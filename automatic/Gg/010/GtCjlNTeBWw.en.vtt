all<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.720> way<00:02:20.810> around<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.260> taped<00:02:21.710> on

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
all the way around it's just taped on

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.170 
all the way around it's just taped on
each<00:02:22.400> end<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.840> way<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.170> can<00:02:24.880> do<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.000> like

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
each end so this way I can do it like

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.510 
each end so this way I can do it like
this

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
this

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.890 
this
and<00:02:28.520> then<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.240> drop<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:32.440> can<00:02:33.440> tuck<00:02:33.710> this<00:02:33.920> down

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
and then I can drop I can tuck this down

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.810 
and then I can drop I can tuck this down
down<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.140> there<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:38.390> that's<00:02:38.540> between<00:02:38.990> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
down in there so that's between the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:48.760 
down in there so that's between the
reflector<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:45.340> lid<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:47.060> rim<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
reflector and the lid the rim of the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.700 
reflector and the lid the rim of the
cooker<00:02:49.130> now<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:51.530> can<00:02:51.740> then<00:02:51.980> go<00:02:52.280> behind<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:53.120> and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
cooker now you can then go behind it and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.560 
cooker now you can then go behind it and
pull<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:54.890> down<00:02:56.680> which<00:02:57.680> I'm<00:02:58.670> trying<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.120> stay<00:02:59.360> in

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
pull it down which I'm trying to stay in

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.970 
pull it down which I'm trying to stay in
view<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.960> camera<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:00.380> see<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.620> can<00:03:00.770> pull

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
view of the camera but see you can pull

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.750 
view of the camera but see you can pull
this<00:03:01.130> down<00:03:01.400> top<00:03:02.800> between<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.890> reflecting<00:03:04.580> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
this down top between the reflecting the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.420 
this down top between the reflecting the
lid<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:06.740> rim<00:03:09.520> and<00:03:10.520> then<00:03:11.740> see<00:03:12.740> it'll<00:03:12.950> pull<00:03:13.190> back

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
lid the rim and then see it'll pull back

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:24.680 
lid the rim and then see it'll pull back
up<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:16.550> then<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:17.450> snap<00:03:17.780> these<00:03:18.080> around

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.960 

and<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.560> might<00:03:25.710> have<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:25.920> fold<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.790> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
and you might have to fold it just a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.660 
and you might have to fold it just a
little<00:03:27.120> bit<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:28.200> make<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.560> work<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:28.890> way

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.640 

but<00:03:32.670> that's<00:03:32.880> how<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.150> do<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.600> now<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.260> have<00:03:34.620> a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
but that's how I do it now if you have a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.980 
but that's how I do it now if you have a
grill<00:03:35.180> it's<00:03:36.180> going<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.510> be<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.600> little<00:03:36.840> more

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
grill it's going to be a little more

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.360 
grill it's going to be a little more
complicated<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.040> know<00:03:38.360> because<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:40.370> you're

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
complicated I know because you you're

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.710 
complicated I know because you you're
you're<00:03:41.880> going<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.210> have<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.510> put<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> wedge<00:03:43.320> of

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
you're going to have to put a wedge of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.380 
you're going to have to put a wedge of
cardboard

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.390 

back<00:03:51.390> here<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.140> spot<00:03:52.200> because<00:03:53.099> when<00:03:53.280> it's

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
back here in this spot because when it's

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.920 
back here in this spot because when it's
going<00:03:53.580> around<00:03:54.000> you're<00:03:54.360> going<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.629> have<00:03:54.780> this

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
going around you're going to have this

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
going around you're going to have this
this<00:03:55.409> gap<00:03:55.739> here<00:03:56.569> but<00:03:57.569> see<00:03:58.230> this<00:03:58.440> spot<00:03:58.709> right

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
this gap here but see this spot right

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.490 
this gap here but see this spot right
here<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.700> can<00:03:59.879> put<00:04:00.060> your<00:04:00.239> hand<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.319> when

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
here you can put your hand in so when

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.229 
here you can put your hand in so when

you have a grill and you're going to put

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.229 
you have a grill and you're going to put
this<00:04:03.420> around<00:04:03.799> you<00:04:04.799> can<00:04:04.980> get<00:04:05.610> some<00:04:05.790> cardboard

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
this around you can get some cardboard

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.320 
this around you can get some cardboard
and<00:04:06.720> make<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> wedge<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:08.069> put<00:04:08.580> up<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:09.090> there

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
and make like a wedge to put up in there

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.420 
and make like a wedge to put up in there
to<00:04:09.450> hold<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.930> stable<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.040> know<00:04:11.129> you<00:04:11.220> can

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
to hold this stable and you know you can

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.300 
to hold this stable and you know you can
tape<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:12.000> up<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.269> little<00:04:12.390> bit<00:04:13.099> which<00:04:14.099> you<00:04:14.250> know

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
tape it up a little bit which you know

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.039 
tape it up a little bit which you know
with<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.519> grill<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:15.030> bowl<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.750> going<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.959> be<00:04:16.019> a

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
with the grill the bowl is going to be a

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.629 
with the grill the bowl is going to be a
lot<00:04:16.260> longer<00:04:16.530> than<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.840> now<00:04:19.430> with<00:04:20.430> this

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
lot longer than this now with this

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.950 
lot longer than this now with this
particular<00:04:20.850> cooker<00:04:22.910> there<00:04:23.910> are<00:04:24.120> days<00:04:24.979> when

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
particular cooker there are days when

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.710 
particular cooker there are days when
the<00:04:27.960> sun's<00:04:28.260> angle<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.860> going<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.160> be<00:04:29.250> different

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
the sun's angle is going to be different

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.980 
the sun's angle is going to be different
and<00:04:30.949> you<00:04:31.949> can<00:04:32.160> actually<00:04:32.430> adjust<00:04:32.789> this<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:36.840> be

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
and you can actually adjust this to be

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.060 
and you can actually adjust this to be
tilted<00:04:37.580> by<00:04:38.580> simply<00:04:39.180> raising<00:04:39.449> this<00:04:39.960> up<00:04:40.289> like

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
tilted by simply raising this up like

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.590 
tilted by simply raising this up like
that<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:42.320> then<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:44.760> can<00:04:44.880> put<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.539> know

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
that and then you can put you know

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.360 
that and then you can put you know
something<00:04:46.229> like<00:04:46.350> this<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.830> block<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.340> wood

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
something like this a block of wood

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.510 
something like this a block of wood
whatever<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.240> set<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.199> underneath<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.220> pan

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
whatever and set it underneath the pan

00:04:50.520 --> 00:05:01.790 
whatever and set it underneath the pan
itself<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:59.550> could<00:04:59.669> do<00:04:59.880> it<00:05:00.030> like<00:05:00.060> that<00:05:00.570> or<00:05:00.840> you

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
itself you could do it like that or you

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.290 
itself you could do it like that or you
can<00:05:01.950> just<00:05:02.010> simply<00:05:04.460> you<00:05:05.460> know<00:05:05.550> this<00:05:05.729> is<00:05:05.880> tilted

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
can just simply you know this is tilted

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.529 
can just simply you know this is tilted
right<00:05:06.450> now<00:05:06.599> or<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.830> can<00:05:08.039> scoot<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.700> back<00:05:08.970> on

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
right now or you can scoot this back on

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.580 
right now or you can scoot this back on
there<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.610> actually<00:05:11.610> just<00:05:11.849> tilt<00:05:12.590> this

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
there and actually just tilt this

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.620 
there and actually just tilt this
forward<00:05:14.099> and<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.910> know<00:05:15.000> up<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.450> back<00:05:17.630> until

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
forward and you know up and back until

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.900 
forward and you know up and back until
you<00:05:18.750> get<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.020> right<00:05:19.139> angle<00:05:19.410> get<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.490> focal

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
you get the right angle get the focal

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.290
