00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
long your new chain should be is to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
long your new chain should be is to
simply<00:01:04.680> compare<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> against<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.820> old<00:01:06.090> chain

simply compare it against your old chain

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
simply compare it against your old chain
now<00:01:07.080> that's<00:01:07.320> assuming<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.220> old<00:01:08.490> chain

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
now that's assuming that your old chain

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.300 
now that's assuming that your old chain
was<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> correct<00:01:09.479> length<00:01:09.840> simply<00:01:10.830> take<00:01:11.280> your

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
was the correct length simply take your

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179 
was the correct length simply take your
two<00:01:12.060> chains<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:12.840> new<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.590> old<00:01:13.860> one

two chains your new one and your old one

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
two chains your new one and your old one
and<00:01:14.369> compare<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> lengths<00:01:15.570> against<00:01:16.200> each

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and compare the lengths against each

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.160 
and compare the lengths against each
other<00:01:16.619> remember<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:17.970> old<00:01:18.270> chain<00:01:18.869> has

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
other remember that your old chain has

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.070 
other remember that your old chain has
stretched<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:21.090> bit<00:01:21.390> shorter<00:01:21.420> on

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
stretched so go a little bit shorter on

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.480 
stretched so go a little bit shorter on
your<00:01:22.680> new<00:01:22.979> chain<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:25.020> order<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.560> determine<00:01:26.100> the
