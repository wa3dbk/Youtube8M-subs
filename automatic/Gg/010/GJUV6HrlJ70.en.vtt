 continue with this tutorial called 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.210
 back your drivers you have to create the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.950
 bank of your drivers to format a 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.560
 step that you must do very important

 before formatting your pc back all 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.150
 the drivers that are the drivers is something 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.290
 very important in your pc which gives you 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.390
 video audio image is to say all these 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.360
 components that your mother card has 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.750
 all the hardware is ram memory 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.690
 the microphone the keyboard speakers 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.510
 all of these need drivers in 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.550
 your pc and you have to download 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.920
 including screen drivers 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.710
 so that the image does not look too big 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.790
 26 are those are drivers and they are necessary 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.739
 so that your pc works 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.600
 correctly then let's create a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.790
 backup ie we're going to 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.430
 endorse everything we already have in 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.530
 drivers we are going to back it up in a single 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.229
 file or in several files in one file 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.580
 folder so that we form we have 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.200
 the pc 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.630
 what are we going to do a few more tutorials 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 forward let's format the pc and 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.080
 when we reinstall windows 7 no 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.240
 give us no problem and just 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.100
 let's reinstall this program and a 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.140
 Once it is installed, it will 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.900
 we say that our restored 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.880
 drivers and we will not have to download 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.760
 or waste time looking for the ones in 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.250
 Internet 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.480
 other issues then we are going to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.230
 use the programs of madrid 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.490
 Virgins is the professional that I leave you 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.350
 a video in the description of it 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.330
 so you can download this file 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.210
 which is where the installer has the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.710
 crack and good you have it full once 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.630
 have the program installed is very 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.430
 simple we're just going to open it 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.220
 and we are going to create our copy of 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.650
 security 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.200
 let's do an analysis this is for 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.270
 another tutorial on how to download them but 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.720
 we are going to go here to copy 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.030
 security let's give a click render 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.340
 backup and starts to analyze 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.370
 all our devices our 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.690
 drivers already installed on the pc for 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.970
 create a good backup 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.030
 while we are waiting here 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.230
 that this happened to us but we will create 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.740
 a new folder folder and we're going to 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.680
 put a name you want to copy me copy 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.270
 of security and good this is the folder 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.530
 where are we going to keep all of our 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.690
 drivers is very important this copy 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.550
 Well once they are saved 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.000
 the driver can save to your google 0 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.430
 and format pc and then return it to 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.280
 put your documents to your desk 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.290
 she is the restoration we hope that 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.079
 keep loading I'm going to press a little the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.739
 video and continued ok once you have 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.689
 finished 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.739
 she is going to send us here what they are 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.629
 all our drivers you can go 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.510
 selecting the ones you're going to want all of 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.969
 are in packages and have them separated 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.170
 For example, we open and remove those that 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:26.780
 they are restoring are categories and good 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.150
 of the council that the backup is all 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.549
 because this is how the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.049
 pc right now is like more to want to follow 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.930
 working once the form is 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.450
 then we select all and how they 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.639
 says it weighs one hundred and eight megabytes 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.280
 our support then we are going to give it 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.189
 click here we go to the next one in this 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.530
 part is choose the location we are going to 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.510
 click here and well let's 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.239
 select what is our folder in 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.540
 this case we keep in the 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.450
 desk and call me back up 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.800
 here is we are going to accept once that 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.650
 showed this 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.530
 here we are sent this which is by default 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.740
 in folder are zip files or a 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.560
 automatic installation that we 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.450
 let's give in default one time and 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.680
 we select here again our 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.710
 folder we accept and simply accept 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.350
 we give in next and start doing 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.440
 our backup our backup of the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.810
 drivers this process sometimes reaches 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.270
 it takes depending how many drivers 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.240
 have installed in villages right now 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.310
 is making the copy quickly but 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.220
 well let's try this video and 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.200
 continues once I have finished 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.000
 restore them once you have 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.550
 finished says the backup 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.750
 the controllers has been done with 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.090
 success 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.790
 Here he sends us a brief information and 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.590
 we are going to give it in finalize so that 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.940
 finish the task 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.100
 you can see then here is our 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.480
 folder if we open it here gives us a 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.340
 backup driver 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.740
 we open it and here they are all 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.979
 our drivers ok 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:14.050
 all these drivers and everything that we 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.050
 it's needed because 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.920
 and well, this would be our drivers 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.960
 the whole folder as well as we see the 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.940
 right or just here we 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.410

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.620
 it weighs 161 measures ok and good we go for 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.790
 restore them this is a brief example 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.650
 later added a video of how 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:40.120
 restore those since we have formatted 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.860
 and we can and right now we are 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.440
 send this because we just did the 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.120
 copy then have this program but 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.590
 we are going to need it, we are going to 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.020
 install is going to lose these 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.210
 data this is from the one you just made 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.800
 of the copy you just made 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.930
 we are going to do it 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.480
 look for a backup copy of 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.150
 system drivers we are going to 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.520
 who to examine we are going to give 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.140
 here in safety cope let's give 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.990

 the controls to restore we're going to 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.150
 say that we select all 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.960
 we simply give it in next and the 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.889
 start to restore good friends this 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.439

 save it, I advise you to do 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.960
 this 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.979
 that you put security drivers 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:37.340
 although you think 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:42.020
 the rar file and we give it here tells us 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.150
 remove assets after compression here 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:48.139
 we have the best and we are simply going to 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.300
 accept ok and wait for it to compress 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.000
 all of our files here in what 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.430
 it is a rar file and thus it is no longer going to 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.410
 erase anything or get more secure and 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.900
 when we already have them, we simply 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.360
 we give right click to extract here 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.280
