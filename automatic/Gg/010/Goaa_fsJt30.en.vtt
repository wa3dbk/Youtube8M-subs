00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.860
 a title the scrum 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.860
 or not 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.549
 a little bit dynamic elected 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.279
 the ingredients are in order 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.650
 so we start with a little bit of mustard a little bit 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.019
 stash a spoon of mustard 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 on mustard bones 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.769
 we will put our newspapers at the end we start to find my legs has 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.829
 mixed mustard salt and stitch together a little bit 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.920
 e if you put salt on the back of the storm it is sometimes small 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.059
 white dots that are to watch will be the one who can understand it does not 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.300
 are not very pleasant 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.010
 so be the only one dissolved by the moisture of the mustard we will add 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.710
 the egg yolk 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.240
 vinegar 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.200
 we are a little bit of vinegar from the start in fact report of the un 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.480
 very very light liquid by the vinegar 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.210
 and a little bit of acidity 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.140
 it favors evolution 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.800
 we formulate and that together therefore himself 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.600
 % the technique 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.120
 a trickle of oil 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.120
 and we want all the time 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.170
 then to make a liter of mayonnaise for a record of five days of break 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.090
 so there I did not feel 18 because of a way that produced the project 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 account 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.000
 so we're going to squeeze the mayonnaise now 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.960
 here 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.880
 sometimes well defined 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.850
 so the hand sliced 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.560
 kim a large amount of oil which we can not catch up with 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.210
 odd jobs 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.290
 to catch cold is very very simple 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.890
 in fact it's a balance between the ski in Greece that endorses so they do not 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.490
 not progress enough water 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 to catch room a little bit of cold water 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.000
 p there I see poured we will resume with a spoon a little bit of his 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 mixed 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.540
 you will see as you go 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.280
 the water intake in my mix makes for the show becomes a record again 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.180
 with the comedian on the nerves 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.970
 so the fact that the beautiful and if you ever missed it she always catches up 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.970
 very easily 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.369
 so 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.100
 a title
