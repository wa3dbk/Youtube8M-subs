00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.960
 no 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.060
 the sun goes down changes appearance to the city 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.640
 I have been waiting all day and he has me 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.720
 hurry to get out of here as soon as possible 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.360
 breathe now everything is ready the awakening 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.329
 of the senses like the gargoyle at sunset 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.399
 but text I can't stop the norm now 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.230
 I can't hear you leave behind 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.989
 my mistakes don't make passers by in 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.489
 world that 0 of some chester party 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.879
 out jack sparrow 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.239
 sometimes it drags me down as if 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.949
 he was drowning, looking for a window 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.190
 light to make my way 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.550
 I'm still looking for fatigue 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.880
 pay but only pieces and bones remain 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.910
 broken 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:07.530
 laughter jokes in this sweet night 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.290
 sweet night keeps me coming back late 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.900
 night warriors 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.680
 the night will seem strange but sometimes 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.920
 the exhibition of people crossing each other 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.610
 I am very 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.950
 they say that the night brings advice and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.670
 there are those who seek it with the brokers affixed in 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.290
 ten from the mouth of an unobtainable team 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.400
 it's hard to hang 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.550
 the hands 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.490
 a foothold and I just have this left 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.430
 go home when it's dark outside 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.240
 how many things I hate and it really is 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 when well only in my head 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.299
 castiglione 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.299
 notes as my martini said 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.479
 at 30 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.909
 remember when night falls change 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.730
 humor me always the calm that makes it 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.950
 strong 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.260
 to me 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.500
 but I don't want to wake up until 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.560
 early morning tonia juice around there 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.260
 people 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.430

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.400
 and movements made to dream 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.129

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.600
 of all these days it is now 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:51.910
 a habit to leave home and see 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.590
 I unplug it like a rose 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.260
 fresh morning as a rose when it does 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.320
 dark the light years with a spirit of 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.720
 few thoughts while at night heard 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.460
