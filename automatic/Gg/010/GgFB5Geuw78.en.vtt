00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.010
 aimed at the cooking course of austere 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.200
 austere I just said that it's not that 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.350
 I was confused what is cheap cooking 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.820

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.930
 he confused cooking for singles with 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.490
 kitchen for you 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.800

 agro same day homophony putting with 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.710

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.810
 I 'm married a bachelor class 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.090
 it's for me but how do you pay for 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.980
 I asked the manager in advance 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.810
 and he told me that as long as it does not bother 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.520
 the others registered I can stay and 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.380
 I take advantage of it has been very kind 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.050
 it's clear that it's going to bother her but 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.550
 you do not notice without bothering this and 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.470
 since a long time since what 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.420

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.980

 by the way this in a class for 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.760
 singles I guess a person is so 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.370
 meticulous not over confused like me 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.830

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.200
 put the leg 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.190
 here he has fallen into his trap shin chan 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.630
 the help not good no no no is that it is not 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.390
 that she would point me to find a husband and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.540

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.090

 your table the sirloin has two parts 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.000
 the fat and the meat between them is the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.770
 cartilage that you need to talk about before 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.010
