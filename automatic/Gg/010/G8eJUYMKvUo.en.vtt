now let's go to when you've done that go

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:56.519 
now let's go to when you've done that go
to<00:04:53.139> build<00:04:53.499> and<00:04:53.769> light<00:04:54.729> thing<00:04:55.109> take<00:04:56.109> off<00:04:56.259> use

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:56.529 
to build and light thing take off use

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.519 
to build and light thing take off use
light<00:04:56.919> mass<00:04:57.359> you<00:04:58.359> don't<00:04:58.779> have<00:04:58.929> to<00:04:59.049> do<00:04:59.139> this<00:04:59.289> but

00:04:59.519 --> 00:04:59.529 
light mass you don't have to do this but

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.709 
light mass you don't have to do this but
it<00:04:59.679> it<00:04:59.859> will<00:05:00.189> load<00:05:00.429> a<00:05:00.669> lot<00:05:00.939> faster<00:05:01.449> if<00:05:01.479> you<00:05:01.599> do

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
it it will load a lot faster if you do

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:07.529 
it it will load a lot faster if you do
so<00:05:01.989> okay<00:05:03.089> building<00:05:04.619> so<00:05:05.879> then<00:05:06.879> go<00:05:07.059> to<00:05:07.119> build

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
so okay building so then go to build

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.739 
so okay building so then go to build
