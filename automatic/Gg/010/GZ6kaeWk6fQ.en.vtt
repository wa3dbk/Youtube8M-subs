00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 ah 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello in this video in collaboration with 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.219
 stamp blair I will give you tricks and ideas 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 for sewing leatherette 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.960
 the poly skin is a material that is not 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.020
 natural has nothing to do with the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.130
 skin and it's just a good ni 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.860
 I'm even going to say it's a fabric 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.270
 because it's not woven but it's a 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.530
 plastic sheet that imitates 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.230
 the skin in this case 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.149
 It has a slightly thick granulate in 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.570
 Stamped bleu there are two types of I chose the 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.690
 thick because I like it much more and for 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.079
 the backside has a kind 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.820
 of mesh that makes it more resistant this 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.620
 it does not mean it 's difficult to cut 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.660
 because as you see with him 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.260
 with the cutter and the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:08.060
 and the rule is cut super easily 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.090
 just like with scissors it 's like it's a 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.010
 thin plastic because when cut 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.410
 the feeling is a bit like cutting 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.570
 eva rubber but it's even a little bit more 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.640
 fine 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.650
 the print you can ask him to 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.600
 stamp on the poly skin the design that 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.040
 you want in this case I asked 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.640
 white but I've also asked in the same 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.070
 fabric meter my wolf repeated and what 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.200
 I have good I have it trimmed each one 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.410
 of them because I want to teach you too 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.440
 that poly skin can be used 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.090
 also to make applications in 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.290
 Depending on the size of the file that you 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.720
 You can make the design so big 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.910
 as possible what I love you 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.160
 To teach also is that the pattern is 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.050
 of a super good quality because 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.090
 even notice that if you stretched it a little 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.320
 everything that the policy allows me to 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.050
 neither is it a thing that is 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.850
 Extends a lot but you see that the drawing 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.850
 it deforms but it does not break 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.110
 and that when the police return to their 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.960
 place the design remains intact 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.320
 to sew it I will use a needle 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.110
 normal size 90 and the thread is also 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.510
 normal polyester in this case of 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.430
 white color I've picked two pieces of 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.640
 leatherette 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.990
 and I have placed them right with right 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.990
 to start sewing 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.400
 you see that the union is perfect as you see 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.200
 with each stitch the needle leaves a 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 little hole and the poly skin this means 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.819
 that we can not put pins we have 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.349
 to be very safe when sewing 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.170
 I'll also explain how to make 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.560
 the seam is decorative once the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.500
 we have passed the first seam we are going 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.680
 to leave folded the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.720
 the leftover towards one of the sides and 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.830
 let's move again 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.630
 by the machine 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.630
 above this seam 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.260
 As you can see I sewed with the center a bit 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.690
 moved so that I have a seam 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.560
 decorative and I also want to make a 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.560
 second pass 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.890
 I'll put it a little more next 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.110
 to get two seams 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.730
 to apply we simply have to 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.050
 cut the piece that we want to put 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.230
 on top of another piece of imitation leather 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.750
 we will cut flush and I to make sure 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.490
 how can we not use pins because if 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.250
 would not stay the holes I put 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.860
 a little adhesive for fabric that already 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.560
 you see that not that it is not super strong nor 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.680
 much less but it simply assures me 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.750
 that is not going to move me and in this case 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.850
 to sew round we have to walk 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.210
 spinning the fabric all the time I put 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.550
 a tip of a little bit wide and a 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.710
 little bit so I can stay pretty 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.850
 bushy without becoming an embroidery that 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.850
 I stayed pretty dense 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.500
 at the end I give a finishing stitch 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.480
 ready and you see the result in the absence of 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.490
 that we cut these threads is super good 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.260
 as you see in this case what we have 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.450
 had to do is place the reverse 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.390
 of the part that we wanted to apply in 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.210
 this side of the girl look logo 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.060
 we had to put the reverse of this 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.550
 against the right of the poly skin to 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.470
 that is seen at all times well I have 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.180
 done in a small piece but if it 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.160
 make a bigger piece we could 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.590
 seize to do anything 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.350
 but I also want to give you another idea and it's 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.930
 that instead of placing the reverse against the 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.230
 right if you put the reverse of here 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.650
 against the reverse of here you can do with 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:31.580
 a much busier zig zag a coasters 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.190
 that on both sides will have the face 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.140
 good of the poly skin if you thought 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.640
