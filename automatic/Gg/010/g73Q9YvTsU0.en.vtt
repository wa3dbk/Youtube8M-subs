six Arctic for 20 or 10 stacks of rhino
meat<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.170> 11<00:02:33.170> stacks<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.830> boron<00:02:34.700> leather

meat and 11 stacks of boron leather

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.720 
meat and 11 stacks of boron leather
scraps<00:02:35.480> which<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.530> sell<00:02:36.890> or<00:02:37.190> give<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.700> a

leather worker to turn them into the
boron<00:02:40.580> leather<00:02:40.790> itself<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:41.870> think<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.350> got

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
boron leather itself and I think we got

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.850 
boron leather itself and I think we got
two<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.040> half<00:02:43.190> stacks<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.820> boron<00:02:44.180> mother

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
two and a half stacks of boron mother

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.340 
two and a half stacks of boron mother
so<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.160> around<00:02:46.430> 500<00:02:47.090> gold<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.570> an<00:02:47.840> hour<00:02:47.990> and

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
so is around 500 gold and an hour and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.630 
so is around 500 gold and an hour and
that<00:02:49.010> Arctic<00:02:49.370> fur<00:02:50.170> really<00:02:51.170> depends<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:51.950> it's
