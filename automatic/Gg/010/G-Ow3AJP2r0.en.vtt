00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.559
 and then the weeks passed the months 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.719
 and the years and each makes it so 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.450
 his very own experiences with the 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.939
 school I may ask so im 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.560
 Review of who is in the right place 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.649
 happy to go to school 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 So he almost cried at noon 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.730
 when he had to go home 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.570
 it was someone wonderful 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.660
 great is not bad they are allowed 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.280
 stay 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.110
 who has who is not like in the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.300
 gone school or translated said 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.699
 who liked the school because of the friends 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.739
 the breaks and of self wahnsinn the 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.980
 did you go that he says so times 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.860
 lala 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.500
 some yes and they are now 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.430
 they did not report at all 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:08.470
 In school she would be me then 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.360
 now the rules of the evening 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.010
 clarify 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.970
 they are here on a distance 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.740
 on no coffee break and me 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.140
 just register who are here 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.630
 It's all about cooperation 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.260
 notation and that was not quite so 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.260
 Well 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.690
 a few more rules should be settled today 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.600
 Run here in the afternoon and in the evening 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.090
 inappropriate place a mobile phone ringing 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.320
 half note worse and we see 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.720
 By the way, exactly who here 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.880
 example a sms writes or his e 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.670
 mails checks half note worse 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.690
 and if you say it now, that's the note 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.610
 but it does not matter to me 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.170
 then they should know one thing 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.630
 this note during the afternoon 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.290
 worse than 4 - we break 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.480
 the idea and thus a circle 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.480
 if a shit builds all are tuned 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.939
 Of course you have the possibility 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.980
 your touch to improve three chances 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:28.720
 first cooperation second cooperation third 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:32.250
 Employees should take care of themselves 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.990
 see enthusiasm looks different 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.390
 but we already have the real one here 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.940
 image of a class the first hook 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.490
 already very cautious on the front 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.480
 chair edge and I see the think bubbles 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.180
 over their heads 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.970
 well that can be cheerful, I hope 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.880
 Does not take me off 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:56.080
 the others have already 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:01.390
 a mistake does not lean back with me 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:04.270
 I am here voluntarily and then see 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.740
 I already isolated which the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.600
 turn their heads direction output 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.220
 I 'm not doing this for the first time 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.920
 topic so the time where I then 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.670
 sign bent backwards like now 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.890
 please lock the doors from the inside 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.500
 may also scribble this blog until 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.060
 on one side you still need them 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.950
 but I warn her she should 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.500
 Anyone of you on the idea 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.540
 come from one of the leaves one 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.140
 paper planes to craft and fly 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.540
 allow 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.160
 half a note worse and if we 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.550
 catch the crouches us up 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.550
 the stage 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.350
 But now the first start place 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.030
 turn them now just the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.730
 prosecco mode a relax 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.090
 I also have two tricks from students 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.130
 First of all, they always help 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.350
 even if they do not know anything, they report 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.520
 anyway and with 1500 students is 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.290
 yes, the chance that they get 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.100
 vanishingly small and if then then 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.850
 songs is easy now I have known 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.660
 that does not matter 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.030
 and then there is another 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.750
 The trick is very effective 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:27.220
 always good a fake 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.370
 attentive look and always nodding 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.410
 no matter what mental 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.330
 parallel universe they are on the way 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.940
 are 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.460
 This is how we have this Bregenz Clock room 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.750
 already transformed into a classroom 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.490
 and with that I want ours too 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.890
 educational think a bit today 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.460
 upside down and confused 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.650
 swirl 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.360
 and i am an enfant terrible me 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.550
 I would also like to have some doubt 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.200
 are they here 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.450
 so oversubscribed at lisa and her mum 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.690
 have seen that is still the 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.570
 Reality in many families learning frustration 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.190
 instead of the desire to learn and there is for me the 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.740
 ask where is she actually? 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.020
 where is she still this desire to learn 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.020
 the first day of school was still there
