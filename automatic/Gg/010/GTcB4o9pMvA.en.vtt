00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
nordstrom rack i think most of you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
nordstrom rack i think most of you
probably<00:01:27.090> know<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.290> those

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
probably know what that is but for those

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.640 
probably know what that is but for those
of<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.430> basically<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
of you don't it's basically like the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
of you don't it's basically like the
place<00:01:31.650> where<00:01:32.040> nordstrom<00:01:32.700> sends<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> their

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
place where nordstrom sends all of their

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240 
place where nordstrom sends all of their
like<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.290> season<00:01:34.530> clothes<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.159> whatever

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
like out of season clothes or whatever

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
like out of season clothes or whatever
so<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.640> basically<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.720> clearance

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
so it's basically like the clearance

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.929 
so it's basically like the clearance
store<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.400> nordstrom<00:01:38.729> um<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.610> things

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
