00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 you will live one more day to my channel today what 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:10.050
 I bring you is a video of chest hair 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.580
 a little change of look I'm with the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.990
 head cut because I do not want that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.269
 see the result until the end of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 video because I have the process clips 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.500
 I did it yesterday and well more or less like 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 they are the tips and up to here I try 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.330
 get as close to camera as possible 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.529
 so that you do not see the result what 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.289
 today I bring you is how to do is a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.970
 degraded in fantasy tones in the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 tips like Californian but a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.290
 gradient in fantasy tones in concrete 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.000
 from a purple to a blue green sky not 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 I know how to describe the blue tone but it's 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.129
 precious to me I loved not first of all 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.289
 tell you that if you want to get that 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.690
 our hair grabs or picks up a color 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.789
 fantasy is essential that you have 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.160
 colorado hair and against more white 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 or the clearer the tone the better it is to say 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.640
 only a natural or virgin hair does not 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.260
 is going to catch practically nothing or is going to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.760
 be wasting time is spending money 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.039
 in dyes that will serve us 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.839
 unless you are blond obviously a 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.119
 Natural blond well, but like here 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.700
 in spain I think that in many cases 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.100
 I would recommend that you red 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.869
 of color you do the hair if you want 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.060
 achieve a fantasy tone but I have 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.580
 the bleached hair is worth the root not the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.070
 root is stained what would happen to me 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.440
 ball dye it but it's so clear and so 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.119
 white because he gave it to me red I 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.780
 I have already explained everything in 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.570
 videos 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.729
 successive but of course you have 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.500
 have a similar base not so white 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.960
 depends on the tone you want if you want 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.789
 a strong pink a purple a base tone 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.069
 the teeth that I have used are from 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.590
 crisis and color 2000 is a brand that 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.539
 like it in excess because with the first 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.240
 washing goes a lot and everything with the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.740
 23 go practically in their entirety 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.149
 but good are the ones that I had here yes 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.640
 that it is true that the tones are 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.350
 precious has all the shades very 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.299
 beautiful and that when you throw it is 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.740
 very accomplished but with water is easy 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.229
 of not going to damage the sun but you can 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.149
 throw us the times you want is what 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.259
 good and that I do not like you with water 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.030
 is going to go so that's why I do not 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.979
 you worry 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 if you are interested in seeing how the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.250
 hair as I have done 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.350
 stay here that I put you and the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.350
 scripts of the process and see you later 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.180
 with the final result now the first thing 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.709
 what are we going to need are the dyes I 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.990
 I'm using these two crazy 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.210
 color in the tone the blue jays flag 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.790
 you will also need like a bowl or 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.130
 something to throw 15 and gloves 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 so that they work in our hands and in 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.000
 that dye the dyes that was mentioned 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.610
 before and you can also use 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.130
 Well, the typical brochita that is for 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.400
 cast the dyes let's start with a 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.040
 tone the flag which is like a purple 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.319
 because it's the one that I'm going to apply 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.150
 up I'm going to do as a gradient 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.219
 of purple blue therefore we are going to 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.739
 start with this tone that although a to 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.510
 the band is not a tone the band is left 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.790
 rather as you are seeing there a 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.709
 purple has been dark but tell you that 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.450
 are dyes that carry ammonia that 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.459
 They go with water and therefore are easy 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.799
 to remove we will also need a 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.010
 clip to go distribute the hairs 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.989
 sections and that we do not look bad and a 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.450
 comb I am using target and set 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.280
 it is necessary that you nipples well 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.859
 the hair so it does not have knots and it does not 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.870
 leave whenever you go to dye and 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.370
 the gloves please put it on because 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.669
 if not true that it costs a lot 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.669
 remove it from your hands and nothing little by little 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:31.790
 Well, as you can see, I started with the brush 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.439
 with the brush but I'm very much to do everything 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.269
 with my hands so then I find myself 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.970
 much better with my hands and I continued with 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.680
 what we are going to start with is to take a 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.079
 purple tone 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.640
 from media to media is that I do not know well 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.500
 how to explain this is how it starts and in 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.329
 the image as we want to make a 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.760
 degraded then we will have happened with 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.129
 hands and so that the typical 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.500
 What remains is what we can do 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.090
 throwing his hands up to go 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.920
 like loading a little hair and not 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.079
 That cut is so ugly and looks more like 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.459
 all the gradient that after all 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.400
 is what we are looking for that has a 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.099
 pretty degraded then let's go 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.989
 to put purple on the areas that I had 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.510
 I already talked before because I had these 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.689
 tones but as a type with 23 washes it 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.549
 loses a lot of intensity and once 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.090
 that we have already applied the purple tone 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.759
 we went to the blue blue green tone is a 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.479
 tone a little weird and we apply it in 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.479
 the points 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.250
 who must above all understand 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.590
 throw it a lot but I had a 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.720
 error and that is to leave a little hole between 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.520
 the purple and this tone and I advise you with 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.340
 you mix them a little better so that 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.810
 note rather this gradient and this is 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.270
 union between the two colors this 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.040
 component of each other because I already 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.990
 you will see the final result that can be 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.669
 that for the next one I have to use more 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 tone there because they have not blended 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.620
 very well but above all exist in the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.430
 tips so that it stays from less to more and 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.430
 the joints are as blue as possible and 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.639
 nothing now has to wait around 20 30 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.009
 minutes when the 15th penetrates and then the 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.889
 low on Thursday after that routine 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.669
 okay girls, the final result is 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.860
 this 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.860
 Let's see how you can teach 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.189
 Here the purple begins, as I 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:23.380
 I said in the video I tried to stay that way 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:25.210
 a little side 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.620
 here although there are areas that yes it is 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.330
 true that it has not been so so 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.610
 degraded but to say is that with the step 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.770
 of the days it goes away the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.890
 intensity and it is going well and little to 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.100
 little is appearing here in blue or 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.070
 the tone this weird is pierre no se is not 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.840
 blue but it's cool what he said 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.210
 in the video is that I've had a little 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.100
 of error because if you see here there you see 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.690
 a little background noise and maybe 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.910
 I should have a little bit of empathy 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.700
 better the colors have gone up a bit 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.100
 plus the blue and empathize the best with 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.930
 the purple but good I do not dislike 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.450
 nor how is this agreed here 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.400
 you see the two sides more or less there 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.780
 you are seeing what the result has been 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.270
 final is worth but nothing I put two braids 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.730
 yesterday why and I slept with and so I was 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.410
 stayed that way I like it much more how 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.150
 it remains if some lasted because if it is 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.760
 true smooth tessitura let's do what 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.830
 the court will notice more but good 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.360
 result I'm happy enough 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.280
 happy with them except the glue of 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.540
 blending these two colors there that you 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.820
 I said 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.610
 and in love any doubt you can 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.590
 leave it down here in comments os 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.080
 I will leave in the information box the 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.450
 dyes although I think they have been well 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.130
 in the video and nothing this is all I hope 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:43.470
 that you liked it and see you in the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.470
 next video a very strong kiss and
