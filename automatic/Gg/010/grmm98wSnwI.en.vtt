00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.250
 long 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.010
 why but the wur beyond this is an earth week week follower 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.610
 role 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.519
 peeters so I can't join the wall 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.509
 why not 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.429
 ma 9 the court proved that interest lies the Polish pilots there is one 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.960
 increased 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.560
 and we don't need that anyway 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.460
 just now 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 be that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.470
 everything is possible 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 get used to the program 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.379
 we are 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.600
 water on and on 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.070
 the project 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.510
 and the walker we are talking about 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.100
 let's do that 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.570
 so then expected 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.899
 for the rotterdammers 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.030
 yes, you just say that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.100
 just the civilians were injured 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.030
 the driver that drills 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.970
 one also has the oil 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.769
 yes, he came the driver of the last-but-one work week 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.180
 in the car with examples 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.950
 New York was eventually transported 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.960
 a disgrace 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.700
 Well what about the first session in how tight the tractor 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.510
 mark of the fore 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.189
 the arrests made after an hour of play or then expected 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.040
 probably Marines now 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.210
 but they are normally expected 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.719
 the Netherlands makes a difference 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.439
 I mean if I want to fall into a shoplifter and I see sometimes 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.310
 six men after he spoke to the rubber boat 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.710
 but on the impression that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.950
 that there by employees 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.630
 the decrease has been 700 meters for a few months 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.590
 3 locked up 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.990
 the remaining 20 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.200
 it went at a profit he misses something I missed 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.480
 the coeur is bigger 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.320
 but what about 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.900
 then we get to those who were cared for 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.310
 a hearing about that would be waiting and Jacqueline Cramer 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.490
 nice idea anyway 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.830
 don't bother if you are almost seventy days old 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.830
 with only men locked in the dark 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.360
 and you will hear that you will receive a booklet again soon above Saturday but me 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.279
 don't understand the fun 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.399
 only 6 the appropriate 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:20.009
 the shaft is 55 centimeters wide and if you do with a response they want on it 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:21.409
 have to go up 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.409
 in the newspaper 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:27.400
 now is included 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.699
 shortening for that has started 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.819
 the Alkmaar 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.750
 also on 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.830
 easier 9 people go once that time 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.399
 4 and 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:43.609
 2 We are almost the same day after the government you know you yourself 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.509
 During the fighting the relationship between it's a prerequisite is that 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.049
 he is like your haiti but it is 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.719
 Technical Director 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.719
 just like the murder 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.719
 of course you can 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:02:59.659
 love 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.420
 I just love false accusations leave that man alone 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.760
 that is nice partying in portugal with a big bite yes that year and by chance 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.109
 a large number of other parties vs 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:10.970
 intercepted 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.969
 but to point so far 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.969
 well great 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:21.609
 although renting for a year can cause it to drink 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.399
 a dog that can drink vertically but that is not possible at all 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.799
 Chamber President 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:33.159
 nice than or younger on paper beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful that it would be difficult 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:39.829
 only a small spaces are the camera guys I have a container fire 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.099
