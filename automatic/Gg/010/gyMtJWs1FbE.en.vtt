00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.530
 good then small 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.620
 near how 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.980
 we proceed to make a league 1 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.090
 so I 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.880
 to give a helping party Pounds 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:24.220
 like that to go back up the way to 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 create a small morphine that will retain 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:35.489
 the son alone when I'm going to spend 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:43.059
 on the paw of the donkey at the tac 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:46.150
 here after I go so I start on 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:51.000
 will say 5000 about the paw of 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:54.430
 the ring I pass my son on here 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.750
 I come like that with the brown iron 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:05.500
 on the side of the paw of the ring hop I 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 hangs with my finger and there I go 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.789
 start turning the blank that goes and 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.640
 so it's the son who wants himself 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:19.569
 stuck free lebrun and thus ensure the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.280
 holding the film held there after 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.530
 three princes is already stuck one can 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.099
 let go ligation holds after one 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.899
 meal that using a browned night we re 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:37.060
 pacsÃ©s ligature and that's it we can 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:38.860
 start going there and turned in 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.160
 trying to be the most perfidious cullers 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.380
 possible blank there from time to time 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.830
 stops and meals that a little bit it 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.830
 ligature 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.360
 here with the little lime stroke and the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.950
 morphil that it creates its retainers alone 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.850
 the son that we can really ride with 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.369
 facility on the paw of the ring there a 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:20.800
 once I'm a little bit up I'm going 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:24.640
 come cut hop the son i'm leaving but 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.060
 ligature for it to be peculiar to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.060
 varnishing 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.980
 this is the take off I can remove my 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.980
 Scotch 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.590
 I re pacma ligature the mia early i'm going 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.540
 attack so the end of the ligature so 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.280
 what I do is I take a 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.270
 little bit very relieved a little 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.350
 ten centimeters with which I 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:26.810
 loop and I will come 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:29.230
 stuck the loop under the wire I continue 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.230
 to turn 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.520
 here I am blocking the son here with my 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:48.440
 finger the main thread so the pink wire 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:51.380
 I cut I come to pass the loop I 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:04:02.390
 come and pass the pink thread in the loop 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:04.190
 green hop here and so i draw on the 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.070
 loop what will lead the thread under 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:12.680
 the other spirent is stuck the 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.970
 ligation after to cut I pull a 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.459
 little bit on the wire there to put it 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:23.390
 in tension 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:29.960
 I cut well nara and play meals that a 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:35.450
 little bit all this is the way to this 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.370
 that it is good and that it is before the 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.780
 opening a varnishing a little bit of 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.180
 lighter to see if there is not a 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:46.430
 little bit of two sons because that's it 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.570
 can ensure failures at the opening 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.590
 so this is his request not a nobel prize 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.590
 of chemistry physics con
