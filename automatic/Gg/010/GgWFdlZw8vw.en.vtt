00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.020 
I'm going to do that I'm gonna follow
these<00:03:55.200> directions<00:03:55.230> says<00:03:55.890> there<00:03:56.130> as<00:03:56.790> their

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
these directions says there as their

these directions says there as their
stated<00:03:57.859> and<00:03:58.859> so<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.160> an<00:03:59.250> hour<00:03:59.370> we're<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.239> to

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
stated and so in an hour we're going to

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.560 
stated and so in an hour we're going to
come<00:04:00.450> back<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:01.100> we're<00:04:02.100> going<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.280> put<00:04:02.430> this

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
come back and we're going to put this

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.420 
come back and we're going to put this
together<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:03.959> going<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.140> assemble<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
together so I'm going to assemble the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.289 
together so I'm going to assemble the
other<00:04:05.579> one<00:04:05.850> here<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:07.820> downhill<00:04:08.820> flip<00:04:09.030> drop

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
other one here the downhill flip drop

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.360 
other one here the downhill flip drop
I'm<00:04:09.900> not<00:04:10.019> sure<00:04:10.260> how<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:10.680> would<00:04:10.950> connect<00:04:11.310> to

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
I'm not sure how that would connect to

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.729 
I'm not sure how that would connect to
the<00:04:11.519> other<00:04:11.670> one<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.690> I'm<00:04:13.200> just<00:04:13.380> going<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.560> set

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
the other one so I'm just going to set

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.130 
the other one so I'm just going to set
these<00:04:13.829> up<00:04:13.980> separately<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:15.000> then<00:04:15.269> they<00:04:16.019> can

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
these up separately and then they can

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.289 
these up separately and then they can
always<00:04:16.320> take<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.590> down<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.890> move<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:18.120> get

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
always take it down and move it and get

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.150 
always take it down and move it and get
those<00:04:18.419> connected<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.930> different<00:04:19.229> way<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
those connected a different way the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.650 
those connected a different way the
other<00:04:20.280> set<00:04:20.489> i<00:04:20.519> have<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.030> downhill<00:04:21.419> flip

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
other set i have is the downhill flip

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.050 
other set i have is the downhill flip
drop<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.160> i'm<00:04:23.160> going<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.400> set<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.669> one<00:04:23.820> up<00:04:23.880> as

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
drop and i'm going to set this one up as

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.060 
drop and i'm going to set this one up as
well<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:24.870> we<00:04:25.050> have<00:04:25.169> both<00:04:25.380> templates<00:04:25.860> on<00:04:25.979> the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
well so we have both templates on the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.399 
well so we have both templates on the
wall<00:04:26.250> in<00:04:26.550> both<00:04:26.820> tracks<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.659> this<00:04:28.260> one<00:04:28.380> also

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
wall in both tracks and this one also

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.350 
wall in both tracks and this one also
comes<00:04:28.680> with<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.039> car<00:04:29.250> just<00:04:29.880> looking<00:04:30.150> car

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
comes with the car just looking car

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.980 
comes with the car just looking car
there

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
there

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.020 
there
and<00:04:31.110> that's<00:04:32.010> kind<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.310> how<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:32.610> breaks<00:04:32.820> down

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
and that's kind of how that breaks down

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.570 
and that's kind of how that breaks down
so<00:04:33.420> I'm<00:04:34.020> going<00:04:34.170> to<00:04:34.260> connect<00:04:34.500> these<00:04:34.680> i<00:04:35.130> don't

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
so I'm going to connect these i don't

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.440 
so I'm going to connect these i don't
know<00:04:35.640> if<00:04:35.670> i'll<00:04:35.790> connect<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.120> two<00:04:36.240> sets

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
know if i'll connect the two sets

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.150 
know if i'll connect the two sets
together<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.870> student<00:04:37.110> separately<00:04:37.470> but<00:04:37.980> we

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
together of a student separately but we

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.670 
together of a student separately but we
put<00:04:38.370> them<00:04:38.460> up<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.700> wall<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.120> let<00:04:39.360> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
put them up in the wall and let the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.930 
put them up in the wall and let the
adhesive<00:04:40.680> dry<00:04:40.860> for<00:04:41.040> about<00:04:41.130> an<00:04:41.250> hour<00:04:41.370> before<00:04:41.850> we

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
adhesive dry for about an hour before we

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.610 
adhesive dry for about an hour before we
put<00:04:42.090> any<00:04:42.240> weight<00:04:42.270> on<00:04:42.420> it<00:04:42.540> all<00:04:42.900> right<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.260> we<00:04:43.380> set

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
put any weight on it all right so we set

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.850 
put any weight on it all right so we set
up<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.580> wall<00:04:45.000> tracks<00:04:45.330> on<00:04:45.660> behind<00:04:46.290> us<00:04:46.470> but<00:04:46.710> we

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
up the wall tracks on behind us but we

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.040 
up the wall tracks on behind us but we
need<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.190> let<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.580> sit<00:04:47.820> for<00:04:47.850> an<00:04:48.060> hour<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.930> the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
need to let it sit for an hour so the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.650 
need to let it sit for an hour so the
adhesive<00:04:49.530> really<00:04:49.920> gets<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.400> there<00:04:50.580> well<00:04:51.150> but

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
adhesive really gets in there well but

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.630 
adhesive really gets in there well but
before<00:04:51.990> we<00:04:52.320> do<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.920> thought<00:04:53.310> we'd<00:04:53.430> take<00:04:53.580> a

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
before we do that I thought we'd take a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.160 
before we do that I thought we'd take a
look<00:04:53.850> at<00:04:53.970> some<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.180> our<00:04:54.330> other<00:04:54.390> hot<00:04:54.930> wheels

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
look at some of our other hot wheels

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.120

we're<00:05:36.780> going<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:36.960> do<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.340> once<00:05:38.340> we<00:05:38.430> get<00:05:38.520> the

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
we're going to do that once we get the

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.360 
we're going to do that once we get the
track<00:05:38.850> also<00:05:39.060> this<00:05:39.900> is<00:05:40.170> the<00:05:40.200> daredevil<00:05:41.010> curve

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
track also this is the daredevil curve

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.420 
track also this is the daredevil curve
and<00:05:42.110> this<00:05:43.110> one<00:05:43.290> over<00:05:43.320> here<00:05:43.530> is<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.980> downhill

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
and this one over here is the downhill

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.740 
and this one over here is the downhill
flip<00:05:44.790> drop<00:05:45.260> I<00:05:46.340> didn't<00:05:47.340> really<00:05:47.820> put<00:05:48.120> them<00:05:48.270> up<00:05:48.450> I

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
flip drop I didn't really put them up I

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.690 
flip drop I didn't really put them up I
put<00:05:49.080> them<00:05:49.170> up<00:05:49.260> really<00:05:49.440> high<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.010> then<00:05:50.400> I<00:05:50.430> tried

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
put them up really high and then I tried

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.060 
put them up really high and then I tried
to<00:05:50.820> attach<00:05:51.060> my<00:05:51.360> other<00:05:51.650> track<00:05:52.650> and<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:52.860> just

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
to attach my other track and I just

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.090 
to attach my other track and I just
don't<00:05:53.160> have<00:05:53.280> enough<00:05:53.430> tracker<00:05:53.790> to<00:05:54.690> support<00:05:55.620> the

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
don't have enough tracker to support the

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.250 
don't have enough tracker to support the
track<00:05:57.060> going<00:05:57.270> down<00:05:57.570> because<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:57.930> don't<00:05:58.080> want<00:05:58.110> to

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
track going down because I don't want to

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.770 
track going down because I don't want to
pull<00:05:58.500> too<00:05:58.650> much<00:05:58.680> on<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.100> on<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.280> wall<00:05:59.750> so<00:06:00.750> i

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
pull too much on the on the wall so i

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.660 
pull too much on the on the wall so i
would<00:06:01.050> need<00:06:01.350> some<00:06:01.560> extra<00:06:01.770> support<00:06:02.250> if<00:06:02.460> i<00:06:02.550> was

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
would need some extra support if i was

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.940 
would need some extra support if i was
going<00:06:02.790> to<00:06:02.850> do<00:06:02.970> that<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.330> i'd<00:06:04.170> like<00:06:04.350> to<00:06:04.500> grab<00:06:04.920> a

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
going to do that and i'd like to grab a

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.290 
going to do that and i'd like to grab a
couple<00:06:05.220> more<00:06:05.340> set<00:06:05.580> so<00:06:05.760> that<00:06:05.790> i<00:06:05.940> can<00:06:06.000> attach

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
couple more set so that i can attach

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.840 
couple more set so that i can attach
them<00:06:06.540> together<00:06:06.660> because<00:06:07.020> these<00:06:07.170> both<00:06:07.500> are

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
them together because these both are

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.820 
them together because these both are
pointing<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:08.940> same<00:06:08.970> way<00:06:09.530> there's<00:06:10.530> probably

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
pointing the same way there's probably

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.340 
pointing the same way there's probably
some<00:06:11.010> configuration<00:06:11.670> i<00:06:11.760> can<00:06:11.910> do<00:06:12.060> it<00:06:12.960> would<00:06:13.200> be

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
some configuration i can do it would be

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.800 
some configuration i can do it would be
nice<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.740> see<00:06:13.770> directions<00:06:14.430> on<00:06:15.060> how<00:06:15.090> to<00:06:15.510> set<00:06:15.780> up

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
nice to see directions on how to set up

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.480 
nice to see directions on how to set up
the<00:06:16.020> additional<00:06:16.470> configurations<00:06:17.190> i'd<00:06:17.370> love

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
the additional configurations i'd love

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.270 
the additional configurations i'd love
to<00:06:17.610> get<00:06:17.760> a<00:06:17.820> template<00:06:18.300> to<00:06:19.050> set<00:06:19.710> up<00:06:19.800> like<00:06:19.950> all<00:06:20.160> the

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
to get a template to set up like all the

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.490 
to get a template to set up like all the
wall<00:06:20.430> tracks<00:06:20.730> together<00:06:20.990> but<00:06:21.990> these<00:06:22.290> the

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
wall tracks together but these the

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.490 
wall tracks together but these the
individual<00:06:22.950> ones<00:06:23.160> being<00:06:23.520> set<00:06:23.760> up<00:06:24.230> they're<00:06:25.230> fun

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
individual ones being set up they're fun

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.860 
individual ones being set up they're fun
