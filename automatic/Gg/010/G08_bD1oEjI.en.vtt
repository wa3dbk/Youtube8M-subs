00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:08.340
 Yes, here is a backpack for mountaineering 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:15.730
 I would like to talk about Zac 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:18.930
 Well, naturally, when I go to the mountains, I always need a Zack. 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.050
 If there is a need something went 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.480
 I think that I do not understand well how to buy for the first time 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:32.480
 I would like to talk in detail as much as possible 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.760
 Well in general it is damage if it is 20 liters with mountains and flowers if it is damage 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.120
 15 liters 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.700
 It is a size called so-called rice pack , but it is also small 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.350
 I think pack is enough 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.770
 For example, stay in a mountain hut 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 It is natural to change clothes when it is tempting to climb 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.320
 A little extra 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.460
 And bring the food of 2 days 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.980
 It becomes such a form 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.980
 30 liters and 35 liters because it will be more 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.990
 That's why we need a little more capacity 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.110
 For example, stay at a tent and climb a mountain 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.970
 Or I will stay in a mountain hut, but for quite a long time 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.310
 5 minutes now and whether that comes supposed to be a walk therefore I this I went 55 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.190
 Oh yeah this rucksack 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.250
 I think that sounds will come out 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.840
 More long term 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.790
 If it comes to have various equipment which does not go in snow mountain whether it is equivalent to Hugh mountain 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.390
 This is a bigger force 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.110
 May be required 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.950
 Oh dear 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.870
 Of course the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.710
 As you try to do a hard climb that is a difficult road 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.330
 I need to 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.830
 Well left, mountain and flowers are like you usually use oneself 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.720
 That I wonder if good even Deipaggu, such as those used in town 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.170
 I think some people think that if the luggage is really light 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.860
 Well if it is a backpack 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.450
 To some extent 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.049
 I think that I can use it for the time being 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.690
 After all what is different when it comes to mountain climbing ? 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.530
 eh 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.399
 If you understand it, you're not thinking that you want a climber's backpack 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.530
 I think 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.640
 It is first and say what kind of place it will be different Oh 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.770
 It is the back part of the back 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:24.720
 Here it's one for climbing has become the most likely amount to the absence of mesh 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.630
 We of the contact at all the force of the back view and is absolutely mountain-climbing 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.400
 Do not Masu pretty Oh life 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:37.280
 This part of the rucksack here is sweaty and sticky 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.569
 The back is always sweaty and sticky because it doesn't dry immediately if it's not such mesh material 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.980
 It is very unpleasant to me 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.550
 So I think it's quite important to say that the back is in mesh, so this is 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.760
 Not just your back 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.140
 The shoulder belt is a part of this back of the belt 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.110
 Especially in the fact that such places are well meshed 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:02.840
 Is what I described such time as sweat when hot 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.050
 Comfortable that do not feel as much as possible is to say the feeling is kind of it is whether Brett 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.190
 Can 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.430
 After all it will be a rucksack for mountain climbing quite important point though 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.630
 It is a waist belt existence 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:20.400
 The left side of the package is, for example, 1 liter of water 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:24.240
 Something users had and surprisingly heavy I do I usually that city entered 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.280
 I think I will not have enough to have one liter of water even though I put my luggage slowly and walk 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.040
 Because 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:36.560
 Furthermore , when you climb a mountain and get down, it is fine when you land 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.760
 Because there is vibration, the luggage shakes by this vibration and it is quite good 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.770
 It is the burden is you take 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.830
 Shoulder is easy to stiffness be if I say only thus shoulder the luggage you have the 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.620
 So this West Belt is a big success 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.300
 Ne 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.580
 The position of this hipbone of just human of forever21 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:01.040
 It is made to fix 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:05.150
 About half the weight of the load r by fixing firmly here 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.710
 The plate is more than half weight and is shaped to support and support 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:14.940
 So although the shoulder is so much that now actually do so also I 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:19.380
 Is so much since this in such do not it takes the weight of the head for those who 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.630
 Even if there is a lot of luggage in it, it won't hurt much 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.010
 say 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.600
 This is the chest belt of mart high , so this is how you carry your luggage 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.440
 I really want to 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.560
 It'll come with shoulder belt has prevented but shifted to this 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.960
 Well there are various things like this I can adjust in a long way 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.030
 Because it can be adjusted 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.860
 It is possible to walk with fine adjustment while walking in such a form 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.330
 Ding-dong Oh Ryukkuro for climbing 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.300
 It becomes a point 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:54.169
 Furthermore, if that day is Rio's small power , there is not such a function so much 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.509
 But 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.509
 When you come to the backpack of a large round-trip 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.540
 This is the way, what kind of unexpected Rick 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.050
 but 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.050
 Bag day 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.150
 On the back 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:11.210
 It is the length of this back 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.500
 Waist to shoulder position 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:18.010
 It is this by shifting out this 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:22.330
 It can be adjusted to the height of the person 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:28.840
 Of course, if it comes to such a large size, it will be mostly for men and women 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:31.990
 It is divided, but by choosing a backpack that suits the person's figure, this shoulder and waist 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.260
 The position is perfect 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.129
 The package is more 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:42.189
 It fits snugly to the body of his own 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.189
 We can walk without burdening 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:50.080
 Wife I Kutteyuu paint the after agent 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.080
 Rain cover method 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.160
 Another I mean and is attached to the top this Amefuta 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.360
 As these 2 finally cover the top 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.469
 it's finished 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.469
 If you can drink this 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:09.740
 The contents of this key has become full sail 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.220
 When a little wear is like Tteyuu Naa not enter one 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.289
 How did this go 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.399
 It became the Abba 2 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.399
 To the place 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.310
 You can spend 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.449
 I can't get into Zack 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.430
 It went over the top 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:37.110
 Because it can also be stored 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:39.560
 Is such a merit and is easy to take out what is easy to take out ? 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.009
 It is something to be taken out frequently 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.080
 It's raining 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:48.800
 Is it a glass 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:53.280
 Is it a mobile phone that you want to take out after every break 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:57.430
 It has become such a thing to be able to accommodate the small items 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.300
 Though such a thing is time in April City 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.300
 It will be such a point 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.780
 Whether and is the location of the I's are after that various pocket 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:11.340
 There are various functions depending on the backpack 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.040
 It is also to say the difference between the performance backpack itself has to say that so 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:18.290
 Well first 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.440
 And whether as Luc becomes the greater compatibility with its own body that matches 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:25.160
 Because it is so important to say 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.969
 It is contained in that mountain climbing supplies sold Akio store the other the power of various manufacturers 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.430
 You carry it on your back 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:33.560
 It is better to compare thoroughly 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:35.310
 That's a bad backpack that doesn't really fit my body 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.200
 It has become like a hardship 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:41.300
 My shoulder is hurting and I can not help it anymore 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:46.720
 You do n't want to be respectful for anything heavy 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:48.840
 But by carrying a backpack that really suits my body 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:53.740
 Because the burden is considerably reduced 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:59.050
 Even the same weight of luggage that I thought was hard on the mountain 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:00.920
 There is such an element that you can walk fairly easily by exchanging beer 

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:03.950
 so 

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.210
 Good for me 

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.259
 By all means 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.259
 I hope you find it
