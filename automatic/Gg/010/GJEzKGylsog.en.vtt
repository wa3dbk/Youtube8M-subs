cutting potatoes last night for stew so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
cutting potatoes last night for stew so

I thought we would show you that and it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
I thought we would show you that and it
is<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.009> size<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> full<00:01:17.850> sheet<00:01:18.150> it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
is not the size of a full sheet it's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.499 
is not the size of a full sheet it's
about<00:01:19.340> maybe<00:01:20.340> three<00:01:20.460> quarters<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> size

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
about maybe three quarters of the size

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.810 
about maybe three quarters of the size
of<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.780> full<00:01:21.960> sheet<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.860> weird<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> rest

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
of a full sheet it's weird so the rest

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
of a full sheet it's weird so the rest
of<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> packaging<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.900> tells<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.680> what

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
of the packaging is just tells you what

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.550 
of the packaging is just tells you what
to<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:28.380> had

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to do with it and on and they had

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
to do with it and on and they had
glow-in-the-dark<00:01:29.030> stick<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.180> letters<00:01:30.600> which

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
glow-in-the-dark stick on letters which

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.359 
glow-in-the-dark stick on letters which
I<00:01:30.930> thought<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.590> cool<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.750> this

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
I thought was really cool and now this

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.480 
I thought was really cool and now this
that<00:01:35.869> isn't<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.020> cool<00:01:39.650> it's<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.890> mirrors

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that isn't that cool it's like mirrors

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.679 
that isn't that cool it's like mirrors
because<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.689> called<00:01:43.079> prism<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.689> just

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
because this is called prism so I just

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.789 
because this is called prism so I just
did<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.399> it's<00:01:47.399> silver<00:01:48.409> gray<00:01:49.409> whatever

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
did it like it's silver gray whatever

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.859 
did it like it's silver gray whatever
you<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> call<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:54.420> coolest

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
you want to call it and then the coolest

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.090 
you want to call it and then the coolest
tape<00:01:55.079> ever<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.710> duct<00:01:55.890> tape
