 to help the guys who are with 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.079
 cancer because the medications are 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.530

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.809
 to do the analyzes and different 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.850
 treatments seems a very activity 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.510

 of them those parents have to leave 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.189
