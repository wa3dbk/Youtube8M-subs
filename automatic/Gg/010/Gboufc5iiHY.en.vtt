00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.349
If you think about a traditional clock
like a

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.369
pendulum clock that's based on some

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.380
periodic event in that case the
pendulum swinging back and forth to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.529
generate time from that you just count

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.699
cycles of its oscillator for atomic
clocks

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.659
it's really not much different at all you
can think about some characteristic

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:40.970
vibration and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.970
an atom and you build the device that
somehow measures or can synchronize to this

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.769
oscillations have an oscillator that
generates

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.809
radiation and that radiation is

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.549
some particular frequency that you can tune to one of the natural

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:05.049
oscillations in the atom to generate time from
that the simplest way is when

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.650
if radiation is tune

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.220
in synchronizations with its natural vibrations
and that radiation is absorbed

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.420
when you find out when that condition of
maximum

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.479
absorbtion then you simply count cycles of the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.550
oscillator that's producing
radiation and the only

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.960
sort of technical difference is that with rather than a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.540
as opposed to penddium clock that's oscillating maybe once every

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.200
other second or so and so we're talking
about oscillation frequencies

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310
about ten to the ten cycles per second
and now

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.570
we can't make much more accurate
clocks if we go to high frequencies

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.950
so now

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.159
like 10 to the 15th cycles per second on of the nice things about

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.690
atoms as opposed to pendulum clocks is
that as far as we know

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.110
all atoms say of a given type are

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.630
exactly identical so as opposed to a
pendulum clock

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.930
as good as we might be able to make say the link

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.000
the pendulum a be the same on different
parts we can we can never do that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.959
precisely

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.890
so there's errors in one clock versus
another

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.420
an atomic clock based on one atom we
agree on a convention you know some

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.069
transition elimination

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.409
the degree we can measure this transition
frequencies frequencies are exactly identical
