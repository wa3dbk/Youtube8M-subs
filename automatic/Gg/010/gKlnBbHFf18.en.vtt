drilled<00:02:49.860> out<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> little<00:02:50.250> bit<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.550> an<00:02:50.640> angle<00:02:50.760> so

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
drilled out a little bit of an angle so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.350 
drilled out a little bit of an angle so
they<00:02:51.440> sort<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.500> bounce<00:02:52.770> along<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:54.239> design

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360
