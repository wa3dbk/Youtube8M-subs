00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.840
 or is a Caribbean island in many 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.150
 senses to which we live here we 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.530
 surrounds much more than water and those who live 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.850
 outside they have to overcome more than the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.850
 distance to reach us 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.770
 although officially we are separated only 90 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.310
 miles south of the usa the distance 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.080
 real is much greater 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.990
 but I think the policy has stopped 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.180
 In Cuba, culture achieved where 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.790
 politicians have failed artists 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.410
 they triumph and manage to create bridges with 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.440
 all this has to be against wind and 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.440
 tide 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.910
 when the dress about the exchange 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.590
 I notice that more questions arise than 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 answers and now they see me better there 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.460
 I ask a group of friends to open a 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.649
 chat and we can talk about it 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.879
 the state of a very large country where the 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.890
 most of the play we go audios not 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.000
 we know we do not know we were not 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.369
 raised or has always been a country of very 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.640
 looked a lot north and has pulled out is very 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.590
 good very good unions not of that of 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.740
 that avant-garde music of the usa 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.540
 our national laps in baseball 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.830
 we like the hamburger with chips 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.750
 fries 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.840
 we like jazz 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.460
 visit was united it was like a dream 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.310
 extremely 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.150
 and I think that in these times there have been 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.260
 a small opening in that sense of 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.590
 that there has been a little more than 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.040
 Miami flexibility go actors and 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:44.060
 actresses who live in mexico in uruguay 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.030
 in Argentina in Venezuela and it's normal 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.520
 they go make their seasons even live 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.259
 in their countries and they live in the USA or 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 singers and then they return to their country 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.190
 in the whole world what as a fact 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.880
 normal because a Cuban can not do 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.130
 the same and that's what I did that's why 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.979
 I had to ask anyone's permission 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.100
 we want to learn also from that culture 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.250
 We also want them to know 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.200
 know our art because it looks at me 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.390
 I started singing without going any further 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.930
 before and when there are two steps of the theater 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.580
 whole was standing and not 69 - the thumb 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.890
 now the young people who now leave me 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.830
 google goes out with the vitality comes out as 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.310
 transform the Cuban community of the USA 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.180
 has changed and Cuba because those people 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.940
 that are there they feel very deeply 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.269
 a need to feel the subject of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.000
 between something that I read this is like the 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.390
 people have begun to understand the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.670
 importance that little and power have 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.600
 that he has to follow in the speech of the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.560
 confrontation in art 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.560
 has passed 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.150
 political positions on one side yes god 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.620
 we love people who do not give themselves 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.790
 tells how to live in Cuba and does not want 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.379
 people who were when he walks in Cuba 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 because we have managed to handle that because 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.890
 we are artists 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.670
 sometimes I do not understand why 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.870
 certain personalities 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.870
 inside the art 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.530
 and sometimes sometimes you do not know where they come from 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.170
 where do themes come from if it's from the usa 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.900
 on the part of one of my dreams was that 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.180
 if it was ever crude to sing again 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.790
 in Cuba I would have the opportunity to 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.090
 see them 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.150
 but olga guillot some of the people 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.519
 that I heard about children who 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.930
 my parents spoke of those artists who 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.140
 they remained Cuban artists and 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.000
 they followed the whole scientific world in the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.640
 world as Cuban artists besides the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.510
 artist always wants that his work is 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.900
 know 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.819
 that influences that 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.819
 and that you see 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.830
 stimulated with the presence with 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.440
 electric change with thanks 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.580
 miravalle's decision to accept a 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.940
 paper 22 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.230
 if the player 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.440
 he wants to come to shoot 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.139
 and that here they feel they understood 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.139
 the legitimacy of being first of chijona 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.680
 that I can work with through that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.650
 I would like to work, take the baguette that 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.210
 here it was understood that they were necessary 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.730
 I was looking at the provision 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.240
 of returning who worked for those who 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.590
 has program process without any 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.240
 geographical proximity in the miners in the 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.800
 plan of actions that have to do with 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.020
 familiarity with culture with the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.940
 made migratory themselves and therefore how much 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.620
 that there are many Americans are in Cuba 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.910
 culture 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.910
 It is the soul of a country 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.880
 a fractured culture makes a country 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.630
 fractured there are also many Marxists 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.630
 those bourgeois 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.839
 and there are many proletarians who are 

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:07.839
 capitalists 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.919
 schematic 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.050
 the schemes of humans this is 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.320
 just blocked 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.950
 autonomous 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.450
 I 'm going to give you a bit of your civility 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.580
 great things have small 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.260
 beginnings I thought that the distances 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.420
 they were insurmountable but before the change 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.620
 between the two countries seems to achieve 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.620
 necessary reconciliations
