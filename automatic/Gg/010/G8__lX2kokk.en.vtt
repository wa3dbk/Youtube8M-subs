00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
going to be centered anymore so just go

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.770 
going to be centered anymore so just go
slowly<00:01:05.460> until<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> hole<00:01:06.210> open

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
did the retainers I found an epoxy that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
did the retainers I found an epoxy that
has<00:01:19.710> 2,500<00:01:20.670> psi<00:01:20.880> pole<00:01:21.840> strength<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.009> what<00:01:23.909> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
has 2,500 psi pole strength so what that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
has 2,500 psi pole strength so what that
epoxy<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.869> basically<00:01:25.850> made<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.890> attachment

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
epoxy I basically made this attachment

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.910 
epoxy I basically made this attachment
slight<00:01:29.670> glass<00:01:30.360> if<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.320> were<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> paint<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
slight glass if I were to paint this you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.910 
slight glass if I were to paint this you
would<00:01:32.040> even<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.460> tell<00:01:32.610> separate<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:34.770> one

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
would even get to tell separate it's one

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.819 
would even get to tell separate it's one
whole<00:01:35.100> piece<00:01:35.659> we<00:01:36.659> wants<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.320> not<00:01:37.619> gonna

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
whole piece we wants this is not gonna

whole piece we wants this is not gonna
call<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.750> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.960> drop<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.590> probably

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
call off if you drop it it's probably

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.399 
call off if you drop it it's probably
gonna<00:01:41.009> mess<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.850> retainer<00:01:42.840> well<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.320> not

break<00:01:45.720> away<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.380> crystal

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
break away this is crystal

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.160 
break away this is crystal
so<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
so if you can see that the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.899 
so if you can see that the
inside-outside<00:01:51.259> just<00:01:52.259> did<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> conversion

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
inside-outside just did the conversion

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.480 
inside-outside just did the conversion
alright<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.060> we're<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.270> put<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:55.310> HIV<00:01:56.310> blog

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
alright so we're gonna put a HIV blog

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.210 
alright so we're gonna put a HIV blog

this is a h7h i Devo it's a K so it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.280 
this is a h7h i Devo it's a K so it's
not<00:02:12.090> gonna<00:02:12.210> be<00:02:12.330> two<00:02:12.510> blues<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.020> gotta<00:02:13.170> be

not gonna be two blues and I gotta be
too<00:02:13.440> white<00:02:13.650> but<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.100> gonna<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.460> 20<00:02:14.850> where

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
too white but it's gonna be in 20 where

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.210 
too white but it's gonna be in 20 where
it's<00:02:15.510> pretty<00:02:15.720> sharp

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
it's pretty sharp

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.040 
it's pretty sharp
the<00:02:17.220> lower<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.760> number<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.240> horizon<00:02:18.810> above

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
the lower the number the horizon above

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.990 
the lower the number the horizon above
but<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.860> always<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.160> killer<00:02:20.370> preference<00:02:20.820> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
but it always a killer preference to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.130 
but it always a killer preference to
higher<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.330> number<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.810> have<00:02:21.930> lower

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
higher the number you can have lower

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.590 
higher the number you can have lower
risk<00:02:22.500> visibility<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.820> went<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.660> K<00:02:26.600> you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
risk visibility so I went with a K you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.990 
risk visibility so I went with a K you
stick<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.959> blob<00:02:28.110> right<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> hole<00:02:29.000> it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
stick the blob right in the hole it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.630 
stick the blob right in the hole it's
pretty<00:02:30.420> much<00:02:30.570> exactly<00:02:31.200> accurate<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:31.980> need<00:02:32.490> it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
pretty much exactly accurate I need it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.830 
pretty much exactly accurate I need it
on<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.300> little<00:02:33.450> bit<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
on there just a little bit so when you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.410 
on there just a little bit so when you
put<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.050> blob<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.320> there<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.850> drops<00:02:36.180> off

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
put the blob in there it's it drops off

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.550 
put the blob in there it's it drops off
in<00:02:36.600> there<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:38.850> snug<00:02:39.209> it's<00:02:39.750> not<00:02:39.900> any<00:02:40.170> play

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
in there and it's snug it's not any play

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.280 
in there and it's snug it's not any play
and<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.430> no<00:02:42.300> play<00:02:42.510> at<00:02:42.600> all<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.870> don't<00:02:43.020> want<00:02:43.140> any

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and it no play at all you don't want any

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.810 
and it no play at all you don't want any
play<00:02:43.440> because<00:02:43.739> any<00:02:43.920> play<00:02:44.130> means<00:02:44.550> you're<00:02:44.730> gonna

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
play because any play means you're gonna

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.520 
play because any play means you're gonna
have<00:02:45.060> probably<00:02:45.840> some<00:02:45.959> moisture<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.260> get<00:02:46.410> in

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
have probably some moisture to get in

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.990 
have probably some moisture to get in
there<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.230> then<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.220> take<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.610> wire<00:02:50.790> I'm

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
there so then you just take the wire I'm

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.440 
there so then you just take the wire I'm
cohoon<00:02:51.420> zeroth<00:02:51.900> hand<00:02:52.110> clip<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.120> I'll<00:02:54.239> pull

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
cohoon zeroth hand clip and I'll pull

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.890 
cohoon zeroth hand clip and I'll pull
the<00:02:54.600> wire<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:54.989> through<00:02:55.110> there<00:02:56.600> keep<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.720> bub

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the wire in through there keep the bub

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.810 
the wire in through there keep the bub
steady<00:02:58.230> if<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.250> make<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
steady if you have it that make the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.640 
steady if you have it that make the
whole<00:02:59.940> bullet<00:03:00.330> too<00:03:00.450> long

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
whole bullet too long

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.140 
whole bullet too long
it's<00:03:02.130> also<00:03:02.310> why<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.920> then<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.280> just<00:03:05.550> pull<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
it's also why and then you just pull the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.390 
it's also why and then you just pull the
blue<00:03:06.660> Taner

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
blue Taner

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:19.110 
blue Taner
pull<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.489> retainer<00:03:08.790> over<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.980> bulb

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.830 

and<00:03:19.330> just<00:03:20.200> like<00:03:20.349> any<00:03:20.590> other<00:03:20.800> 87<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:22.629> was<00:03:22.810> a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
and just like any other 87 this was a

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.710 
and just like any other 87 this was a
the<00:03:24.060> corners<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:26.290> little<00:03:26.530> ridges<00:03:26.860> around<00:03:27.720> L

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
the corners the little ridges around L

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.210 
the corners the little ridges around L
will<00:03:28.870> park<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.590> hole<00:03:29.830> they'd<00:03:30.069> actually

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
will park that hole they'd actually

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.500 
will park that hole they'd actually

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
bright and if you look at the light

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.920 
bright and if you look at the light
itself<00:05:03.710> even<00:05:04.550> from<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.820> side<00:05:05.000> just<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.600> sheer

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
itself even from the side just the sheer

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.300 
itself even from the side just the sheer
it<00:05:06.770> is<00:05:06.919> so<00:05:07.100> bright<00:05:08.590> I'm<00:05:09.590> gonna<00:05:09.800> put<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.070> camera

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
it is so bright I'm gonna put the camera

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.909 
it is so bright I'm gonna put the camera
in<00:05:10.580> it's<00:05:11.030> so<00:05:11.780> bright<00:05:12.669> it's<00:05:13.669> ridiculous<00:05:14.919> from

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
in it's so bright it's ridiculous from

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.140 
in it's so bright it's ridiculous from
the<00:05:16.160> factory<00:05:16.520> steel<00:05:16.699> beam<00:05:17.320> it<00:05:18.320> was<00:05:18.729> nowhere<00:05:19.729> as

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
the factory steel beam it was nowhere as

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.659 
the factory steel beam it was nowhere as
bright<00:05:20.479> as<00:05:20.600> this<00:05:20.750> aks<00:05:21.440> perfect<00:05:21.889> you<00:05:22.520> don't

want to go too much and as that light

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.900 
want to go too much and as that light
got<00:05:26.630> hot<00:05:26.900> it<00:05:27.770> got<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.220> much<00:05:28.340> brighter

got hot it got so much brighter
I<00:05:29.650> see<00:05:30.650> hid<00:05:30.979> conversion<00:05:31.220> for<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.880> if<00:05:32.150> you<00:05:32.270> got

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
I see hid conversion for the if you got

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.090 
I see hid conversion for the if you got
a<00:05:32.419> transit<00:05:32.810> more<00:05:33.020> primero<00:05:33.380> same<00:05:33.620> process

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
a transit more primero same process

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:42.540 
a transit more primero same process
smaller<00:05:34.970> steel<00:05:35.300> beam<00:05:39.520> hid<00:05:40.520> conversion<00:05:40.760> on<00:05:41.360> a

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
smaller steel beam hid conversion on a
