out<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.450> front<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.290> you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
out in front of you

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.670 
out in front of you
and<00:02:33.890> then<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:34.880> have<00:02:35.450> your<00:02:35.840> back<00:02:36.230> foots<00:02:36.530> on

and then you can have your back foots on

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.160 
and then you can have your back foots on
the<00:02:36.709> ground<00:02:37.069> because<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.610> popped<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.170> scooped

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the ground because you popped it scooped

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
ground and then you have your front foot

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.140 
ground and then you have your front foot
just<00:02:42.470> hanging<00:02:43.069> out<00:02:43.190> there<00:02:43.459> above<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.880> board

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
just hanging out there above the board

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.089 
just hanging out there above the board
that's<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.230> foot<00:02:45.440> that's<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.830> catch<00:02:46.069> it

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
that's the foot that's going to catch it

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.820 
that's the foot that's going to catch it
so<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.269> one<00:02:47.599> practice<00:02:48.200> step<00:02:48.410> you're<00:02:48.650> just

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
so that one practice step you're just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.170 
so that one practice step you're just
stepping<00:02:49.010> off<00:02:49.250> with<00:02:49.370> your<00:02:49.489> back<00:02:49.700> foot<00:02:49.940> but

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
stepping off with your back foot but

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.390 
stepping off with your back foot but
that<00:02:50.330> one<00:02:50.540> practice<00:02:51.019> step<00:02:51.200> accomplishes<00:02:51.950> so

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
that one practice step accomplishes so

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.350 
that one practice step accomplishes so
many<00:02:53.209> things<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:54.530> accomplishes<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.549> getting

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
many things it accomplishes you getting

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.710 
many things it accomplishes you getting
the<00:02:56.480> full<00:02:56.780> 360<00:02:57.230> flip<00:02:57.650> rotation<00:02:58.130> down

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
the full 360 flip rotation down

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.240 
the full 360 flip rotation down
practicing<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> proper<00:03:00.170> scope<00:03:00.440> practicing

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
practicing the proper scope practicing

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.520

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
the proper flick and practicing how

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.380 
the proper flick and practicing how
you're<00:03:03.709> going<00:03:03.829> to<00:03:03.920> catch<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.250> board<00:03:04.819> which<00:03:05.239> is

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
you're going to catch the board which is

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.630 
you're going to catch the board which is
with<00:03:05.540> your<00:03:05.750> front<00:03:06.019> foot<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.250> most

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
with your front foot but the most

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.400 
with your front foot but the most
important<00:03:08.450> thing<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.959> number<00:03:09.290> one

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
important thing and the number one

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.650 
important thing and the number one
problem<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:09.829> see<00:03:10.040> with<00:03:10.069> tre<00:03:10.489> flips<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:11.030> that

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
problem I see with tre flips is that

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.400 
problem I see with tre flips is that
people<00:03:11.930> don't<00:03:12.140> lean<00:03:12.380> back<00:03:12.880> no<00:03:13.880> stand<00:03:14.510> with<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
people don't lean back no stand with the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.839 
people don't lean back no stand with the
majority<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.860> their<00:03:16.069> weight<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.310> their<00:03:16.459> back

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
majority of their weight on their back

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.970 
majority of their weight on their back
foot<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.480> then<00:03:17.630> purposely<00:03:18.049> pop<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.739> board

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
foot and then purposely pop the board

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.550 
foot and then purposely pop the board
while<00:03:19.790> leaning<00:03:20.090> back<00:03:20.480> which<00:03:21.049> shoves<00:03:21.410> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
while leaning back which shoves the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.849 
while leaning back which shoves the
board<00:03:21.799> out<00:03:22.069> forward<00:03:22.639> in<00:03:22.760> front<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.540> them<00:03:23.859> that

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
board out forward in front of them that

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.809 
board out forward in front of them that
one<00:03:25.340> thing<00:03:25.700> alone<00:03:26.060> will<00:03:26.450> for<00:03:27.410> sure<00:03:27.819> change

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
one thing alone will for sure change

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.750 
one thing alone will for sure change
everything<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.810> know<00:03:30.260> about<00:03:30.680> tre<00:03:31.160> flips<00:03:31.459> I

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
everything you know about tre flips I

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.640 
everything you know about tre flips I
know<00:03:32.329> that's<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.690> big<00:03:32.870> statement<00:03:33.350> because<00:03:33.410> you

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
know that's a big statement because you

practicing and studying and etc for a

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.539 
practicing and studying and etc for a
while<00:03:38.389> but<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:38.900> guarantee<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.220> look<00:03:40.430> at

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
while but I guarantee you like look at

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.449 
while but I guarantee you like look at
how<00:03:40.670> far<00:03:40.970> my<00:03:41.810> upper<00:03:42.380> body<00:03:42.530> is<00:03:42.709> compared<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.310> my

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
how far my upper body is compared to my

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.569 
how far my upper body is compared to my
legs<00:03:43.790> mid<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.840> tre<00:03:45.079> slit<00:03:45.350> like<00:03:45.950> my<00:03:46.130> body<00:03:46.489> is

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
legs mid the tre slit like my body is

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.420 
legs mid the tre slit like my body is
back<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:47.389> always<00:03:47.569> back<00:03:47.989> it's<00:03:48.889> just<00:03:49.069> really

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
back it's always back it's just really

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.030 
back it's always back it's just really
hard<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.880> explain<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.420> phenomenon<00:03:50.959> of<00:03:51.139> lean

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
hard to explain the phenomenon of lean

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.879 
hard to explain the phenomenon of lean
back<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.819> shove<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.269> board<00:03:53.480> forward<00:03:54.109> it's

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
back to shove the board forward it's

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.379 
back to shove the board forward it's
like<00:03:55.040> if<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.280> were<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.519> draw<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.760> straight<00:03:56.180> line

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
like if you were to draw a straight line

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.150 
like if you were to draw a straight line
down<00:03:56.569> your<00:03:56.780> body<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.230> line<00:03:57.440> would<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.680> slanted

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
down your body the line would be slanted

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.300 
down your body the line would be slanted
and<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:59.660> motion<00:04:00.170> just<00:04:00.650> shoves<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.069> board
