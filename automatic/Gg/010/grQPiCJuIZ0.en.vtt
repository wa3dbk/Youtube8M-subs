00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
which we don't have on display here but

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.740 
which we don't have on display here but
this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.830> basic<00:00:20.189> engine<00:00:20.430> if<00:00:21.420> you're

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
this is the basic engine if you're

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.570 
this is the basic engine if you're
familiar<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.289> our<00:00:22.619> product<00:00:23.070> you'll<00:00:23.220> notice

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
familiar with our product you'll notice

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.210 
familiar with our product you'll notice
that<00:00:23.789> we've<00:00:23.970> moved<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.480> things<00:00:24.510> around<00:00:25.220> ECMs

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
that we've moved some things around ECMs

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.670 
that we've moved some things around ECMs
in<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> different<00:00:26.730> location<00:00:27.230> we<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> new

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
in a different location we have a new

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.700 
in a different location we have a new
air<00:00:28.980> intake<00:00:29.429> system<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:31.260> we've<00:00:31.500> also

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
air intake system and we've also

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770 
air intake system and we've also
improved<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.820> crankcase<00:00:33.329> ventilation

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
improved the crankcase ventilation

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.700 
improved the crankcase ventilation

high-pressure common-rail xpi fuel
system<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.980> allows<00:00:41.219> us<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:42.030> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
system that allows us to do a lot of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.060 
system that allows us to do a lot of
things<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> emissions<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.920> we

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
things with the emissions that we

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.029 
things with the emissions that we
weren't<00:00:44.280> able<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.789> before<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
weren't able to do before so that's the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.590 
weren't able to do before so that's the
biggest<00:00:47.250> change<00:00:47.579> you'll<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.300> side

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
biggest change you'll see on this side

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.060 
biggest change you'll see on this side
also<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.739> notice<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.430> ECM<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.289> same<00:00:52.649> part

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
also of notice the ECM is the same part

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.279 
also of notice the ECM is the same part
number<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.640> now<00:00:53.789> use<00:00:53.820> across<00:00:54.629> our<00:00:54.840> product

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.490 

notice<00:01:05.270> that<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.540> Plumbing's<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.110> little<00:01:06.380> bit

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
notice that the Plumbing's a little bit

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.270 
notice that the Plumbing's a little bit

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
to the front of the engine you do notice

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.340 
to the front of the engine you do notice
that<00:01:48.920> we've<00:01:49.310> run<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:50.680> EGR<00:01:52.480> gas<00:01:53.480> across<00:01:54.170> the

that we've run the EGR gas across the
top<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.890> engine<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.370> it<00:01:55.460> keeps<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.790> away

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
top of the engine and it keeps it away

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.550 
top of the engine and it keeps it away
from<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.270> rear<00:01:56.540> which<00:01:56.780> makes<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.200> fit<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.530> the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
from the rear which makes it fit in the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.350 
from the rear which makes it fit in the
chassis<00:01:57.890> better<00:01:58.340> makes<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> little<00:01:59.150> easier

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
chassis better makes it a little easier

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.250

for<00:02:00.160> Kenworth<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.340> do<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.640> engineering<00:02:02.260> if

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
for Kenworth to do the engineering if

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.800 
for Kenworth to do the engineering if
you're<00:02:03.890> familiar<00:02:04.070> with<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.880> x-15<00:02:05.600> you'll

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
you're familiar with the is x-15 you'll

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.350 
you're familiar with the is x-15 you'll
note<00:02:06.050> that<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:07.250> gear<00:02:07.520> housing<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.119> now

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
note that the gear housing is now

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.300 
note that the gear housing is now
different<00:02:08.720> with<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> lower<00:02:09.350> profile<00:02:09.980> and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
different with a lower profile and

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.820 
different with a lower profile and
that's<00:02:10.820> because<00:02:11.270> we've<00:02:11.630> removed<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.560> cam

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
