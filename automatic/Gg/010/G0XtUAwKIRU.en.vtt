 it all started at the end of the 80s in the USA 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.610
 two foundations began to collect the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.430

 it was no longer American clothes but the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.200
 renamed as used clothing and the 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.860

 but eye come from military garments 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.020
 even intimate clothing that is offered under 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.600
 the elegant lingerie term 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.820
 on the edge of legality on the edge of 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.710
 what is allowed and what is not the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.380
 commerce has evolved so much that one 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.190
 you can find everything in this market 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 [Music] 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.030
 it does not matter what kind of merchandise 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.890
 while you see well those who bring it 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.290
 you know they come from hospitals 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960

 [Music] 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.950
 but not everything is old in this underworld 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.500
 where we have learned to look among the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.890
 waste from other countries there are clothes from 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.360

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.890

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.080
 they thank me 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.850
 at first the used clothes came from the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.979
 united states but the sizes were very 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.060
 big and difficult to sell now 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.340
 arrives from europe 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.800
 malaysia and korea this is the brand that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.600
 dominates the market is transported in almost 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.850
 one month from South Korea to this 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.430
 market and it is not a foundation that the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.230
 brings but a private company that also 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.300
 checking a bit on the internet 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.130

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.670
 other waste earning more than 100 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.080
 millions of dollars a year 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.000
 [Music] 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.120
 A good brand is key for the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.860
 sellers but also if it's new it can 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.010
 end up in a luxury boutique without 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.010
 problems have are the originals 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.440

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.479
 others can put it yes but it is not the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.479
 [Music] 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.360
 First 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.749
 two 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.640
 and everyone knows about that business that's why 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.830
 best clothes are not in this market 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.900
 were chosen before reaching this 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.450
 place although according to the small 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.610
 sellers are a group of 20 large 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.840
 importers who get the most 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.840
 juicy business 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.710

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.380
 controls in each lock the used clothes 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.050
 continues to exist and the business has not only 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.790
 matured if not perfected thousands 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.660
