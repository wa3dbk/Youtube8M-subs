far<00:00:58.300> as<00:00:58.390> I'm<00:00:58.540> concerned<00:00:58.570> looking<00:00:59.380> really

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
far as I'm concerned looking really

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.910 
far as I'm concerned looking really
strong<00:00:59.920> there<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:01.330> as<00:01:01.450> you<00:01:01.570> say<00:01:01.780> flicks<00:01:02.710> in

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
strong there and as you say flicks in

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.380 
strong there and as you say flicks in
another<00:01:03.880> slide<00:01:04.330> as<00:01:04.630> he<00:01:05.170> crosses<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.619> line<00:01:05.830> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
another slide as he crosses the line so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.270 
another slide as he crosses the line so
the<00:01:07.390> more<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.810> car<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.290> going<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.220> straight

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
the more the car is going in a straight

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.730 
the more the car is going in a straight
line<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:10.119> less<00:01:10.360> flamboyant<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.320> less<00:01:11.530> you'll

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
line the less flamboyant the less you'll

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.850 
line the less flamboyant the less you'll
get<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.920> score<00:01:12.220> he<00:01:12.840> was<00:01:13.840> barely<00:01:14.170> ever<00:01:14.470> with<00:01:14.770> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
get a score he was barely ever with the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.890 
get a score he was barely ever with the
steering<00:01:15.180> facing<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.270> right<00:01:16.390> directions<00:01:16.840> you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
steering facing the right directions you

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.420 
steering facing the right directions you
can<00:01:16.930> see<00:01:17.229> actually<00:01:17.590> quite<00:01:17.770> clearly<00:01:18.100> as<00:01:18.310> the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
can see actually quite clearly as the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.850 
can see actually quite clearly as the
car<00:01:18.640> steers<00:01:19.330> they<00:01:19.630> really<00:01:20.410> adjust<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
car steers they really adjust the

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.650 
car steers they really adjust the
steering<00:01:21.070> camber<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.820> get<00:01:22.000> very<00:01:22.360> quick

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
steering camber to get very quick

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.570 
steering camber to get very quick
response<00:01:23.020> from<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.410> it's<00:01:24.100> always<00:01:24.310> spectacular

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
response from it it's always spectacular

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.250 
response from it it's always spectacular
because<00:01:25.030> it's<00:01:25.300> sideways<00:01:25.540> around<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:26.050> water

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
because it's sideways around the water

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.990 
because it's sideways around the water
and<00:01:26.500> then<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.740> next<00:01:26.770> one<00:01:27.070> looms<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.490> straight

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
and then the next one looms so straight

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.640 
and then the next one looms so straight
away<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.270> put<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.479> flick<00:01:28.869> from<00:01:29.050> one<00:01:29.260> side<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
away to put a flick from one side to the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:39.760 
away to put a flick from one side to the
other<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:30.040> do<00:01:30.190> it<00:01:30.220> all<00:01:30.310> over<00:01:30.369> again<00:01:30.640> so

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.350 

oh<00:01:41.469> my
