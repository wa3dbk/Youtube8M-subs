00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
day because it's real hard to do this

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.690

just<00:01:47.529> clips<00:01:47.829> right<00:01:48.009> on<00:01:48.189> so<00:01:48.369> that's<00:01:48.520> kind<00:01:48.670> of

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
just clips right on so that's kind of

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.879 
just clips right on so that's kind of
neat<00:01:48.929> ok<00:01:49.929> so<00:01:49.990> I've<00:01:50.170> misunderstood<00:01:50.799> the

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
neat ok so I've misunderstood the

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:52.260

packaging<00:01:51.429> a<00:01:51.490> little<00:01:51.700> bit<00:01:51.819> I<00:01:51.850> thought<00:01:52.119> you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
packaging a little bit I thought you

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.819 
packaging a little bit I thought you
could<00:01:52.420> rearrange<00:01:52.719> like<00:01:53.380> some<00:01:53.679> of<00:01:53.770> the

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
could rearrange like some of the

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.679 
could rearrange like some of the
components<00:01:54.189> here<00:01:54.609> to<00:01:54.729> make<00:01:54.880> an<00:01:54.999> inside<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.450> an

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
components here to make an inside and an

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.300 
components here to make an inside and an
outside<00:01:55.779> setting<00:01:56.469> but<00:01:56.649> really<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.009> just<00:01:57.099> put

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
outside setting but really you just put

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.949 
outside setting but really you just put
everything<00:01:57.490> together<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.509> only<00:01:58.719> it<00:01:58.810> does

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
everything together the only it does

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.899 
everything together the only it does
flip<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.499> switch<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.189> couch<00:02:00.579> to<00:02:00.880> a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909
