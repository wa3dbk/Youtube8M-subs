00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.879
 well friends of hd magazine engines from 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:15.089
 milan showroom presentation in 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.390
 model s of tesla we are with roberto toro 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.089
 who knows the car well and there 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 tell all I ask you how many versions 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.740
 what differences are there between the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.400
 versions that in this case unlike 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.470
 of the roster three versions are yes 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.090
 differentiate by autonomy 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.050
 available there will be battery packs 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.740
 from 40 60 to 85 kilowatt hours they mean 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.240
 translated 34 and 500 km of autonomy 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.880
 as regards the model s some 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.610
 number in summary the model s is the first 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.250
 totally electric premium sedan 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.140
 available on the international market is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.970
 as I said a car that arrives able 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.940
 to travel up to 500 kilometers with 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.340
 a single charge on the 85 kilowatt hour 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.190
 it is a right car to make him understand the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.900
 power of this sedan that can 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.000
 to go from 0 to 100 in 4 seconds always 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.100
 the following sporting race numbers 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 themes are always zero obviously being 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.370
 100 per 100 electric and you can 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.750
 recharge to have on any outlet 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.220
 of current 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.050
 the other note certainly important 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.940
 top speed that for an electric is 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.010
 certainly noteworthy because it is a car 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.600
 which is able to reach beyond 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.160
 210 kilometers per hour 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.310
 we look at the specific lighthouses 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:31.950
 front xenon and I assume ok the trunk 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.550
 front however good capacity 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.890
 I see a cable to recharge it yes this 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.510
 the model s exactly like the red e 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.220
 will be rechargeable through any 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.830
 power outlet is at the outlets 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.850
 maids which is the very classic from 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.200
 column that I used in Europe 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.640
 there too obviously charging times 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.680
 will vary depending on Paraggio 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.510
 available 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.040
 in this case with the model of the bulk 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.930
 advantage and will be available to us 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.850
 customer a charging device 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.070
 quick to recharge up 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.550
 all 80 percent of the battery in 30 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.060
 years dies 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.100
 so definitely a reason 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.959
 promote let's see it in 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:15.480
 next we see the line really a bit 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:17.430
 racy wheels and tires 19 front 21 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.400
 aluminum rear is the bodywork 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.739
 that the circles i 245 rear tire 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.390
 225 front tire 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.980
 obviously rear-wheel drive if any 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.569
 decidedly back then not driving 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.400
 that in addition to being pleasant is 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.170
 certainly also a lot of fun 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.540
 I see the handles already flush 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.590
 there is a make-up 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.780
 absolutely yes llano gods 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.810
 sensors also these touch in quotci 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.190
 this time in general they come 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.940
 off automatically simply 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.760
 touched and fall on where I close 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.890
 the car is another interesting thing 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.410
 these internal sensor handles which 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.150
 allows you at random where the car but 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.640
 maybe talk after someone 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.319
 I leave the hand inside us we will tighten 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.670
 note obviously from grandma themes 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.610
 the expression cut me unpublished well to the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.840
 back here we see the cotton of the 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.400
 races 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.989
 the charging connector that opens 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.060
 both through the remote control and 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.310
 through an internal button and it is 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.970
 hidden project toucan 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.310
 also behind I imagine led too 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.830
 rear corrected another race 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.660
 another positive note of the model s 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.830
 I'm sure the cargo spaces 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.930
 also posterior with layers that are spoken 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.180
 then 740 liters of load 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.590
 certainly far superior 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.349
 compared to any other sedan of the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.450
 category made reclining seats 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.769
 jewelry on the third claimed of being a 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.750
 third with the seats completely 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.940
 reclined to 1600 years 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.739
 of the Italian closure obviously 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.470
 absolutely yes and no electricity 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.860
 press a button for the evening procession 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.140
 this is the Mr. version then the 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.450
 before the customers will be delivered 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.040
 Italians here we speak for a moment prices 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.640
 have not yet been formalized between 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.500
 a few days but delivery times and in 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.970
 perfect booking method 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.890
 model s prompt lavater 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.989
 pay a security deposit of 4 thousand 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.549
 euro which is totally reportable to 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.019
 customer in the case from today to 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.489
 delivery to the customer should change 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.620
 idea and a way to get started 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.989
 list get in the list because why there 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.440
 14 thousand reservations are filosa del 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.090
 world 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.870
 of people who can't wait to have it 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.600
 explains the Asturian 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.300
 delivery times difficult to establish 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.160
 with precision housing we speak of 8 12 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.950
 months the first to have it will be 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.780
 surely the customers signatures 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.440
 today we have paolo vanzetto that it is 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.210
 one of ours is our first customer 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.380
 model s ordered it every type fi will be 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.080
 certainly the first to receive it 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.700
 probably between good gear first 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.640
 let's try to look at the interiors because 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.270
 even inside it is very well finished if there 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.590
 you want to tell about materials and finishes 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.690
 Also for the integers on the level 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.640
 customization if we want extreme 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.460
 it passes from the skin into different 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:07.670
 briar and wood colors 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:10.780
 soaked for the bridge of course 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.780
 inserts its neighborhoods 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.990
 we must enter 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.550
 front 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.500
 here to tell us about the electric seats 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.320
 obviously electric 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.540
 also in this case if they are reclining 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.950
 at practically one can do it 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.690
 quietly spread out in two 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.190
 inside this car besides the 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.380
 spaces of cargo also the spaces of 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.710
 interior seats are definitely large 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.480
 considered a heat engine car 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.340
 the mechanical parts are really a lot 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.420
 space in this case obviously Venetian 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.040
 there is not even the tunnel of 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.300
 central transmission obviously not 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.380
 there being no motor there is no need to 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.730
 have a central transmission that 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.470
 will take up that a lot of space and 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.870
 consequently also the living space 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.160
 interior is definitely also a see 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.540
 great touchscreen but we'll do this 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.720
 I'd say a special one that's all for now 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.150
 if I can give you my opinion model s 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.740
 I'd like to have it in 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.740
 thanks roberto in history
