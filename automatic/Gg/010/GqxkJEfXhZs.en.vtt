automatically<00:01:28.560> unlocks<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> need<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> use

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
automatically unlocks so you need to use

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.890 
automatically unlocks so you need to use
light<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.600> metal<00:01:30.930> pretty<00:01:31.439> simple<00:01:31.619> stuff<00:01:32.900> so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
light and metal pretty simple stuff so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.300 
light and metal pretty simple stuff so
that's<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.380> we're<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.860> use<00:01:34.890> we're

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that's what we're going to use we're

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.899 
that's what we're going to use we're
going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.000> light<00:01:36.450> dragon<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
going to use the light dragon and the

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.649 
going to use the light dragon and the
metal<00:01:38.909> dragon<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.000> looking<00:01:42.210> for

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
metal dragon and what we are looking for

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
metal dragon and what we are looking for
is<00:01:42.689> 10.5<00:01:43.649> hours<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:46.340> there<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.520> alright<00:01:47.820> so

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
is 10.5 hours and there it is alright so

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.609 
is 10.5 hours and there it is alright so
10.5<00:01:48.810> hours<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> 10<00:01:50.220> hours<00:01:50.579> 29<00:01:51.240> minutes<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.899> 59

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
10.5 hours so 10 hours 29 minutes and 59

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.569 
10.5 hours so 10 hours 29 minutes and 59
seconds<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> should<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.610> 59<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
seconds it should be 59 and then that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.880 
seconds it should be 59 and then that
means<00:01:56.850> they'll<00:01:57.180> take<00:01:57.420> 11<00:01:57.899> gems<00:01:58.200> too<00:01:58.409> fast<00:01:58.649> for

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
means they'll take 11 gems too fast for

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.889 
means they'll take 11 gems too fast for
so<00:01:59.070> let's<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.610> let's<00:01:59.909> fast<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.420> forward

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
so let's do this let's fast that forward

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.600 
so let's do this let's fast that forward
and<00:02:01.079> there<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.790> egg<00:02:04.399> with<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and there is there is the egg with the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.630 
and there is there is the egg with the
exact<00:02:06.090> same<00:02:06.799> breeding<00:02:07.799> time<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> guess

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
exact same breeding time or I guess

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.880 
exact same breeding time or I guess
hatching<00:02:09.239> time<00:02:09.479> or<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> hatching<00:02:10.560> time<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
hatching time or the hatching time is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.710 
hatching time or the hatching time is
the<00:02:10.979> same<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> breeding<00:02:11.849> time<00:02:12.000> alright<00:02:12.569> so

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
source without arms so let's just dive

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.199 
source without arms so let's just dive
out<00:04:13.180> of<00:04:13.210> into<00:04:13.870> here<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.580> here<00:04:15.580> it<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.790> this

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
out of into here and here it is this

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.210 
out of into here and here it is this
this<00:04:16.630> looks<00:04:16.900> like<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.230> Spinosaurus<00:04:18.040> if

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
this looks like the Spinosaurus if

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.250 
this looks like the Spinosaurus if
you're<00:04:18.880> into<00:04:19.180> dinosaurs<00:04:19.570> that's<00:04:20.019> what<00:04:20.230> I

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
you're into dinosaurs that's what I

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.140 
you're into dinosaurs that's what I
think<00:04:20.350> it<00:04:20.739> looks<00:04:20.950> like<00:04:21.160> all<00:04:21.760> right<00:04:21.880> so<00:04:22.030> we're

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
think it looks like all right so we're

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.950 
think it looks like all right so we're
gonna<00:04:22.300> level<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.750> up<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.960> bit<00:04:22.990> more<00:04:23.380> into<00:04:24.190> its<00:04:24.960> or

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
gonna level it up a bit more into its or

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.710 
gonna level it up a bit more into its or
form<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:27.070> what<00:04:27.370> i'd<00:04:27.520> call<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.910> i<00:04:28.180> guess<00:04:28.420> because

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
form is what i'd call it i guess because

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.510 
form is what i'd call it i guess because
there's<00:04:29.170> orb<00:04:29.470> above<00:04:29.800> his<00:04:30.010> head<00:04:30.220> his<00:04:30.580> head<00:04:30.910> um

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
so he has the light orb opposed to the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.570 
so he has the light orb opposed to the
metal<00:04:36.820> warm<00:04:37.180> so<00:04:37.900> there<00:04:38.110> he<00:04:38.290> is<00:04:38.410> he's<00:04:39.040> just<00:04:39.310> as
