 It is a thing 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.260

 I said I was a person who was able to travel and enjoy it so much 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:11.250
 I think we fun at best to have something of thought on their own switch in the stay-at-home by also so far 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.020
 I was thinking of something like that, but after all I went to various places and got in touch

 Feelings say Na also good travel and there is a 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.509
 Now it's time to say Okinawa is a place I've never seen before 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.770

 Toshi-Saiga I'm here now for 23 weeks Now it's good here among them Recommended 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.390
 So I mean, it's not something that will compete in the market 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.990
 I understand 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.800
 Therefore, to say So I was a little hanging out Yeah, you say Ugh'll guide 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.950

 Place to go where the Matokko go to sleep 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.420
 It's all day off, it's a day off, it's really that kind of an orphan with no such fish 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.380
 It's a holiday no matter where you go 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.560
 In the end, at any time, at a smartphone , eat a log and start eating a log with Heidi's here ice confectionery ed 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.090

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.140
 Ne 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.670
 I mean Tsu Well, with me Hagachan I eventually sequel also one 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.230
 And another 3 in the sheet 2 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:16.099
 It has been said that the sound of Okinawa's sound international cuisine has been around for many weeks 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.630
 It's about time that has no meaning yet, but it's the first time in Okinawa 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:25.880
 It Ja do a little thin not you be able occasionally matrix I is Sachotto over there of ramen shop in 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.660
 Toka do not try to go say when the age is and Heidi's over there is why it is Anna to attack 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.250
 Speaking of overseas people 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:36.030
 It is a ramen shop listed in the guidebook , so it is not so delicious but I had a meeting 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.800
 People know that it's just like you're in line with it 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:46.020
 Shop I want him to go to deny the store you want me to go where to put not even in the Tteyuu no 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.650
 I 'm also really getting d Sanji, so in the end there's no rush 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.340
 Everyone is pushing in the alley 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.450
 The store of the key that I found there 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.170
 Well I'm glad because it was after all after all good shops Nde was good 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.920
 Yes I said something like thank you for the introduction of water here 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.420
 The 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.189
 Beneath Why would the five that I have strange I say so say Datte'm in the form that was introduced 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.670
 If you think carefully 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:12.830
 The next morning in Tokyo 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.840
 It came out, but at that time, I would like to ask if there are no recommended stores for Necessie 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.160
 I realized that I did not 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.930
 Say to their expectations to go to Okinawa because'm so in Tokyo 's here is you are wrong 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.410
 That's why it's not 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:29.180
 I'd heard from after I was also reflect Tosshi 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.770
 You may be on a business trip to Okinawa, but everyone who is the performer around you 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.970
 I'm a junior 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:40.220
 Still it seems doing Bakka surrounded by as a senior where softened fledgling junior in Okinawa 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.950
 If there is a village comes to, for example, work 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.580
 At the end of work 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:49.530
 Everyone is not it become Toka Let's go eat part rice it would normally 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:53.880
 So what is the plan of Tokyo is that the other party to go with me is me or Abe Kouji 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:58.620
 I didn't give money for myself 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.040
 When I go to Okinawa, I'm the most senior, so I have to put out all myself. 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.940
 The 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.790
 What it is Nigemawa''d strongly anymore 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:10.420
 Certainly, even though I 'm talking about making a business trip to Okinawa like earning 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:15.040
 If I go to the workplace every day and I go out to lunch 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:19.990
 Through the Kawakan and without money are saying becomes negative because only come back to Tokyo 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.930
 When the science department work is over, only a small snack and can of beer are bought by the convenience store 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.970
 Myself 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:29.300
 I have no choice but to have a dinner at home , which is a little pity but this is true 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.600
 I think I feel that say something seems Yoshimoto Naa story to 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:37.310
 So Yoshimoto's performer is a way of thinking of being a family 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:42.020
 There is a custom that seems like the hull is open to the public doing so from old times 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.100
 It is said that there are a lot of fathers who are running away at night because of the recession really recently 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.940
 In the family 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.550
 While you are talking about the crap I want to appeal me here that Tteyuu 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.950
 a 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:57.880
 The picture of today is finished 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:06:02.440
 Yes today is there a scene in this way I wood building kun is in love with a girl 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.070
 I wonder if this was pretty good too, so I will see you again next time 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.070
 Goodbye
