00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.139 
BAM if they don't respond again well
guess<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.129> we'll<00:01:02.309> go<00:01:02.489> ahead<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.670> jump<00:01:02.879> one

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
guess what we'll go ahead and jump one

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.390 
guess what we'll go ahead and jump one
more<00:01:03.300> time<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.170> damn<00:01:04.470> hook<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> they're

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
more time the damn hook in it they're

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.789 
more time the damn hook in it they're
already<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:06.080> sometimes<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.530> chunk

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
already there sometimes it's one chunk

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
already there sometimes it's one chunk
sometimes<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.610> sometimes<00:01:08.640> history<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
sometimes two sometimes history I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.090 
sometimes two sometimes history I
haven't<00:01:09.780> had<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> point<00:01:10.590> we're<00:01:10.860> going

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
haven't had it to the point we're going

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280 
haven't had it to the point we're going
to<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> fourth<00:01:11.970> job<00:01:12.240> at<00:01:12.900> least<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.229> yet

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to do like a fourth job at least not yet

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.030 
to do like a fourth job at least not yet
so<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.250> didn't<00:01:14.460> spawn<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.909> time<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> it's

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so they didn't spawn that time and it's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
so they didn't spawn that time and it's
fun<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> time<00:01:17.670> again<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.390> looks<00:01:18.540> like

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
fun that time again so it looks like

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.260 
fun that time again so it looks like
it's<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> third<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:19.860> again

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
it's going to be a third one again

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.090 
it's going to be a third one again

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
the best methods to do this Luke a just

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.320 
the best methods to do this Luke a just
for<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.260> fact<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.650> they<00:01:34.610> won't<00:01:34.760> spawn<00:01:35.090> if

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
for the fact that they won't spawn if

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.550 
for the fact that they won't spawn if
you<00:01:35.420> don't<00:01:35.570> jump<00:01:35.840> because<00:01:36.200> what<00:01:36.380> you're<00:01:36.500> doing

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
you don't jump because what you're doing

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.230 
you don't jump because what you're doing
is<00:01:36.800> you're<00:01:36.920> actually<00:01:37.100> jumping<00:01:37.490> over<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> box

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
is you're actually jumping over the box

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.990 
is you're actually jumping over the box
that<00:01:38.930> they<00:01:39.110> spawn<00:01:39.440> so<00:01:40.250> they<00:01:40.430> will<00:01:40.760> go<00:01:40.940> ahead

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
that they spawn so they will go ahead

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.880 
that they spawn so they will go ahead
and<00:01:41.150> kill<00:01:41.360> them<00:01:41.660> again<00:01:42.230> and<00:01:42.500> then<00:01:42.680> we're<00:01:42.800> gonna
