00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
got to find the end of the tape there's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.649 
got to find the end of the tape there's
two<00:01:35.220> ends<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.090> got<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> find<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
two ends right so you got to find the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.170 
two ends right so you got to find the
end<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.990> has<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.670> part<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.880> sticky

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
end that has a little part that's sticky

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.440 
end that has a little part that's sticky
in<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:40.500> case<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:42.180> side

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
in my case here it's this one this side

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
in my case here it's this one this side
is<00:01:42.600> sticky<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> other<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.409> isn't<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.950> it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
is sticky the other one isn't so it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.340 
is sticky the other one isn't so it's
easier<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> start<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.840> side<00:01:46.079> that's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
easier to start with a side that's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.660 
easier to start with a side that's
sticky<00:01:46.710> because<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.159> put<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
sticky because then you put it on the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
sticky because then you put it on the
racket<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> doesn't<00:01:48.600> move<00:01:48.689> around<00:01:48.890> so

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
racket and it doesn't move around so

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.870 
racket and it doesn't move around so
here<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.220> let<00:01:50.399> me<00:01:50.430> see<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.759> get<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880

little amount not too much not too

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.870 
little amount not too much not too
little<00:02:21.340> if<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.620> go<00:02:23.860> over<00:02:24.340> too<00:02:24.610> much

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
little if you if you go over too much

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.630 
little if you if you go over too much
every<00:02:25.480> time<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.870> go<00:02:25.990> over<00:02:26.320> it's<00:02:27.160> going<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.430> be

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
every time you go over it's going to be

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.610 
every time you go over it's going to be
you're<00:02:28.240> going<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.420> end<00:02:28.570> up<00:02:28.660> with<00:02:28.840> too<00:02:29.050> short<00:02:29.440> of

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
you're going to end up with too short of

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.140 
you're going to end up with too short of
a<00:02:29.680> grip<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.490> it's<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:30.760> going<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.970> cover

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
a grip here and it's not going to cover

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.260 
a grip here and it's not going to cover
all<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.480> way<00:02:31.600> down<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.430> know<00:02:33.610> you're<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
all the way down you know you're to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.120 
all the way down you know you're to
cover<00:02:34.480> all<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.750> way<00:02:34.840> down<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.920> need<00:02:36.070> to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
cover all the way down you need to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.470 
cover all the way down you need to
overlap<00:02:36.640> only<00:02:37.180> by<00:02:37.450> about<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.670> quarter<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.700> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
overlap only by about a quarter of the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.010 
overlap only by about a quarter of the
width<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.740> tape<00:02:41.980> has<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.420> if<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.690> divide

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
width that the tape has so if you divide

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.270 
width that the tape has so if you divide
your<00:02:44.170> tape<00:02:44.380> in<00:02:44.560> half<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.040> divide<00:02:45.250> it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
your tape in half and then divide it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.590 
your tape in half and then divide it
again<00:02:45.640> you're<00:02:45.820> going<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.060> like<00:02:46.270> four

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
again you're going to have like four

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.140 
again you're going to have like four
parts<00:02:47.200> that's<00:02:47.800> amount<00:02:48.190> about<00:02:48.580> how<00:02:48.730> much<00:02:48.970> you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
parts that's amount about how much you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.870 
parts that's amount about how much you
put<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.660> top<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.990> each<00:02:50.290> other<00:02:50.470> as<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.700> go

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
put on top of each other as you go

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.850 
put on top of each other as you go
around<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.170> hold<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.500> racket

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
around like this so you hold the racket

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.350 
around like this so you hold the racket
with<00:02:53.950> these<00:02:54.070> four<00:02:54.310> fingers<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.090> then<00:02:55.180> your

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.720 
if you put it like soft and gentle like
this<00:03:22.570> eventually<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.440> moves<00:03:23.620> around<00:03:23.800> so<00:03:24.280> you

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
this eventually it moves around so you

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.220 
this eventually it moves around so you
want<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.000> give<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.270> little<00:03:25.420> tug<00:03:25.750> here<00:03:26.050> and

want to give it a little tug here and

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.350 
want to give it a little tug here and
stretch<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.770> a<00:03:26.830> little<00:03:26.860> bit<00:03:27.430> as<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:28.030> lay<00:03:28.209> it

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
stretch it a little bit as you lay it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.390 
stretch it a little bit as you lay it
down<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.870> then<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.680> keep<00:03:29.860> working<00:03:30.250> your<00:03:30.340> way

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
down and then you keep working your way

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.449 
down and then you keep working your way
up<00:03:31.120> on<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.050> shaft<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.739> racket<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.340> the

grip towards the middle of the racket

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.550 
grip towards the middle of the racket
remember<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:36.940> said<00:03:37.030> overlapping<00:03:37.780> by<00:03:38.110> about<00:03:38.500> a

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
remember I said overlapping by about a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.470
