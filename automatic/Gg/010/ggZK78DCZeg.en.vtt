00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.990
 and how about youtube friends I hope that 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.790
 are all very well are ricardo acosta 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.830
 of sonder productions and bringing them 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.509
 will make a video that happened to me is going to be in 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.470
 the review of galaxy no 3 which is the 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.509
 stylus 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.550
 let's see its functions and I'm also going 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.470
 to take advantage to show what the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.540
 flip cover that is being this 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.420
 has the action out right now 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.240
 here is this is new this I sell it in 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.330
 a price of 299 can be added to the 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.850
 equipment price and it costs 199 so 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.110
 Well, this has been what 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.950
 I want to take advantage also is to tell you 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.170
 I already got the htc one perfect plan 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.510
 as you see here is 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.760
 are the same measures soon I will do according to 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.519
 boxing and its review so that it is very 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.829
 pending and apart here are shipments that 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.750
 I have done by this date as you see 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.050
 they all have my name ricardo acosta 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.870
 that they were always mentioned 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.230
 so that they distrust a little 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.610
 less of me and those who are clients I 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.160
 have bought some various equipment 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.730
 because they lose distrust but 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.380
 well let's go now if what is the 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.450
 team as I tell you is this flip 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.760
 cover that then more than anything help 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.430
 protects the team while leaving you 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.840
 use it here as we can see for example 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.180
 we can unlock it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.120
 from here 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.480
 we can here start the music put the 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.480
 camera 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.460
 and so without uncovering the case we can 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.500
 we do capture photos and then 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.870
 as you see it is very practical 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.980
 because they are protecting your team and 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.530
 they are also making use of it then 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.570
 well we have nothing the function and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.460
 also that you are using it here 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.860
 in normal use and with this they block it 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.560
 if it is blocked then it is one of the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.560
 main function that this has 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.390
 this accessory so well this is all 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.120
 of freak cover as I tell you has a 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.720
 price of 199 pesos in case 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.170
 buy together with the team 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.000
 so that style is what many 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.190
 they asked me and the truth that happened to me 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.500
 do in the review as you see here what 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.380
 I pulled out of here is the stylus and it opened 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.840
 what is the command us here 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.690
 we can go to 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.940
 I have known 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.940
 the spin action memos is called 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:58.209
 it opens and we can do it here 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.209
 a note with the pencil either this I do not know 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.760
 Question 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.760
 at 1 pm they keep it 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.360
 and then this one stays there so that 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.220
 remember today we either 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.220
 ingredients of a recipe or things like that 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.900
 anything they were pointing it out like that 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.110
 that this is where the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.930
 direct access to the mail command after 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.840
 is this that is of the applications 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.140
 recent as you see here we eliminate them 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.950
 then there is this one that is a capture of 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.640
 screen 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.640
 and that agreement 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.130
 yes we can see 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.130
 that if he captured it 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.530
 this was the capture of fact also 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.560
 I want to take the opportunity to look at 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.440
 details and as you see is a resolution of 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.320
 720p which is what the water mentioned 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.390
 and therefore out there someone who said 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.090
 that that was not true but then here 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.880
 You can also check simply 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.069
 is what is this 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.349
 if you make a window here 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.840
 for example I want to see the calculator and 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.919
 it opens there like in the background there 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.919
 we can use it 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.740
 and how they see it is there this 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.849
 flying so to speak 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.229
 we can move it keep using the equipment 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.580
 put it here on the corner anywhere if 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.520
 they want in the application and they put it 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.889
 big and they make it smaller and from here you 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.620
 removes so afterwards it is very practical 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.040
 that the other thing that is step here is the one of 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.020
 search that the truth does not have much 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.060
 many sciences only want 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.340
 because with an application here they look for it 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.730
 for example the camera 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.919
 and here is the camera then it is 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.760
 also something here of what this has 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:04.330
 the command and well out there they do not have 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.199
 another function more than the use the common use 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.060
 as if it were a finger something but in 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.210
 instead of that the stylus can be more 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.740
 simple to use so fast that 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.470
 we fill up we would occupy a hand to use 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.940
 the whole screen because if we did not have 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:24.070
 the style is to be like this and it takes longer to 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.510
 reach end to end with this 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.000
 illusion is very simple only 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.310
 here they do it more freely 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.960
 so that was all I hope 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.940
 have liked the video since they saw the 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.580
 functions of the stylus the functions of the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.930
 Itching and I hope that there is 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.430
 also become clearer all that 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.410
 trust me more from this video 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.670
 and I am ricardo acosta de sommer 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.370
 productions waiting to see you in the 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.180
 next video 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.180
 and see you
