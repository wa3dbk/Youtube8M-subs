00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.389
 radio controlled models 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.469
 welcomes you again and you show you 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.570
 today modelku 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.699

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.689
 motors for rent 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.210
 There is such a machine engine on 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.740
 methanol rather kills us without k and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 programmer such a model from 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:43.320
 brain collector and look at Turkish 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.000
 language after all provodochek to convince himself 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.520
 equipment associated with cults if 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.079
 Trukhanov lost now set up 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:57.420
 another special pays fontanka here and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:07.650
 means must protect and also have 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:09.810
 tuning for metal parts which 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.670
 you can put on the car you want 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.400
 let 's light up the front bumper 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.680

 can order to for your favorite glory and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.790
 put using 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.009
 No need for meat, my best 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.030
 Plastic Now they are cheaper and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.490
 break did not catch 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.860
 because you are nice cute at work 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.770
 lazy suspension can be both cost and 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:46.560
 look further will we have two more or 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:53.580
 messenger means 8 batteries we insert here 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.440
 That means the nose of the line all sorts of different 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.560
 the creatures will be left to right and right 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.170
 left personal fate arm not forward but 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.690
 back and so vice versa rearranged 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.080
 sensitivity is set to steering and 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.890
 date single sharply on the steering wheel and 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.440
 accordingly compiled 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.920
 pleasure collapse i.e. to machine 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.920
 inside 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:24.319
 well done it changes mean 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.319
 the body rests on only two heels and 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.180
 means he is a differential here 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:37.109
 four wheel all-wheel drive independent 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 shock absorber mass serviced 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.730
 then there are spacers you can put 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.010
 sneakers 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.599
 for the model to be harder 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.670
 clipped from 10 to jump to tape affair 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.129
 here is a normal model for beginners 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.069
 she's not a little small on medium then 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.650
 there is no reason you can go down the street 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.260
 basically match up with baby suede 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.480
 light from this speed and be difficult 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.690
 break therefore she principle not 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.549
 the only thing you kill is not wet 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.549
 so that the equipment and water got it 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:37.250
 mean when how much cent machine itself 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:39.799
 the battery charge, the atom 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.019
 only store us to care availability 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.609
 can see how much it costs 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.639
 what are the size of this can 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:50.859
 see the video where with this model 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.859
 people get tired of training can see
