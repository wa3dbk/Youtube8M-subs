00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.760
 hello with you finally the next 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.160
 release they while I wildly apologize to 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.410
 those who really waited for him I thought for a long time 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 about to talk and I realized that I was wild 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.209
 I want to talk about the most controversial issue 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.160
 fansub or funds in this issue i 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.480
 I will try everything possible to paint but 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.280
 and let's start my books 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.020
 in the past two years the Japanese theme 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.370
 animations began to proliferate 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.230
 In Russian federation 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.390
 the audience rose almost twice 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.059
 but what the fuck most 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.519
 viewers have reached 18 years old I have nothing 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 I not mind just do not flag was 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.390
 they would no longer flag if it were not 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.399
 there were epic introductions and since even I 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 can't think of anything epic but also 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.829
 let's start right away to our topic 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.050
 fandom or fansab fansab or funds that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.629
 better let's figure it out 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.229
 although what I immediately answer is direct 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.190
 text 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:58.319
 nothing yes nothing start with the fact that the fan 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.940
 dub is an amateur voice acting which 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.800
 performed pimply card Vym 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.899
 teenagers on the headset by the way 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.119
 most of the Berov Fatty Fund 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.009
 this is usually recorded at home in 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.020
 normal room without sound insulation 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.329
 although lying carpet serves as a good 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.759
 soundproofing because everyone hangs at home 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.530
 the carpet and I'm right it fansab 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.880
 amateur translation hence 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.850
 there is no special education translator 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.950
 on ergey Fion learned all the subtleties 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.299
 translation, he does not know, I am silent about what 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.430
 in most cases they are stupid 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.619
 throw a translation in some chrome 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.840
 and then stupidly edits and edits 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.909
 By the way, too, the cortex wa translates they usually 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.950
 sansa would ansa bye english subtitles 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.840
 I mean, someone translated from Japanese to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.909
 English and English to Russian and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.829
 even there are such long chains when with 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 Japanese translate to Spanish with 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.149
 Spanish to French from French 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.189
 in English and from English to Russian 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.350
 hence the accuracy of translation pipets 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.420
 how is lost and in the end the place 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.789
 kind japanese phrases and i love you on 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.249
 we have the screen I want you 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.560
 baby i will give you bye for 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.560
 will work when it stops 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 I will work with your fingers 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.249
 Now you probably ask silent and about 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.930
 voice acting so little shit said and all 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.090
 easy 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.950
 our dear dubbing is done for the same 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.960
 translation therefore it is the same 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 wrong plus fan dober may not 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.070
 read the words and by that he again 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.900
 claim tag meaning him and with this we 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.280
 figured out then let's go to 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.110
 the second part of our program under 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.720
 I want to hear the name of the original 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.310
 the game is this, they are not only angry voices 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.110
 that dubbing can ruin without it 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.690
 ruined translation so she can 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.830
 spoil the whole viewing experience 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.350
 Now in voice acting lizat all 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.200
 and most of them climb for the weaker sex 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.540
 and now voice the 928 series naruto me 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.820
 will look 10,000 and I'm just but famous 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.610
 they do not think about the fact that pipets 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.830
 What are they nagging you and hoarse 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.380
 diction no hearing no pro actor 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.540
 I generally keep quiet take the old headset 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.550
 write spread online but 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.130
 along with the map you're between gay and fatter 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.930
 which are less good but thicker 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.970
 is not recorded on the headset on 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.280
 more or less studio equipment and 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.290
 know how to play voice what can I 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.910
 say about this voice acting in the majority 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.459
 cases she does not deserve her 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.650
 attention and I look with the voice acting but I look 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.660
 with voice acting only some voices with 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.790
 that I'm really interested to listen to 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.040
 Why you ask because I pipets 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.600
 how I love Russian voice acting now you 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.090
 Perhaps they are perplexed because I only 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.640
 crap tower but I say that I love 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.350
 but I love not the fund will love the real 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.120
 professional Russian voice acting and 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.340
 now we will move the main part of this 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.690
 themes in professional anime dubbing 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.910
 good or bad, 80 percent i 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.650
 I can say yes it is good at least 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.140
 because people translate with special 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.980
 Education voiced actors who 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.620
 well the actors are true they are fat too but they 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.420
 actors but even in these 80 percent 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.910
 Kindness for not shit a rainbow describe 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.400
 Fanta and there is 20 percent evil this 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.240
 the eternal problem of shinigami or sinigami 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.300
 ichigo or &amp; tyga dried sushi 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.560
 let's talk a little bit on this topic 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.870
 let's start with the captain saying that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.030
 Japanese is not Russian in Japanese 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.130
 There are some sounds, such as 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.810
 us so grammatically correct 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.310
 speak sinigami just like not 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.500
 mitsubishi mitsubishi 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.330
 these are features of Japanese with this 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.000
 nothing can be done why are we not 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.250
 we can take it all very easily because 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.810
 that we were initially fed fan sub 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.250
 just the wrong translation 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.380
 which makes using promt 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.230
 most translators don't know these 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.360
 nuances and so when it is written with her 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.430
 Inch on the basis of English does not translate 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.170
 like shinigami tobish they translate not with 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.430
 Japanese translates to english 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.350
 hence up 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.120
 dubbing is good example 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.250
 serve and him and called shaman 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.290
 king or more simply the king of shamans 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.600
 showing this dumb in Russia saved the names 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.820
 good dubbing for me is the first 32 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.620
 Syria dubbing and would have changed voices 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.540
 not only that in the first half were 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.370
 smartly picked up voices so also 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.530
 dubbing did not come from the Japanese version with 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.810
 American and that's a plus because 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.160
 The American version is really better because in 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.260
 not rewritten all musical 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.240
 accompaniment japanese version very 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.280
 sad in this regard and if dubbing 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.780
 gone over her don't think they came mine 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.730
 to such success in russia 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.920
 i'm silent about chic american 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.340
 opening which are no less elegant 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.990
 our actors are dober and 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.180
 sound only good 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.670
 equipment is a minimum need to spend 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.710
 12,000 although if you take the rights of the sphere there 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.810
 only a microphone can cost 90 thousand 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.530
 plus a sound chip of 90,000 and everyones 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.450
 compressors 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.100
 you must have clear diction and before 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.080
 voice acting you have to do a chanting 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.110
 not long me 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.300
 over 15 never never repeat 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.729
 intonation behind the original is big 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.780
 mistake if they scream like crazy not 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.120
 shout like they are 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.979
 for it is a wretched look you should 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.530
 there may be a level dubbing 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.300
 convey emotions and i'm silent that many 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.210
 intonation is language features and 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.740
 do not copy them at all and background Sabir 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.569
 if you translate from english 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.009
 translate as normal translators 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.530
 knowing english 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.539
 they stick impromptu I won't 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.280
 slander good translators more 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.409
 than good divers but also among 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.319
 translators have their fecal cooler and 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.879
 they themselves know about it in the end win 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.039
 licensed products 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:12.990
 they fansub or fund it because 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.840
 licensed dubbing there is always a duck 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.940
 drill so you can enjoy 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.680
 correctly put the translation by the way I want 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.409
 add that dubbing lovers are divided into 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.870
 two kinds of 1 someone bolin read and second 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.949
 these are people with little restrictions 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.139
 for example, with poor eyesight 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.240
 which is simply physically difficult to read 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.699
 Subtitles Well, there are people who are stupid 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.129
 like the original everyone has their own tastes but 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.750
 they often shout at phantom moles 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:39.990
 shit and that dober and spoils everything with his 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:44.509
 voices wondering what you want for everything 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.509
 spoils its not high-quality translation 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.430
 but at the end I would like to say that if 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.190
 there will be a good right voice acting i will choose 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.810
 her if dubbing otrini me it's me 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.729
 I will select their translation and will watch 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.620
 subtitles to me because they are voiced 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.990
 not dubbing theater actors and 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.360
 the quality of their dubbing I really don't 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.550
 I like them, but the translation is good and 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.199
 if there is a good fandom i will choose him 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.699
 but if it is announced badly 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.680
 translation and the Internet will lie 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.789
 a translation that will be much better 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.180
 watch subtitles 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:18.949
 because the main thing is the meaning and not how 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.210
 You looked well, but today it's all 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:23.669
