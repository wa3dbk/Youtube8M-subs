 also state certified graduated from 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.289

 ik emma so I'm going today you 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.460
 learn to defend yourself against a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.619
 knife threat 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 krav maga is a method 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.940
 of Israeli self-defense practicable by 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.440
 all and in any situation 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.850
 the opponent does not seize and threatens to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.270
 throat and grabbed me the opposite poles 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.870
 first step I grab the marl and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.420
 I chained by a face stroke then 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.079
 we continue to chase and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.469
 coming controlled with the second hand the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.680
 lama army and strikes genitals for 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.619
 then year the attacker on the ground 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.080
 last phase we always come 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.530
 maintain and we come back disarmed in 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.979
 coming spitting and tears in the hand of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.979
 the adversary 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.759
 so we learned today to 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.790
 Defend yourself against a knife threat 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.619
 on the throat do not forget some 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.130
 principles of krav maga 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.530
 first of all away from the angel and in 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.880
 grabbing the armed hand and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.539
 simultaneously come and hit the opponent 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.259
 on sensitive points and then 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:54.560
 try either to bring it to the ground or to 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.810
 disarm him so he can pull himself 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.500
 of business we have seen the different 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.960
 defense opportunities presented by the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.569
 Krav Maga 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.269
 but do not forget that the 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.750
 best defense is to know how to run 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.410
 and for that you need a very good 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.410
 pair of sneakers
