just<00:01:53.580> mines<00:01:53.940> level<00:01:54.270> two<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.929> mean<00:01:55.200> either

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
just mines level two so I mean either

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
just mines level two so I mean either
way<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> will<00:01:55.619> work<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:56.039> then<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> want<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
way it will work and then you want to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.900 
way it will work and then you want to
drop<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.509> your<00:01:57.899> dragons<00:01:58.349> so<00:01:58.770> notice<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
drop in your dragons so notice the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.580 
drop in your dragons so notice the
strategic<00:02:00.509> placement<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.380> then

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
strategic placement of them and then

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.490 
strategic placement of them and then
drop<00:02:01.830> your<00:02:01.860> rage<00:02:02.190> spells<00:02:02.550> accordingly

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
drop your rage spells accordingly

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.080 
drop your rage spells accordingly
because<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.739> want<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> drop<00:02:05.190> in<00:02:05.459> your<00:02:05.489> archers

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
because you want to drop in your archers

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.339 
because you want to drop in your archers
as<00:02:06.239> well<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.720> get<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.959> extra<00:02:07.170> little

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
as well just to get that extra little

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.650 
as well just to get that extra little
boost<00:02:07.619> those<00:02:07.920> rage<00:02:08.220> spells<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.789> necessary<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
boost those rage spells are necessary to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.020 
boost those rage spells are necessary to
compensate<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.590> happening<00:02:11.190> level<00:02:11.880> two

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
compensate for not happening level two

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.760 
compensate for not happening level two
dragons<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> can<00:02:13.140> see<00:02:13.290> everything<00:02:13.620> got

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
dragons so you can see everything got

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.920 
dragons so you can see everything got
picked<00:02:13.980> off<00:02:14.130> pretty<00:02:14.459> easily<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.629> Giants

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
picked off pretty easily and the Giants

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.030 
picked off pretty easily and the Giants
and<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.079> barbarian<00:02:16.500> King<00:02:16.620> are<00:02:16.739> definitely

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and the barbarian King are definitely

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.699 
and the barbarian King are definitely
doing<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.219> work<00:02:17.430> down<00:02:17.640> there<00:02:18.140> not<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.439> worried

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
doing the work down there not so worried

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.690 
doing the work down there not so worried
about<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> wizard<00:02:20.280> tower

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
about the wizard tower

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.979 
about the wizard tower
just<00:02:20.879> because<00:02:21.090> they<00:02:21.209> don't<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.750> well

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
just because they don't do that well

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.550 
just because they don't do that well
against<00:02:22.500> air<00:02:22.680> units<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:24.030> obviously<00:02:24.560> there's

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
against air units but obviously there's

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.300 
against air units but obviously there's
a<00:02:25.650> pretty<00:02:25.890> some<00:02:26.099> hefty<00:02:26.790> wizard<00:02:27.480> towers

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
a pretty some hefty wizard towers

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
a pretty some hefty wizard towers
everything<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.400> going<00:02:29.580> well<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.940> dropped<00:02:30.209> a

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
everything is going well I dropped a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.180 
everything is going well I dropped a
heal<00:02:30.629> spell<00:02:30.900> just<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.410> kind<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.680> secure<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.099> in

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
heal spell just to kind of secure it in

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.580 
heal spell just to kind of secure it in
because<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.670> was<00:02:32.849> ripping<00:02:33.690> my<00:02:33.840> hair<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.230> trying

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
because I was ripping my hair out trying

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.920 
because I was ripping my hair out trying
to<00:02:34.830> get<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.069> done<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.569> see<00:02:36.720> now

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
to get this done but you can see now

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.040 
to get this done but you can see now
that<00:02:36.959> all<00:02:37.290> that's<00:02:37.530> done<00:02:38.840> everything<00:02:39.840> is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
that all that's done everything is

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.110 
that all that's done everything is
fairly<00:02:40.500> simple<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:41.340> retrospect<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.970> was<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
fairly simple in retrospect it was a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.270 
fairly simple in retrospect it was a
little<00:02:42.239> bit<00:02:42.360> overkill<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.410> actually<00:02:43.830> tried

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
little bit overkill but I actually tried

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.100 
little bit overkill but I actually tried
this<00:02:44.430> several<00:02:44.880> different<00:02:45.300> times<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:45.690> many

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
this several different times with many

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.500 
this several different times with many
different<00:02:46.260> options<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.790> was<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
different options and this was the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.930 
different options and this was the
combination<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.650> get<00:02:50.280> her<00:02:50.370> done<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.819> can

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
combination to get her done so you can

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.150 
combination to get her done so you can
see<00:02:51.120> my<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:51.629> dragon<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.080> almost<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.590> its<00:02:52.620> last
