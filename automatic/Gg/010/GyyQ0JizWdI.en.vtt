soil okay what we're doing is we're
putting<00:00:22.230> real<00:00:22.529> compost<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:24.390> opposed

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
putting real compost in this as opposed

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.330 
putting real compost in this as opposed
to<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.960> soilless<00:00:25.230> mix<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.859> doesn't<00:00:26.189> have

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to a soilless mix it doesn't have

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.970 
to a soilless mix it doesn't have
compost<00:00:26.789> okay<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.599> our<00:00:27.750> compost<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> seafood

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
compost okay so our compost is a seafood

a lot of nutrients that are great for

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.010 
a lot of nutrients that are great for
growing<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.980> soil<00:00:38.280> food<00:00:38.430> web<00:00:38.489> okay<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:39.809> in

growing the soil food web okay which in

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.260 
growing the soil food web okay which in
turn<00:00:40.200> feeds<00:00:40.500> plants<00:00:41.070> okay<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.730> soil<00:00:41.969> food<00:00:42.210> web

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
turn feeds plants okay the soil food web

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.250 
turn feeds plants okay the soil food web
yeah<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.680> well<00:00:44.100> soil<00:00:44.399> food<00:00:44.520> web<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
yeah what is it well soil food web is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.930 
yeah what is it well soil food web is
sort<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> oceans<00:00:46.920> food<00:00:47.219> chain<00:00:47.460> okay

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
sort of like the oceans food chain okay

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.220 
sort of like the oceans food chain okay
you<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> lot<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.600> bacteria<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you have to have a lot of bacteria and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
you have to have a lot of bacteria and
fungi<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> bottom<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.760> web<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
fungi at the bottom of the web right and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.990 
fungi at the bottom of the web right and
they<00:00:51.870> feed<00:00:52.140> progressively<00:00:53.070> larger<00:00:53.340> things

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
they feed progressively larger things

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
they feed progressively larger things
you<00:00:54.300> still<00:00:54.480> can't<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.930> them<00:00:55.110> right<00:00:55.530> because

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you still can't see them right because

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.099 
you still can't see them right because
things<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.280> nematodes<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.329> protozoa<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
things like nematodes and protozoa and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.680 
things like nematodes and protozoa and
ciliates<00:00:58.770> those<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> guys<00:00:59.940> that<00:00:59.969> eat<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
ciliates those are the guys that eat the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.399 
ciliates those are the guys that eat the
bacteria<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.199> fungi<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.489> excrete

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
bacteria and fungi and then excrete

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.320 
bacteria and fungi and then excrete
plant<00:01:04.409> ready<00:01:04.619> food<00:01:04.830> sure<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.820> there's<00:01:06.000> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
plant ready food sure so there's so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.210 
plant ready food sure so there's so
there's<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> alive<00:01:07.350> that's<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.070> people

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
there's this is alive that's what people

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190 
there's this is alive that's what people
I<00:01:08.430> think<00:01:08.670> sometimes<00:01:09.030> forget<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.960> lot

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I think sometimes forget there's a lot

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
I think sometimes forget there's a lot
happening<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.460> why<00:01:11.670> when<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> grab

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
happening here that's why when you grab

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240 
happening here that's why when you grab
it<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.590> leave<00:01:14.040> some

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it like this you know we leave some

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
it like this you know we leave some
moisture<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.600> built<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
moisture in here it's built into the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
moisture in here it's built into the
compost<00:01:16.740> sure<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.670> want<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.000> some

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
compost sure you want to have some

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
compost sure you want to have some
moisture<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.689> those<00:01:18.900> guys<00:01:19.110> could<00:01:19.380> stay<00:01:19.590> alive

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
moisture so those guys could stay alive

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.880 
moisture so those guys could stay alive
and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.090> want<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.780> add<00:01:22.049> food

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and then what we want to do is add food

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.340 
and then what we want to do is add food
to<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.430> pot<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.659> really<00:01:24.960> boost<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
to it when we pot to really boost the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.490 
to it when we pot to really boost the
activity<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.549> an<00:01:27.390> organic<00:01:27.810> granular

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
activity now we have an organic granular

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
activity now we have an organic granular
plant<00:01:29.070> food<00:01:29.369> Egham<00:01:29.790> ugh<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> blend<00:01:30.299> right

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
plant food Egham ugh and blend right

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
plant food Egham ugh and blend right
would<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.320> something<00:01:31.500> you'd<00:01:31.799> use<00:01:31.829> with

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
would that be something you'd use with

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.920 
would that be something you'd use with
this<00:01:32.369> yes<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.090> granular<00:01:33.509> chicken<00:01:33.840> manure

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this yes it's a granular chicken manure

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.569 
this yes it's a granular chicken manure
so<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.400> making

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
so what you do is you when you're making

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.550 
so what you do is you when you're making
your<00:01:35.820> pot<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> spring<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.200> mix<00:01:37.439> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
your pot up in the spring you mix it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.230 
your pot up in the spring you mix it
from<00:01:37.710> top<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> bottom<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:38.970> put<00:01:39.150> the
