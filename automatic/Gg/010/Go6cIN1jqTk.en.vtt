00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
just experience right now right now I'm

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.229 
just experience right now right now I'm
recording<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:36.019> 11pm<00:02:37.019> on<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:38.310> 12th<00:02:39.709> so

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
recording this it's 11pm on the 12th so

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.789 
recording this it's 11pm on the 12th so
that's<00:02:42.239> what<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.630> 13th<00:02:43.049> basically<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.620> that's

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
that's what the 13th basically so that's

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.449 
that's what the 13th basically so that's
18<00:02:44.400> days<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.910> get<00:02:45.000> 160<00:02:45.840> 170<00:02:46.320> more<00:02:46.680> subs<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.280> think

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
18 days to get 160 170 more subs I think
