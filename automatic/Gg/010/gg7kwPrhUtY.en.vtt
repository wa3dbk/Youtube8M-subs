00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
plenty bag these platypus bags don't

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.230 
plenty bag these platypus bags don't
give<00:01:03.280> off<00:01:03.489> any<00:01:03.730> flavor<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.770> they<00:01:05.770> make

bladders<00:01:07.240> two<00:01:07.450> backpacks<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:08.500> can<00:01:09.400> probably

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
bladders two backpacks I can probably

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.400 
bladders two backpacks I can probably
even<00:01:09.850> buy<00:01:10.120> an<00:01:10.300> adapter<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.900> make<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.080> regular

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
even buy an adapter and make a regular

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.950 
even buy an adapter and make a regular
party<00:01:11.770> bag<00:01:11.950> into<00:01:12.400> a<00:01:12.490> back<00:01:12.940> hand<00:01:13.360> away<00:01:13.540> black

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
party bag into a back hand away black

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.920 
party bag into a back hand away black
which<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.440> what<00:01:14.650> I'll<00:01:14.770> probably<00:01:14.800> do<00:01:15.280> but<00:01:15.930> in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
which is what I'll probably do but in

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.930 
which is what I'll probably do but in
the<00:01:17.260> meantime<00:01:17.530> they<00:01:17.950> may<00:01:18.100> put<00:01:18.340> some<00:01:18.550> solder

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
the meantime they may put some solder

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.340 
the meantime they may put some solder
and<00:01:19.030> this<00:01:19.180> one<00:01:19.360> let<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.630> soak<00:01:19.810> for<00:01:19.870> a<00:01:20.080> couple

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
and this one let it soak for a couple

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.320 
and this one let it soak for a couple
days<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.650> see<00:01:20.710> if<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:20.950> can't<00:01:21.220> get<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.580> bad

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
days and see if I can't get the bad

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.940 
days and see if I can't get the bad
things<00:01:22.690> out<00:01:22.900> of<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.110> but<00:01:23.230> I'm<00:01:23.380> thinking<00:01:23.800> if<00:01:23.860> it

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
things out of it but I'm thinking if it

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.560 
things out of it but I'm thinking if it
tastes<00:01:24.280> better<00:01:24.460> it's<00:01:24.970> got<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.240> be<00:01:25.330> something

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
tastes better it's got to be something

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.900 
tastes better it's got to be something
putting<00:01:26.080> something<00:01:26.350> bad<00:01:26.800> in<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.280> water<00:01:27.520> so

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
putting something bad in the water so

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.180 
putting something bad in the water so
I'll<00:01:28.780> probably<00:01:29.020> buy<00:01:29.320> an<00:01:29.470> adapter<00:01:29.740> for<00:01:30.130> my

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
I'll probably buy an adapter for my

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.310 
I'll probably buy an adapter for my
larger<00:01:30.820> plan<00:01:31.300> teabag<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.870> make<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.050> dual

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320
