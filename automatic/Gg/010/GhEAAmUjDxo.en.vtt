necessary<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.630> which<00:02:29.930> we<00:02:30.109> use<00:02:30.380> bar<00:02:30.920> chords<00:02:31.459> and

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
necessary to which we use bar chords and

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.120 
necessary to which we use bar chords and
I<00:02:31.700> try<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.000> explain<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.380> when<00:02:33.950> you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:03:00.220 
it is necessary to find the feeling it's
the<00:02:44.269> feeling<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:45.489> sixteenth<00:02:46.489> notes<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:59.230> the

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
permanently it goes down up yeah and

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.540 
permanently it goes down up yeah and
then<00:04:49.110> when<00:04:50.110> I<00:04:50.139> want<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.500> hit<00:04:50.590> these<00:04:50.800> notes<00:04:51.220> then

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
then when I want to hit these notes then

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:00.210 
then when I want to hit these notes then
I<00:04:51.580> hit<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.970> strings<00:04:57.720> I<00:04:58.720> want<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.080> do<00:04:59.229> this<00:04:59.380> this

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
I hit the strings I want to do this this

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.640 
I hit the strings I want to do this this
one<00:05:00.520> down<00:05:01.150> up<00:05:01.720> down<00:05:02.229> up<00:05:02.650> down<00:05:03.099> down<00:05:04.090> up<00:05:04.449> down<00:05:04.900> up

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
one down up down up down down up down up

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.050 
one down up down up down down up down up
down<00:05:05.889> down<00:05:06.460> up<00:05:07.240> down<00:05:07.630> up<00:05:08.409> down<00:05:08.610> when<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:09.639> take

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
down down up down up down when I take

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:23.880 
down down up down up down when I take
the<00:05:10.210> court<00:05:10.539> with<00:05:10.930> my<00:05:11.080> left<00:05:11.289> hand<00:05:11.409> and

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.880 

then<00:05:24.890> this<00:05:25.550> sounds<00:05:26.120> better<00:05:26.900> than<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.530> version

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
then this sounds better than the version

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.210 
then this sounds better than the version
with<00:05:28.220> C<00:05:28.670> but<00:05:29.540> it<00:05:29.690> is<00:05:29.720> not<00:05:30.080> exactly<00:05:30.290> what<00:05:30.890> I<00:05:30.920> want

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
with C but it is not exactly what I want

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.520 
with C but it is not exactly what I want
to<00:05:31.280> hear<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:31.760> now<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:31.970> next<00:05:32.420> step<00:05:32.690> is<00:05:32.870> do<00:05:35.530> you

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
to hear and now the next step is do you

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.850 
to hear and now the next step is do you
see<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:37.190> lift<00:05:38.150> of<00:05:38.420> my<00:05:38.630> fingers<00:05:39.490> when<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:41.290> play<00:05:42.290> the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
see I lift of my fingers when I play the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.300 
see I lift of my fingers when I play the
air<00:05:43.190> guitar<00:05:43.250> or<00:05:44.120> something<00:05:44.360> like<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:45.160> like<00:05:46.160> I

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
air guitar or something like that like I

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.250 
air guitar or something like that like I
would<00:05:46.460> call<00:05:46.910> it<00:05:47.090> yet<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.450> when<00:05:47.810> I<00:05:47.840> have<00:05:48.080> this

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
would call it yet and when I have this

00:05:48.260 --> 00:06:20.500 
would call it yet and when I have this
rhythm<00:06:16.900> first<00:06:17.900> idea<00:06:18.410> was<00:06:19.090> your<00:06:20.090> hand<00:06:20.330> goes

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
rhythm first idea was your hand goes

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.540 
rhythm first idea was your hand goes
down<00:06:20.810> up<00:06:20.990> all<00:06:21.169> the<00:06:21.290> time<00:06:21.530> then<00:06:22.100> you've<00:06:22.310> got

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
down up all the time then you've got

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:31.870 
down up all the time then you've got
this<00:06:22.669> rhythm<00:06:25.450> next<00:06:26.450> step<00:06:26.660> was<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:26.930> use<00:06:27.410> a<00:06:27.440> chord

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.580 

this<00:06:32.880> is<00:06:33.030> not<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.330> way<00:06:33.480> wanted<00:06:33.960> to<00:06:34.080> sump<00:06:34.350> we

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
this is not the way wanted to sump we

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.770 
this is not the way wanted to sump we
want<00:06:34.860> to<00:06:34.980> make<00:06:35.160> it<00:06:35.280> to<00:06:35.670> to<00:06:35.910> have<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.210> note

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
want to make it to to have the note

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.830 
want to make it to to have the note
shorter<00:06:37.350> then<00:06:37.980> whenever<00:06:38.730> I<00:06:39.030> hit<00:06:39.300> go<00:06:39.480> streams

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
shorter then whenever I hit go streams

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:59.650 
shorter then whenever I hit go streams
are<00:06:40.110> pressed<00:06:40.470> down<00:06:40.620> but<00:06:41.340> immediately<00:06:41.850> left

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660

hand is so important so if you play on

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.840 
hand is so important so if you play on
your<00:07:27.600> party<00:07:28.080> a<00:07:28.110> song<00:07:28.500> like<00:07:28.710> that<00:07:29.010> here<00:07:29.340> you

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850 
your party a song like that here you

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:36.140 
your party a song like that here you
must<00:07:30.450> really<00:07:30.930> see<00:07:31.440> that<00:07:31.980> when<00:07:32.250> you<00:07:32.400> play<00:07:35.150> tap

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
must really see that when you play tap

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.990 
must really see that when you play tap
their<00:07:36.390> feet<00:07:36.720> or<00:07:37.100> start<00:07:38.100> to<00:07:38.280> clap<00:07:38.490> their<00:07:38.730> hands

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 
their feet or start to clap their hands

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.930 
their feet or start to clap their hands
and<00:07:39.300> when<00:07:39.510> that<00:07:39.900> reaction<00:07:40.290> is<00:07:40.560> there<00:07:40.920> then<00:07:41.820> you

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 
and when that reaction is there then you

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.420 
and when that reaction is there then you
see<00:07:42.180> you<00:07:42.360> on<00:07:42.480> the<00:07:42.630> right<00:07:42.780> track

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 
see you on the right track

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.260 
see you on the right track
imagine<00:07:44.430> you<00:07:44.520> start<00:07:44.850> to<00:07:44.940> play<00:07:47.120> there's<00:07:48.120> no

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.270 
imagine you start to play there's no

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.760 
imagine you start to play there's no
reaction<00:07:48.570> when<00:07:48.870> for<00:07:49.080> example<00:07:49.110> you<00:07:49.530> may<00:07:49.740> be

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:49.770 
reaction when for example you may be

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.670 
reaction when for example you may be
played<00:07:50.220> wrong

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.490 

so<00:07:53.680> when<00:07:54.130> it<00:07:54.250> is<00:07:54.370> unclear<00:07:54.940> and<00:07:55.270> nobody<00:07:56.200> knows

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:56.500 
so when it is unclear and nobody knows

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.760 
so when it is unclear and nobody knows
the<00:07:57.010> rhythm<00:07:57.340> then<00:07:57.910> you<00:07:58.150> can<00:07:58.540> be<00:07:58.660> sure<00:07:58.960> hmm

00:07:59.760 --> 00:07:59.770 
the rhythm then you can be sure hmm

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.420 
the rhythm then you can be sure hmm
maybe<00:08:00.670> I<00:08:00.970> should<00:08:01.510> sit<00:08:01.900> down<00:08:01.930> in<00:08:02.410> my<00:08:02.470> little

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:03.430 
maybe I should sit down in my little

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.520 
maybe I should sit down in my little
room<00:08:03.730> and<00:08:03.970> practice<00:08:04.660> again<00:08:04.990> yeah
