00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.280
 I swear I will not do that, but 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.180
 Okay. 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 The vine leaves his head? 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.720
 do you see? For this reason, never give up 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.760
 No joke, we have more than a million names for incubation. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.660
 We call it 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.400
 And my lover because it is this 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.600
 * Read the question angrily * 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440
 * The question is long * 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.340
 Dan shakes his head 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.040
 Start!!! I will not answer your question! Start! 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.260
 I do not know. I do not know where the baby ninja 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.280
 Punch 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.240
 No! You are amazing 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.620
 You're betting! Mutual. 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.460
 You bet, to turn on the danko 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.440
 a hit! 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.280
 here we are! Oh Jargl I refuse 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.280
 Why? Why do you do this? Why? I do not even understand 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.280
 Uh, I'll have to go with Luke and Sky Walker 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.380
 Well I will be forced to do things 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.220
 Like 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.420
 Crazy things like one of these see 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.780
 Dan comes out of his legs 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.120
 Shoufun this? 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.100
 screaming 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.440
 This has dire consequences 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.940
 This 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.660
 Explosion 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.220
 You do not want to get this, then 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920
 That's why you do not do things and I will not 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.420
 OK? 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.600
 Why? 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.960
 Words .... of life by them 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.140
 Ah, oh, ohh, this is late 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 I'm already here 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.540
 But I think I'm fine, I do not think there are velociraptors around us or anything 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.780
 Things are perfect 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.020
 * Sound splitting * 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.780
 Oh no 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.660
 No, it can not be! 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.940
 Oh no, it's veloci-crap-tor 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.400
 Oh, I understood the hand of this coward 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.900
 Funny 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.960
 Funny 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.960
 Take a bite 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.380
 And delicious 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.240
 Do you speak gazelle or money? 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 The sound of a cat 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.220
 Certainly, a man. I love you, it's wonderful. 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.280
 Thanks. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.360
 I would never say with a small and busy shi 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.960
 Start with something you already want to learn 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.360
 And make the idea for the video about it 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.320
 Such as the Devil's distorted face 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 I made a full video just about that effect 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.400
 It was really good and I finished it several times because of it 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.200
 This is a good example of starting with a small idea and making it great 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.520
 Well, because of that, if this is the way you want this good 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.080
 Voice breaks 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.340
 Sure, brother! No one is saying this right now 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.140
 Look at this 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.180
 Crazy right? 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.920
 Oh, thank you very much 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.840
 It will not be enjoyed 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.920
 Mohaaha! 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.800
 I do not know why I laughed so ... 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.700
 Its shape is, in reality, appalling 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.180
 He says there is no way to understand this 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.460
 This is a good time to introduce myself 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.900
 My name is Chris and I'm generous enough to put a translation into this video. You can find me in the description box 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.580
 Or no, that would be strange 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.500
 For me, the disco was shaken all the time 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.760
 I have an answer to this 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.180
 Become a Utopar 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.180
 Wonderful. Oh, you even have a counter 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.220
 Ummm 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.780
 There is nothing else to see 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.660
 Ooh. This was colorful 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.600
 I leave you with a last thing 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.480
 Dan needs to shoot more videos 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.960
