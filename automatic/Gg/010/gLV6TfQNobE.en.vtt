00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.330
 ah ah 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.880
 I did not let go of Geneva steak launched 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.590
 but as soon as I made the move 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.660
 heads I looked at the sky saying that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.700

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.170
 that he is proud in ten years who are my 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.040
 real land that will be the first to me 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.410

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.590

 candle of wind did it I confess 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.699
 to throw too much sin but who will come 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.949
 stop me from doing all this 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.960
 somehow I want to avoid hell 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.730
 everything I did I'm not proud of it 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.379
 three months I'll make my mother smile 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.250

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.780
 parlor 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.850

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.620

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.670
 binary lighting thrown like a wolf 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 lonely to stop it's the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.519
 mower that will be the best of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.320
 sleeping pills I'm not going to do the head to do 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.270
 the party in front of the tests is not the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 flask I wear in me scars of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.810

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.580
 bottom of the chasm and to sell off like 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.690

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.940

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.560
 what separates us from what unites us 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.380
 very few friends in truth and I take 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.390

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.220
