00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
beads around the photo like this then

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.870 
beads around the photo like this then
you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.700> take<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> minute<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:43.549> just<00:01:44.549> check

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you can take a minute to just check

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.539 
you can take a minute to just check
check<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.229> they're<00:01:46.380> even<00:01:46.590> give<00:01:47.340> them<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
little push wherever they might need to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.810 
little push wherever they might need to
be<00:01:51.060> straightened<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:53.520> we'll<00:01:53.670> let

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
be straightened out and then we'll let

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
be straightened out and then we'll let
that<00:01:53.850> dry<00:01:54.060> next<00:01:54.899> we're<00:01:55.049> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> put<00:01:55.590> the
