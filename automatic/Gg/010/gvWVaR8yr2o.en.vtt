00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.330 
so I remember most of this game being
pretty<00:01:17.810> easy<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.469> go<00:01:18.619> through<00:01:18.920> because<00:01:19.070> you

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
pretty easy to go through because you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.190 
pretty easy to go through because you
know<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.549> obviously<00:01:19.939> have<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.630> normal

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
difficulty then you had the difficult

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.270 
difficulty then you had the difficult
difficulty<00:01:24.140> which<00:01:24.350> was<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.920> original

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
difficulty which was the original

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.100 
difficulty which was the original
difficulty<00:01:26.240> in<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> Japanese<00:01:27.079> version

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110
