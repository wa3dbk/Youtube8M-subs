00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.190 

and<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.670> go

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
and there we go

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.249 
and there we go
what<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.649> a<00:01:22.680> full<00:01:23.009> case<00:01:24.110> let's<00:01:25.110> just

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
what you see is a full case let's just

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.249 
what you see is a full case let's just
open<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.680> real<00:01:26.009> quick<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:27.079> little<00:01:28.079> bit<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
open that up real quick a little bit of

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.090 
open that up real quick a little bit of
dust<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.680> yeah<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:30.350> little<00:01:31.350> bit<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> plastic

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
dust on yeah a little bit of a plastic

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.910 
dust on yeah a little bit of a plastic
so<00:01:32.760> we<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.180> take<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.450> PSU<00:01:33.870> go<00:01:34.080> out<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so we can do is take the PSU go out of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.020 
so we can do is take the PSU go out of
my<00:01:35.580> other<00:01:35.729> case<00:01:37.010> I'll<00:01:38.010> just<00:01:38.340> kind<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.729> hard<00:01:38.940> to
