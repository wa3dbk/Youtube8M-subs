00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.970
 Welcome people to the physical channel 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.800
 higher 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 I'm Fernando, and today we are 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.570
 let's solve an exercise using the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.369
 chain, the problem is that the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.910
 land is roughly equivalent to one 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.470
 sphere with 6.37 from the 10 to 6 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.449
 meters and ends and letter a 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.199
 earth circumference kilometers 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.029
 letter B 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.070
 the surface area of ​​the earth in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.529
 square kilometers and letters and the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.930
 volume of land in cubic kilometers 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.559
 so let's first convert this ray 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 of land for miles since he gave 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.290
 in meters 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:48.590
 the radius reported that several 6.37 since the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.590
 10 high sixth meters 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.860
 Let's do the chain conversion and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:02.010
 we know that one kilometer 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:03.180
 equals 10 to the third mex or 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.890
 one thousand meters 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.400
 that's equal to what we have now is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 simplify the meter by 1 meter and 1 10 by 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.220
 cube with 6 ac left over here 3 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:24.830
 therefore we have that the ray of the earth 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:27.829
 worth 6.37 times 10 to cube maps 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.170
 now let's calculate the circumference 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.450
 that he asks in the item he says aquino 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.369
 problem that even the approximate form of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.600
 a sphere then we know that the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.600
 sphere circumference equals 2 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.570
 this here is equal to 2 since sofia 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:58.770
 3.14 times the radius we calculate in 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:02.990
 kilometers that is 6.37 10 to cube that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.990
 then gives us a value of approximately 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.890
 42 10 the fourth kilometers 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.830
 in letter b 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.750
 it loses the surface area of ​​the earth 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.910
 in square kilometers 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.260
 let's use the area of ​​the circumference nodes 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.580
 we know either the circumference is 4 pe r 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.300
 squared 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:38.600
 this is equal to four times 3.14 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:45.870
 times the radius which is 6.37 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:52.500
 those 10 to cube to square four 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:59.940
 times 3.14 times 6.37 squared gives us 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.010
 the value of 40.50 and eight times 10 to the cube 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 squared the tip camus the exponents 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.620
 so we got ten 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:16.100
 on Friday and this equals 5.10 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:19.740
 from ten to eight kilometers 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.310
 square now in the letters he 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.350
 orders volume up to cubic kilometers 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.100
 so let's use the volume of the sphere 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:35.700
 volume of the sphere equal to four rise 3 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:42.780
 er to cube 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:52.260
 this is equal to 4 over three times 3.14 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:54.780
 of 6,37 10 to the cube raised to the cube and 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.680
 taking all this term to the cube 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:08.340
 we arrive at the following expression four 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:12.230
 thirds of them 3.14 times 6 87 cube in the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.230
 gives the value of 258 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:25.640
 gauge 47 and o should the hub lead to the hub 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.450
 that there are 32 39 times 10 the ninth 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.820
 this is the same 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:37.080
 now four times 3.14 and 258-b 47 and 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:42.920
 the result dividing by three gives us a 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:49.130
 value of one thousand and 82 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.130
 of these 10 to nona the volume km of your 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.240
 so this is it if you want to watch 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.800
 video lesson complete with others 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.560
 solved exercises 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.270
 access our channel meeting go to class 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.400
 about change of units 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.760
 A hug to everyone until the next class. 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.760
 bye
