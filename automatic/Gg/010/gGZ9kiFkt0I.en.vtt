00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.280
 in 2014 multiplayer spintires so for 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.920
 start downloading steam client 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 register new account this is mine mine 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.170
 games old account not paying attention 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 this is a new account clean one person 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 only well, there's nothing here at all 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.980
 further download these two files it will be 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.689
 the link in the setup description I set 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.850
 pause for now 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.660
 will come to the point so already here 88 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:46.649
 percent 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:51.390
 wait 100 percent run yes further 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.050
 further further further update on that topic 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.460
 Hall old version just create a shortcut 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:03.600
 Further installation is very fast and so 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.840
 we can wait 488 megabytes in total 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840
 only 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.120
 we wait 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.860
 most importantly steam should be new and 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.450
 that is, I immediately say because if 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.770
 old steam will not work and need 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.490
 ask questions why don't i 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.090
 works 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.860
 the most important thing was to have a new steam 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.180
 this is the game that I threw off 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:48.380
 and it is that multiplayer increasingly from 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:50.680
 nothing is required of you waiting for us five 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.330
 percent all 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:00.040
 setting make everything now go to 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.910
 the root folder of the game is our computer 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.660
 systems in my files still purchase pent 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.190
 spintires and 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.410
 shut down and then opens again but 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.880
 so he opens the second this file 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:23.049
 spontaneity and now just from here 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:29.299
 we throw in folders here 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:33.890
 yes yes that's all our game is ready now 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:36.670
 we can go away calmly and figure delete 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.910
 and run the game 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.760
 prove that it works all show how 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.190
 see now the gto icon will appear here 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.239
 what we went to type through the style so sounds 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.239
 so I turned off so 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.010

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.159
 see got access to the steam community 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.450
 during the game so we are all the incentive of the incentive 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.459

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.980
