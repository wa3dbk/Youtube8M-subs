00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.490
 hello I'm june from meetings euro 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:14.360
 not today as her network mesh 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.540
 For example, you can crochet her 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.630
 the shopping network needs it all 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.150
 simply because actually you only do 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.750
 strong stitches pulled out 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.939
 become 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.420
 the problem if you use the spice 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.029
 Power is that the mesh normally 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.100
 not all the same length or it will be 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.100
 it's pretty exhausting right now 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.550
 so we help ourselves 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.300
 a little remedy what it is in 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.309
 every household gives 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.410
 you can choose what you want for it 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.260
 it uses for example 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.940
 Cooking spoon is a bit thicker 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.789
 pencil it is also a ruler 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.550
 depending on what you take will be yours 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:08.119
 mesh longer or shorter depending on 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:10.690
 which extent has which object so 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:16.030
 i use the pencil 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:19.039
 you have finished the ground and now 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.069
 you take the thread as normal as 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.940
 if you wanted to crochet tight stitches and 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:30.590
 you just take the pen behind you 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.280
 the working phases then you put all 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.280
 normal 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.929
 and the fan 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.489
 That's important over the pencil 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.080
 you bring the thread through quite normal 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:47.239
 pulls the whole that is at the first 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.530
 I fly round a little bit 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.920
 circumstances might need a bit 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.630
 look threadbare and then see 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.080
 there something like it again a 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:04.160
 Stinging thread is above the pencil 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:10.039
 were through pick and the two stitches 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.740
 off a stab were to get through 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.499
 and wash it off and it was in principle 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.909
 even if you 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:21.849
 you made a few stitches 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:25.329
 or reasonably made the 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.819
 pencil is full then pushes 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.670
 her just the stitches 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.750
 The finished behind the pencil 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.799
 down and then you have front again 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.299
 space for the next stitches 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.700
 in the first round you have to take care 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.939
 if you go around the corners you can do it 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.739
 see here as might have the 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.709
 pencil out too soon 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.689
 pull if he is not completely crochet 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.739
 is because you are otherwise bad for the 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.689
 turns and the stitches in the 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.819
 Length does not mean they will not 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:05.469
 right from the top so best then 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.230
 just before the curve ever 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:11.290
 take off and on the pencil at the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.069
 bend and then it goes here completely 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.069
 normal continue 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.000
 if you have the first row and the second 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.610
 row comes then you have to take care 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.060
 that you really only crochet the crochet 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.560
 this is caught in upper rows of loops 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.910
 especially difficult in the first row 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.220
 as I do not have to say now but you have to 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.769
 take special care because you can 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.390
 you see this well this is the loops 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.340
 lie relatively close together 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.790
 The easiest way is if you just 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.829
 really the first row times short 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.250
 pulls then could namely see how the 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:58.780
 knots slip down here and then 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.700
 it really only stays up here 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.700
 only the loops left in her 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.440
 after a sting and you have to run 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.900
 just not dangerous that he is somewhere deep 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:15.790
 get in and the bend after 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:19.120
 not really pulling apart like this 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.750
 you can see her well that knotted 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.010
 contract and in between the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.180
 elongated meshes that net 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.180
 character 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.550
 I wish you a lot of fun while working 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.550
 and see you next time
