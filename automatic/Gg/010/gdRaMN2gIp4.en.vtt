you<00:02:05.189> pull<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> down<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.540> really<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.930> can

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
you pull it down so really you can

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.350 
you pull it down so really you can
practice<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.590> practice<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.550> turning<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
practice this practice just turning it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.020 
practice this practice just turning it

around like this while it's clamped

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.820 
around like this while it's clamped
so<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.780> can<00:02:13.900> get<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.050> motion<00:02:14.500> down<00:02:14.650> really

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830
