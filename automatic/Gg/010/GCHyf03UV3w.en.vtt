basically this method will work all year

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.300 
basically this method will work all year
round<00:00:27.750> because<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.980> fact

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
round because we know for a fact

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.429
