 I sell it there for example 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.010
 ten dollars and all my competitors 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 sell it for ten dollars and i have 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
 Here is such a small profit for me 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 such a small margin is not on anything 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.890
 everything is not good for me 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.560
