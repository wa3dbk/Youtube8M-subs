00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
change coolant on a Subaru WRX so the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.909 
change coolant on a Subaru WRX so the
first<00:00:05.940> thing<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.660> take<00:00:06.930> off<00:00:07.109> your<00:00:07.319> coolant

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
first thing is to take off your coolant

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:17.689 
first thing is to take off your coolant
filler<00:00:08.130> neck<00:00:08.840> cap<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:17.070> then<00:00:17.369> what<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.550> want

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
filler neck cap and then what you want

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.400 
filler neck cap and then what you want
to<00:00:17.760> do<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.940> locate<00:00:18.119> your<00:00:18.390> drink<00:00:18.960> which<00:00:19.199> is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to do is locate your drink which is

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.029 
to do is locate your drink which is
on<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> passenger<00:00:20.250> side<00:00:20.400> below<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> car<00:00:22.039> so

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
on the passenger side below the car so

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.410 
on the passenger side below the car so
what<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> want<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.910> turn<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
what you want to do is turn that

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660 
what you want to do is turn that
counterclockwise<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> coolant<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
counterclockwise to get the coolant to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.140 
counterclockwise to get the coolant to
come<00:00:26.820> out<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.800> what<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> would<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.490> take<00:00:29.939> off

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
come out and what I would do is take off

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.830 
come out and what I would do is take off
the<00:00:30.449> actual<00:00:30.869> core<00:00:31.199> cap<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.800> well<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.750> then

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the actual core cap as well and then

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240 
the actual core cap as well and then
after<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.350> drained<00:00:37.739> take<00:00:38.070> your

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
after that's all drained take your

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
after that's all drained take your
reservoir<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.390> push<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> tab

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
reservoir out so you just push that tab

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.470 
reservoir out so you just push that tab
there<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.739> push<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.280> resort<00:00:42.000> forward<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
there and push the resort forward and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.069 
there and push the resort forward and
you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.570> pull<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:43.670> at<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.539> point<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you can pull it out at this point what I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.250 
you can pull it out at this point what I
would<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.469> after<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.430> sure<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
would do after that is make sure that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.709 
would do after that is make sure that
you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.350> everything<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.010> put<00:00:50.850> back<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
you know everything is put back in the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.439 
you know everything is put back in the
way<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.110> before<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:53.670> we'll<00:00:54.300> get

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
way it was before and then we'll get

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.500 
way it was before and then we'll get
ready<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.870> fill<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.350> core<00:00:55.800> back<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.510> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
ready to fill the core back up and you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.639 
ready to fill the core back up and you
know<00:00:57.629> fill<00:00:58.020> everything<00:00:58.350> back<00:00:58.469> up<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
know fill everything back up so the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.560 
know fill everything back up so the
person<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.460> take<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.969> coolant

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
person you want to do is take a coolant

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
person you want to do is take a coolant
conditioner<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.080> put<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.619> Subaru<00:01:05.369> Coors

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
conditioner and put that in Subaru Coors

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
conditioner and put that in Subaru Coors
are<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.510> sensitive<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
are a little bit sensitive to the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
are a little bit sensitive to the
minerals<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> chlorine<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.580> water<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
minerals and chlorine in water so the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
minerals and chlorine in water so the
conditioner<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:10.950> helps<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> prevent

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
conditioner actually helps to prevent

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210 
conditioner actually helps to prevent
the<00:01:12.270> core<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:12.689> breaking<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.740> definitely<00:01:14.070> put

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the core from breaking so definitely put

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
the core from breaking so definitely put
that<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.670> you're<00:01:14.760> changing<00:01:15.180> you're

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that in when you're changing you're

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.219 
that in when you're changing you're
doing<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> full<00:01:16.229> change<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:16.799> coolant<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
doing a full change in your coolant and

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.100 
doing a full change in your coolant and
then<00:01:19.229> fill<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.799> core<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.509> way<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
then fill up the core all the way is the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.670 
then fill up the core all the way is the
first<00:01:22.320> thing<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.619> do

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.430 

and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:32.340> basically<00:01:32.580> top<00:01:33.150> off<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.840> coolant

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
and then basically top off the coolant

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.210 
and then basically top off the coolant
filler<00:01:34.710> neck<00:01:34.980> and<00:01:35.990> also<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.370> put<00:01:38.900> put

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
filler neck and also you know put put

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.050 
filler neck and also you know put put
coolant<00:01:41.220> into<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.760> reservoir<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:44.060> so

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
coolant into the reservoir as well so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.460 
coolant into the reservoir as well so
after<00:01:45.330> that<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.140> is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
after that what you want to do is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.700 
after that what you want to do is
basically<00:01:47.430> turn<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> engine<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.480> race<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
basically turn the engine on and race it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.300 
basically turn the engine on and race it
under<00:01:50.100> two<00:01:50.310> thousand<00:01:50.760> five<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:52.080> six<00:01:52.320> times<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
under two thousand five to six times and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.660 
under two thousand five to six times and
then<00:01:54.300> basically<00:01:55.100> what<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.220> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.400> do<00:01:56.520> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
then basically what you want to do is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.610 
then basically what you want to do is
turn<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.940> engine<00:01:57.150> off<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.630> let<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.140> wait<00:01:58.380> for

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
turn the engine off and let it wait for

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.880 
turn the engine off and let it wait for
about<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.800> minute<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> after<00:02:00.840> that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
about a minute and so after that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
about a minute and so after that
basically<00:02:01.890> keep<00:02:02.160> doing<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.640> until<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
basically keep doing that until the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.520 
basically keep doing that until the
coolant<00:02:03.810> level<00:02:04.080> stays<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.830> same<00:02:05.040> level<00:02:06.530> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
coolant level stays the same level and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.930 
coolant level stays the same level and
then<00:02:07.619> basically<00:02:07.890> after<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:08.760> you<00:02:08.820> want

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
then basically after that what you want

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
then basically after that what you want
to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.270> turn<00:02:09.510> your<00:02:09.570> heater<00:02:09.990> all<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.410> way<00:02:10.500> up

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
to do is turn your heater all the way up

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.630 
to do is turn your heater all the way up
and<00:02:10.830> keep<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> blower<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.910> low<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.430> just<00:02:14.430> make

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and keep the blower on low and just make

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.630 
and keep the blower on low and just make
sure<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.880> your<00:02:15.360> fans<00:02:16.010> are<00:02:17.010> still<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.490> working

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
sure that your fans are still in working
