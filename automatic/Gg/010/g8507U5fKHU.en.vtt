00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.150
 found in made you and chips number 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.370
 3 I'm going to show you how to draw 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.889
 degraded so this video will risk you 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 look a little bit simple compared 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.580
 to others you are used to seeing 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.160
 on my channel but it is above all a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.480
 video to show you especially the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.220
 gradient technique 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.470
 so I still hope it's okay 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.160
 to please and go we start everything 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.630
 right away so first of all first 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.000
 degraded I will show you how 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 make with colored pencils 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.390
 so here I am going to make you a gradient 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700
 all are pink 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.219
 so in the beginning the essential thing is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 to really really support with your 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.360
 pencil and as you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.570
 actually move forward you have to press 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.820
 less and less with the hand up 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.410
 what in the end in the end there is almost 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.410
 more colors on the sheet 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.870
 in Switzerland that I advise you to do 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.880
 it is to take a simple handkerchief 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.530
 or a cotton swab I find that with the 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.720
 crayons a handkerchief it's 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.760
 much more efficient for flute and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.830
 your gradients or faded if you 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.390
 prefer and to give it an effect 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.030
 much prettier is a lot more 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.920
 clear 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.509
 then second gradient so here I go 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.810
 you make a gradient with several 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.430
 colors so finally that is to say we're going 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.080
 make a mostly yellow gradient 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.229
 so I start with a yellow color 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.180
 very clear and little by little I'm going 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.950
 incorporate more and more colors 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.050
 hot to give really 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.479
 the intensity has risen grade and so the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.899
 I use a yellow a little more 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.729
 golden a bit more gold go for it 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.789
 the device at the beginning I really support 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.020
 strong and as I go 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.789
 I release a little pressure on 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.500
 my wrist so that it's really 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.500
 more and more clear 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.070
 now I use an orange and there I 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.150
 go less and less advanced so that 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.700
 the intensity is really marked at 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.500
 level of the edge of the crush and finally I 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.200
 finish with a bit a little bit 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.310
 chocolate so the device you see that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.310
 I do not go all the way 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.390
 and the same with a handkerchief gesture homps 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.700
 all for a little bit of mixing 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.300
 colors between them and give an appearance 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.100
 much more beautiful with gradients 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.740
 now i'm going to show you a little 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.540
 degraded very simple with a crime so 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.340
 the criterium as you can know 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.650
 I already wanted to say in another video 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.630
 it is the pencil of paper that I use 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.390
 most often for my drawings I am 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.310
 really comfortable with 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.240
 with this tool so simply by 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.220
 against what I advise you to do 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.120
 it's to train yourself first with a 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.860
 normal hb pencil because it's not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.710
 obvious to dose at the beginning when we 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.540
 do not really master the criterium 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.100
 the intensity of the mine because we 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.250
 risk of really pressing too hard 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.320
 hills at risk not go back 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.739
 the effect we want to forgive so that's 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.200
 the same 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.730
 at the beginning you support very strongly aside 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.180
 and gradually when we have 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.770
 arrived in the middle or after 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.660
 your gradient you press less and 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.400
 less strong so here I decided to you 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.739
 make a small square to show you 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.690
 a little what it gives and the same 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.790
 with a little tone I come blurred 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.170
 all unfortunately is optional I 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.050
 wanted to add a little light 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.540
 so with an eraser you erase 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.730
 where the view of the light and 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.390
 then you come to blur everything with 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.390
 a cotton swab 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.610
 now i'm going to show you how 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.830
 coloring little things all 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.450
 simple so that's above all for 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.700
 to train you 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.070
 it's really a good thing to do 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.769
 so here I decided to draw you a 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.480
 little ring so it's really a 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.670
 little fake thing but it's really 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.260
 to show you how to apply 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.780
 this technique in any 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.050
 little drawing so here it's the same I 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.930
 also starts with the edges so 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.950
 always very strong in the edges and this 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.580
 that I advise you it's always 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.890
 this is a white zone 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.660
 for just the light to be reflected 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.580
 in the other drawing and that it gives a 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.390
 much more much more real effect 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.700
 so here I went on a blue of 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.390
 navy blue color and then you 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.560
 go see I'm going to use a blue 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.560
 clear a little further 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.090
 the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.430
 so I come now with my blue 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.199
 clear and it's the same I go overflow and 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.699
 I always leave this white area 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.159
 and as could be seen it gives 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.680
 really intensity is a lot 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.840
 more colors to the drawing I find that 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.580
 much prettier so there do not hesitate 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.169
 to have fun at you can even 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.819
 add a third color if you 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.909
 want but there I found that with two 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.379
 colors it was already not bad and 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.389
 Then I will show you another 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.370
 little example so here again really a 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.840
 example boat but it was the first 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.520
 thing that came to mind so 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.400
 I decided to draw a little 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.900
 simple flower and in fact there the goal 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.800
 is to practice your coloring 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.690
 petals so there do not hesitate to do 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.219
 as you see fit 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.680
 unleash your creativity imagination 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.370
 have fun really it's done for 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.650
 to train you 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.800
 so the first cracking decided on the 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.169
 to do in pink entirely whose same 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.580
 years and I apply the technique at all 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.689
 first gradient that I showed you 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.949
 at the beginning of video so the same 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.680
 progressively less support 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.960
 less strong etc and we can come football and 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.789
 the doubs with a cotton swab if you want 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.810
 or a handkerchief 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.259
 then second petals in the 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.460
 separated I use a purple and I 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.460
 leave some light in the middle 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.900
 and 3rd petals I decided to apply the 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.730
 color gradient technique with 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.970
 several killers so I start with 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.290
 a young pale cleric and we wish 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.480
 gradually I put colors 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.480
 hot all around 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.780
 and that's what it gives to the result 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.780
 final 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.180
 so this video is now 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.070
 finished it was a video a little bit 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.020
 different from what I'm used to 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.610
 do you play there I hope you still 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.800
 that it will have you more than that you will have 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.180
 been useful it's above all a video 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.410
 technical 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.450
 do not hesitate to tell me in comment 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.670
 if you liked it and I find you 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.000
 very quickly in an upcoming video 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.000
 ciao
