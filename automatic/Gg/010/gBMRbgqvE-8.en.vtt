00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.069 
me here like I walked down into it
that's<00:02:43.040> why<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.190> fired<00:02:43.459> early<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.970> knew<00:02:44.840> he<00:02:44.989> would

should just ran away there that was not
a<00:03:13.230> good<00:03:13.470> time<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:14.190> sit<00:03:14.370> there<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.730> try

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
a good time to sit there and try

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.520 
a good time to sit there and try
shooting<00:03:15.150> long<00:03:15.420> distance<00:03:15.810> nights<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.230> mean<00:03:16.410> not

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
shooting long distance nights I mean not

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.600 
shooting long distance nights I mean not
that<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.830> won't<00:03:16.950> work<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:17.400> does<00:03:17.580> work

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
that it won't work it does work

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.600 
that it won't work it does work
occasionally<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.480> not<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:20.160> time<00:03:20.400> that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
occasionally but not that time that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.180 
occasionally but not that time that
definitely<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.000> not<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> time<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:22.190> so

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.250 
out to a bunch of buildings here and
we're<00:03:26.520> actually<00:03:26.550> kind<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.810> choppers<00:03:28.140> on

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
we're actually kind of the choppers on

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.620 
we're actually kind of the choppers on
the<00:03:28.319> ground<00:03:28.560> doing<00:03:29.040> their<00:03:29.160> thing<00:03:29.370> hopefully

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.180 

we're<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.720> decent<00:03:34.110> spot<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.560> try<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:34.920> help<00:03:35.040> you
