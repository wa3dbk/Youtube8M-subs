 episode is today I'll bring one to gameplay 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.890
 with a secret character game 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.420

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.550
 characters are watching there 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.250
 the first thing as I do to 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.230
 Release this character in the game is well 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.000
 Simple folks, it's very simple, I'm not saying. 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.850
 but if you decided my walkthrough and 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.730
 Will you be able to use it with certainty? 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.079
 any character is of the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.840
 any common character that already comes in 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.079
 game you must complete all stages 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.870
 of the game 100% is 100% goals between 10 and 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.940
 100 per cent of missions and 100 per cent 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.890
 money you have collected at each stage 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.300
 with this it will release what goes 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.209
 release the opa come back here will release the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.399
 clothes number two the right character who 

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:19.060
 You closed the game and consequently 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.920
 will release the sergipe is off road that 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.479
 I took the liberty is that of the one father 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.330
 little already because I think it comes well 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.890
 bad if we say so right up to 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.380
 release another phase that I do not like 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.039
 play in that first or Houston is 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.450
 cool but remembered argued and hangar 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.860
 so I want to show you one 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.720
 little maneuvers of this character 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.250
 so let's get it put here in the mode 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.250
 free skateboard let's play a little bit of 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.800
 hangar which is one of your favorite messages 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.619
 It was a samba for you as he is. 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.069
 I also want to show how it is in the game. 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.929
 to the maneuvers of this character 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.030
 Ok, then let me get some of the 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.679
 special skateboard for those who do not know the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.390

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.739
 who wishes to practice this is a 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.660
 great way the difference is that there is no 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:10.300
 How do you post us? 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.120
 event to maneuver there , and after 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.760
 you start the other will go again to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.900
 guys then we get the special face 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.700
 he is optimistic not wanting to 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.300
 The first special one that has standard is 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.020
 slide 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.020
 this here is your deposition 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.550
 that is, he kneels by the hand 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.400
 on the back income position is to do 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.470
 here you only see the other one. 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.630
 strike position here here 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.090
 I can not not sing here 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.410
 he picks it up and lets say a lot of skateboarding 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.760
 as if it were a fan supporter not 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:57.510
 Let's negotiate the right word for 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.510
 so do it over here 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:08.710
 I want to make over the ramp that 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:11.080
 It's nice to see it right, right? 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:16.260
 special that he has is flip that is 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.910
 that I had seen him then I kind of 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.430
 run on skate well 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.150
 interesting to also do because upon 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.590
 if you can better this character who is a 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.110
 of the characters and creed game 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.959
