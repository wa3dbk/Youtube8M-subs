either<00:02:41.640> horizontally<00:02:42.640> or<00:02:42.670> vertically<00:02:43.599> and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
either horizontally or vertically and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.559 
either horizontally or vertically and
actually<00:02:45.340> makes<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.579> nice<00:02:45.730> complement<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.450> the

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
actually makes a nice complement to the

large wheels for some time now but

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.789 
large wheels for some time now but
here's<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.090> great<00:02:55.359> example<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.200> 30-inch

comes<00:03:03.819> another<00:03:04.120> issue<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.659> that's<00:03:04.870> how<00:03:05.109> to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
comes another issue and that's how to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.520 
comes another issue and that's how to
stop<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.950> bike<00:03:06.549> with<00:03:06.879> a<00:03:06.909> big<00:03:07.209> wheel<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.900> with

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
stop a bike with a big wheel and with

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.979 
stop a bike with a big wheel and with
that<00:03:08.680> we've<00:03:08.950> designed<00:03:09.609> and<00:03:10.120> engineered<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.780> new

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
that we've designed and engineered a new

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.569 
that we've designed and engineered a new
16-inch<00:03:11.859> rotor<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:13.720> will<00:03:13.989> give<00:03:14.200> you

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
16-inch rotor that will give you

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.380 
16-inch rotor that will give you
increased<00:03:15.579> braking<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.709> also<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:18.099> new<00:03:18.760> brake

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
increased braking and also a new brake

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.860 
increased braking and also a new brake
system<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.349> actually<00:03:20.530> takes<00:03:21.040> two

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
system that actually takes two

four-piston<00:03:22.870> calipers<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.530> mounts<00:03:24.099> it<00:03:24.220> on

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
four-piston calipers and mounts it on

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.000 
four-piston calipers and mounts it on
the<00:03:24.459> left<00:03:24.700> side<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.299> wheel<00:03:25.739> which<00:03:26.739> gives

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
the left side of the wheel which gives

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.420 
the left side of the wheel which gives
you<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.340> same<00:03:27.639> results<00:03:28.599> as<00:03:28.690> having<00:03:29.049> dual

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
you the same results as having dual

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:40.980 
you the same results as having dual
