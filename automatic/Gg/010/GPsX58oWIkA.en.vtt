really truly get lost in the mail it
does<00:03:37.640> happen<00:03:37.880> but<00:03:38.360> not<00:03:38.480> often<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.950> can

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
does happen but not often so you can

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.580 
does happen but not often so you can
take<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.150> percentage<00:03:41.570> some<00:03:41.930> very<00:03:42.200> tiny

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
take that percentage some very tiny

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.330 
take that percentage some very tiny
percentage<00:03:42.950> something<00:03:43.490> goes<00:03:44.710> wrong<00:03:45.710> but<00:03:46.130> when

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
percentage something goes wrong but when

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.280 
percentage something goes wrong but when
you<00:03:46.460> do<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.670> thousand<00:03:47.300> shipments<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:47.930> would<00:03:48.050> say

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
you do a thousand shipments I would say

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.080 
you do a thousand shipments I would say
at<00:03:48.650> least<00:03:48.910> two<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.210> four<00:03:50.240> their<00:03:50.840> issues<00:03:51.350> with

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
at least two to four their issues with

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.350 
at least two to four their issues with
so<00:03:53.090> maybe<00:03:53.300> a<00:03:53.390> point<00:03:53.810> two<00:03:54.710> percent<00:03:54.950> chance<00:03:55.520> that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
so maybe a point two percent chance that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.760 
so maybe a point two percent chance that
you<00:03:56.570> will<00:03:56.690> have<00:03:56.840> an<00:03:56.990> issue<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.530> but<00:03:57.680> have

you will have an issue of it but have

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.590 
you will have an issue of it but have
you<00:03:57.920> still<00:03:58.100> have<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.310> calculate<00:03:58.550> that<00:03:58.820> has<00:03:59.270> a

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
you still have to calculate that has a

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.220 
you still have to calculate that has a
cost<00:04:00.530> right<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:02.150> whole<00:04:02.330> deal<00:04:02.630> going<00:04:03.020> wrong

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
cost right the whole deal going wrong

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.140 
cost right the whole deal going wrong
and<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.650> you're<00:04:04.010> out<00:04:04.280> fees<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:04.820> all<00:04:04.970> that

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
and you you're out fees and all that

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.270 
and you you're out fees and all that
stuff

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
stuff
