Bradshaw<00:00:03.929> outdoors<00:00:14.299> in<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.900> area<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.320> was

Bradshaw outdoors in the area that I was
fishing<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.070> video<00:00:17.430> there's<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> lot<00:00:18.359> of

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
fishing in this video there's a lot of

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.929 
fishing in this video there's a lot of
submerged<00:00:19.080> timber<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> knew<00:00:20.430> getting<00:00:20.670> hung

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
submerged timber so I knew getting hung

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.240 
submerged timber so I knew getting hung
up<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> risk<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:24.590> was<00:00:25.590> pretty<00:00:25.740> sure<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.010> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
up was a risk I was pretty sure that I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.990 
up was a risk I was pretty sure that I
had<00:00:26.460> hung<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.939> hook<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:28.340> some<00:00:29.340> timber<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
had hung the hook up some timber and a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.470 
had hung the hook up some timber and a
branch<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.740> it<00:00:31.740> didn't<00:00:31.980> feel<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.279> was

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
branch and it didn't feel like it was

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.209 
branch and it didn't feel like it was
coming<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> started<00:00:34.469> paddling<00:00:34.680> towards

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
coming out so I started paddling towards

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
coming out so I started paddling towards
it<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.820> could<00:00:36.380> get<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.440> better<00:00:37.590> angle

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it to see if I could get a better angle

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:48.330 
it to see if I could get a better angle
on<00:00:38.129> it

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.900 

as<00:00:48.430> I<00:00:49.150> pedaled<00:00:49.360> closer<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.050> hangup<00:00:50.470> I<00:00:50.910> saw

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
as I pedaled closer to the hangup I saw

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.210 
as I pedaled closer to the hangup I saw
a<00:00:51.970> flash<00:00:52.330> of<00:00:52.510> green<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.840> realized<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:53.980> there

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
a flash of green and realized that there

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.420 
a flash of green and realized that there
was<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.610> bass<00:00:54.940> on<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.270> other<00:00:55.450> end<00:00:55.630> of<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.870> hook

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
was a bass on the other end of the hook

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.890 
was a bass on the other end of the hook
and<00:00:57.430> what<00:00:57.580> became<00:00:57.700> apparent<00:00:58.180> was<00:00:58.480> that<00:00:58.630> manure

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
and what became apparent was that manure

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.780 
and what became apparent was that manure
wasn't<00:00:59.290> hung<00:00:59.440> out<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.860> was<00:01:00.010> my<00:01:00.160> line<00:01:00.370> that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
wasn't hung out that was my line that

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.570 
wasn't hung out that was my line that
was<00:01:00.970> wrapped<00:01:01.330> around<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.750> branch<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.410> as<00:01:03.340> it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
was wrapped around the branch and as it

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.850 
was wrapped around the branch and as it
was<00:01:03.670> wrapped<00:01:03.850> on<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.059> branch<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.869> basset<00:01:05.710> come

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
was wrapped on the branch a basset come

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.609 
was wrapped on the branch a basset come
by<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.250> taking<00:01:06.760> hold<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.150> my<00:01:07.240> worm<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:07.810> must

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
by and taking hold of my worm and must

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.440 
by and taking hold of my worm and must
have<00:01:08.740> got<00:01:08.860> itself<00:01:09.160> hooked<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:12.270> tried<00:01:13.270> all

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
have got itself hooked I tried all

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.270 
have got itself hooked I tried all
different<00:01:13.600> kinds<00:01:13.900> of<00:01:14.110> angles<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.860> try<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.100> get

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
different kinds of angles to try to get

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.969 
different kinds of angles to try to get
my<00:01:15.400> line<00:01:15.610> free<00:01:16.090> but<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:17.200> seemed<00:01:17.530> like<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:17.860> was

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
my line free but it seemed like it was

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.590 
my line free but it seemed like it was
wrapped<00:01:18.190> around<00:01:18.340> multiple<00:01:18.850> times<00:01:19.150> because<00:01:19.390> it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
wrapped around multiple times because it

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.469 
wrapped around multiple times because it
wasn't<00:01:19.930> giving<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.729> after<00:01:21.850> tightening<00:01:22.300> the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
wasn't giving so after tightening the

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.510 
wasn't giving so after tightening the
drag<00:01:22.780> all<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.050> way<00:01:23.350> sticking<00:01:24.190> my<00:01:24.220> pole

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
drag all the way sticking my pole

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.630 
drag all the way sticking my pole
underwater<00:01:25.800> cutting<00:01:26.800> my<00:01:26.890> hands<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.310> little<00:01:27.399> bit

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
underwater cutting my hands a little bit

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.749 
underwater cutting my hands a little bit
by<00:01:27.820> pulling<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.240> braid<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:29.610> realized<00:01:30.610> they

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
by pulling the braid I realized they

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.370 
by pulling the braid I realized they
didn't<00:01:30.970> have<00:01:31.090> anything<00:01:31.330> like<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.080> broom<00:01:32.350> handle

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
didn't have anything like a broom handle

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.450 
didn't have anything like a broom handle
or<00:01:33.009> any<00:01:33.190> type<00:01:33.399> of<00:01:33.690> anything<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.899> wrap<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
or any type of anything to wrap the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.340 
or any type of anything to wrap the
braid<00:01:36.460> around<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:37.060> get<00:01:37.180> some<00:01:37.390> leverage<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.320> I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
braid around to get some leverage so I

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.389 
braid around to get some leverage so I
saw<00:01:38.830> my<00:01:38.979> anchor<00:01:39.280> cleat<00:01:39.580> and<00:01:41.220> figured<00:01:42.220> why<00:01:42.369> not

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
saw my anchor cleat and figured why not

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.840 
saw my anchor cleat and figured why not
wrap<00:01:42.789> it<00:01:42.940> around<00:01:43.030> there<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.800> good<00:01:44.800> 10<00:01:45.070> times<00:01:45.369> and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
wrap it around there a good 10 times and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.440 
wrap it around there a good 10 times and
just<00:01:46.420> used<00:01:46.869> my<00:01:47.050> paddle<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.640> break<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.270> line

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
just used my paddle to break the line

00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:14.860 
just used my paddle to break the line
free

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.240 

I<00:02:17.290> was<00:02:18.290> fishing<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> lightest<00:02:19.069> your

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
I was fishing with the lightest your

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.770 
I was fishing with the lightest your
head<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.489> had<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.180> then<00:02:20.239> happened<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.599> be<00:02:20.690> the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
head I had and then happened to be the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.930 
head I had and then happened to be the
last<00:02:20.959> one<00:02:21.230> in<00:02:21.349> my<00:02:21.470> box<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.549> hang-up

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
last one in my box and this hang-up

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.149 
last one in my box and this hang-up
occurred<00:02:23.360> within<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.170> first<00:02:24.409> 20<00:02:24.739> minutes<00:02:24.769> of

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
occurred within the first 20 minutes of

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.399 
occurred within the first 20 minutes of
my<00:02:25.310> fishing<00:02:25.700> outing<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.269> figured<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.290> would

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
my fishing outing and figured it would

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.899 
my fishing outing and figured it would
be<00:02:27.440> key<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.890> any<00:02:27.980> success<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.700> were<00:02:28.819> to

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
be key to any success that I were to

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.490 
be key to any success that I were to
have<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.239> leg<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.930> kind<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.230> wanted<00:02:30.409> to

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
have on that leg so I kind of wanted to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:52.320 
have on that leg so I kind of wanted to
get<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.739> back

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.910 

Wow

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
Wow

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:13.840 
Wow
got'em

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.390 

I<00:03:13.940> tied<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.720> off<00:03:14.990> a<00:03:15.020> ton<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.650> times<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.280> my

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
I tied it off a ton of times to my

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.290 
I tied it off a ton of times to my
anchor<00:03:18.040> my<00:03:19.040> anchor<00:03:19.490> seat<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:19.880> then<00:03:19.970> just<00:03:20.120> kept

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
anchor my anchor seat and then just kept

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.490 
anchor my anchor seat and then just kept
paddling<00:03:20.810> in<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:20.990> bunch<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.230> different

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
paddling in a bunch of different

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.450 
paddling in a bunch of different
directions<00:03:21.980> until<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.430> finally<00:03:22.640> busted<00:03:22.970> free

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
directions until it finally busted free

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.920 
directions until it finally busted free
because<00:03:25.460> you<00:03:25.610> can't<00:03:25.820> pull<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:26.480> cuts<00:03:26.690> into

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
because you can't pull it like cuts into

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.770 
because you can't pull it like cuts into
your<00:03:27.050> skin<00:03:27.880> some<00:03:28.880> people<00:03:29.120> bring<00:03:29.300> like<00:03:29.480> logs

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
your skin some people bring like logs

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.640 
your skin some people bring like logs
that<00:03:30.260> they<00:03:30.320> can<00:03:30.530> tie<00:03:30.710> them<00:03:30.860> around<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.430> then<00:03:31.580> I

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
that they can tie them around and then I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.600 
that they can tie them around and then I
didn't<00:03:33.650> have<00:03:33.770> anything<00:03:33.950> but<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.250> saw<00:03:34.490> this

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
didn't have anything but I saw this

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.280 
didn't have anything but I saw this
anchor<00:03:34.970> seat<00:03:35.210> figured<00:03:35.720> I'd<00:03:35.840> give<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:35.960> a<00:03:36.050> try<00:03:36.260> I

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
anchor seat figured I'd give it a try I

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.390 
anchor seat figured I'd give it a try I
think<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.620> might<00:03:36.740> have<00:03:36.830> straighten<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.250> hook

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
think it might have straighten the hook

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.340 
think it might have straighten the hook
but<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:38.380> didn't<00:03:39.380> Wow<00:03:40.990> wrapped<00:03:41.990> around<00:03:42.110> this

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
but I didn't Wow wrapped around this

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:54.570 
but I didn't Wow wrapped around this
tree<00:03:42.740> branch<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.580> lot<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:44.000> times<00:03:47.350> yeah

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.270
