hello everyone I finally finished my
self<00:00:03.750> destructing<00:00:04.380> programmable<00:00:05.040> walk<00:00:06.140> I'm

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
self destructing programmable walk I'm

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.709 
self destructing programmable walk I'm
going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.379> show<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.010> off<00:00:08.130> right<00:00:08.280> now<00:00:08.630> so<00:00:09.630> as

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
going to show that off right now so as

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.940 
going to show that off right now so as
you<00:00:09.750> can<00:00:09.870> see<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> correct<00:00:10.650> code

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
you can see with the correct code

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.730 
you can see with the correct code
entered<00:00:11.370> i<00:00:11.580> push<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.240> button<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:13.559> door

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
entered i push this button the door

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.060 
entered i push this button the door
opens<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:15.020> push<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.170> again<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> door<00:00:16.619> closes

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
opens I push it again the door closes

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.529 
opens I push it again the door closes
and<00:00:18.470> actually<00:00:19.470> inside<00:00:19.830> also<00:00:20.390> there's<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and actually inside also there's a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
and actually inside also there's a
button<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.830> from<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> inside<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.670> open<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
button so from the inside I can open and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750 
button so from the inside I can open and
close<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.390> well<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.160> go<00:00:26.160> through<00:00:26.340> here<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
close as well and go through here and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.670 
close as well and go through here and
you<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.180> programmable<00:00:27.930> switches<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
you can see the programmable switches I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
you can see the programmable switches I
moved<00:00:29.580> them<00:00:29.760> from<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.240> wall<00:00:30.420> because<00:00:30.630> then<00:00:30.720> I

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
moved them from this wall because then I

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.880 
moved them from this wall because then I
realized<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.349> put<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> redstone<00:00:31.679> torch

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
realized you just put a redstone torch

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.500 
realized you just put a redstone torch
on<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> other<00:00:32.399> side<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.239> switches

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
on the other side and see which switches

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.880 
on the other side and see which switches
were<00:00:33.719> programmed<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.440> now<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> kind<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
were programmed on so now the kind of

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.020 
were programmed on so now the kind of
isolated<00:00:35.250> from<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> outside<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.000> going

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
isolated from the outside so I'm going

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
isolated from the outside so I'm going
to<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.239> ahead<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.500> show<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.739> happens

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to go ahead and show you what happens

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
to go ahead and show you what happens
when<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.270> enter<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> wrong<00:00:42.750> code<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
when you enter the wrong code in so

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.060 
when you enter the wrong code in so
let's<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.739> ahead<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.890> close<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.280> door<00:00:46.070> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
let's go ahead and close the door so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.240 
let's go ahead and close the door so
let's<00:00:47.340> say<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.789> am<00:00:47.969> flip<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.450> letter<00:00:49.250> I'm

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
let's say I am flip this letter I'm

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.680 
let's say I am flip this letter I'm
going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> push<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> button<00:00:50.910> i<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.120> i<00:00:51.480> get

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
going to push the button i get i get

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
going to push the button i get i get
three<00:00:52.110> tries<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> third<00:00:53.070> incorrect

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
three tries and on the third incorrect

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.330 
three tries and on the third incorrect
try<00:00:54.410> water<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.590> flow<00:00:55.739> down<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.070> one

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
try water will flow down so that's one

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.500 
try water will flow down so that's one
try<00:00:58.129> two<00:00:59.129> tries

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.249 

three<00:01:03.140> tries<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:04.460> now<00:01:05.000> if<00:01:05.180> everything<00:01:05.600> yep

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
three tries and now if everything yep

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.600 
three tries and now if everything yep
there<00:01:06.740> we<00:01:06.890> go<00:01:07.040> waters<00:01:07.729> flowing<00:01:08.060> down<00:01:09.490> let<00:01:10.490> you

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
there we go waters flowing down let you

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.710 
there we go waters flowing down let you
no<00:01:10.790> longer<00:01:10.970> open<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.479> door<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:14.570> basically

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
no longer open the door and so basically

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.969 
no longer open the door and so basically
what<00:01:15.110> this<00:01:15.229> is<00:01:15.409> done<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:16.780> by<00:01:17.780> room<00:01:18.680> around<00:01:18.830> here

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
what this is done is by room around here

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.680 
what this is done is by room around here
the<00:01:19.220> top<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.610> walk<00:01:19.820> things<00:01:20.390> got<00:01:20.570> pretty

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
the top of the walk things got pretty

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.070 
the top of the walk things got pretty
ugly<00:01:20.899> really<00:01:21.409> fast<00:01:21.500> up<00:01:21.979> here<00:01:22.840> but<00:01:23.840> just<00:01:23.990> the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
ugly really fast up here but just the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.630 
ugly really fast up here but just the
same<00:01:24.110> water<00:01:24.500> circuit<00:01:24.860> from<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.190> stretch<00:01:25.490> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
same water circuit from this stretch and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:37.180 
same water circuit from this stretch and
walk<00:01:26.409> up<00:01:27.409> there<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:29.740> fix<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:31.009> real<00:01:31.430> quick<00:01:36.190> so

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
walk up there and fix this real quick so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.919 
walk up there and fix this real quick so
basically<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.580> way<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:37.819> works<00:01:38.060> because

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
basically the way this works because

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.960 
basically the way this works because
I've<00:01:39.200> taken<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.500> couple<00:01:39.679> of<00:01:39.890> influence<00:01:40.280> one

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
I've taken a couple of influence one

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.760 
I've taken a couple of influence one
input<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.539> incorrect<00:01:45.200> lock

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
input is this is the incorrect lock

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.219 
input is this is the incorrect lock
input<00:01:46.280> coming<00:01:46.580> through<00:01:46.819> here<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:47.990> lock

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
input coming through here so if the lock

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.520 
input coming through here so if the lock
is<00:01:48.259> fed<00:01:48.799> or<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.819> is<00:01:49.940> not<00:01:50.119> correct<00:01:50.539> this<00:01:51.289> is

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
is fed or is it is not correct this is

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.520 
is fed or is it is not correct this is
on<00:01:51.679> and<00:01:52.360> this<00:01:53.360> input<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.929> button<00:01:54.140> inputs

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
on and this input is the button inputs

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.050 
on and this input is the button inputs
opa-locka<00:01:54.860> zinc<00:01:55.310> right<00:01:55.459> from<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.700> button<00:01:55.940> is

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
opa-locka zinc right from the button is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.149 
opa-locka zinc right from the button is
pressed<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.539> goes<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.170> gate<00:01:57.440> which

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
pressed it goes to this and gate which

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.680 
pressed it goes to this and gate which
feeds<00:01:58.399> into<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.670> pulse<00:01:58.940> generator<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.630> the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
feeds into a pulse generator and the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.399 
feeds into a pulse generator and the
pulse<00:02:00.440> generator<00:02:00.709> I<00:02:00.799> get<00:02:01.990> signs<00:02:02.990> here<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.289> help

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
pulse generator I get signs here to help

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.499 
pulse generator I get signs here to help
me<00:02:03.500> out<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.850> first<00:02:05.060> pulse<00:02:05.360> in

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
me out is this is the first pulse in

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.600 
me out is this is the first pulse in
this<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.869> second<00:02:06.200> pulse<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:07.340> first

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
this is the second pulse and the first

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.110 
this is the second pulse and the first
pulse<00:02:07.849> will<00:02:08.119> go<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.360> try<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.979> open<00:02:09.979> up<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.819> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
pulse will go to try to open up this and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.260 
pulse will go to try to open up this and
gate<00:02:12.640> over<00:02:14.650> over<00:02:15.650> here<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.760> second<00:02:17.090> post

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
gate over over here and the second post

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.380 
gate over over here and the second post
will<00:02:17.510> set<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.840> RS<00:02:18.170> nor<00:02:18.379> latch<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:20.300> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
will set this RS nor latch and so the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.520 
will set this RS nor latch and so the
first<00:02:20.599> pulse<00:02:20.810> will<00:02:20.930> try<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.110> open<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.410> and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
first pulse will try to open it and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.990 
first pulse will try to open it and
because<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.129> first<00:02:22.340> time<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.610> goes<00:02:22.730> through

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
because the first time it goes through

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.670 
because the first time it goes through
this<00:02:23.599> will<00:02:23.780> be<00:02:23.870> off<00:02:23.989> so<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:24.349> won't<00:02:24.470> go

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
this will be off so this won't go

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830 
this will be off so this won't go
through<00:02:24.980> but<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> second<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.390> second<00:02:26.690> post

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
through but the second the second post

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.030 
through but the second the second post
comes<00:02:27.080> along<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.349> turns<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.709> normal

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
comes along and turns on the normal

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
comes along and turns on the normal
latch<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:29.780> means<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.110> second<00:02:30.500> time

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
latch and so that means the second time

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.699 
latch and so that means the second time
I<00:02:30.950> hit<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.000> button<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:33.110> comes<00:02:33.379> over<00:02:33.560> here

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
I hit the button this comes over here

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.259 
I hit the button this comes over here
and<00:02:33.739> goes<00:02:34.040> through<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.610> gate<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.060> sets

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
and goes through the and gate and sets

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.199 
and goes through the and gate and sets
this<00:02:35.540> RS<00:02:35.900> nor<00:02:36.110> latch<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.910> at<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.000> same<00:02:38.150> time

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
this RS nor latch and at the same time

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.110 
this RS nor latch and at the same time
the<00:02:38.810> original<00:02:39.140> button<00:02:39.319> signal<00:02:39.620> comes<00:02:39.800> around

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
the original button signal comes around

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.119 
the original button signal comes around
first<00:02:41.120> hits<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.349> so<00:02:42.470> once<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.890> end

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
first hits that and so once this end

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.030 
first hits that and so once this end
that<00:02:43.310> goes<00:02:43.489> go<00:02:44.060> through<00:02:44.269> here<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.040> basically

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
that goes go through here and basically

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.290 
that goes go through here and basically
does<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:48.739> know<00:02:48.830> 43<00:02:49.640> presses<00:02:50.060> when

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
does that to you know 43 presses when

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.610 
does that to you know 43 presses when
three<00:02:50.480> persons<00:02:50.750> have<00:02:50.840> completed<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.379> comes

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
three persons have completed it comes

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.890 
three persons have completed it comes
out<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.489> am<00:02:52.970> gate<00:02:53.209> here<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.750> goes<00:02:53.870> up

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
out of the am gate here and it goes up

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.470 
out of the am gate here and it goes up
here<00:02:54.379> and<00:02:54.560> goes<00:02:54.769> over<00:02:54.920> here<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.550> triggers<00:02:56.390> the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
here and goes over here and triggers the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.839 
here and goes over here and triggers the
water<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.920> probably<00:02:58.040> not<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.400> best<00:02:58.459> way<00:02:58.700> to

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
water it's probably not the best way to

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:59.979 
water it's probably not the best way to
do<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.480> only<00:02:59.629> way<00:02:59.690> I<00:02:59.720> could<00:02:59.840> really

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
do it it's the only way I could really

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.869 
do it it's the only way I could really
figure<00:03:00.200> out<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.500> do<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.650> I'm<00:03:01.489> not<00:03:01.640> very<00:03:01.760> good

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
figure out and do it I'm not very good

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.360 
figure out and do it I'm not very good
at<00:03:02.030> like<00:03:02.379> squashing<00:03:03.379> things<00:03:03.739> do<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:03.950> space

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
at like squashing things do a space

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.680 
at like squashing things do a space
efficient<00:03:04.760> way<00:03:04.849> right<00:03:05.090> now<00:03:05.120> because<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> lot<00:03:05.659> of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
efficient way right now because a lot of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.720 
efficient way right now because a lot of
the<00:03:05.810> wires<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.620> run<00:03:06.769> really<00:03:07.730> long<00:03:07.879> distances

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the wires that run really long distances

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.240 
the wires that run really long distances
Peters<00:03:09.379> so<00:03:10.379> maybe<00:03:10.680> I'll<00:03:10.830> improve<00:03:11.010> upon<00:03:11.190> that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
Peters so maybe I'll improve upon that

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.880 
Peters so maybe I'll improve upon that
later<00:03:11.519> but<00:03:11.730> right<00:03:11.790> now<00:03:11.940> I'm<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.680> very<00:03:13.680> glad

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
later but right now I'm just very glad

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.630 
later but right now I'm just very glad
this<00:03:14.040> took<00:03:14.190> me<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.489> day<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:15.239> finish<00:03:16.640> but

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
this took me like a day to finish but

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.490 
this took me like a day to finish but
not<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.330> fixed<00:03:18.810> all<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.080> have<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.319> do

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
not that it's fixed all you have to do

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.440 
not that it's fixed all you have to do
really<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:21.030> inside<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:22.230> repair<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:23.209> go<00:03:24.209> into

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
really the inside to repair this go into

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.990 
really the inside to repair this go into
the<00:03:24.540> service<00:03:24.870> door<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:26.640> these<00:03:26.790> two

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
the service door and just these two

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.550 
the service door and just these two
little<00:03:27.120> things<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.750> I've<00:03:27.870> damaged<00:03:28.170> now<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
little things that I've damaged now the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.949 
little things that I've damaged now the
door<00:03:28.739> opens<00:03:28.980> again<00:03:29.450> all<00:03:30.450> right<00:03:30.569> thank<00:03:30.780> you

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
door opens again all right thank you

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.470 
door opens again all right thank you
very<00:03:31.140> much<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.290> watching
