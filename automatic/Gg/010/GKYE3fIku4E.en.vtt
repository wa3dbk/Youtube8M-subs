00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.680 
and place it in the game world to save
time<00:02:01.250> I'll<00:02:01.490> quickly<00:02:01.790> place<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.180> few<00:02:02.479> more

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
time I'll quickly place a few more

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.690 
time I'll quickly place a few more
throughout<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.080> map<00:02:03.410> now<00:02:06.490> let's<00:02:07.490> give<00:02:07.670> it

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
throughout the map now let's give it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:17.680 
throughout the map now let's give it
another<00:02:07.910> test<00:02:08.240> run<00:02:16.060> when<00:02:17.060> building<00:02:17.270> tracks

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
another test run when building tracks

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.570 
another test run when building tracks
doing<00:02:18.170> these<00:02:18.290> test<00:02:18.590> runs<00:02:18.860> should<00:02:19.100> occur<00:02:19.340> often

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
doing these test runs should occur often

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.940 
doing these test runs should occur often
after<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.630> test<00:02:20.959> run<00:02:21.170> we<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.709> tune<00:02:21.920> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
after a test run we can tune the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.370 
after a test run we can tune the
obstacles<00:02:22.610> we've<00:02:22.790> placed<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.330> add<00:02:24.050> or<00:02:24.230> remove

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
obstacles we've placed and add or remove

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.200 
obstacles we've placed and add or remove
obstacles<00:02:24.860> as<00:02:25.280> needed

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.580 

now<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.360> we've<00:02:30.480> got<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> basic<00:02:31.080> driving<00:02:31.440> line

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
now that we've got a basic driving line

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.440 
now that we've got a basic driving line
is<00:02:31.770> some<00:02:31.920> obstacles<00:02:32.430> all<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.940> remains<00:02:33.300> is

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
is some obstacles all the remains is

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.449 
is some obstacles all the remains is
placing<00:02:33.840> some<00:02:34.020> checkpoints<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.920> general

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459

rule<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:36.090> more<00:02:36.120> checkpoints<00:02:36.600> replace<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
rule the more checkpoints replace the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.740

better any area with a short law between

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
obstacles is a great place for

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.430 
obstacles is a great place for
checkpoints<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.600> good<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:42.990> as<00:02:43.200> few

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
checkpoints and it's good to have as few

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
checkpoint placement will greatly

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.560 
checkpoint placement will greatly
improve<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.870> playability<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.500> our<00:02:52.770> track<00:02:53.040> at

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
improve the playability of our track at
