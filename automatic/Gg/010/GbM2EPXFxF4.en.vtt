00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:13.539
 imagine a world without man that is 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.030
 which you would miss the most nothing it serves 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:21.120
 nothing will be peace sales the Eden 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.120
 may be trafolle to Eden a man 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.350
 reached then what is it to me 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.590
 would lack strength 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.280
 that's the strength, that's all 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:39.329
 that's all so that's not the day 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:41.429
 to ask me this question beats all 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.219
 not touch for me it's a balance 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.839
 men and women is a balance 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.579
 that's all it misses the other reason 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:54.579
 sex yes yes it's true massa too 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.409
 a helmet others we can do everything we 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.409
 same 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:04.030
 yes really no need but everything happened 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.520
 complementary past how do you want 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.880
 that it does not miss I would miss a 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.350
 leg it would be no worse so that's it 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.799
 would Paul be a little bit to himself 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.360
 to rest ben it's like a world without 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.970
 Sun 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.310
 1 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.930
 a boat bath without sail and then 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.930
 especially without a bench a good bet 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:41.750
 what will i miss yonu you have 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:47.030
 of these questions the difference precisely 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.930
 confronted the difference for for 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:59.000
 appreciate what we are 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:02:03.500
 here as a woman here are the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.820
 to leave here it's the sharing the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.740
 difference and complementarity 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.930
 this is like in the world of 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.270
 animals the little men are always 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.410
 removed because we just need one 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.220
 for 21 women to do sex is 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.870
 alas little baby so after but 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.870
 not for another day I was thinking now 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:33.200
 aggressive reason too soon 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 love that's it yeah exactly the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.260
 same thing but there are some who listen 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.700
 so my life is like hockey 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.700
 next my question 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.319
 a world without women I do not know 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.440
 many things a lot 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.780
 yes but what is there a billion 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.520
 things so which one to identify premium 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.590
 first but when I see right in front 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.720
 of me already I say the smile we can 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.620
 not live without women and for the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.840
 children everywhere it's sincere 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.850
 it's a good life already for me it's 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.370
 unimaginable 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.989
 a world without women it is already not a 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.340
 world 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.239
 it must look like something 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:27.560
 anything then what me 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:33.530
 would miss women the woman all her 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:38.570
 sensitivity its presence for the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.350
 dishes clean all that stuff 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:47.420
 that it comes to stir in the bottom of the man 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.430
 indispensable besides the kitchen the 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.570
 household 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.549
 so obviously not cooking because 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.380
 it's my domain so it does not matter 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.380
 trust but no I have not everything 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.150
 and the beauty of the woman not there I speak 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.200
 no beauty dummy case no no 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.200
 no inner beauty 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:17.030
 the temple that she opens to the desires of 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:21.049
 the man but good but half red gpat 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:27.710
 the woman who did not read my opinion because 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:30.500
 than to wait a month I went early 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.990
 romantic teenage legend six years to 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.530
 Moscow oscillates time hear in a 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.660
 it's nice no but it's true 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.890
 I can not imagine it's impossible 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.890
 excuse me but have no choice 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:56.980
 love then comes true and especially 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.670
 without my wife who is there no no I do not 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.710
 can not consider it 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.000
 good it would make a world a little uniform 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.210
 still it would not be very funny no 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.290
 more would not be that I will kill myself 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.740
 what is it going to happen if we 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.930
 had the choice 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.930
 ah well i was turning into shape then 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.340
 cut it's all it's a question 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.230
 it was the opportunity for the microphone 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.230
 sidewalk that's all but if the awesome
