there we were messing around and we

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.590 
there we were messing around and we

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
found out if you dolphin dive at each

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.420 
found out if you dolphin dive at each
other<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.109> actually<00:00:25.289> get<00:00:25.740> into<00:00:26.010> this

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
other you can actually get into this

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.210 
other you can actually get into this
weird<00:00:26.730> little<00:00:26.970> barrier<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.220> very

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
weird little barrier over here and very

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
weird little barrier over here and very
similarly<00:00:29.849> over<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.840> also<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.289> go

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
similarly over here you can also just go

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.720 
similarly over here you can also just go
a<00:00:31.410> little<00:00:31.500> bit<00:00:31.650> further<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.160> dolphin<00:00:32.489> dive

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
a little bit further and dolphin dive

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.250 
a little bit further and dolphin dive
and<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.360> into<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.690> pretty<00:00:33.840> cool<00:00:33.960> barrier

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and get into this pretty cool barrier

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.360 
and get into this pretty cool barrier
it's<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> really<00:00:34.590> nice<00:00:34.710> hiding<00:00:34.950> spot<00:00:35.130> I'd<00:00:35.250> have

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
it's a really nice hiding spot I'd have

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.010 
it's a really nice hiding spot I'd have
to<00:00:35.430> recommend<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:35.910> try<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.390> it'd<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
to recommend you go try it's it'd be a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.970 
to recommend you go try it's it'd be a
little<00:00:37.200> bit<00:00:37.320> risky<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.620> search-and-destroy

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
little bit risky and search-and-destroy

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.770 
little bit risky and search-and-destroy
but<00:00:38.399> i<00:00:38.430> think<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.820> would<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.600> best

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
but i think that would be the the best

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.020 
but i think that would be the the best
game<00:00:39.960> mode<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.260> hide<00:00:40.440> from<00:00:40.829> or<00:00:41.160> maybe<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
game mode to hide from or maybe you do a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
game mode to hide from or maybe you do a
little<00:00:42.120> hidden<00:00:42.540> masters<00:00:42.960> thing<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.260> TDM

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
little hidden masters thing in TDM

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
little hidden masters thing in TDM
that'd<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.770> pretty<00:00:43.860> cool<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.760> come<00:00:44.910> over

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that'd be pretty cool if you come over

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.340 
that'd be pretty cool if you come over
here<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:45.840> descending

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
here you just do the little descending

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.690 
here you just do the little descending
tactical<00:00:46.710> insertion<00:00:46.800> glitch<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.579> have

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
tactical insertion glitch all you have

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
tactical insertion glitch all you have
to<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.360> keep<00:00:48.539> edging<00:00:48.840> your<00:00:48.930> way<00:00:49.050> off<00:00:49.200> until

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
to do is keep edging your way off until

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.369 
to do is keep edging your way off until
you<00:00:50.070> fall<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.539> tactical<00:00:51.840> insertion<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you fall and your tactical insertion is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.869 
you fall and your tactical insertion is
still<00:00:52.559> hanging<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> edge<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.550> then

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
still hanging on to the edge and then

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639 
still hanging on to the edge and then
you<00:00:54.180> shoot<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.809> hold<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> arty<00:00:55.379> button

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
you shoot and hold the arty button

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
you shoot and hold the arty button
before<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.070> fall<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.809> you'll<00:00:57.809> basically

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
before you fall and you'll basically

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.299 
before you fall and you'll basically
just<00:00:58.260> keep<00:00:58.379> following<00:00:58.530> Thea<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.160> death

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
just keep following Thea the death

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
just keep following Thea the death
barrier<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.670> actually<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.239> high<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.510> for

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
barrier is actually pretty high up for

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.270 
barrier is actually pretty high up for
this<00:01:01.109> map<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> won't<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:01.980> able<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> fall

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this map so you won't be able to fall

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
this map so you won't be able to fall
for<00:01:02.460> too<00:01:02.579> long<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.000> pretty<00:01:03.239> cool<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> do

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
for too long but it's pretty cool to do

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
for too long but it's pretty cool to do
if<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.320> come<00:01:04.470> over<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.680> by<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> domination

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
if you come over here by a domination

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
if you come over here by a domination
you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.270> jump<00:01:06.479> off<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.900> ledge<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.290> get

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you can jump off of this ledge and get

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.020 
you can jump off of this ledge and get
onto<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.710> barrier<00:01:08.010> however<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> jump<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
onto this barrier however if you jump it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.250 
onto this barrier however if you jump it
all<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.390> knock<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> off<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
all it will knock you off but it's a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.200 
all it will knock you off but it's a
pretty<00:01:10.409> cool<00:01:10.560> spot<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.610> temporarily<00:01:11.970> do

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
pretty cool spot just to temporarily do

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.760 
pretty cool spot just to temporarily do
it<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.619> very

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.920 
the a flag however if you throw it more
to<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> right<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.790> will<00:02:32.910> kill<00:02:33.120> enemies<00:02:33.480> more

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
to the right it will kill enemies more

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.479 
to the right it will kill enemies more
towards<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> center<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.860> flag<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.310> just

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
towards the center of the a flag so just

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.670 
towards the center of the a flag so just
take<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.640> into<00:02:35.910> consideration<00:02:36.440> we<00:02:37.440> couldn't

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
take that into consideration we couldn't

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.020 
take that into consideration we couldn't
find<00:02:37.799> one<00:02:37.890> for<00:02:38.099> B<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.640> distance<00:02:38.940> is

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
find one for B because the distance is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.270 
find one for B because the distance is
too<00:02:39.090> great<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:39.930> found<00:02:40.140> two<00:02:40.410> really<00:02:41.010> handy

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280
