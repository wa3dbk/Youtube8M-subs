using<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:02.329> common<00:03:02.720> style<00:03:02.959> system<00:03:03.170> instead<00:03:03.440> of

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
using the common style system instead of

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.559 
using the common style system instead of
a<00:03:03.590> guest<00:03:03.829> book<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:04.340> people<00:03:05.269> can<00:03:05.390> leave<00:03:05.540> a

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
a guest book is that people can leave a

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.170 
a guest book is that people can leave a
comment<00:03:06.019> for<00:03:06.170> each<00:03:06.500> like<00:03:07.220> article<00:03:07.760> or<00:03:07.879> post
