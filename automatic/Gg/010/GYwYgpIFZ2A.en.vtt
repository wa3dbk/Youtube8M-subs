00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 today I make you an award-winning 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.740
 a cheesecake 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.300
 on stopper with raspberry and white chocolate 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.300
 I do n't like it 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.029
 today I make the cheesecake for four 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.220
 persons and exact quantities will be one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.020
 at the bottom of the video with the description 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.009
 I'll write you down 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.009
 grocery list 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.070
 yes cheesecake goes very much of course 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.850
 duller, so with cream cheese 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.070
 we have mascarpone we have snake will 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 put some powdered sugar through and white 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.350
 chocolate then we have the raspberry and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 so now normally go on top 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.089
 Anna is upside-down so we do and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.129
 crumbled at the bottom 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.930
 Bastogne cakes and that you get the tens 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.360
 need to get it firm we go 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 the gelatin in cold water is 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.629
 then it doesn't apply to must first 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.629
 soften before you can melt 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 who is going to traffic and let's go 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.880
 stand 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.830
 we can meanwhile we can 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 melt chocolate 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.220
 now it would be a good idea to do that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.350
 or Marie to do better with such 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.490
 bowl in water and let yourself be calm 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.800
 to melt 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.209
 that is very good because it is not possible then 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.470
 to burn 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.560
 now i'm just a bit out of it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.849
 easy kitchen and therefore speed 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.220
 I never actually do that 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:36.330
 but then what i do is i put it on one 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.700
 low heat I put your chocolate in and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.619
 in this case it still creams 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:48.780
 so I already add a little cream 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:50.880
 then bandages that also go less quickly than 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.810
 we the cream price the mascarpone and sugar 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.570
 extend it 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.909
 in a container that is large enough to later 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.630
 also the mixture with the white chocolate 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.049
 to do something 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.729
 hope that with this fallen landscape 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.460
 and this recipe your appearance and win it 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.020
 recipe I had after that one 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.450
 to make a cooking here a ball 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.000
 that presents the chickie taste sensation 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.739
 was a restaurant and age and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.860
 in addition, people like you and me could 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.019
 just submit a recipe and marion 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.540
 submitted this recipe from the f-side 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.980
 Cheesecake and that I won and that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.480
 is now on the map 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.980
 might be nice to have that here too young 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.970
 let them tell you where this recipe is 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.290
 has come from 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.600
 it is a recipe from mark perkins and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.269
 market citizens was the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.780
 pastry chef at the hotel where I worked 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.519
 in London and I remember very well 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.420
 when i first needy like u 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:48.239
 so truly divine would start that 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.489
 mix the chocolate well with the cream then 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:57.810
 there can therefore be more cream at 200 milliliters 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:03.420
 no fuck you this is not for nothing 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.620
 and look no find team who saw you 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.049
 we can add to the mixture of the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.569
 chocolate red eats the water out 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.489
 pinch and then it may go through and 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.620
 let it melt gently 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.150
 never let your machine 10 cook 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.700
 because I'se does not work properly 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.190
 so then you do n't have any cheesecake there 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.209
 this is nicely mixed 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.170
 then we can add it to the mixture of the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.170
 mascarpone and disasters 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.920
 then we can put it in the fridge 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.990
 and there it goes free I suspect one 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.750
 three or four hour stiffen them 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.750
 I will let you know what I am following now 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.730
 had not done what I am going to do now 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.700
 a layer of household foil 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.400
 or skin surface because otherwise the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.230
 top faster becomes firmer faster 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.210
 then the rest of the mixture and if you 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.920
 then pieces to come through 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.300
 Do you not want that of quite hit him once 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.740
 on 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.410
 racing team also a few hours then again 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.630
 what your briel back is that he 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.250
 is so sturdy that you put it over the 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.200
 raspberry can pour later 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.720
 without it going all those raspberries 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.980
 buried but also not as strong 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.960
 that you are no longer in it 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.270
 Glass gets then that leaves a moment to 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.270
 stiffer so medium firm 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.150
 yes that's the weather it can be in it 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.150
 going to do glass 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.580
 in the end he only has two hours in it 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.650
 the fridge stood that went a lot 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.360
 faster than expected and we will enter 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.860
 do the glass but before we do that 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.770
 by my first raspberries 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.600
 at the bottom and ensures that the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.770
 ratio between raspberries a 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.390
 cheesecake is about the same with something 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.860
 more cheese cake is allowed but that 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.860
 friszure is just as tasty in the neighborhood 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.740
 when he is pretty sturdy 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.219
 what even a little earlier from the fridge 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.219
 liked 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.540
 and those Bastogne cakes that you will grind 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.220
 in kitchen 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.750
 or if you don't have a food processor 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:15.360
 you can also put them in a tea towel and 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.360
 then with rolling pin over it 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.800
 and some chocolate raspberry cheesecake 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.110
 side to the bottom cheesecake and the 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.210
 king eat tasty and if you have one 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.070
 visit set conceive Dessert 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.970
 write in the comments of I make it 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.970
