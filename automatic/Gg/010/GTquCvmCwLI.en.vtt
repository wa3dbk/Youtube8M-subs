same<00:02:25.989> thing<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.739> one<00:02:26.920> slight<00:02:27.190> variation<00:02:27.760> in

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
same thing with one slight variation in

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.400 
same thing with one slight variation in
the<00:02:28.000> middle<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.870> you're<00:02:29.019> going<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.290> the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the middle so you're going to do the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.510 
the middle so you're going to do the
same<00:02:29.560> thing<00:02:29.769> AGA

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.420

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
play E F C sharp D so again I'm holding

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.580 
play E F C sharp D so again I'm holding
down<00:02:44.160> those<00:02:44.340> denotes<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.850> hold<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.210> pedal

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
down those denotes I hold the pedal

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.510 
down those denotes I hold the pedal
transition<00:02:46.590> down<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> next<00:02:47.250> one

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
transition down to the next one

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.010 
transition down to the next one
okay<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:47.820> we've<00:02:48.060> moved<00:02:48.210> our<00:02:48.420> hand<00:02:48.600> positions

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
okay so we've moved our hand positions

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.590 
okay so we've moved our hand positions
from<00:02:49.230> here<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:51.030> we're<00:02:51.180> coming<00:02:51.330> all

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
from here to here now we're coming all

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.330 
from here to here now we're coming all
the<00:02:51.930> way<00:02:51.960> down<00:02:52.050> here<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> lower<00:02:52.860> range<00:02:53.190> of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
the way down here to the lower range of

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.180 
the way down here to the lower range of
the<00:02:53.400> piano<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:55.260> we're<00:02:55.650> going<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.830> do<00:02:55.920> exactly

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the piano and we're going to do exactly

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.710 
the piano and we're going to do exactly
what<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.580> did<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.970> very<00:02:57.180> first<00:02:57.480> set<00:02:57.690> of

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
what we did on the very first set of

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.480 
what we did on the very first set of
octaves<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.380> would<00:02:58.530> play<00:02:58.710> so<00:02:59.340> we're<00:02:59.460> just

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
octaves that would play so we're just

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.020 
octaves that would play so we're just
going<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.760> do<00:02:59.880> a<00:03:00.090> G<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.780> then<00:03:00.990> do<00:03:01.370> fpdc<00:03:02.370> deep

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
going to do a G a and then do fpdc deep

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.230 
going to do a G a and then do fpdc deep
now<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.500> when<00:03:04.710> you'll<00:03:05.580> switch<00:03:05.880> your<00:03:06.060> left

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
now this is when you'll switch your left

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.030 
now this is when you'll switch your left
hand<00:03:06.480> over<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.110> start<00:03:07.320> doing<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.770> fun

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
hand over and start doing that fun

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.160 
hand over and start doing that fun
little<00:03:08.220> chord<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:08.640> showed<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.090> guys<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:10.050> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
little chord I showed you guys in the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.900 
little chord I showed you guys in the
beginning<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:11.160> let<00:03:11.310> me<00:03:11.400> clear<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.700> part

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
beginning so let me clear this part

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.970 
beginning so let me clear this part
again<00:03:16.730> now<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:18.090> hold<00:03:18.360> down<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.020> two<00:03:19.350> D<00:03:19.560> chords

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
again now we hold down the two D chords

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.400 
again now we hold down the two D chords
so<00:03:20.490> that's<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.730> full<00:03:21.000> or<00:03:21.270> -<00:03:21.630> denotes<00:03:22.050> I'm<00:03:22.230> sorry

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
so that's a full or - denotes I'm sorry

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.710 
so that's a full or - denotes I'm sorry
backwards<00:03:22.890> that's<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.580> full<00:03:23.940> octave<00:03:24.420> stretch

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
backwards that's a full octave stretch

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.150 
backwards that's a full octave stretch
so<00:03:24.930> some<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:25.470> smaller<00:03:25.710> hands<00:03:25.950> may

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
so some of you with smaller hands may

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.800 
so some of you with smaller hands may
have<00:03:26.370> difficulties<00:03:26.940> with<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.270> are<00:03:27.720> you

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
going from this B here to this D here

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:41.039 
going from this B here to this D here
I<00:03:30.849> know<00:03:30.939> it's<00:03:31.150> kind<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.329> hard<00:03:31.480> with<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:40.049> if
