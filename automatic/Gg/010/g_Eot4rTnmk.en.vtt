00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.950 
see Andrew Garfield in this character
he's<00:01:17.759> really<00:01:18.240> working<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.570> me<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.869> his

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
he's really working for me as his

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
he's really working for me as his
character<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
character I really like that we get a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.980 
character I really like that we get a
lot<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> shots<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> lizard<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.659> he<00:01:21.780> looks

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
lot of shots of the lizard here he looks

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.460 
lot of shots of the lizard here he looks
great

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
great

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.499 
great
my<00:01:22.830> question<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.490> how<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:24.150> they<00:01:24.240> make

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
my question really was how can they make

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
my question really was how can they make
him<00:01:24.720> personally<00:01:25.590> involved<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.250> movie

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
him personally involved with this movie

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.890 
him personally involved with this movie
so<00:01:26.670> much<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.330> connect<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.750> Peter

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
so much so that to connect with Peter

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.359 
so much so that to connect with Peter
Parker<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.409> should<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> lizard<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
Parker not should be the lizard but it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.350 
Parker not should be the lizard but it
seems<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.670> they're<00:01:29.790> making<00:01:29.909> them<00:01:30.060> connect

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
seems like they're making them connect

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.060 
seems like they're making them connect
with<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> parents<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.680> personal

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
with the parents and so that personal

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.980 
with the parents and so that personal
connection<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.000> make<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> film<00:01:33.780> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
connection will really make the film and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
connection will really make the film and
the<00:01:34.140> confrontation<00:01:35.070> better<00:01:35.280> won't<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.759> be

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the confrontation better won't just be

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.670 
the confrontation better won't just be
like<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> fight<00:01:36.509> scene<00:01:36.810> it'll<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.560> an

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
like a fight scene it'll be like an

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
like a fight scene it'll be like an
actual<00:01:37.979> emotional<00:01:38.579> confrontation<00:01:39.270> which

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
actual emotional confrontation which

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
actual emotional confrontation which
will<00:01:39.570> make<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> film<00:01:39.990> even<00:01:40.110> better<00:01:40.439> also<00:01:40.710> we

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
will make the film even better also we

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.749 
will make the film even better also we
get<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.100> Spidey<00:01:41.369> doing<00:01:41.610> some

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
get to see Spidey doing some

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.770 
wall-crawling yes I love wall-crawling
there<00:01:44.520> was<00:01:44.610> way<00:01:44.759> too<00:01:44.820> much<00:01:45.090> swinging<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
there was way too much swinging in the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.359 
there was way too much swinging in the
other<00:01:45.990> movies<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.380> liked<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.890> idea<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.189> him

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
other movies I liked the idea of him

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.950 
other movies I liked the idea of him
crawling<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:47.939> walls<00:01:48.210> more<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> hoped<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.810> get

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
crawling up walls more I hoped that get

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.359 
crawling up walls more I hoped that get
more<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.560> movie<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> lot<00:01:49.920> more

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
more of that in this movie a lot more

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.440 
more of that in this movie a lot more
the<00:01:50.579> only<00:01:50.670> thing<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.939> didn't<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.119> about<00:01:51.210> this

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the only thing I didn't like about this

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.210 
the only thing I didn't like about this
trailer<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> big<00:01:52.290> ending<00:01:52.710> shot<00:01:53.040> of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
trailer is that the big ending shot of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.980 
trailer is that the big ending shot of
the<00:01:53.280> trailer<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> same<00:01:54.210> big<00:01:54.509> ending<00:01:54.810> shot

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the trailer was the same big ending shot

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
the trailer was the same big ending shot
as<00:01:55.170> last<00:01:55.409> time<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:56.040> hoping<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.399> they<00:01:56.460> were

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
as last time I was hoping that they were

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.649 
as last time I was hoping that they were
going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> maybe<00:01:57.060> show<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.509> bit

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
going to maybe show a little bit

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.300 
going to maybe show a little bit
something<00:01:57.810> different<00:01:58.290> other<00:01:58.409> than<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.920> I'm
