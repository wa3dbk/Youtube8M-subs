food bait oh he's woken up a bit and

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.920 
food bait oh he's woken up a bit and
rather<00:00:59.590> than<00:00:59.860> putting<00:01:00.070> 15<00:01:00.550> mils<00:01:00.820> around<00:01:01.180> it<00:01:01.480> on

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
you see the gravity LFL has done its job

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:37.390 
you see the gravity LFL has done its job
oh<00:01:25.880> it's<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.240> common<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:35.650> gravity<00:01:36.650> LFL<00:01:37.100> done

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
oh it's a common the gravity LFL done

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.140 
oh it's a common the gravity LFL done
its<00:01:37.550> job<00:01:37.640> again<00:01:39.430> there<00:01:40.430> we<00:01:40.520> go<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:40.700> pretty
