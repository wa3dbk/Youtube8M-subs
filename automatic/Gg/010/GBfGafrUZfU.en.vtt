00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
circular body and it's the first

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.980 
circular body and it's the first
SmartWatch<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.920> actually<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.090> when

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
SmartWatch to actually do that and when

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.750 
SmartWatch to actually do that and when
you<00:02:20.080> look<00:02:20.110> at<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.440> chassis<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.070> device<00:02:21.460> it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
you look at the chassis of the device it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.090 
you look at the chassis of the device it
is<00:02:21.820> actually<00:02:22.450> made<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.960> stainless<00:02:23.290> steel<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
is actually made of stainless steel and

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.940 
is actually made of stainless steel and
the<00:02:24.850> band<00:02:25.060> itself<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.780> leather<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.230> should<00:02:26.800> be

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the band itself is leather and should be

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.280 
the band itself is leather and should be
replaceable<00:02:27.520> as<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:28.600> tell<00:02:28.660> there's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
replaceable as you can tell there's

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.330 
replaceable as you can tell there's
basically<00:02:29.560> no<00:02:30.270> bezels<00:02:31.270> on<00:02:31.570> this<00:02:32.050> device<00:02:32.680> there

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
basically no bezels on this device there

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.770 
basically no bezels on this device there
is<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.520> little<00:02:33.790> bit<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.210> bottom<00:02:34.600> but

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
is a little bit on the bottom but

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.450 
is a little bit on the bottom but
basically<00:02:35.110> what<00:02:35.290> they<00:02:35.440> did<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.860> they<00:02:35.890> took<00:02:36.280> all

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
basically what they did is they took all

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.310 
basically what they did is they took all
the<00:02:36.610> bezels<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.090> should<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:37.900> been<00:02:37.930> around

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
the bezels that should have been around

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.900 
the bezels that should have been around
the<00:02:38.530> screen<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.070> put<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.430> all<00:02:39.580> into<00:02:39.790> that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
the screen and put it all into that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.690 
the screen and put it all into that
little<00:02:40.180> corner<00:02:40.630> now<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:41.830> definitely<00:02:42.310> not<00:02:42.490> as

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
little corner now it's definitely not as

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.030 
little corner now it's definitely not as
big<00:02:42.970> as<00:02:43.210> it<00:02:43.510> looks<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:44.080> from<00:02:44.590> what<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:44.770> heard
