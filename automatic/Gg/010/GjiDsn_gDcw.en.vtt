00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.240
 well here we are normally 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.240
 the torque has several functions 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.010
 and it tells me that it could not be synchronized what 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.460
 let's synchronize manual let's go to 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 configuration 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:30.070
 let's go to adapter options 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 there the request is asking me up 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 to enter the code of the code is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.620
 comes from factory 1234 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.620
 ready to accept 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.600
 that is, it has to be 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.600
 connected we are going to start up 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.070
 with this we will go again 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.799
 one page to the Home screen 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.189
 keep in mind that I'm 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.600
 testing because the truth will receive it the 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.600
 morning 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.300
 the bed and says I said to the device 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.420
 it's fine is right 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.860
 because he also recognizes in the youtube of 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.840
 the hysteria 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.830
 you're still seeing me the request for 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.830
 synchronization 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.290
 let's go again with the code 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.200
 234 ready to accept 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.789
 Yes now 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.789
 now it is connected 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.550
 to you as a mark of revolutions 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.610
 the clumsy 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.080
 have a little dance 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.700
 it is not supposed to give us much 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.300
 information 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.190
 that we do not have access from the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.910
 down all board from the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.110
 computer 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.110
 let's go here 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.480
 there we have several watches 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.600
 you have to study them well that are each 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.060
 one 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.740
 is the turbo pressure the torque the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.300
 speed the colÃ¡n revolutions is the 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.860
 temperature can be 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.860
 the temperature of him 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.450
 of admission you can also have the 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.480
 exhaust temperature you can have the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.230
 heap temperature you can measure everything 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.110
 what you want a lot of data there 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.940
 to each time stamp you can make 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.819
 to do adult in an eighth of 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.970
 mile in the quarter mile 060 this 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.650
 these little squares these little clock 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.200
 you can add between a list 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.379
 endless there is in the setup in the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.550
 menu here marks you the maximum hp for that 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.710
 you have to be moving 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.120
 and here we return again to 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.120
 ay lap counts and 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.970
 let's see how the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.420
 the error and so we can reset it I have 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.420
 what to leave 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.360
 to the main screen 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.920
 what I'm going to do is like 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.120
 be on video so I go back to do another 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.070
 because I do not know how to edit 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.180
 and then they will be 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.180
 at the time of these videos
