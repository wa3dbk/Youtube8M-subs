the water out in the bugs and that kind

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.220 
the water out in the bugs and that kind
of<00:02:41.260> thing<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:43.000> then<00:02:43.300> you'll<00:02:43.480> set<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.020> in

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
of thing and so then you'll set that in

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.080 
of thing and so then you'll set that in
there<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.680> then<00:02:44.890> cover<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.459> all<00:02:45.580> over<00:02:45.970> with

there and then cover that all over with

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.699 
there and then cover that all over with
dirt<00:02:46.330> now<00:02:47.260> that's<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:48.160> practice<00:02:48.730> right<00:02:49.000> now

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
dirt now that's the practice right now

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.199 
dirt now that's the practice right now
200<00:02:50.709> years<00:02:50.920> ago<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.370> wasn't<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.730> practice
