zipper so you can a little zipper up
here<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.850> keep<00:01:54.090> stuff<00:01:54.409> up<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
here so you can keep stuff up here but I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.590 
here so you can keep stuff up here but I
don't<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.369> keep<00:01:56.610> anything<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
don't really keep anything there at the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.080 
don't really keep anything there at the
moment<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.219> know<00:02:02.310> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
moment so this is actually a you know a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.520 
moment so this is actually a you know a
nicely<00:02:03.899> designed<00:02:04.680> camera<00:02:05.430> bag<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.850> guess

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
nicely designed camera bag I guess

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.570 
nicely designed camera bag I guess
there's<00:02:07.530> enough<00:02:07.590> space<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.069> get<00:02:08.399> this

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
there's enough space you get this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.460 
there's enough space you get this
divider<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.660> which<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:10.080> move<00:02:10.229> from

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
divider in here which you can move from

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.040 
divider in here which you can move from
left<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.830> right<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.340> want<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.450> way<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> have

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
left to right if you want the way I have

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.620 
left to right if you want the way I have
it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.540 
it
place<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.740> know<00:02:14.860> all<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> way<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.310> one

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
place is you know all the way to one

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.220 
place is you know all the way to one
side<00:02:15.730> some<00:02:16.090> people<00:02:16.120> put<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.720> middle<00:02:16.900> some

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
side some people put in the middle some

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.260 
side some people put in the middle some
people<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.010> other<00:02:18.160> side<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.610> keep<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.180> this

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
people on the other side I keep it this

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.420 
people on the other side I keep it this
way<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.620> basically<00:02:21.040> what's<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.340> my

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430

way and this is basically what's in my
bag<00:02:21.580> most<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.240> time<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.230> what<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.770> here

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
bag most of the time so what I have here

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.290 
bag most of the time so what I have here
is<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> Canon<00:02:24.700> Rebel<00:02:24.760> t3i<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:27.120> right<00:02:28.120> now<00:02:28.270> I

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
is a Canon Rebel t3i and right now I

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.370 
is a Canon Rebel t3i and right now I
have<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.600> 50<00:02:28.960> mil<00:02:29.170> F<00:02:29.700> 1.8<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.180> but<00:02:31.960> that's

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
have a 50 mil F 1.8 on it but that's

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.300 
have a 50 mil F 1.8 on it but that's
usually<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.280> 18<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.240> 55<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:35.410> I'm<00:02:35.530> using<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:36.010> 18

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
usually a 18 to 55 but I'm using the 18

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.280 
usually a 18 to 55 but I'm using the 18
to<00:02:36.430> 55<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.030> record<00:02:37.390> right<00:02:37.540> now<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.110> not

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
to 55 to record right now so that's not

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.410 
to 55 to record right now so that's not
on<00:02:38.530> there<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.270> here<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.480> another<00:02:40.720> 51<00:02:41.850> 1<00:02:42.850> 8<00:02:43.030> but

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
on there and here is another 51 1 8 but

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.810 
on there and here is another 51 1 8 but
that's<00:02:43.600> usually<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.080> 51<00:02:44.560> 8<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:44.920> then<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.250> 1855

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
that's usually a 51 8 and then the 1855

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.400 
that's usually a 51 8 and then the 1855
is<00:02:46.150> here

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
is here

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.840 
is here
so<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.360> know<00:02:49.390> never<00:02:49.770> 251<00:02:50.770> 8<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.520> don't

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
so it's you know never 251 8 I don't

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.780 
so it's you know never 251 8 I don't
think<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.660> would<00:02:52.780> be<00:02:52.810> very<00:02:53.080> useful<00:02:53.760> here<00:02:54.760> I

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
think that would be very useful here I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.960 
think that would be very useful here I
usually<00:02:55.210> carry<00:02:55.540> 2<00:02:55.810> flashes<00:02:56.320> sometimes<00:02:57.010> 3<00:02:57.700> if<00:02:57.880> I

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
usually carry 2 flashes sometimes 3 if I

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.080 
usually carry 2 flashes sometimes 3 if I
need<00:02:58.180> another<00:02:58.420> one<00:02:59.340> but<00:03:00.340> here<00:03:00.730> we<00:03:00.850> have<00:03:00.970> the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
the M and it has a like 35 millimeter su

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.440 
the M and it has a like 35 millimeter su
micron<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:06.610> is<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:08.040> version<00:04:09.040> for<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.790> believe

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
micron this is the version for I believe

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.300 
micron this is the version for I believe
and<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:11.680> one<00:04:11.830> was<00:04:12.010> made<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:12.310> Canada<00:04:14.310> pretty

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
and this one was made in Canada pretty

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.840 
and this one was made in Canada pretty
good<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:16.660> aperture<00:04:17.080> ring<00:04:17.109> on<00:04:17.380> mine<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.920> it's

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
good the aperture ring on mine and it's

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.400 
good the aperture ring on mine and it's
like<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.450> with<00:04:19.630> many<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.049> Canadian

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
like this with many of the Canadian

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.620 
like this with many of the Canadian
versions<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.859> believe<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.640> little<00:04:22.060> bit<00:04:22.180> it's

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
versions I believe is a little bit it's

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.050 
versions I believe is a little bit it's
still<00:04:22.720> clicky<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:24.160> stays<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:24.430> place<00:04:24.580> but

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
still clicky and it stays in place but

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.010 
still clicky and it stays in place but
it's<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.840> little<00:04:26.080> bit<00:04:26.350> easy<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.770> move

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
it's a little bit easy to move

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.469 
it's a little bit easy to move
so<00:04:27.410> I<00:04:27.590> have<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.099> get<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.340> fixed<00:04:28.669> whenever<00:04:29.419> I

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
so I have to get that fixed whenever I

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.999 
so I have to get that fixed whenever I
can<00:04:29.720> you<00:04:30.080> know<00:04:30.169> so<00:04:30.319> far<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.500> haven't<00:04:30.680> had<00:04:30.889> an
