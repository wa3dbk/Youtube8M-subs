00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 very good everyone here but there 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.700
 superimpose or legendary 102 and 7 on a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.480
 video that I did not want to sue him today 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.389
 I do not know what I mean, I come with my friend 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 I am a video to how to configure your s / d 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.210
 s / d prepares for another for the cell phone 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 him a huawei that I do not meet with the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.890
 time like that of huawei then and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.930
 whose already has bad if I can 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 do it for my cell phone that I have in 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.840
 these three mini then do not start the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.840
 video well we will go to spend 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.149
 we have to go here good coding the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.020
 encoder I do not know what it is for but I 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.580
 I have it in mpg software 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.040
 4 slow then we can put it there 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:59.780
 I prefer to have it there resolutions 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:03.320
 to make it look better we have 480 x 288 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.040
 we have it there then the viraat the one 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.970
 it's I do not know how it says here that it's outside 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.970
 depending on the encoder 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:21.030
 then we would put it 10 10 mb ps 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.720
 then we will put you there and in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.720
 image frequency 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.799
 we would apologize for that 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.689
 we would put 15 fps then there the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.030
 we would put in image frequency that 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.060
 is to make it a little better programs 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.159
 vertical video players in 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.439
 many diffusion can not reproduce the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.450
 videos with vertical frames and 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.340
 this option is selected as 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.170
 mediate of organization that is done 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.390
 Quick to show correctly 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.299
 in the android producer that I do not 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.090
 I put sources so you can hear the 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.390
 microphone and I have it objective 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.299
 obviously sampling frequency at 16 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.000
 so because if we put it higher 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.000
 they will be worse 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:16.300
 and all this also does not win if 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.340
 you want you can keep this so that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.610
 when they want us cell phone to be deactivated 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.670
 the video is already finished but I do not 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.390
 I finish here or you can finish it in another 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.270
 I finished it then but if 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.310
 he wants to deactivate me no, it's not like that 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.140
 that they do not have this because they are going 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.260
 to see in his books the whole screen and 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.900
 is very bad and they will not be able to and he will 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.040
 gameplay is going to see nothing is not worth 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.750
 nothing any play 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.550
 your details as indicators of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.370
 you can activate this touch 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.800
 so that you see your finger like that when 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.550
 the steps or if you do not want from it do not 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.740
 go 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.050
 I would activate it to look like the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.180
 google place then this has been 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.310
 shady but he liked to like 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.310
