on why you get the biggest bang for your
buck<00:04:40.509> by<00:04:40.870> doing<00:04:41.229> this<00:04:41.409> you<00:04:42.310> know<00:04:42.400> you're<00:04:42.550> only

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
buck by doing this you know you're only

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.640 
buck by doing this you know you're only
using<00:04:42.909> three<00:04:43.389> energy<00:04:43.720> every<00:04:43.930> time<00:04:44.110> you're

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
using three energy every time you're

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.159 
using three energy every time you're
doing<00:04:45.340> this<00:04:45.490> fight<00:04:45.849> you're<00:04:46.629> getting<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.960> rune

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
doing this fight you're getting a rune

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.770 
doing this fight you're getting a rune
to<00:04:47.349> sell<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:48.759> you're<00:04:48.909> making<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.300> decent<00:04:49.539> amount

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
to sell so you're making a decent amount

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.510 
to sell so you're making a decent amount
of<00:04:49.930> mana<00:04:50.169> stones<00:04:50.500> from<00:04:50.710> doing<00:04:51.009> this<00:04:51.129> you<00:04:51.370> can

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
of mana stones from doing this you can

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.550 
of mana stones from doing this you can
make<00:04:51.669> a<00:04:51.699> hundred<00:04:52.090> thousand<00:04:52.509> mana<00:04:52.659> stones<00:04:53.020> with

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
make a hundred thousand mana stones with

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.969 
make a hundred thousand mana stones with
probably<00:04:54.460> about<00:04:54.819> 80<00:04:55.330> energy<00:04:56.080> I'm<00:04:56.710> going<00:04:56.919> to

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
probably about 80 energy I'm going to

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.399 
probably about 80 energy I'm going to
say<00:04:57.300> so<00:04:58.300> a<00:04:58.330> hundred<00:04:58.599> thousand<00:04:58.930> mana<00:04:59.080> stones

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
say so a hundred thousand mana stones

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.830 
say so a hundred thousand mana stones
with<00:04:59.500> AD<00:04:59.680> energy<00:05:00.099> that's<00:05:00.940> pretty<00:05:01.180> great<00:05:01.569> and

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
with AD energy that's pretty great and

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.749 
with AD energy that's pretty great and
the<00:05:02.530> reason<00:05:02.650> you're<00:05:02.919> getting<00:05:03.159> so<00:05:03.310> much<00:05:03.520> is

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
the reason you're getting so much is

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.010 
the reason you're getting so much is
because<00:05:03.789> you're<00:05:04.240> killing<00:05:04.599> all<00:05:04.900> these

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
because you're killing all these

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.510 
because you're killing all these
different<00:05:05.259> mobs<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.830> you're<00:05:05.949> getting<00:05:06.099> energy

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
different mobs and you're getting energy

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.149 
different mobs and you're getting energy
back<00:05:06.759> so<00:05:07.270> sometimes<00:05:07.750> you'll<00:05:08.289> do<00:05:08.560> this<00:05:08.740> level

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
back so sometimes you'll do this level

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.180 
back so sometimes you'll do this level
and<00:05:09.630> you'll<00:05:10.630> end<00:05:10.810> up<00:05:10.930> with<00:05:11.139> more<00:05:11.349> energy<00:05:11.530> than

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
and you'll end up with more energy than

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.909 
and you'll end up with more energy than
it<00:05:12.310> costs<00:05:12.639> you<00:05:12.759> to<00:05:12.909> actually<00:05:13.030> do<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.479> fight<00:05:13.919> so

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
it costs you to actually do the fight so

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.620 
it costs you to actually do the fight so
that's<00:05:15.069> why<00:05:15.220> I<00:05:15.250> highly<00:05:15.759> recommend<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.389> one<00:05:16.449> I

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
that's why I highly recommend this one I

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.100 
that's why I highly recommend this one I
mean<00:05:16.870> there's<00:05:17.050> a<00:05:17.139> lot<00:05:17.169> other<00:05:18.780> normal<00:05:19.780> level

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
mean there's a lot other normal level

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.990 
mean there's a lot other normal level
one<00:05:20.289> stages<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:21.039> are<00:05:21.099> just<00:05:21.580> as<00:05:21.789> good

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
one stages that are just as good

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.249 
one stages that are just as good
especially<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:23.080> new<00:05:23.380> for<00:05:23.740> areas<00:05:24.690> but<00:05:25.690> uh<00:05:25.750> I

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
especially the new for areas but uh I

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.409 
especially the new for areas but uh I
don't<00:05:27.190> know<00:05:27.310> this<00:05:27.490> one<00:05:27.639> just<00:05:27.819> seems<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.210> go

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
don't know this one just seems to go

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.520 
don't know this one just seems to go
considerably<00:05:29.289> quicker<00:05:30.599> the<00:05:31.599> monsters<00:05:32.020> aren't

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
considerably quicker the monsters aren't

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.180 
considerably quicker the monsters aren't
as<00:05:32.849> difficult<00:05:33.849> per<00:05:34.300> se<00:05:34.599> you<00:05:35.590> know<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.860> I'm<00:05:35.949> I

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
as difficult per se you know and I'm I

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.170 
as difficult per se you know and I'm I
have<00:05:36.490> for<00:05:37.469> decent<00:05:38.469> monsters<00:05:38.919> here<00:05:39.310> and<00:05:39.490> all

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
have for decent monsters here and all

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.490 
have for decent monsters here and all
four<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.870> them<00:05:41.020> are<00:05:41.110> going<00:05:41.199> to<00:05:41.259> be<00:05:41.319> getting

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
four of them are going to be getting

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.890 
four of them are going to be getting
experience<00:05:42.219> so<00:05:42.370> this<00:05:42.520> is<00:05:42.669> ideal<00:05:43.120> for<00:05:43.389> me<00:05:43.539> and

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900
