it's not so much important about how

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.549 
it's not so much important about how
many<00:00:42.270> maps<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.600> dropped<00:00:42.809> about<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.469> we

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
took it one map at a time and we got the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.569 
took it one map at a time and we got the
whip<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> suppose

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
whip some I think that so I suppose
