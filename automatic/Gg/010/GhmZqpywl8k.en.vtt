it's<00:01:40.500> been<00:01:40.619> used<00:01:40.829> once<00:01:41.450> i'm<00:01:42.450> using<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> silver

metallic pen touch paint marker for my

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
stencil for several reasons first I love

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.170 
stencil for several reasons first I love
the<00:01:49.140> understated<00:01:49.710> sophistication<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.729> silver

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the understated sophistication of silver

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.870 
the understated sophistication of silver
on<00:01:51.329> gray<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.869> adds<00:01:52.619> shimmer<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> dimension

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
on gray it adds shimmer and dimension

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
on gray it adds shimmer and dimension
when<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> light<00:01:54.390> catches<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.619> think

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
when the light catches it and I think

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.760 
when the light catches it and I think
it's<00:01:55.979> unique<00:01:56.659> secondly<00:01:57.659> using<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> pen<00:01:58.500> instead

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's unique secondly using a pen instead

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.730 
it's unique secondly using a pen instead
of<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.070> paintbrush<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.299> much<00:02:00.450> easier<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:01.020> have

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
of a paintbrush is so much easier I have

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.139 
of a paintbrush is so much easier I have
a<00:02:01.799> lot<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> control<00:02:02.430> over<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.729> ink<00:02:02.969> and
