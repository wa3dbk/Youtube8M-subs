00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670 

played<00:00:00.299> third<00:00:00.480> till<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.719> few<00:00:00.750> years<00:00:00.960> ago<00:00:01.260> and

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
played third till a few years ago and

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.020 
played third till a few years ago and
the<00:00:01.890> first<00:00:02.100> time<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.340> went<00:00:02.520> over<00:00:02.700> there<00:00:02.820> I<00:00:02.850> tried

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
the first time I went over there I tried

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.300 
the first time I went over there I tried
to<00:00:03.120> take<00:00:03.270> my<00:00:03.449> shortstops<00:00:03.990> club<00:00:04.259> which<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.980> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
to take my shortstops club which is a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.309 
to take my shortstops club which is a
little<00:00:05.520> bit<00:00:05.670> smaller<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.870> kind<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.140> wasn't

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
little bit smaller and I kind of wasn't

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.990 
little bit smaller and I kind of wasn't
comfortable<00:00:07.710> over<00:00:07.950> there<00:00:07.980> because<00:00:08.189> your

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
comfortable over there because your

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.490 
comfortable over there because your
reaction<00:00:09.389> time<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.570> less<00:00:09.840> over<00:00:10.110> there<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.380> I'd

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
reaction time is less over there so I'd

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.009 
reaction time is less over there so I'd
rather<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> bigger<00:00:11.219> glove<00:00:11.610> than<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.929> know

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
rather have a bigger glove than you know

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.350 
rather have a bigger glove than you know
a<00:00:13.200> smaller<00:00:13.650> glove<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> smaller<00:00:14.400> pocket<00:00:14.969> so

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
a smaller glove with a smaller pocket so

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.580 
a smaller glove with a smaller pocket so
that's<00:00:15.509> why<00:00:15.599> use<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> bigger<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.289> at<00:00:16.410> third

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
that's why use a bigger one at third

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.099 
that's why use a bigger one at third
this<00:00:16.800> one<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> says<00:00:18.150> 11<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.630> three-quarter

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
this one is a says 11 and three-quarter

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.269 
this one is a says 11 and three-quarter
inches<00:00:19.140> i<00:00:19.590> don't<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.770> if<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.980> could<00:00:20.100> see

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
inches i don't know if you could see

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.790 
inches i don't know if you could see
that<00:00:20.430> right<00:00:20.609> there<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.150> um<00:00:21.560> that's<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:22.769> i

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that right there but um that's what i

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.769 
that right there but um that's what i
use<00:00:22.980> over<00:00:23.250> there<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> third<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.420> probably

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
use over there a third and it's probably

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.000 
use over there a third and it's probably
the<00:00:24.960> most<00:00:25.050> comfortable<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.529> me<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.830> use<00:00:25.980> this

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the most comfortable for me to use this

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.950 
the most comfortable for me to use this
size<00:00:26.400> glove<00:00:26.699> over<00:00:26.910> their<00:00:27.060> third<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.779> so

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
size glove over their third all right so

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.779 
size glove over their third all right so
then<00:00:28.109> tell<00:00:28.349> us<00:00:28.500> take<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> second<00:00:29.340> base<00:00:29.369> here

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
then tell us take is to second base here

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.339 
then tell us take is to second base here
we've<00:00:29.970> got<00:00:30.000> another<00:00:30.300> glove<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> second<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
we've got another glove for a second and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
we've got another glove for a second and
how<00:00:31.830> different<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.369> from<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.329> third

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
how different is this from your third

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.569 
how different is this from your third
base<00:00:33.719> Club<00:00:33.930> okay<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.130> second

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
base Club okay this one I use for second

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.940 
base Club okay this one I use for second
and<00:00:35.640> shortstop<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.559> actually<00:00:37.559> disclosed

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and shortstop and actually disclosed

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.530 
and shortstop and actually disclosed
probably<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.489> five<00:00:38.790> or<00:00:38.940> six<00:00:39.090> years<00:00:39.239> old

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
probably about five or six years old

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.660 
probably about five or six years old
I've<00:00:39.750> had<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.530> while<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:41.280> this

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
I've had this one for a while but this

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.490 
I've had this one for a while but this
one's<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.120> smaller<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.719> size<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.320> it's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
one's a little smaller in size and it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.810 
one's a little smaller in size and it's
a<00:00:43.590> different<00:00:43.920> model<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.610> probably

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
a different model so this is probably

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
a different model so this is probably
about<00:00:45.000> 11<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.559> quarter<00:00:46.739> inches<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
about 11 and a quarter inches but I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.090 
about 11 and a quarter inches but I
think<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.930> feels<00:00:49.079> smaller<00:00:49.500> actually<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
think it feels smaller actually and the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.889 
think it feels smaller actually and the
reason<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> smaller<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> because

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
reason I want a smaller one is because

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
reason I want a smaller one is because
when<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:52.379> turning<00:00:52.680> double<00:00:52.890> plays<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
when you're turning double plays on the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.770 
when you're turning double plays on the
pivot<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
pivot there you don't want have to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
pivot there you don't want have to
search<00:00:55.020> around<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.410> big<00:00:55.620> web<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> ball<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
search around a big web for a ball or a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549 
search around a big web for a ball or a
big<00:00:56.850> pocket<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.539> when<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.989> cast<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
big pocket so when I cast well it's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.840 
big pocket so when I cast well it's
usually<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> same<00:00:59.340> spot<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
usually right in the same spot so I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
usually right in the same spot so I
could<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.570> throw<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.190> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
could just get it and throw it and and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.219 
could just get it and throw it and and
also<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.180> ground<00:01:03.420> balls<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> ball

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
also on ground balls I get the ball

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
also on ground balls I get the ball
quicker<00:01:04.530> when<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.070> coming<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> throw<00:01:05.790> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
quicker when I'm coming up to throw so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
quicker when I'm coming up to throw so
that's<00:01:06.570> why<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> use<00:01:06.810> smaller<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.409> less

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that's why you use smaller one less

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.710 
that's why you use smaller one less
glove<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:08.520> through<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> ground<00:01:09.330> ball<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
glove to go through on a ground ball is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.000 
glove to go through on a ground ball is
that<00:01:09.840> how<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.290> quicker<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.860> love

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that how you get it quicker I just love

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
that how you get it quicker I just love
to<00:01:11.159> go<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> ball<00:01:11.729> went<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.600> so

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
to go get the ball went that it's in so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.270 
to go get the ball went that it's in so
I<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:13.200> exactly<00:01:13.470> where<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> be

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I know exactly where it's going to be

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.170 
I know exactly where it's going to be
when<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.460> go<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.030> i<00:01:15.090> have

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
when I go in there because i have

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
when I go in there because i have
probably<00:01:15.450> less<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.170> throw<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:16.560> short

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
probably less time to throw from short

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.249 
probably less time to throw from short
over<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> first<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.299> i<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.420> from<00:01:18.720> third<00:01:18.960> over

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
like and you know you'll see I think now

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.980 
like and you know you'll see I think now
times<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.970> changed<00:01:33.329> where<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.659> second

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
times have changed where I think second

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.990 
times have changed where I think second

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
don't know if it's because maybe the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.780 
don't know if it's because maybe the
balls<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.740> being<00:01:37.829> hit<00:01:38.070> harder<00:01:38.400> than<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.640> are

now and then let's talk about the glove
use<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.869> first<00:01:46.110> base<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.770> guessing<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.310> got

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
use for first base I'm guessing you got

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.310 
use for first base I'm guessing you got
some<00:01:47.640> scooping<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.810> yeah<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
some scooping to do it there so yeah I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.840 
some scooping to do it there so yeah I
mean<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> couldn't<00:01:50.460> even<00:01:50.520> tell<00:01:50.759> you

mean this one I couldn't even tell you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.719 
mean this one I couldn't even tell you
how<00:01:50.880> big<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.110> mean<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.770> huge<00:01:53.250> yeah

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
how big it is but I mean if huge yeah

our<00:01:54.119> funds<00:01:54.420> between<00:01:54.659> needs<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:56.640> know<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
our funds between needs to you know and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.069 
our funds between needs to you know and
the<00:01:56.909> reason<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> bigger<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:57.869> over

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the reason you have the bigger one over

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.499 
the reason you have the bigger one over
there<00:01:58.170> first<00:01:58.469> base<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.250> because<00:01:59.640> you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
there first base is just because you

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.380 
there first base is just because you
know<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:01.100> matter<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.189> inches<00:02:02.490> over<00:02:02.939> there<00:02:03.090> can

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
know a matter of inches over there can

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.850 
know a matter of inches over there can
be<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.869> difference<00:02:03.960> between<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.530> guy<00:02:04.680> being

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
be the difference between a guy being

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
be the difference between a guy being
safer<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
safer out and you know if there's a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
safer out and you know if there's a
throw<00:02:07.020> up<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> line<00:02:07.469> either<00:02:07.710> way<00:02:07.979> or<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.190> have

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
throw up the line either way or you have

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.650 
throw up the line either way or you have
to<00:02:08.429> pick<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> ball<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> bigger<00:02:09.360> mass

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to pick the ball you have a bigger mass

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.200 
to pick the ball you have a bigger mass
area<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.619> basically<00:02:10.950> catch<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.489> ball<00:02:11.700> in

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
area to basically catch the ball in

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.240 
area to basically catch the ball in
that's<00:02:12.330> why<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.740> first<00:02:13.920> baseman

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
that's why you know the first baseman

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.200 
that's why you know the first baseman
Smith's<00:02:14.460> are<00:02:14.580> bigger<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.940> biggest

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
Smith's are bigger and the biggest

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.700 
Smith's are bigger and the biggest
adjustment<00:02:15.690> for<00:02:15.840> me<00:02:15.930> when<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> moved<00:02:16.440> over

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
adjustment for me when I moved over

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.010 
adjustment for me when I moved over
there<00:02:16.830> was<00:02:17.550> turning<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.330> double<00:02:18.600> play<00:02:18.630> where

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
there was turning the double play where

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.080 
there was turning the double play where
I<00:02:19.050> had<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.410> get<00:02:19.740> in<00:02:19.950> there<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.220> find<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.880> ball

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
I had to get in there and find the ball

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.850 
I had to get in there and find the ball
I<00:02:21.120> mean<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.450> could<00:02:21.570> see<00:02:21.780> how<00:02:21.930> big<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.380> pocket

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
I mean you could see how big this pocket

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.070 
I mean you could see how big this pocket
is<00:02:23.010> where<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.580> had<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.910> go<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.330> find<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.900> and

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
is where I had to go in and find it and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.630 
is where I had to go in and find it and
make<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.260> throw<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.620> second<00:02:26.130> as<00:02:26.220> opposed<00:02:26.520> to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
make the throw to second as opposed to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
make the throw to second as opposed to
using<00:02:26.790> my<00:02:27.060> small<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:27.960> where<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.440> know

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
using my small one where I just know

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.200 
using my small one where I just know
exactly<00:02:28.950> where<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.220> every<00:02:29.520> time<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.060> that

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
exactly where it is every time so that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.320 
exactly where it is every time so that
was<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.390> biggest<00:02:30.540> adjustment<00:02:31.080> for<00:02:31.230> me
