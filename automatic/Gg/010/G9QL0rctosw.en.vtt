00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:10.480
 there has been owed a halo that miac 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:13.330
 shoot flashing in the face and now 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.210
 he should feel weak from the thunder 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.760
 or maybe no oh well I said what you think of 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.550
 golden gianpi I'm afraid to click on 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.000

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:31.700
 fear thunder has arrived 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.440
 ok i send it i think it is you think 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.440
 that is what 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.709
 please can I finish the video like this 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.219
 there I no longer want to talk to 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:49.609
 this shit of shit okay we ask 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.499
 what else do you do hoping that 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.450
 maybe this time, don't insult us 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.549
 because practically then also write to him 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.629
 but he insults you anyway after that 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:03.109
 let's try but later write about what you do today 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.239
 I would have bet 10 thousand euros for dinner 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.909
 I would have bet 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.769
 now let's try to write to you I will try 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.099
 I'm sure he insults us in some way 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:16.599
 way must come out like the fuck off 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.599
 dott. lecce dott 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.030
 I would have preferred him to send me to 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.530
 fuck you more than write something without 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.560
 no sense 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.570
 well we ask where we live we hope 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.780
 not under a bridge but I hope so because 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.190
 he is an asshole so he will see again the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.660
 number four 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:41.210
 what it is I know you are male or female 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:43.220
 i am a busty female ok this not 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.530
 I'm sorry at this point 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.630
 I would ask if he loves me because he is there 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.409
 proving all this affection, it seems to you 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.380
 that does not love me 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:54.320
 so you obviously love the answer 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.830
 it will be yes I have always loved you and always you 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.820
 i will love it i was sure ok at this point 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.310
 as a last question I would ask him to 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.909
 to say goodbye to hunger rather than hunger 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.159
 okay 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.659
 I ask him to salute all of you 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.360
 audience 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:15.320
 ok so if you insult me ​​I'll do one 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.440
 figure of shit ahead of 90 thousand 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.039
 subscribers well I know you don't like it 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.340
 much like a greeting to viewers the 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:31.370
 I know but when he kisses me and if you want too 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:32.389
 now sorry I took a moment there 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.280
 but no 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:38.810
 Well at this point I would say we can 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.930
 give him a friendly greeting though 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.100

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.340
 beautiful although I don't really know 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:52.020
 no female male gave a being 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.460
 living I do not think so I hope because 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.530
 they are living beings that I come to 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.790
