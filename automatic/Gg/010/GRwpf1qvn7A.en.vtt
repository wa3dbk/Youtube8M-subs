00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.199
 when a whole visit to the hospital that 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.539
 the baby was born where he is super happy 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.609

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.140
 well at least here in mexico it 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.480
 It usually corresponds to that type of 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.000
 visit with a sweetie or a cookie 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.980
 or a little water for people 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.930
 Have them like that I'll show you how 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.120
 let's do well this is the material 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.670
 that we are going to work we have some 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.890
 Such typical baby items these 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.410
 pacifiers are so beautiful 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.510
 caballitos what you find where 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.430
 in the community in which you move is 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.800
 perfect then here we already have some 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.840
 little gifts that are chocolates wrapped 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 these are some very felt flowers 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.280
 simple these that go known you 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.950
 let's put in the mold of the bear in 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.720
 my blog are beautiful they are embroidered and 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.030
 they are super pretty we are also going to 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.350
 make some personalized waters too 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.689
 I'll teach you how to do 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.200
 so that later you can assemble all your 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.790
 basket and it would be super nice and these are 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.790
 chocolates and different sweets that already 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.920
 we wrapped up here we have a blonda this 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.380
 blonda this these papers that are used 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.210
 for pastry that are very easy to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 get and then what are we going to 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.630
 to do is that we are going to cut 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.360
 exactly one part and so 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.340
 and now we are going to outline it so that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.259
 see as the favorite 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.380
 then you cut him like a little 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.770
 wavy and then obviously we're going to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.140
 make the peak here we have the beginning 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.539
 of the bib and to make it the handle 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.780
 of the warrior because nothing else we are going to do 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.880
 very simple a ribbon of lacing and what 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.130
 let's ride on the the little bit of 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.899
 Blonda that is already our bib with a 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.899
 little bit of cold silicone 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.990
 and well here we have it already on 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.270
 licorice another thing that does not 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.060
 may be missing in which you throw us are 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.820
 custom watering cans or soft drinks 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.520
 eyes I recommend that you invite or 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.260
 you live a little round not a thing 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.420
 very big because if not people do not 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.550
 they take it more or less whatever the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.380
 equivalent to a glass of water me here 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.240
 I already have a role this paper is 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.120
 plasticized but it can be a paper 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.550
 normal since I removed the label here was 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.430
 around here the label of the one of the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.390
 brand and nothing else you put it we paste it with 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.090
 Scotch tape 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.370
 and well you can do many things 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.130
 you can put the name you can put 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.220
 a bow to me I liked the idea of ​​putting him 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.380
 these popotillo strips I think 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.569
 that are lovely white popotillo 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.260
 we're just going to put a little bit of 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.260
 silicone 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.440
 your personalized waters were left 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.810
 last we are going to elaborate strips that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.970
 carries the basket at each end the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.800
 we will combine white and blue and them 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.930
 let's put a detail that in this 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.450
 case are the pacifiers that we are going to make 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.190
 it's very simple let's create a bow 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.310
 of many laps always calls 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.849
 noticing that you leave the right in front 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.250
 here the right is the one that has the 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.890
 white hairline we already have a wire here 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.160
 that is already ready that is lined in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.350
 white to tie doubles in half 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.269
 so that it is provided because 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.700
 Sometimes the mittens are very funny 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.650
 all charged for a place and then 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.519
 our father here you see that he is already 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.519
 well invited 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.810

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.440
 scope that we had here and of all 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.840
 ways like now we are going to put 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.520
 above another bar or so we will 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.950
 tie where that other ready now 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.950

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.660
 we are now in san blas this with 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.900

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.120

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.360
