00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.050
 Hey guys 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 We'll be back at mayor and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.740
 yes and today , and what's right 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 is really cool what I have been forever 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.710
 long wait for a review game 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.529
 called mario kart 8 in the special 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 edition or limited edition 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.660
 nothing more urban in there 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.970
 the game and the blue tank as 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.489
 small figure that makes you look so decorative 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.380
 can provide cabinet in the play what 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.880
 I like it very much and then I did 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.590
 I have seen this edition 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.219
 Of course she also wanted to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.020
 yes i still just want to go there 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.370
 and now that's real I'm playing 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.559
 can and even a bit before 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.480
 I think release is very cool 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.489
 I'm really looking forward to it and will be 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.170
 then online with one or the other 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.120
 but you may play other of you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.780
 if you want to have fun there you can 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.980
 then, of course, talk about it 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.090
 short story is with me 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.219
 I would like to give you the following 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.660
 Just tell me I have that 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.250
 had been presented at the time 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.750
 amazon on the 10th 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.250
 or whatever that was pretty much 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.229
 the first day where you order this 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.030
 could and that was now on a whole 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.409
 I was sold out that's why I was 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.939
 pretty happy one more too 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.000
 to get 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 The price was just 70 euros and then gave 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.049
 The following thing is what happens 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.369
 now on friday and thursday 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.320
 Before that, the Lord's Day is one 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.520
 holiday and therefore had also 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.780
 many the fear that is maybe 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.280
 not in time to get longer 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.380
 post and when will be sent off and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.790
 so on and always has one 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.650
 bit pursued throughout by 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.670
 amazon 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.619
 after I have seen you then 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.150
 yesterday and was yesterday 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.009
 have sent the have already today 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.479
 and so on, of course, I wanted too 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.040
 I have one as soon as possible 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.630
 written extra on Amazon 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.250
 then we said that well 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.880
 still going out yesterday but that's it 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.590
 then no more 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.729
 and today it still was not 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.850
 sent and I was quite 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.350
 sad that this has to wait a long time yes 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.290
 I'm just that summarily 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 Just take a ride in the rain with a bike 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 driven by the media market 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.500
 and in fact it already existed today 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.450
 For 65 euros that means I have only once 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.580
 I saved five euros in the spring 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.160
 and autumn pharmacy studied and am 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.350
 mega mega happy 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.550
 with me at media market there was now 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.650
 quite a few of the standard 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.700
 versions and 4 of this special 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.680
 editions and I have the same 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 one seized and am at the cash register and 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.600
 'm super happy that I play this now 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.190
 can and so on briefly something else 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.810
 the trailer and so on I always 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.310
 I've seen the graphic really looks 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.710
 really good, I am very curious 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.270
 where I'm huge there with the whole 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.680
 that has fans on the ceiling and so on 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.920
 continue to look how it is then 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.390
 Everything feels like control when I am 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.770
 maybe take the gamepad first 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.710
 and let's see if we still 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.000
 change or not 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.820
 the online mode I am looking forward too 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.620
 on it and in general also on the new ones 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.710
 items and so just really cool 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.450
 game saw yes then I would say 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.340
 we unpack the whole time and look 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.960
 Let's get in on them, at least the ones below 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.150
 that is once taped but above yourself 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.710
 somehow not sealed because of that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.120
 I'm just trying this now 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.680
 The boxes do not open at the top 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.230
 By the way, very nice here with the design 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.670
 about computer science and one page each 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.650
 times the text here you can see something in it 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.290
 is there and also back there is again 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.300
 the walls up the ceiling full throttle 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.890
 Without limit, the items will be 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.890
 still shown are the three new ones that exist 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.770
 and if I'm very curious and up here 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.480
 then a cool good from the ju and me 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.030
 Try to open it with care 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.450
 this big kitchen knife here with it 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.110
 I do not mind that and that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.850
 leave open 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.350
 and if there is something missing in there then 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.930
 I'm sad I open it all the time 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.320
 careful what is it so far already 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.050
 we have good times to get out well 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.230
 once a poplar that is just deco 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:49.820
 I say that a little bit 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.630
 Carefully out and then the atom too 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.610
 already empty 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.170
 yes I would say we catch now 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.060
 easy to talk with briefly look at me 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.580
 for if I unpack the times ever 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.170
 do not pack it out as it said 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.250
 this armor figure third you can 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.780
 then look at another 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.550
 Watch boxing again if you look at that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.989
 I really want to look at it now 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.850
 yet again shows what is inside and 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.010
 also nintendo and that's up here 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.110
 keep small readers stripes actually 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.000
 just taped but I'll be him 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.520
 ultimately, necessarily, to put up and 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.020
 so just stay and I will 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.489
 Then return to the carton and look forward to it 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.139
 me that she was there 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.650
 I have the same with my zelda 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.300
 made the wind waker hd version 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.479
 we then the game that is even more 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.830
 times extra welded yes actually 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.699
 the packaging is pretty much that 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.620
 same 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.449
 but that is something you can do now 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.650
 looks different but is behind 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.470
 actually the same trust ye 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.810
 then not show it again, yes 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.680
 I'll open it when I am 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.680
 now then get on 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:05:00.380
 gea has when I get this pass 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:04.190
 currently gets yes then we open first 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.650
 times and since we have even a mario 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.940
 kart eight disc looks really cool 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.449
 I am very much the same as mine 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.720
 view and we have 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.180
 here's what a club nintendo once again 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.710

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.870
 if you register this but only off 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.639
 Friday from 10 o'clock 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.690
 then get the dollar co too 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.039

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.659

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.530

 I'll see what I'm the wii 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.099
 party interests me a bit like that 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.349
 then i can do a bit of multiplayer 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.490
 zocken nintendo learn for example 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.349

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.219
 not yet 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.860
 If I look, but I think so 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:49.310

 newest and then I still have here 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.130
 to represent something on a guide 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.630
 since we are on one side here in all 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.790
 possible languages 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.560
 somehow one synchronizes the controller 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.120
 and on the other side you see 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.770
 once the control works 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.170
 what the gas give is what curb 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.270
 longest and how can you power like 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.760
