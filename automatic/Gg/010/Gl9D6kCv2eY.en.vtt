sound I'm going to demo the sound so
we've<00:03:46.980> got<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.280> horn<00:03:48.050> we've<00:03:49.050> got<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.380> sound

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.060 

we're<00:03:53.160> going<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:53.460> what<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.640> does<00:03:53.670> but

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
we're going to know what it does but

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.100 
we're going to know what it does but
it's<00:03:56.070> there

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.990 

any<00:04:01.860> minute<00:04:02.100> now<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:02.910> think<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:08.010> clocks<00:04:08.820> about

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
any minute now I think the clocks about

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.740 
any minute now I think the clocks about
the<00:04:09.270> same

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.640 

a<00:04:12.810> while<00:04:14.720> are<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.870> what<00:04:16.140> are<00:04:16.170> you<00:04:16.260> saying<00:04:16.500> that

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
a while are you what are you saying that

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.920 
a while are you what are you saying that
it<00:04:16.799> doesn't<00:04:17.100> change<00:04:17.160> at<00:04:17.609> all<00:04:20.540> definitely<00:04:21.540> does

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
it doesn't change at all definitely does

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
it doesn't change at all definitely does
I<00:04:22.260> mean<00:04:22.290> yeah<00:04:22.710> but

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.640 

set<00:04:42.950> 8<00:04:43.130> hours<00:04:43.550> this<00:04:44.390> is<00:04:44.570> 8<00:04:44.720> hours<00:04:45.080> right

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
set 8 hours this is 8 hours right

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:54.460 
set 8 hours this is 8 hours right
I<00:04:45.820> guess<00:04:46.820> so<00:04:47.090> maybe<00:04:48.100> starting<00:04:49.100> up<00:04:49.220> time<00:04:53.320> we<00:04:54.320> had

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
I guess so maybe starting up time we had

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.130 
I guess so maybe starting up time we had
the<00:04:54.620> mouth<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.670> a<00:04:55.850> for<00:04:56.210> like<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.360> millisecond<00:04:57.020> or
