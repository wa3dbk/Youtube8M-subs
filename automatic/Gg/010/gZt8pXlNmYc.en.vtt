you can see they're almost black with a
little<00:00:36.390> bit<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> yellow<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.110> that's<00:00:37.530> exactly

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
little bit of yellow and that's exactly

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220 
little bit of yellow and that's exactly
what<00:00:38.370> we're<00:00:38.520> looking<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.390> we're<00:00:40.140> just

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
what we're looking for and we're just

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.840 
what we're looking for and we're just
going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> cut<00:00:40.710> off<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.219> ends<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
going to cut off the ends then with the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.459 
going to cut off the ends then with the
help<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> knife<00:00:45.420> we're<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> barely

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
help of a knife we're going to barely

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.889 
help of a knife we're going to barely
cut<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.280> peel<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.850> either<00:00:48.360> side<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
cut the peel on either side of the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
cut the peel on either side of the
plantain<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> make<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
plantain and this is going to make it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:03.829 
plantain and this is going to make it
easier<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.300> us<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.719> take<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> off

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.680 

and<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.250> can<00:01:06.430> see<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:07.030> plantain<00:01:07.510> is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
and as you can see the plantain is

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:16.470 
and as you can see the plantain is
completely<00:01:08.350> ripened<00:01:08.800> on<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.100> inside

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.730 

now<00:01:17.480> we're<00:01:17.720> just<00:01:17.750> going<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.050> cut<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.650> a

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
now we're just going to cut it in a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.450 
now we're just going to cut it in a
diagonal<00:01:19.100> just<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.790> make<00:01:19.940> some<00:01:20.180> slices<00:01:20.720> I'm

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
diagonal just to make some slices I'm

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.860 
diagonal just to make some slices I'm
making<00:01:22.460> very<00:01:22.640> small<00:01:22.760> slices<00:01:23.450> because<00:01:23.600> I

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
making very small slices because I

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.930 
making very small slices because I
needed<00:01:24.080> two<00:01:24.440> plantains<00:01:24.980> to<00:01:25.250> feed<00:01:25.400> about<00:01:25.610> five

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
needed two plantains to feed about five

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.150 
needed two plantains to feed about five
people<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:26.570> if<00:01:26.690> you<00:01:26.810> want<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:27.590> can<00:01:27.770> make<00:01:27.920> them

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
people but if you want you can make them

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.420 
people but if you want you can make them
bigger

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.800 

another<00:01:36.430> way<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.670> make<00:01:36.940> this<00:01:37.150> is<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.540> fry<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
another way to make this is to fry the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.350 
another way to make this is to fry the
whole<00:01:38.080> plantain<00:01:38.710> if<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:39.010> want<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.180> also

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
whole plantain if you want you can also

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.450 
whole plantain if you want you can also
cut<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.960> through<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.500> middle<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:42.040> end<00:01:42.160> up<00:01:42.310> with

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
cut it through the middle to end up with

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.880 
cut it through the middle to end up with
two<00:01:42.700> big<00:01:42.910> pieces<00:01:43.120> or<00:01:43.570> cut<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:44.440> in<00:01:44.590> half

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
two big pieces or cut it in half

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.890 
two big pieces or cut it in half
whichever<00:01:45.580> way<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:45.850> want<00:01:46.150> is<00:01:46.330> completely

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
whichever way you want is completely

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.560 
whichever way you want is completely
fine<00:01:47.170> but<00:01:47.800> like<00:01:47.980> I<00:01:48.130> said<00:01:48.190> I<00:01:48.460> only<00:01:48.610> had<00:01:49.060> two

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
fine but like I said I only had two

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.110 
fine but like I said I only had two
plantains<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.830> feed<00:01:50.950> about<00:01:51.190> five<00:01:51.460> people<00:01:51.910> so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
plantains to feed about five people so

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.850 
plantains to feed about five people so
that's<00:01:52.240> why<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.540> how<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.780> cut<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.230> into<00:01:53.410> small

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
that's why I how to cut it into small

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:04.470 
that's why I how to cut it into small
slices<00:01:59.580> and<00:02:01.800> then<00:02:02.800> all<00:02:03.130> we<00:02:03.310> have<00:02:03.550> to<00:02:03.730> do<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.180> fry

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
slices and then all we have to do is fry

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.300 
slices and then all we have to do is fry
them<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.110> little<00:02:05.350> bit<00:02:05.440> of<00:02:05.470> oil<00:02:05.800> that's<00:02:06.190> been

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
them in a little bit of oil that's been

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.450 
them in a little bit of oil that's been
heated<00:02:06.880> on<00:02:07.030> medium<00:02:07.570> heat<00:02:08.100> which<00:02:09.100> is<00:02:09.250> going<00:02:09.399> to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
heated on medium heat which is going to

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.680 
heated on medium heat which is going to
add<00:02:09.640> all<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:09.970> our<00:02:10.270> plantain<00:02:10.840> slices<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:12.690> then

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
add all of our plantain slices and then

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.090 
add all of our plantain slices and then
we're<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.080> going<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> fry<00:02:14.500> them<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.740> about

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
we're just going to fry them for about

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.770 
we're just going to fry them for about
three<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.520> five<00:02:15.850> minutes<00:02:16.270> or<00:02:16.480> until<00:02:16.570> golden
