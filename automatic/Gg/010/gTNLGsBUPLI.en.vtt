00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
of room to make profit on this and also

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.250 
of room to make profit on this and also
i<00:01:08.850> waited<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.360> bit<00:01:09.479> too<00:01:09.630> much<00:01:09.780> i<00:01:09.930> didn't<00:01:10.110> pay<00:01:10.200> too

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
i waited a bit too much i didn't pay too
much<00:01:10.350> attention<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.340> after<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:11.790> started

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
much attention but after they started

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.090 
much attention but after they started
rising<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.540> lot<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:13.350> dropped<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:13.950> bit

rising a lot they dropped a little bit

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
rising a lot they dropped a little bit
in<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> end<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.820> i<00:01:14.850> could<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.210> sold<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.689> for

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
much attention there but let me have

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.280 
much attention there but let me have
here<00:02:18.450> vimeo<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.620> for<00:02:19.830> 170<00:02:20.400> sold<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.880> 209<00:02:21.290> have

here vimeo but for 170 sold for 209 have

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.180 
here vimeo but for 170 sold for 209 have
kata<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:23.220> 441<00:02:23.790> sewed<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.330> 67<00:02:24.930> 500<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.620> think

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
kata but 441 sewed for 67 500 I think

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.650 
kata but 441 sewed for 67 500 I think
percentage-wise<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.330> really<00:02:27.570> really

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
percentage-wise it was really really

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.860 
percentage-wise it was really really
good<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.170> mean<00:02:28.820> almost<00:02:29.820> doubled<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.810> amount

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
good I mean almost doubled the amount

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.560 
good I mean almost doubled the amount
inaudible<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:31.920> still<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.460> increased<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.270> lot<00:02:33.390> in

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
inaudible but still I increased a lot in

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.140 
inaudible but still I increased a lot in
value<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.500> then<00:02:34.650> have<00:02:34.860> mensa<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.550> think<00:02:35.970> if<00:02:36.090> we

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
value and then have mensa I think if we

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.420 
value and then have mensa I think if we
could<00:02:36.270> pick<00:02:36.540> him<00:02:36.690> up<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:36.990> around<00:02:37.140> 15<00:02:37.500> k<00:02:37.710> if<00:02:38.130> you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
could pick him up for around 15 k if you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.699 
could pick him up for around 15 k if you
were<00:02:38.930> doing<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.020> happy<00:02:40.140> hours<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.590> stuff

this<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.170> can't<00:04:49.890> tell<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.160> can't<00:04:50.610> say<00:04:50.880> there<00:04:51.030> will

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
this I can't tell I can't say there will

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.520 
this I can't tell I can't say there will
always<00:04:51.330> be<00:04:51.480> like<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:51.750> but<00:04:52.050> I<00:04:52.110> think<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:52.440> this

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
always be like this but I think in this

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.660 
always be like this but I think in this
case<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.950> was<00:04:53.390> but<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:55.590> after<00:04:55.860> this<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.280> lot<00:04:56.640> of

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670

the supply is going to keep decreasing

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.540 
the supply is going to keep decreasing

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
to be pretty high since pretty much go

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.020 
to be pretty high since pretty much go
up<00:05:15.710> because<00:05:16.710> their<00:05:17.160> displays<00:05:17.610> are<00:05:17.820> fresh

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
to invest them just like I did so that

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.450 
to invest them just like I did so that
will<00:05:21.750> push<00:05:21.930> their<00:05:22.110> prices<00:05:22.530> up<00:05:22.770> like<00:05:23.250> this

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
will push their prices up like this

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.120 
will push their prices up like this
let's<00:05:24.240> change<00:05:24.420> the<00:05:24.600> color<00:05:24.630> here<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.680> blue

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
let's change the color here so blue

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.520 
let's change the color here so blue
arrow<00:05:26.640> so<00:05:27.420> that<00:05:27.570> will<00:05:27.690> push<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.960> prices<00:05:28.350> up

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
arrow so that will push the prices up

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.680 
arrow so that will push the prices up
like<00:05:28.860> this<00:05:29.040> so<00:05:29.640> they<00:05:29.820> will<00:05:29.940> keep<00:05:30.060> going<00:05:30.360> up<00:05:30.480> for

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
like this so they will keep going up for

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.320 
like this so they will keep going up for
a<00:05:30.750> while<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.640> this<00:05:32.640> is<00:05:32.760> one<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:32.940> didn't<00:05:33.240> pay

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
a while and this is one I didn't pay

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.090 
a while and this is one I didn't pay
attention<00:05:33.450> because<00:05:33.870> after<00:05:34.230> a<00:05:34.260> while<00:05:34.350> they

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
attention because after a while they

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.820 
attention because after a while they
started<00:05:36.090> going<00:05:36.330> down<00:05:36.540> again<00:05:36.840> and<00:05:37.110> this<00:05:37.650> I

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
started going down again and this I

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.960 
started going down again and this I
think<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:38.160> think<00:05:38.370> this<00:05:38.430> happened<00:05:38.640> because

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
think I think this happened because

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.690 
think I think this happened because
let's<00:05:39.720> change<00:05:40.110> your<00:05:40.320> chip<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:40.800> what<00:05:41.340> happens

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
let's change your chip and what happens

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.370 
let's change your chip and what happens
is<00:05:41.790> after<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.150> while<00:05:42.360> people<00:05:42.390> bought<00:05:42.960> them<00:05:43.170> and

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
is after a while people bought them and

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.990 
is after a while people bought them and
they<00:05:43.830> try<00:05:44.040> them<00:05:44.190> out<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.610> they<00:05:44.700> want<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:44.880> move

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
they try them out and they want to move

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.820 
they try them out and they want to move
on<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.300> something<00:05:45.480> else<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.470> supply<00:05:46.800> of

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
on to something else to the supply of

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.500 
on to something else to the supply of
them<00:05:47.100> they<00:05:47.370> won't<00:05:47.520> start<00:05:47.820> selling<00:05:48.150> them<00:05:48.180> again

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
them they won't start selling them again

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.560 
them they won't start selling them again
so<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:49.020> supply<00:05:49.350> starts<00:05:49.740> going<00:05:50.040> up<00:05:50.130> again<00:05:50.570> and

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
so the supply starts going up again and

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.570 
so the supply starts going up again and
the<00:05:51.750> demand<00:05:52.050> people<00:05:52.410> like<00:05:52.920> I<00:05:52.950> said<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:53.280> start

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
the demand people like I said I start

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.950 
the demand people like I said I start
moving<00:05:53.910> on<00:05:54.000> to<00:05:54.180> other<00:05:54.210> things<00:05:54.390> I<00:05:54.750> start

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
moving on to other things I start

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.870 
moving on to other things I start
looking<00:05:55.230> at<00:05:55.320> other<00:05:55.410> players<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.220> they<00:05:56.700> want

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
looking at other players and they want

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.040 
looking at other players and they want
to<00:05:56.910> sell<00:05:57.090> them<00:05:57.180> on<00:05:57.390> they<00:05:57.540> want<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.810> make<00:05:57.900> their

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
to sell them on they want to make their

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.900 
to sell them on they want to make their
profit<00:05:58.290> if<00:05:58.590> they<00:05:58.740> invested<00:05:59.130> them<00:05:59.250> on<00:05:59.430> him<00:05:59.580> here

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
profit if they invested them on him here

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.960 
profit if they invested them on him here
so<00:06:00.680> you<00:06:01.680> supply<00:06:02.130> increase<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.550> demand<00:06:02.700> it

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
so you supply increase the demand it

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.210 
so you supply increase the demand it
decreases<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:04.170> prices<00:06:04.590> started<00:06:04.860> rapping

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
decreases the prices started rapping

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.130 
decreases the prices started rapping
again<00:06:05.280> so<00:06:05.820> that's<00:06:06.120> pretty<00:06:06.330> much<00:06:06.450> it<00:06:06.510> and

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
again so that's pretty much it and

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.900 
again so that's pretty much it and
eventually<00:06:07.620> they're<00:06:08.010> sort<00:06:08.280> of<00:06:08.370> find<00:06:08.760> their

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
eventually they're sort of find their

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.870 
eventually they're sort of find their
balance<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.510> stay<00:06:10.140> stable<00:06:10.590> for<00:06:10.890> for<00:06:11.700> a<00:06:11.730> while

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
balance and stay stable for for a while

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.030 
balance and stay stable for for a while
maybe<00:06:12.120> so<00:06:12.870> i<00:06:12.900> may<00:06:13.350> be<00:06:13.410> higher<00:06:13.650> than<00:06:13.830> this<00:06:13.980> i

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
maybe so i may be higher than this i

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.920 
maybe so i may be higher than this i
think<00:06:14.310> it's<00:06:14.430> a<00:06:14.490> bit<00:06:14.640> higher<00:06:14.850> the<00:06:15.300> money<00:06:15.480> was<00:06:15.720> as

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
think it's a bit higher the money was as

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.270 
think it's a bit higher the money was as
you<00:06:16.050> can<00:06:16.200> see<00:06:16.320> for<00:06:16.530> the<00:06:16.590> press<00:06:16.770> that<00:06:16.950> I<00:06:16.980> saw

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
you can see for the press that I saw

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.340 
you can see for the press that I saw
them<00:06:17.490> they<00:06:17.700> seem<00:06:18.270> to<00:06:18.330> have<00:06:18.480> set<00:06:18.840> of<00:06:18.990> the<00:06:19.140> price

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
them they seem to have set of the price
