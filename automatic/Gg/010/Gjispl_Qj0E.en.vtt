year before I kill any mob that has a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.140 
year before I kill any mob that has a
higher<00:00:16.170> chance<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.710> dropping<00:00:16.890> yellows<00:00:17.460> so

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
higher chance of dropping yellows so

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.800 
higher chance of dropping yellows so
when<00:00:18.300> doing<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.020> said<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.410> myself<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:20.810> am

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
when doing this I said to myself I am

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.200 
when doing this I said to myself I am
NOT<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> click<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.400> item<00:00:24.000> at<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> time

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
NOT going to click one item at a time

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.109 
NOT going to click one item at a time
and<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.289> slow<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> die<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> process<00:00:26.609> I

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and do it slow and die in the process I

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.240 
and do it slow and die in the process I
wanted<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> fast<00:00:27.810> way<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.680> there<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
wanted a fast way to do it and there is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.120 
wanted a fast way to do it and there is
no<00:00:29.460> set<00:00:29.880> swapping<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.779> game<00:00:31.050> yet<00:00:31.650> which<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
no set swapping in this game yet which I

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.580 
no set swapping in this game yet which I
hope<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.489> add<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.450> here's<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> way<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.559> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
hope they add but here's a way that you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
hope they add but here's a way that you
can<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.219> as<00:00:35.370> long<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> program

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
can do it as long as you have a program

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.150 
can do it as long as you have a program
or<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> newer<00:00:37.230> mouse<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.800> comes<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
or a newer mouse that comes with a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
or a newer mouse that comes with a
program<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:38.610> set<00:00:39.090> point<00:00:39.360> or<00:00:39.540> something<00:00:39.960> but

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
program like set point or something but

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.810 
program like set point or something but
i'm<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> show<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.040> guys<00:00:41.250> how<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
i'm going to show you guys how to do it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.690 
i'm going to show you guys how to do it
with<00:00:41.940> set<00:00:42.149> point<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> your<00:00:44.309> macro

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
with set point so you go to your macro

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
with set point so you go to your macro
manager<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> make<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> new<00:00:45.960> macro<00:00:46.260> i<00:00:46.649> just

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
manager and you make a new macro i just

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.910 
manager and you make a new macro i just
left<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> called<00:00:47.430> new<00:00:47.700> macro<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:49.050> record<00:00:49.739> your

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
left it called new macro you record your

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100 
left it called new macro you record your
mouse<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> check<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.750> multiple

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
mouse have that check to have multiple

like<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.470> how<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.220> slot

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
like this see how I have the one slot

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.730 
like this see how I have the one slot
stuff<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.090> row<00:01:51.270> line<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.409> row<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
stuff in a row line that up in a row so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
stuff in a row line that up in a row so
you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> drag<00:01:53.549> over<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.240> just

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you can just do a drag over it and just

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
you can just do a drag over it and just
hit<00:01:54.630> everything<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.290> straight<00:01:55.590> line<00:01:55.619> as

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
hit everything in a straight line as

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.760 
hit everything in a straight line as
long<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.299> do<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
long as you do that and you just it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
long as you do that and you just it
there's<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> chance<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.180> mess<00:02:00.360> up

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
there's a chance that this can mess up

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.050 
there's a chance that this can mess up
it<00:02:00.780> isn't<00:02:00.930> perfect<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:01.740> practice<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it isn't perfect but practice with it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.730 
it isn't perfect but practice with it
you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.570> slower<00:02:03.899> than<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.229> faster

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
you can do it slower than this faster

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.469 
you can do it slower than this faster
than<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.490> takes<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.909> while<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
than this it takes a while for it to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.479 
than this it takes a while for it to
like<00:02:06.689> slump<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.590> something<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
like slump put something in and out so

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.820 
like slump put something in and out so
it's<00:02:08.640> hard<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.879> mess<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.830> but

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
it's hard to mess it up like that but

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.700 
it's hard to mess it up like that but
hopefully<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.910> will<00:02:12.030> help<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.330> guys<00:02:12.510> out
