what we're trying to do is figure out if

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.630 
what we're trying to do is figure out if
the<00:00:20.490> composition<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.859> the<00:00:22.859> scene<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.400> we

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the composition of the scene that we

the composition of the scene that we
want<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> paint<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.740> pleasing<00:00:26.670> to

want to paint is going to be pleasing to
the<00:00:27.090> eye<00:00:27.119> when<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.289> finally<00:00:28.560> finished

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

now<00:00:29.970> no<00:00:30.240> 10<00:00:30.480> sketches<00:00:30.990> are<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.619> really

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
now no 10 sketches are really really

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.000 
now no 10 sketches are really really
easy<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.460> draw<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.480> there's<00:00:33.899> really<00:00:34.230> no<00:00:34.559> excuse

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
easy to draw so there's really no excuse

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.240 
easy to draw so there's really no excuse
not<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> quickly<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.350> need<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
not to quickly do one all you need is a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.880 
not to quickly do one all you need is a
sheet<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.700> paper<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.840> marker<00:00:42.649> let's<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sheet of paper and the marker let's do a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.000 
sheet of paper and the marker let's do a
no<00:00:44.040> 10<00:00:44.280> sketch<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> scene<00:00:45.239> over<00:00:45.600> yeah<00:00:46.010> what

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
no 10 sketch of the scene over yeah what

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.850 
no 10 sketch of the scene over yeah what
I<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.850> squint<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.539> eyes<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.559> gets

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I do is I squint my eyes and that gets

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.459 
I do is I squint my eyes and that gets
rid<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.940> detail<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.260> we're

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
rid of all the detail because what we're

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.520 
rid of all the detail because what we're
looking<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.699> light<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.260> dark

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
looking for is the light and the dark

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.369 
looking for is the light and the dark
areas<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.170> draw

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
areas that's all so I'm going to draw

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.650 
areas that's all so I'm going to draw
myself<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.949> bounding<00:00:59.399> box<00:00:59.609> on<00:01:00.030> my<00:01:00.270> sheet<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
myself a bounding box on my sheet of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.500 
myself a bounding box on my sheet of
paper<00:01:00.899> roughly<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> proportion<00:01:03.239> over

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
paper roughly to that proportion over

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.859 
paper roughly to that proportion over
there<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.790> again<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.750> an

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
there and again if you don't get an

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.420 
there and again if you don't get an
exact<00:01:07.290> remember<00:01:07.740> these<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.250> little

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
exact remember these are just little

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.899 
exact remember these are just little
quick<00:01:08.820> planning<00:01:09.659> sketches<00:01:10.640> nobody's<00:01:11.640> ever

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
quick planning sketches nobody's ever

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.429 
quick planning sketches nobody's ever
going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.140> end<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
going to see them so if they end up a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.850 
going to see them so if they end up a
little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.860> wonky<00:01:14.070> obscure<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.680> okay

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
little bit wonky obscure so what okay

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.090 
little bit wonky obscure so what okay
see<00:01:17.549> over<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:18.060> I've<00:01:18.630> got<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.900> dark<00:01:19.229> area<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
see over here I've got a dark area and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.140 
see over here I've got a dark area and
over<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.420> I've<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.810> dark<00:01:22.110> area<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.790> area

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
over here I've got a dark area that area

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
over here I've got a dark area that area
there<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.820> this<00:01:26.820> area<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.750> light

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
there and this area here is light

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
there and this area here is light
so<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.310> darks<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.530> these<00:01:31.530> Mullis<00:01:32.240> let's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so these my darks and these Mullis let's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.490 
so these my darks and these Mullis let's
draw<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.869> oh<00:01:34.110> no<00:01:34.759> no<00:01:35.759> 10<00:01:36.000> sketch<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> see

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
draw that in oh no no 10 sketch and see

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.230 
draw that in oh no no 10 sketch and see
how<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> works<00:01:43.520> again<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.670> doesn't<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.119> be

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
how it works again it doesn't have to be

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330 
how it works again it doesn't have to be
exact<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.899> we're<00:01:46.049> interested<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
exact what we're interested in is the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889 
exact what we're interested in is the
basic<00:01:47.759> shapes<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
basic shapes to see if it's going to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
basic shapes to see if it's going to
work<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.619> seem<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> have<00:01:53.040> something<00:01:53.310> like

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
work you seem to have something like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:20.509 
work you seem to have something like
that<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.540> cover<00:01:54.810> them<00:01:55.020> in

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.520 

and<00:02:21.519> there's<00:02:21.849> you<00:02:22.120> got<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> little<00:02:23.110> bit<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.290> dark

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
and there's you got a little bit of dark

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.530 
and there's you got a little bit of dark
going<00:02:23.769> across<00:02:24.040> there<00:02:24.370> as<00:02:24.670> well<00:02:24.909> a<00:02:25.209> better

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
going across there as well a better

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.420 
going across there as well a better
house<00:02:31.409> now<00:02:32.409> what<00:02:32.560> we<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:32.860> do<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.099> we<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.370> take

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
house now what we can do is we can take

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.390 
house now what we can do is we can take
a<00:02:33.670> look<00:02:34.000> at<00:02:34.390> uh<00:02:34.659> no<00:02:34.870> dents

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
a look at uh no dents

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.809 
a look at uh no dents
to<00:02:36.400> see<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:37.330> pleasing<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.230> eye<00:02:38.819> now

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
to see if it's pleasing to the eye now

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.900 
to see if it's pleasing to the eye now
so<00:02:40.360> far<00:02:40.690> that's<00:02:41.230> reasonably<00:02:42.069> pleasing<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.790> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
so far that's reasonably pleasing to the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.839 
so far that's reasonably pleasing to the
eye<00:02:43.140> except<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.290> see<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.620> little<00:02:44.829> gap<00:02:45.549> over

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
eye except you see this little gap over

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.059 
eye except you see this little gap over
there<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.239> seems<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.660> break<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.319> nice<00:02:47.620> flow

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
there it seems to break that nice flow

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.759 
there it seems to break that nice flow
that<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:48.489> have<00:02:48.700> between<00:02:48.879> this<00:02:49.329> light<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.049> that

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
that we have between this light and that

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.259 
that we have between this light and that
light<00:02:50.799> over<00:02:51.430> there<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.590> I'm<00:02:54.340> sure<00:02:54.640> if<00:02:54.879> we<00:02:55.060> take

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
light over there so I'm sure if we take

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.930 
light over there so I'm sure if we take
that<00:02:55.629> piece<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:57.190> whole<00:02:57.459> scene<00:02:57.730> would<00:02:57.910> be

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
that piece out this whole scene would be

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.199 
that piece out this whole scene would be
a<00:02:58.090> lot<00:02:58.299> more<00:02:58.480> pleasing<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.260> eye<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.940> I'm

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
a lot more pleasing to the eye so I'm

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.130 
a lot more pleasing to the eye so I'm
going<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.540> modify<00:03:01.900> my<00:03:02.459> mono<00:03:03.459> ten<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.720> reflect

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
going to modify my mono ten to reflect

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.160 
going to modify my mono ten to reflect
that<00:03:12.870> yeah<00:03:13.870> we<00:03:14.079> have<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.410> piece<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.829> his<00:03:14.980> name

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
that yeah we have that piece of his name

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.900 
that yeah we have that piece of his name
and<00:03:17.170> then<00:03:17.560> we<00:03:17.650> have<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.799> remember<00:03:18.280> coming<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.760> or

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
and then we have I remember coming in or

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.319 
and then we have I remember coming in or
something<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:20.790> there's<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.940> three

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
something like that there's the three

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:29.929 
something like that there's the three
piece<00:03:22.599> over<00:03:22.870> there

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.250 

mr.<00:03:30.939> color<00:03:31.120> remittance<00:03:31.659> is<00:03:31.840> what<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.110> looks

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
mr. color remittance is what it looks

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:45.229 
mr. color remittance is what it looks
like<00:03:32.439> now<00:03:40.230> doesn't<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.290> look<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.739> lot<00:03:41.920> better

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.030 

so<00:03:46.239> now<00:03:46.390> we<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.659> a<00:03:46.689> nice<00:03:46.959> was<00:03:47.349> almost<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.890> bit

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
so now we have a nice was almost a bit

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.800 
so now we have a nice was almost a bit
of<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.189> geometric<00:03:48.730> shape<00:03:48.760> going<00:03:49.239> on<00:03:49.450> over<00:03:49.629> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
of a geometric shape going on over the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.199 
of a geometric shape going on over the
array<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:52.379> quite<00:03:53.379> like<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.340> later

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
array so quite like that and later

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.020 
array so quite like that and later
signed<00:03:55.450> up<00:03:55.930> quite<00:03:56.859> by<00:03:57.040> chance<00:03:57.069> I<00:03:57.609> made<00:03:57.849> that

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
signed up quite by chance I made that

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.780 
signed up quite by chance I made that
taller<00:03:58.480> in<00:03:58.840> there<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.379> there<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.650> the<00:04:00.400> original

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
taller in there in there in the original

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.729 
taller in there in there in the original
sketch<00:04:01.090> then<00:04:01.389> probably<00:04:02.019> what<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.319> is<00:04:02.470> over

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
sketch then probably what it is over

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.500 
sketch then probably what it is over
there<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:02.950> look<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.459> looks<00:04:03.670> quite<00:04:03.879> nice<00:04:04.120> so

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
there but look it looks quite nice so

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:17.529 
there but look it looks quite nice so
let's<00:04:06.810> make<00:04:07.810> another<00:04:08.109> note<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.530> sketch

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.059 

and<00:04:18.539> let's<00:04:18.780> take<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.049> look<00:04:19.319> I'm<00:04:19.620> sure<00:04:19.859> we<00:04:19.979> can

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:20.069 
and let's take a look I'm sure we can

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.969 
and let's take a look I'm sure we can
also<00:04:20.310> improve<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.970> by<00:04:21.419> maybe<00:04:21.979> broadening

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
also improve it by maybe broadening

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.650 
also improve it by maybe broadening
better<00:04:23.250> than<00:04:23.639> here<00:04:25.580> like<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.819> but<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.360> few

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
better than here like that but a few

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.550 
better than here like that but a few
little<00:04:28.250> pleas<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.280> goodies<00:04:29.789> over<00:04:30.090> there<00:04:30.680> and

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
little pleas and goodies over there and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.350 
little pleas and goodies over there and
what<00:04:34.560> about<00:04:34.800> if<00:04:34.919> we<00:04:34.949> broaden<00:04:35.669> our<00:04:35.789> River<00:04:36.150> over

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
what about if we broaden our River over

00:04:36.360 --> 00:05:08.930 
what about if we broaden our River over
there

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.830 

now<00:05:09.940> I'm<00:05:10.120> pretty<00:05:10.270> happy<00:05:10.540> with<00:05:10.780> that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
now I'm pretty happy with that

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.170 
now I'm pretty happy with that
composition<00:05:11.590> notice<00:05:12.220> how<00:05:12.430> because<00:05:12.820> the

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
composition notice how because the

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.510 
composition notice how because the
state's<00:05:13.480> narrower<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:14.320> narrower<00:05:14.520> it's

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
state's narrower and narrower it's

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.150 
state's narrower and narrower it's
leaving<00:05:15.820> my<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:16.090> bit<00:05:16.570> into<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:16.990> picture<00:05:17.380> and

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
leaving my I bit into the picture and

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:30.140 
leaving my I bit into the picture and
I've<00:05:18.340> got<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:18.550> bit<00:05:18.820> of<00:05:18.940> interest<00:05:19.270> over<00:05:19.630> there

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.210
