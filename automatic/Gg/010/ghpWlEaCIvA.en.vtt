00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
how much momentum really gets into this

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.840 
how much momentum really gets into this
router<00:01:19.740> there's<00:01:20.100> been<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.460> been<00:01:20.640> very

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
router there's been it's been very

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.370 
router there's been it's been very
streaky<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.689> player<00:01:21.900> wins<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> bunch

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
streaky where one player wins a bunch

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
streaky where one player wins a bunch
and<00:01:22.470> Rove<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.890> Djokovic<00:01:23.670> can't<00:01:24.030> lose<00:01:24.240> any

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and Rove and Djokovic can't lose any

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
and Rove and Djokovic can't lose any
more<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.140> not<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.770> owns<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.159> again

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
more and then not at all owns them again

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.789 
more and then not at all owns them again
and<00:01:26.640> seems<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.390> make<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:27.689> little

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
and seems like they make these little

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.950 
and seems like they make these little
adjustments<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:29.790> win<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.210> big<00:01:30.420> match<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
adjustments they win one big match and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.149 
adjustments they win one big match and
then<00:01:31.200> they're<00:01:31.350> sort<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> off<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> rolling

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
then they're sort of off and rolling

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.350 
then they're sort of off and rolling
again<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.520> mean<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> me<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.210> almost

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
again I mean to me it's almost

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.149 
again I mean to me it's almost
impossible<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.140> predict<00:01:34.530> what's<00:01:34.950> gonna

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
impossible to predict what's gonna

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.649 
impossible to predict what's gonna
happen<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.640> year<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.240> they're<00:01:36.390> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
happen this year you know they're so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.149 
happen this year you know they're so
tight<00:01:36.930> they're<00:01:37.229> having<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:37.650> swings<00:01:37.979> it's

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
tight they're having these swings it's

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.830 
tight they're having these swings it's
almost<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.700> hot<00:01:39.210> potato

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
almost like this hot potato

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.749 
almost like this hot potato
you<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.229> who's<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.430> know<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> they

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
you know they who's up you know and they

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.460 
you know they who's up you know and they
then<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.180> they<00:01:42.509> can't<00:01:42.750> hold<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
then they they can't hold on to it you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
then they they can't hold on to it you
know<00:01:43.590> even<00:01:43.890> though<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> good<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.570> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
know even though it's a good thing and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.940 
know even though it's a good thing and
they<00:01:45.689> give<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> other<00:01:46.200> guy<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> then

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
they give it to the other guy and then

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
they give it to the other guy and then
that<00:01:47.070> runs<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> while<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> don't<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that runs for a while so I don't know it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.450 
that runs for a while so I don't know it
does<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.320> me<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.619> had<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> pick<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.159> feel<00:01:50.310> like

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
does to me if I had to pick I feel like

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.920 
does to me if I had to pick I feel like
Rafa<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.850> gonna<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> better<00:01:51.450> year<00:01:51.720> in

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.010 
Rafa is gonna have the better year in
the<00:01:52.049> rivalry<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:53.130> feels<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:54.420> me<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.570> that's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the rivalry it feels to me like that's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.690 
the rivalry it feels to me like that's
where<00:01:55.259> things<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> moment<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
where things are at the moment and it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.719 
where things are at the moment and it
also<00:01:57.180> seems<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.780> me<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.070> watch<00:01:59.280> them<00:01:59.549> over

also seems to me as you watch them over

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.209 
also seems to me as you watch them over
the<00:01:59.850> long<00:02:00.090> haul<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.869> rafa's<00:02:01.409> built<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.920> little

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the long haul that rafa's built a little

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.190 
the long haul that rafa's built a little
more<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.090> long<00:02:03.360> haul<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.049> he<00:02:04.110> spent

more for the long haul you know he spent
all<00:02:04.500> those<00:02:04.740> years<00:02:04.850> at<00:02:05.850> number<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.390> with<00:02:07.049> Roger

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
all those years at number two with Roger

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.669 
all those years at number two with Roger
never<00:02:08.310> got<00:02:08.520> discouraged<00:02:09.030> by<00:02:09.119> being

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
never got discouraged by being

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.199 
never got discouraged by being
you<00:02:10.129> know<00:02:10.250> right<00:02:10.459> there<00:02:10.609> but<00:02:10.819> not<00:02:10.969> quite

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
you know right there but not quite

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.610 
you know right there but not quite
number<00:02:11.510> one<00:02:11.719> he's<00:02:11.930> gone<00:02:12.079> up<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.409> down<00:02:12.500> a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
number one he's gone up and down a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.390 
number one he's gone up and down a
little<00:02:12.890> bit

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
little bit

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.699 
little bit
he<00:02:13.579> just<00:02:13.760> seems<00:02:13.939> to<00:02:14.000> ride<00:02:14.299> out<00:02:14.540> whatever<00:02:15.469> it<00:02:15.620> is

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
he just seems to ride out whatever it is

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.050 
he just seems to ride out whatever it is
you<00:02:15.950> know<00:02:16.010> he's<00:02:16.189> out<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:16.459> seven<00:02:16.760> months<00:02:16.969> with

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
you know he's out for seven months with

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.630 
you know he's out for seven months with
the<00:02:17.180> knee<00:02:17.439> so<00:02:18.439> it<00:02:18.680> feels<00:02:18.890> like<00:02:19.099> if<00:02:19.219> he<00:02:19.250> stays

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
the knee so it feels like if he stays

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.390 
the knee so it feels like if he stays
healthy<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.719> just<00:02:21.379> feel<00:02:21.530> like<00:02:21.650> he's<00:02:21.859> much<00:02:22.129> more

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
healthy I just feel like he's much more

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.039 
healthy I just feel like he's much more
steady<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.180> long<00:02:23.329> term<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:23.689> joke<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.989> it

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
steady in the long term and joke of it

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.750 
steady in the long term and joke of it
just<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.319> little<00:02:24.349> more<00:02:24.560> up<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.519> down

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
just a little more up and down

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.250 
just a little more up and down
now<00:02:26.150> we're<00:02:26.420> seem<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.989> be<00:02:27.079> it's<00:02:27.170> this

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
now we're seem to be it's this

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.440 
now we're seem to be it's this
interesting<00:02:27.769> place<00:02:28.040> where<00:02:28.069> at<00:02:28.609> some<00:02:29.150> level

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
interesting place where at some level

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.879 
interesting place where at some level
it's<00:02:29.569> about<00:02:29.750> X's<00:02:30.109> and<00:02:30.200> O's<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.409> whether

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
it's about X's and O's and whether

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's about X's and O's and whether
Djokovic<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.969> shorten<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.569> cord<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.079> take

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
Djokovic can shorten the cord and take

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.599 
Djokovic can shorten the cord and take
away<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.590> down<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.739> line<00:02:33.980> backhand<00:02:34.219> but

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
away the down the line backhand but

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.270 
away the down the line backhand but
really<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.239> think<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.439> is<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:36.769> mental<00:02:37.129> right

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
really I think this is so mental right

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.349 
really I think this is so mental right
now<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.579> think<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.849> interesting<00:02:38.180> thing<00:02:38.329> for

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
now I think the interesting thing for

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.629 
now I think the interesting thing for
from<00:02:39.109> Nadal's<00:02:39.439> perspective<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.219> yeah<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
from Nadal's perspective is that yeah I

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.580 
from Nadal's perspective is that yeah I
would<00:02:41.120> say<00:02:41.659> if<00:02:41.780> you're<00:02:41.989> not<00:02:42.049> reaching<00:02:42.319> by

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
would say if you're not reaching by

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.080 
would say if you're not reaching by
saying<00:02:42.859> this<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.280> first<00:02:43.310> tennis<00:02:43.849> player

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
saying this is the first tennis player

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.479 
saying this is the first tennis player
in<00:02:44.359> his<00:02:44.930> entire<00:02:45.319> life<00:02:45.620> since<00:02:45.980> he<00:02:46.069> was<00:02:46.189> a<00:02:46.220> kid

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
in his entire life since he was a kid

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.729 
in his entire life since he was a kid
who's<00:02:47.359> been<00:02:47.419> in<00:02:48.139> his<00:02:48.260> head<00:02:48.439> and<00:02:48.530> been<00:02:48.709> a

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
who's been in his head and been a

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.589 
who's been in his head and been a
consistent<00:02:49.489> problem<00:02:49.819> frame<00:02:50.180> because<00:02:50.389> even

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
consistent problem frame because even

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.229 
consistent problem frame because even
Federer<00:02:50.870> wasn't<00:02:51.349> a<00:02:51.409> consistent<00:02:51.950> problem<00:02:52.239> he's

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
Federer wasn't a consistent problem he's

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.610 
Federer wasn't a consistent problem he's
always<00:02:53.510> had<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.019> advantage<00:02:54.349> of<00:02:54.379> it<00:02:54.500> he's

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
always had the advantage of it he's

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.920 
always had the advantage of it he's
always<00:02:54.859> been<00:02:55.219> beaten<00:02:55.969> everybody<00:02:56.510> he's<00:02:56.659> played

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
always been beaten everybody he's played

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.449 
always been beaten everybody he's played
more<00:02:57.169> often<00:02:57.349> than<00:02:57.620> they'd<00:02:57.739> beaten<00:02:58.040> him<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
more often than they'd beaten him and

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.649 
more often than they'd beaten him and
he's<00:02:58.579> got<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.909> on<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.180> guy<00:02:59.329> but<00:02:59.540> it's

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
he's got that on this guy but it's

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.119 
he's got that on this guy but it's
really<00:02:59.989> tight<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.590> think<00:03:00.769> it's<00:03:00.859> a<00:03:00.950> weird

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
really tight and I think it's a weird

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.830 
really tight and I think it's a weird
thing<00:03:01.250> for<00:03:01.489> him<00:03:01.819> he's<00:03:01.939> never<00:03:02.090> quite<00:03:02.389> had<00:03:02.569> there

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
thing for him he's never quite had there

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
psychological because I think Nadal was

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.770 
psychological because I think Nadal was
the<00:03:23.810> best<00:03:24.079> fighter<00:03:24.409> in<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.709> game<00:03:25.069> bar<00:03:25.400> none
