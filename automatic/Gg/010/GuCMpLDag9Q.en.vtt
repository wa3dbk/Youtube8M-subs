00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 and even the girls as they are I hope that 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.420
 they are super well as always the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.110
 today's video is going to be something interesting 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.269
 since it 's some information maybe you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.790
 you already have this in your house and the truth is 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.430
 that not even of these the video is 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.220
 it's about the dukes or duplicates 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.289
 of some sea lipsticks 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.430
 I know there are many more explained 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.220
 but I do not know I do not have lipsticks or 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.160
 I do not have the others when I have the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.590
 dukes so I did it with sap them that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.760
 I have to with the passage of time in 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.450
 the account that they are almost or almost the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.520
 same tone and I wanted to share it with 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170
 you because sometimes they ask me 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.680
 garment that lipstick you are using no 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.860
 it is the number 9 of mac that I mention 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.860
 but it does not know what looks like because the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 subject is very clear then in that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.699
 I do not know what to answer them because 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.489
 I have them at hand or so 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.660
 or maybe my self is I knew what 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.120
 had in 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.790
 more economical so those that I could 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.370
 realize that they are almost identical 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.750
 I want to share them in this video and 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:19.830
 I hope and start that is the tone of the sea 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.490
 is the morange tone that is this 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.509
 super orange 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.270
 and the one that I have that looks like this 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.409
 this one of the mark back in white that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:39.520
 is the number 970 then I'm going to 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:43.860
 do the comparison of each one this is 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.860
 the subject that is putting it here 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.469
 and this is the huetamo 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.940
 the truth is that they are very similar or is 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.540
 compared to what this costs as 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:07.020
 how much with branded honey 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:10.000
 I think it costs about $ 16 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.750
 I think yes like 16 dollars and this 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.820
 it costs 199 the only thing that is if it's 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.520
 like that more brightness cited that is but 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.070
 be at a glance here I expect it very 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.990
 similar very similar alternative 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:31.750
 would be of the reverse tone of higher no 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:35.590
 number 6 party of the brand italy no of 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.680
 the clean color mark then this is the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.720
 reverse of marc that is of those of the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.170
 most famous lipsticks that has this 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.890
 brand I think and this is the clean color 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.220
 the party tone 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.140
 as you can tell, it's very similar 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.300
 that is not as I tell you, it is not 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.280
 exactly the same color but they are 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.160
 very good alternatives that if you guys 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.190
 can not get the sea â€‹â€‹can 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.500
 get the clean color llosa less 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.780
 of the half much less than half 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.600
 because this the clean color costs 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.520
 like two dollars I think or a dollar if 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.560
 several purchases, even sometimes you can 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.930
 find up to one dollar and the one 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.940
 rebel mack then if it counts as 16 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.000
 another alternative to this mack lip 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.380
 that also that is a color like red 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.080
 icing so super super called is this 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.560
 which is the number 0 will not escape from 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.560
 Jordan 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.660
 Even the subject is still a bit more 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.380
 dark but this one yes if you give him another 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.500
 last or equal you can put a little 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.600
 of eyeliner and you will see that it remains the same 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.090
 tone that is others that are also very 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.090
 similar is this which is the tone 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.489
 klinko of sea and east in tone 24 of visu 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.190
 the truth is that they are very similar are 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.550
 these two this is the subject and this is the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.090
 of vissum as I tell you is a very 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.310
 good alternative at a super price 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.130
 access and I think they come out like 20 pesos 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.680
 the visu lipsticks so I think it 's 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.620
 an excellent option the next that 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.459
 I have also this is that tone is not 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.459
 brand 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.850
 this 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:34.420
 and this is very similar to color 49 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.240
 lavender lady from jordan and this is like 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.390
 lights of jordan and I'll do what 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.540
 are the samples so that you can 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.640
 see it better with their own leaves and they are 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.640
 and that is this one looks a little more 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.400
 dark here in the camera obviously by 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.640
 the light and everything is because of the shadow that there is 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.000
 but at first glance the truth is that I 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.120
 I look at them and they look or are almost identical 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.400
 the camera will not always capture it 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.800
 what is it but the truth is that I 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.220
 I say it is very similar the tone is not and 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.520
 the number 49 tone of jordan to are almost 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.850
 identical so you know girls can 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.650
 make your list of the mac dukes for 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.680
 that you guys are making your collection 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.380
 of mac but with more accessible brands 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.000
 you can go this by making your list and to 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.409
 when they walk in stores and they bump 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.059
 with jordan its color 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.999
 that we forget what it is that 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:35.789
 they have to buy and you know girls the 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:39.149

 I hope you like this video and I 

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:42.760

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.920

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.900

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.900

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.630
 clear economic products tops 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.240

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.940
 so they look like please leave me the 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.710
 know in your comments that not always 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.390
 I have time to answer the why 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.580
 The truth is that they are very many and that 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.130
 It takes a long time but if 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.340
 I am constantly reading them even 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.810
 if we were answered but that is maybe 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.250
 Sometimes I can pass one because 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.580
 Sometimes girls get angry and they tell me 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.010
 you did not answer me and it's like that but 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.450
 as I tell you it 's depends when I get 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.070
 and I look at the comments at that moment 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.390
 are the ones that I start to answer but 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.280
 please do not stop leaving us your 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.400
 comments because I love reading them and 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.370
 know that they like what I do so 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.490
 They give me more encouragement and motivate me to do more 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:40.620
