00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
whether it's a high punch a medium sized

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.750 
whether it's a high punch a medium sized
pot<00:02:11.630> or<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:12.080> mid-level<00:02:12.830> punch<00:02:13.190> or<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.430> low-level

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
pot or a mid-level punch or a low-level

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.530 
pot or a mid-level punch or a low-level
punch<00:02:14.410> you're<00:02:15.410> hitting<00:02:15.800> them<00:02:16.540> you're

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
punch you're hitting them you're

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.930 
punch you're hitting them you're
punching<00:02:17.870> them<00:02:18.320> with<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> palm<00:02:18.950> your<00:02:19.550> heading

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
punching them with the palm your heading

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.590 
punching them with the palm your heading
so<00:02:20.570> she's<00:02:20.780> coming<00:02:20.990> in<00:02:21.200> bang<00:02:21.890> pushing<00:02:22.820> there<00:02:23.030> so

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
so she's coming in bang pushing there so

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.620 
so she's coming in bang pushing there so
either<00:02:23.750> pushing<00:02:24.110> coming<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.160> they're<00:02:25.630> pushing

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
either pushing coming in they're pushing

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.650 
either pushing coming in they're pushing
the<00:02:26.750> wrist<00:02:27.460> or<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.520> elbow<00:02:28.970> just<00:02:29.300> comes<00:02:29.570> from

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
the wrist or the elbow just comes from

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.480 
the wrist or the elbow just comes from
the<00:02:29.750> other<00:02:29.930> side<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:36.100> remember<00:02:37.100> what<00:02:37.340> we're

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
the other side so remember what we're

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.130 
the other side so remember what we're
doing<00:02:37.700> with<00:02:37.850> us<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.240> we're<00:02:38.420> pushing<00:02:38.780> across

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
doing with us is we're pushing across

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.170 
doing with us is we're pushing across
with<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> palm<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.220> we're<00:02:40.370> pushing<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.030> we're

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
with the palm so we're pushing and we're

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.540 
with the palm so we're pushing and we're
striking<00:02:41.690> with<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.080> palm<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.040> push<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
striking with the palm and push the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.540 
striking with the palm and push the
other<00:02:43.580> side<00:02:44.530> with<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.770> technique<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.430> can

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
other side with this technique you can

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.700 
other side with this technique you can
either<00:02:46.730> go<00:02:46.970> for<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.360> inside<00:02:47.780> line<00:02:48.260> or<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
either go for the inside line or the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.640 
either go for the inside line or the
outside<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:50.150> she's<00:02:50.660> attacking<00:02:51.050> me

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
outside so she's attacking me

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.090 
outside so she's attacking me
I<00:02:51.680> can't<00:02:52.550> block<00:02:53.030> across<00:02:53.300> outside<00:02:53.960> and<00:02:54.920> that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
I can't block across outside and that

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.410 
I can't block across outside and that
means<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.680> may<00:02:57.680> seem<00:02:57.950> flying<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.580> not<00:02:58.790> able

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
means that I may seem flying is not able

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.660 
means that I may seem flying is not able
to<00:02:59.540> hit<00:02:59.750> her<00:02:59.930> directly<00:03:00.290> but<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:01.370> means<00:03:01.490> that

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
to hit her directly but it means that

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.479 
to hit her directly but it means that
she's<00:03:01.940> now<00:03:02.090> tacked<00:03:02.450> up<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.959> can<00:03:03.920> strike<00:03:04.160> but<00:03:04.400> it

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
she's now tacked up I can strike but it

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.510 
she's now tacked up I can strike but it
protects<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:05.209> lot<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.930> her<00:03:06.080> body<00:03:06.320> or<00:03:07.130> if<00:03:07.310> she's

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
protects a lot of her body or if she's

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.620 
protects a lot of her body or if she's
punching<00:03:07.790> me<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.650> can<00:03:09.650> go<00:03:09.800> inside<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:11.390> still

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
punching me I can go inside this still

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.850 
punching me I can go inside this still
leaves<00:03:11.780> me<00:03:12.050> exposed<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.770> hand<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:14.860> it

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
leaves me exposed to this hand but it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.460 
leaves me exposed to this hand but it
means<00:03:16.610> I<00:03:16.820> have<00:03:17.060> more<00:03:17.300> target<00:03:17.810> areas<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.260> choose

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
means I have more target areas to choose

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.030 
means I have more target areas to choose
from<00:03:18.830> so<00:03:19.730> she's<00:03:20.000> punching<00:03:20.239> in<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:21.380> come<00:03:21.770> here

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
from so she's punching in I come here

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.490 
from so she's punching in I come here
but<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.700> have<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.180> stop<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.630> coming<00:03:24.050> immediate

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
but I have to stop that coming immediate

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.710 
but I have to stop that coming immediate
so<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.010> have<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.280> immediately<00:03:25.489> take<00:03:26.420> her<00:03:26.600> off

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
so I have to immediately take her off

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.800 
so I have to immediately take her off
balance<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.580> then<00:03:28.580> do<00:03:28.820> my<00:03:29.570> follow-up<00:03:30.050> strike

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
balance and then do my follow-up strike

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.790 
balance and then do my follow-up strike
going<00:03:32.810> outside<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:35.050> have<00:03:36.050> more<00:03:36.290> options<00:03:36.500> I

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
going outside so I have more options I

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.870 
going outside so I have more options I
have<00:03:36.890> more<00:03:37.070> time<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.700> study<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.330> have<00:03:39.140> more

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
have more time to study I have more

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.410 
have more time to study I have more
options<00:03:40.880> but<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.330> have<00:03:41.570> these<00:03:41.810> targets
