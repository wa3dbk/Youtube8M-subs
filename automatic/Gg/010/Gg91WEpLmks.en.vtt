personally find third person to be a
little<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:18.900> better<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.350> because<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.799> sort

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
little bit better just because you sort

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.859 
little bit better just because you sort
of<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> full-on<00:01:21.180> view<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> everything

push you have to keep tapping W as if
you<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.570> each<00:01:36.810> tap<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.350> W<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.890> an<00:01:38.070> actual<00:01:38.490> push

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you know each tap of W is an actual push

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
you know each tap of W is an actual push
and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.659> you'll<00:01:39.780> hit<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:39.960> top<00:01:40.200> speed<00:01:40.380> start

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and then you'll hit your top speed start

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.010 
and then you'll hit your top speed start
slowing<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.150> you'll<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.659> hit

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
slowing down and then you'll have to hit

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
slowing down and then you'll have to hit
W<00:01:43.320> again<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.890> order<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> sort<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> keep

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
W again in order to sort of keep

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
W again in order to sort of keep
yourself<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.290> how<00:01:46.530> actually

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
yourself going so that's how actually

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.289 
yourself going so that's how actually
propelling<00:01:47.369> yourself<00:01:47.460> forward<00:01:47.820> works<00:01:48.090> then

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
propelling yourself forward works then

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.210 
propelling yourself forward works then
when<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.600> ollie<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.680> actually<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
when you ollie you actually have a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980 
when you ollie you actually have a
chance<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.850> some<00:01:51.060> tricks<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.840> way<00:01:51.930> you

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
chance to do some tricks and the way you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.889 
chance to do some tricks and the way you
do<00:01:52.170> those<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> s<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.299> D<00:01:54.630> keys

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
do those is with the the a s and D keys

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.859 
do those is with the the a s and D keys
so<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> straight<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.070> left<00:01:56.880> push<00:01:57.240> will<00:01:57.719> do

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
so just to straight up left push will do

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.810 
so just to straight up left push will do
a<00:01:57.899> kickflip<00:01:58.380> right<00:01:58.979> push<00:01:59.189> will<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> heel

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
a kickflip right push will do a heel

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700 
a kickflip right push will do a heel
flip<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.899> combo<00:02:01.290> em<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> do

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
flip and then you can combo em to do

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
flip and then you can combo em to do
things<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.130> pop<00:02:02.430> shove-its<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.240> varial

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
things like pop shove-its and varial

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.990 
things like pop shove-its and varial
kick<00:02:04.350> flips<00:02:04.619> varial<00:02:05.100> heelflip<00:02:05.579> s--<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:05.939> I

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
kick flips varial heelflip s-- I think I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.119 
kick flips varial heelflip s-- I think I
just<00:02:06.210> reversed<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:07.049> whatever<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.890> then

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
just reversed that but whatever and then

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.150 
just reversed that but whatever and then
get<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> little<00:02:08.910> bit<00:02:09.090> height<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> 360

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
get a little bit height you can do a 360

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.580 
get a little bit height you can do a 360
flip<00:02:11.190> which<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:12.030> will<00:02:12.599> try<00:02:12.780> doing<00:02:13.080> from<00:02:13.410> here<00:02:13.560> I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
flip which I will try doing from here I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
flip which I will try doing from here I
know

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
know

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620 
know
get<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.100> every<00:02:14.310> time<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.790> yeah<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.330> didn't<00:02:15.570> get

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
get it every time but yeah it didn't get

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.090 
get it every time but yeah it didn't get
it<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.870> time<00:02:16.140> all<00:02:16.320> right<00:02:16.500> don't<00:02:16.650> don't<00:02:16.950> worry

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
it that time all right don't don't worry

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.340 
it that time all right don't don't worry
I<00:02:17.340> got<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:18.120> got<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:18.990> we<00:02:19.050> go

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
I got this I got this here we go

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.490 
I got this I got this here we go
three<00:02:19.740> flip<00:02:19.890> God<00:02:20.700> dang<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.870> um<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
three flip God dang it it's um a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.350 
three flip God dang it it's um a
thriller<00:02:23.190> actually<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.640> would<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.880> 360

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360

thriller actually this would be a 360
heel<00:02:24.750> flip<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.140> think<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:25.590> come<00:02:26.160> on<00:02:26.280> come<00:02:26.490> on

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
heel flip I think but come on come on

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.330 
heel flip I think but come on come on
there<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.030> go<00:02:27.060> oh<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:28.080> barely<00:02:28.440> squeaking<00:02:29.280> by

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
there we go oh just barely squeaking by

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.240 
there we go oh just barely squeaking by
on<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.540> haven't<00:02:31.410> fallen<00:02:31.590> yet<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.160> you

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
on it so I haven't fallen yet but you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.060 
on it so I haven't fallen yet but you
can<00:02:32.400> fall<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.260> actually<00:02:34.260> allow<00:02:34.500> me<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.740> swap

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
can fall and actually allow me to swap

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.610 
can fall and actually allow me to swap
on<00:02:35.310> into<00:02:35.910> survival<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> has

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
on into survival because it has

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.310 
on into survival because it has
consequences<00:02:38.160> when<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.850> do<00:02:39.390> fall<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.140> all

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
consequences when you do fall so all

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.800 
consequences when you do fall so all
eggs<00:02:40.980> an<00:02:41.250> f1<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.180> actually<00:02:42.300> see<00:02:42.660> what

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
eggs an f1 so you can actually see what

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.750 
eggs an f1 so you can actually see what
happened<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.410> I'm<00:02:43.620> gonna<00:02:43.740> land<00:02:43.980> sideways<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
happened so I'm gonna land sideways and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.420 
happened so I'm gonna land sideways and
it<00:02:45.750> should<00:02:46.050> actually<00:02:46.290> caused<00:02:46.680> me<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.980> fall<00:02:47.250> off

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it should actually caused me to fall off

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.680 
it should actually caused me to fall off
there<00:02:47.670> we<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.060> take<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.240> little<00:02:48.390> bit<00:02:48.600> of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
there we go and I take a little bit of

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.120 
there we go and I take a little bit of
damage<00:02:49.080> fall<00:02:49.290> off<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> board<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> have<00:02:50.010> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
damage fall off the board and I have to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.699 
damage fall off the board and I have to
get<00:02:50.250> back<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.910> then<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.959> keep<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.680> going

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
get back on and then I can keep on going

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.160 
get back on and then I can keep on going
also<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.880> take<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.209> little<00:02:54.450> bit<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.690> damage<00:02:54.840> if

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
also you take a little bit of damage if

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.620 
also you take a little bit of damage if
you<00:02:55.260> fall<00:02:55.530> off<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.790> pretty<00:02:56.790> high<00:02:57.000> jump<00:02:57.450> I

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
you fall off a pretty high jump I

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.600 
you fall off a pretty high jump I
shouldn't<00:02:58.230> say<00:02:58.380> fall<00:02:58.620> off<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.130> just<00:02:59.340> do<00:02:59.580> a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
shouldn't say fall off if you just do a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.430 
shouldn't say fall off if you just do a
really<00:02:59.850> high<00:03:00.120> jump<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.810> takes<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.320> little

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
really high jump it it takes a little

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.930 
really high jump it it takes a little
damage<00:03:01.770> but<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:01.980> know<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.250> worth<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.700> in

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
damage but you know it's worth it in

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.930 
damage but you know it's worth it in
order<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:04.050> your<00:03:04.230> you're<00:03:04.800> sick<00:03:05.160> escape
