00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
going to plug in the broadcaster this is

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.670 
going to plug in the broadcaster this is
the<00:05:55.700> top-of-the-line<00:05:55.910> one<00:05:56.870> of<00:05:57.140> theirs<00:05:57.350> that<00:05:57.410> I

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
the top-of-the-line one of theirs that I

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.740 
the top-of-the-line one of theirs that I
own<00:05:57.890> they<00:05:58.340> do<00:05:58.400> go<00:05:58.760> up<00:05:59.030> and<00:05:59.210> up<00:05:59.300> and<00:05:59.420> up<00:05:59.510> and<00:05:59.690> up

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
own they do go up and up and up and up

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.370 
own they do go up and up and up and up
and<00:05:59.870> up<00:06:00.020> but<00:06:00.470> this<00:06:00.710> one<00:06:00.920> is<00:06:01.310> just<00:06:02.120> beautiful<00:06:02.600> ok

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.300 
think you can really hear a difference
in<00:07:02.479> the<00:07:02.599> mics<00:07:02.840> you<00:07:03.409> do<00:07:03.590> want<00:07:03.800> to<00:07:03.860> pay<00:07:04.039> attention

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
in the mics you do want to pay attention

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.010 
in the mics you do want to pay attention
and<00:07:04.610> try<00:07:04.729> and<00:07:04.909> keep<00:07:05.030> the<00:07:05.210> same<00:07:05.389> distance<00:07:05.870> away

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
and try and keep the same distance away

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.629 
and try and keep the same distance away
and<00:07:06.379> make<00:07:06.530> sure<00:07:06.710> you<00:07:06.830> get<00:07:06.949> your<00:07:07.129> levels<00:07:07.460> done

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
and make sure you get your levels done

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.179 
and make sure you get your levels done
right<00:07:07.939> if<00:07:08.150> you<00:07:08.419> clip<00:07:08.990> it's<00:07:09.259> like<00:07:09.590> your

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:10.189 
right if you clip it's like your

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:11.529 
right if you clip it's like your
highlights<00:07:10.610> and<00:07:10.759> your<00:07:10.909> shadows<00:07:11.270> in

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:11.539 
highlights and your shadows in

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:14.769 
highlights and your shadows in
photography<00:07:12.139> if<00:07:12.439> you<00:07:12.819> overdo<00:07:13.819> them<00:07:14.029> or<00:07:14.240> undo

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:14.779 
photography if you overdo them or undo

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.110 
photography if you overdo them or undo
them<00:07:14.990> and<00:07:15.169> get<00:07:15.590> into<00:07:15.830> the<00:07:15.919> red<00:07:16.129> then<00:07:16.430> you<00:07:16.789> have

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
them and get into the red then you have

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.149 
them and get into the red then you have
really<00:07:17.449> ruined<00:07:17.689> the<00:07:18.110> file<00:07:18.379> so<00:07:18.740> hopefully<00:07:19.129> I

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:19.159 
really ruined the file so hopefully I

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:20.709 
really ruined the file so hopefully I
haven't<00:07:19.400> done<00:07:19.610> that<00:07:19.729> on<00:07:19.879> any<00:07:20.090> of<00:07:20.240> these<00:07:20.419> I'm

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:20.719 
haven't done that on any of these I'm

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:22.749

still<00:07:21.080> a<00:07:21.259> work<00:07:21.469> in<00:07:21.500> progress<00:07:21.680> I'm<00:07:22.250> learning<00:07:22.639> as

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 
still a work in progress I'm learning as

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:23.140 
still a work in progress I'm learning as
I<00:07:22.909> go

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150 
I go

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.879
