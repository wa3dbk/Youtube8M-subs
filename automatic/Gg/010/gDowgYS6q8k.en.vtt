00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
all right guys the best way I could

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.039 
all right guys the best way I could
figure<00:02:21.820> out<00:02:21.940> how<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.150> do<00:02:22.329> this<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.840> that

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
figure out how to do this is that that

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.479 
figure out how to do this is that that
screw<00:02:23.230> does<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.500> doesn't<00:02:24.040> work<00:02:24.160> as<00:02:24.310> well

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
screw does it doesn't work as well

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.610 
screw does it doesn't work as well
putting<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.359> as<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.630> does<00:02:25.720> getting<00:02:25.900> off<00:02:26.109> is

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
putting it on as it does getting off is

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.530 
putting it on as it does getting off is
you<00:02:26.769> have<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.130> have<00:02:27.280> this<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.760> slight<00:02:28.150> angle

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
you have to have this on a slight angle

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.500 
you have to have this on a slight angle
upward<00:02:29.109> this<00:02:29.980> hook<00:02:30.280> here<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:31.299> otherwise

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
upward this hook here because otherwise

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.979 
upward this hook here because otherwise
this<00:02:31.720> rubber<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:33.190> keeps<00:02:33.579> hitting<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.090> side

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
this rubber not keeps hitting the side

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.740 
this rubber not keeps hitting the side
of<00:02:35.019> where<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.709> hook<00:02:35.859> it<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.660> obviously<00:02:37.660> is

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
of where you hook it on and obviously is

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.180 
of where you hook it on and obviously is
going<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> look<00:02:38.019> easy<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.769> don't<00:02:38.859> want<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.100> do

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
going to look easy you don't want to do

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.920 
going to look easy you don't want to do
it<00:02:39.280> without<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.549> battery<00:02:39.730> but<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.690> get<00:02:40.810> it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
it without the battery but you get it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.539 
it without the battery but you get it
like<00:02:41.079> you<00:02:41.109> got<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.650> keep<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.890> at<00:02:41.950> approximately

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
like you got to keep it at approximately

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.120 
like you got to keep it at approximately
that<00:02:42.640> angle<00:02:43.150> okay<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.440> snaps<00:02:44.709> in<00:02:44.920> right

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
that angle okay and it snaps in right

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.509 
that angle okay and it snaps in right
away

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
away

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.509 
away
okay<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.959> just<00:02:47.170> slightly<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.220> an<00:02:48.370> run

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
okay so just slightly up like an run

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.699 
okay so just slightly up like an run
about<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.880> this<00:02:49.090> it'll<00:02:49.989> take<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> couple<00:02:50.410> of

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
about like this it'll take a couple of

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.640 
about like this it'll take a couple of
times<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.040> get<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.810> okay<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.200> that's<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.560> way

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
times to get it okay but that's the way

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.380 
times to get it okay but that's the way
that's<00:02:53.859> basically<00:02:54.340> angled<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.880> try<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.180> grab

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
that's basically angled to try and grab

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.819 
that's basically angled to try and grab
it<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.720> get<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.870> little<00:02:56.019> frustrating<00:02:56.620> didn't

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
it can get a little frustrating didn't

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.800 
it can get a little frustrating didn't
do<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.040> before<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:58.180> stick<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.780> and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
do this before but stick with it and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.740 
do this before but stick with it and
you'll<00:02:59.440> get<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.620> I'll<00:03:00.040> be<00:03:00.160> right<00:03:00.280> back
