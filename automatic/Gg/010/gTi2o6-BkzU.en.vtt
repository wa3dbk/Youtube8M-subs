00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
difference because these sub cables are

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.090 
difference because these sub cables are
digital<00:01:35.700> before<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.930> 10<00:01:37.170> 20<00:01:37.439> years<00:01:37.530> ago<00:01:37.770> 20

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
digital before like 10 20 years ago 20

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460

years<00:01:38.220> ago<00:01:38.430> everything<00:01:39.240> was<00:01:39.420> analog<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
years ago everything was analog and you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
years ago everything was analog and you
know<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.040> interference<00:01:41.610> from<00:01:42.060> stuff

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360

know you get interference from stuff
that<00:01:42.600> digital<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.250> likely<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:45.240> it's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that digital not so likely because it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
that digital not so likely because it's
