00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
 show you the dead that are 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.340
 more using and the care I have 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 my nails so I'll start with 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.780
 the tips of care tabom a tip 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 super cool that has worked too much 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.390
 For me it's a homemade recipe in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.529
 that is the supplier of nails with 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.480
 garlic 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.400
 what you will need to do 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.619
 you will need a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 Nail base may be a base for the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.830
 strengthening the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 It is made 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 and then you will put pieces of it there 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 inside if you grind the garlic stays until 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160
 better but I was not going to contribute 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
 Pain in the day I liked it very little in the day. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.210
 do even put it in here he stays 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.700
 as well as the more yellowish coloration 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.219
 but it does not leave a yellowish it is not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.640
 worry about it and this recipe had 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.390
 Wonderful people the garlic is it does 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.270
 strengthen and take away any kind of 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.399
 Yes, you have good nail disease. 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.620
 start not logical that it will not cure 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.379
 a deep ringworm, but if you have 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.930
 so you know which one is yellowish or 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.700
 the garlic brittle working fine 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.460
 to heal this to improve this 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.150
 nail look and I'm using it like this 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.880
 It's been months since you've been doing what 15 months 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.259
 and I'm in love on the command I felt a lot 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.210
 difference in my mother she is 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.759
 growing much harder much more 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.350
 healthy is today it breaks much less 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.290
 than before when I used this 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 This product is mine from that shell of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.340
 horse but you can mix the garlic 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.770
 any empowering foundation that you 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.619
 have in your home so that it is okay 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.170
 my main tip you pass it like 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.579
 a base for me the same 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.909
 You passed before your nail polish. 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.560
 colorful and goes there at all times 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.810
 that you exchange enamel for him 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.310
 there is only one other care that I 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.350
 I have my dreams is not taking the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.350
 cuticle cuticle and I 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.320
 felt much weaker but fragile 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.500
 was easier to break and also the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.119
 all of them were dry. 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.799
 I hated that the dry corners 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.800
 so I opted not to take it anymore 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.200
 cuticle I make my own 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.830
 the agent then if you do the manicure and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.660
 tetra 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.090
 Can you talk to your manicure? 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.830
 to see what works best for you 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.360
 but how do I do it at home and what 's more 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.520
 Easy myself 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.440
 I get all this product every 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.110
 finally my maltz 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.710
 and then I use this project had to 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.470
 which is that looks at the title of the avon that 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.620
 You pass on cuticle massage and 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.170
 then just push pushes with those 14 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.120
 and ready did not take the tico calico I feel 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.610
 mine remains much more hydrated 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.320
 I also feel that my nail has become 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.100
 strong after I stopped taking the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.140
 cuticle 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.570
 It is logical that these Corinthians 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.690
 well back here on the day of the 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.960
 even I still shoot I do not shoot this 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.090
 protection even from the cuticle 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.610
 This I avoid to the maximum take away 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.560
 so my tip for you is not there 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.260
 take the cuticle also very helping 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.320
 strengthen the nails there is there is health 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.620
 nail gets much better and there we go to the 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.090
 smart right you have noticed that I am 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.700
 very basic with it a great 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.860
 once used to be yellow it was purple 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.350
 wore all that is enamel color today 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.200
 I'm very basic people I do not know if 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.010
 to preguicinha colors do not know what 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.090
 happens but lately in the last year 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.739
 at least 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.440
 It will be a year or so sooner than I 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.770
 I miss using colored glaze I use more 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.610
 neutral enamels like black or black 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.680
 always use of random tags and today 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.590
 I'm wearing that black here look that 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.920
 it's urbanity it's the dead end 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.450
 and these enamels of urban than urban 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.209
 I do not know how to speak 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.790
 they have that kind of little mouse brush 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.520
 it is much better to paint tomorrow 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.260
 at home will not show up on but he has 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.180
 that chatinho brush that is much more 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.090
 easy to color the nail then this 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.800
 here is what I really like him too 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.070
 is the colorama black looks at the end 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.070
 I also really like the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.600
 I like it a lot too, decide if 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.440
 we call the dot osorio he's a black 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.230
 creamy 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.880
 I always wear creamy black or I do not 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.070
 has one of the colorama that I like too 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.620
 that the rock he has 16 a brilliance 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.690
 green but very discreet is another color 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.870
 which I use a lot and always ask me 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.620
 this color here from scratch and that the gabriela 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.750
 I'm student is these new shows scratches 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.570
 because they also come with this type of 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.250
 brush no more annoying g10 10 bottles 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.450
 I could not open but it will not work either. 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.420
 show up to you 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.210
 and if this packaging of enamels of 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.700
 risqué is an enamel by generic law 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.760
 so for those who have allergies, it's great 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.500
 and he has that type of applicator that 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.970
 I told you that I already had this 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.580
 it's gabriela it's that classic red 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.830
 and when I touch a kind a wine in the 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.090
 nail usually this highlights that 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.669
 I love it, it's passion, it's a wine 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.560
 very dark and this enamel of the 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.840
 For more in my hand I really 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.540
 why so people I'm a housewife 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.050
 mac and real life I wash the dishes 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.120
 clothes then enamel intact in my 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.000
 nail rarely lasts longer than three 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.400
 days no matter what I do but the 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.919
 real time it usually lasts a bit longer 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.419
 another enamel that I use a lot and do not 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.850
 every time I 'm not somebody 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.740
 video question is this one of risqué 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.580
 also that packaging with the cap 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.040
 white and this one looks at indian babysitter 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.650
 from that baggage and travel collection I 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.080
 I even go to the perfumery I 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.110
 I buy it because I'm there. 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:01.110
 finishing and I love this gray he's like 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:03.040
 a metallic gray with the reflection 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.530
 purple lilac 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.760
 He is very handsome and he lasted very 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.980
 mine too 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.810
 and then to intensify because I like 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.880
 of the enamel so well shiny 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.960
 You know the look on your face that you just 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.110
 do the nails 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.570
 So to identify the shine I love, I already 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.020
 I tested several top coat says 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.760
 those that give the same malt shine and 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.050
 My favorite is the one of color 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:31.510
 Look at the red and he calls the cover 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.760
 cutting intensifier 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.490
 I love this product here it helps 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.010
 dry faster enamel and it leaves a 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.020
 very beautiful and very beautiful shine 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.200
 It's hard but it's the thing, too. 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.270
 so I feel that when I pass him the 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.389
 Enamel takes longer to peel in 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.120
 you know and I like my fingernail 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:55.360
 of average fulfilled sometimes the most 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.030
 I cut short, but I like her more. 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.930
 square I'm not one of those people 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:04.660
 that you keep a flawless 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.669
 sometimes I run out of enamel a week 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.260
 to let it breathe 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:11.290
 I always like to have my nails 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.330
 done but sometimes it does not work 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.979
 I get weeks and even without enamel 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.260

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.240
