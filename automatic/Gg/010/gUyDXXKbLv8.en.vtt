00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
effect this is one of the more basic

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.420

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
ones in my opinion now this one starts

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.780 
ones in my opinion now this one starts
out<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> keyboard<00:00:41.100> being<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.610> black

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
out with the keyboard being all black

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.160 
out with the keyboard being all black
and<00:00:42.090> every<00:00:42.210> time<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> press<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> key<00:00:42.960> it

and every time you press the key it
slowly<00:00:43.829> lights<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> LED<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.149> slowly

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
slowly lights up the LED and then slowly

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
slowly lights up the LED and then slowly
fades<00:00:45.809> away<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.350> has<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.620> nice<00:00:46.800> trailing

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
fades away so it has this nice trailing

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.889 
fades away so it has this nice trailing
effect<00:00:47.670> where<00:00:47.910> whenever<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.539> press<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.870> key

effect where whenever you press a key

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
effect where whenever you press a key

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it's gonna light up and then also gonna

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.310 
it's gonna light up and then also gonna
fade<00:00:50.789> away<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.629> does<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.140> several

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
fade away and it does this for several

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
fade away and it does this for several
keys<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> row<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.579> mean<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.940> could<00:00:54.059> write

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
keys in a row so I mean you could write

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.490 
keys in a row so I mean you could write
you<00:00:54.510> could<00:00:54.629> light<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.989> 10<00:00:55.199> keys<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you could light up like 10 keys at a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
you could light up like 10 keys at a
time<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.100> fade<00:00:56.280> away<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:57.000> looks

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
time then have them fade away it looks

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
time then have them fade away it looks
really<00:00:57.570> nice<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.989> sleek<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.620> honestly<00:00:58.980> this

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
really nice and sleek and honestly this

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
really nice and sleek and honestly this
is<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> ones<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> use<00:01:00.090> mostly

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
is one of the ones that I use mostly

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
is one of the ones that I use mostly
just<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.140> not<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.410> distracting<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
just because it's not so distracting and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.889 
just because it's not so distracting and
it<00:01:02.460> looks<00:01:02.640> still<00:01:02.969> really<00:01:03.300> really<00:01:03.510> cool<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it looks still really really cool the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.149 
it looks still really really cool the
second<00:01:04.229> effect<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.680> figured<00:01:04.920> out<00:01:05.010> we're

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
second effect that I figured out we're

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.980 
second effect that I figured out we're
just<00:01:05.189> thrown<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.869> not

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
just thrown here just because it's not

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.510 
just thrown here just because it's not
one<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.189> time<00:01:08.369> but

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
one that I really use all the time but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.190 
one that I really use all the time but
it's<00:01:08.670> still<00:01:08.760> pretty<00:01:09.090> cool<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> does<00:01:10.049> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
it's still pretty cool what it does is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
it's still pretty cool what it does is
it<00:01:10.320> starts<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.979> keyboard<00:01:11.340> being<00:01:11.490> totally

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it starts out the keyboard being totally

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
it starts out the keyboard being totally
black<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> lights<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> entire

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
black and then it lights up the entire

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.230 
black and then it lights up the entire
row<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> keys<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.460> press<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.030> one's

row of the keys as you press this one's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090 
row of the keys as you press this one's
still<00:01:15.509> pretty<00:01:15.750> cool<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.229> rarely<00:01:16.530> ever<00:01:16.770> use

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
still pretty cool but I rarely ever use

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.469 
still pretty cool but I rarely ever use
this<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.790> figured<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.090> throw<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.330> in

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

this one I just figured out throw it in
here<00:01:18.689> alright<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.320> third<00:01:19.530> effect<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
here alright so the third effect is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.499 
here alright so the third effect is
honestly<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> most<00:01:20.729> impressive<00:01:21.060> ones

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
honestly one of the most impressive ones

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.670 
honestly one of the most impressive ones
and<00:01:21.689> whenever<00:01:21.840> I've<00:01:22.049> showed<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.259> someone

this feature and honestly it's my

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.440 
this feature and honestly it's my
favorite<00:01:26.400> effect<00:01:26.490> although<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> little

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
favorite effect although it's a little

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
favorite effect although it's a little
bit<00:01:27.540> distracting<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.680> happens<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
bit distracting now what happens is the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.530 
bit distracting now what happens is the
keyboards<00:01:29.520> gonna<00:01:29.670> start<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:29.939> black<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.420> when

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.539 
lights around and give it a matrix vibe
to<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> keyboard<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.950> looks<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.369> really

to the keyboard it looks really really
cool<00:01:59.759> um<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> actually

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
cool um this is one that you actually

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.719 
cool um this is one that you actually
have<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.649> download<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.250> run<00:02:02.369> through<00:02:02.579> their

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
have to download and run through their

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.950 
have to download and run through their
software<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.299> doesn't<00:02:03.570> come<00:02:03.689> pre-installed

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
software so doesn't come pre-installed

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.289 
software so doesn't come pre-installed
on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.710> actual<00:02:05.040> keyboard<00:02:05.250> itself<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
on the actual keyboard itself but I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.700 
on the actual keyboard itself but I
think<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.570> looks<00:02:06.719> really<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.170> cool<00:02:07.350> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
think it looks really really cool and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.169 
think it looks really really cool and
although<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.910> bit

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
although it can be a little bit

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
although it can be a little bit
distracting<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.140> too<00:02:10.319> bad<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.770> think

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
distracting but it's not too bad I think

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.150 
distracting but it's not too bad I think
it's<00:02:11.069> definitely<00:02:11.190> worth<00:02:11.400> downloading<00:02:11.640> your

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
it's definitely worth downloading your

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.190 
it's definitely worth downloading your
you<00:02:12.310> try<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.850> then<00:02:13.060> finally<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.600> last<00:02:13.630> effect

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
you try and then finally the last effect

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.570 
you try and then finally the last effect
on<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.560> keyboard<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:15.040> going<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.460> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
on this keyboard is going to be the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.460 
on this keyboard is going to be the
snake<00:02:15.910> effect<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.630> this<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.050> really<00:02:17.200> cool

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
snake effect and this is really cool

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.140 
snake effect and this is really cool
because<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.040> looks<00:02:18.190> like<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.490> like<00:02:18.640> snake

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
because what it looks like is like snake

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.270 
because what it looks like is like snake
on<00:02:19.390> your<00:02:19.570> phone<00:02:19.840> or<00:02:20.170> anything<00:02:20.410> like<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.680> like

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
on your phone or anything like that like

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.920 
on your phone or anything like that like
it<00:02:21.400> Scrolls<00:02:21.730> around<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> keyboard<00:02:22.360> and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
it Scrolls around the keyboard and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.840 
it Scrolls around the keyboard and
emotion<00:02:23.440> goes<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.890> very<00:02:24.070> outside<00:02:24.490> and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
emotion goes on the very outside and

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.190 
emotion goes on the very outside and
goes<00:02:24.940> back<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.420> middle<00:02:25.720> then<00:02:25.840> goes<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200
