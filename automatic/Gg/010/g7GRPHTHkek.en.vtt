00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 do not forget to check the description 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.280
 of the video for more information 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.230
 the attention and the 33 and the 34 a lanceta 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.780
 current is too hot and 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.990
 received does not expect to receive by itself 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.370
 completely received coordinates 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.170
 immediate correction of course started 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.120
 the base of his death the office of 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.970
 naval intelligence is besieged by a 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.680
 cornet type ship of covenant due 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.570
 to the importance of these facilities 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.820
 the use of orbital ammunition has been 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.040
 banned for the time being unfortunately 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.080
 my efforts to obtain data on the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.700
 enemy decided useless however 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.450
 the current defensive forces are 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.820
 insufficient 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.530
 the NGO has requested the intervention of the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.130
 new equipment to help insuring 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.130
 work links 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.560
 very good guys for now we continue with 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.330
 this ship we will have the infantry a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.330
 film let's take a hand let's solve 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.530
 because later I find it more convenient 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.610
 not made in the attack to the base are us 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.960
 charge that we face in the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.430
 old farah station contain 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.650
 own stores should allow us 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.330
 contact command base 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.130
 new has an area that will help 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.560
 clear mention 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.810
 the anti-aircraft to the west the antennas are 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.060
 to the east we are not in danger with 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.520
 transport 6 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.570
 and we go through the land 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.570
 keep me stable 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.720
 because still undo 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.720
 i 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.400
 good job spartan go to the station 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.970
 of farragut and put shelves in 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.970
 functioning 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.310
 how 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.660
 a storm of the young h is placed 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.610
 6 paste position we immediately look 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.740
 we'll see inside the corvette are 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.130
 riddling the base 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.120
 and our orbital support that came from 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.050
 platforms that could destroy with a 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.050
 sun to close 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:20.329

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.290
 6 below 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.040

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.020
 the team does not both go on the way and 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.040
 ready to attack orbital defense is 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.040
 waiting to shoot 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:23.230

 I find something I can 56 the general 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.990
 scientific 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.130
 the doctor fucks who wants information and 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.850
 the command says that we are at your 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.770
 provision 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.270

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.880
 we are going 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.510
 I do not have to take half a life to 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.510
 its disposition 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.960
 I have requested your help commander and not 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.030
 I need a report of the things that 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.040
 happen to my own eyes what 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.689
 I need is a detailed account of your 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:04.399
 previous mission jorge how long 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:08.960
 Lord you've done for my armor are 

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:11.840
 just a few add-ons I see 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.150
 the big stone repeater one of my 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.979
 sine archaeologists the teacher tie their 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.430
 he really worked in his data centers 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.199
 maybe he knows something about his death if it was 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.940
 a civilian in his sixties died 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.620
 with a covenant energy sword in the 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.139
 abdomen 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.940
 they also attacked us was 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.880
 right after finding the daughter of 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:37.250
 his scientist lady was hiding in 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:40.510
 the one before the three and one pozuelo 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.720
 the leader survived by his appearance 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.230
 sure his armor matched the shield 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.910
 he also ordered to pursue our 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.950
 main objective was to reactivate the 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.780
 repeater of the station its objective 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.380
 main commander are you a 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.600
 puppet a spartan lady some in 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.310
 the ong and we think that the chain sends you 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.040
 elite teams to locate 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.960
 valuable artifacts for your religion the 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.780
 stories of the survivors suggest 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.570
 that these teams are small agile and 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.070
 almost always of types of the cndh is 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.960
 clear that they went to the station by 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.480
 amount of excavation data from the 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.520
 young and stored there and they left them 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.160
 escape the data recovery was not 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.470
 a command directive we also had 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.890
 more urgent matters such as notifying the 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.890
 planet 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.449
 the last entry in the field notes 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:34.449
 from the deaf teacher to reference to a 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.809
 key key discovery is not a 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.520
 word that he would use lightly 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:43.779
 let's hope that the data module that your 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.059
 Lieutenant Robot does not contain chat before 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:48.550
 I asked was I alerted as soon as 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:52.059
 tried to access the content as with 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.899
 any unauthorized access those 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:58.139
 data are level 1 could send it to 

00:06:55.899 --> 00:07:01.499
 dungeon for intervening in my work 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.969
 maybe he would like to accompany her 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:06.550
 we are under an emergency directive 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:08.050
 planetary safe winter plan 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.309
 who knows the punishment that the 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.889
 civilians for putting obstacles in 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:14.289
 Spartan contingent is threatening me 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.980
 commander was just a recommendation of 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:19.450
 reading 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.450
 we go noble team 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.830
 and that's all for
