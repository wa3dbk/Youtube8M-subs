00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
different sections this section is the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.040 
different sections this section is the
regular<00:00:20.130> water<00:00:20.390> this<00:00:21.390> section<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
regular water this section was the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.800 
regular water this section was the
little<00:00:22.590> tiny<00:00:22.920> ones<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.640> were<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:24.029> little

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
little tiny ones that were just little

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.269 
little tiny ones that were just little
small<00:00:24.930> plants<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.769> didn't<00:00:26.039> even<00:00:26.130> think

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
small plants that I didn't even think

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.830 
small plants that I didn't even think
would<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.300> structured

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
would make it and that's structured

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259 
would make it and that's structured
water<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> other<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.760> which<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
all structured water and the same sized

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.090 
all structured water and the same sized
plants<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.870> their<00:00:34.079> left<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> right

come over here to the structured water

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.999 
come over here to the structured water
side<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.240> could<00:01:18.360> even<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.830> much

I'm going to show you the roots and all
of<00:01:31.890> them<00:01:32.040> look<00:01:32.460> at<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:33.110> I'm<00:01:34.110> gonna<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.590> I

of them look at that I'm gonna see if I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.410 
of them look at that I'm gonna see if I
can<00:01:34.799> zoom<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:36.020> like<00:01:37.020> every<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:38.420> have

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
can zoom in like every one of them have

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.319 
can zoom in like every one of them have
those<00:01:39.600> big<00:01:39.990> long<00:01:41.540> nice<00:01:42.540> roots<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:44.329> comparison

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
those big long nice roots in comparison

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.170 
those big long nice roots in comparison
so<00:01:45.810> anyway<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.979> wanted<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> show<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.939> that's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.730 
so anyway just wanted to show you that's
the<00:01:48.390> difference<00:01:48.689> between<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.320> another

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the difference between one or another

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.370

and then just again looking at the kind

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.370 
and then just again looking at the kind
of<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> difference<00:01:55.890> between<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:57.380> alright

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
of the difference between them alright

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.740 
of the difference between them alright
that's<00:01:58.649> it
