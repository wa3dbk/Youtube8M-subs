00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.899
 everlasting hamburger dilemma or 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.030
 sandwich quickly swallowed cheap paid 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 that times are changing

 Steam cooking itself is already 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.989
 scene ie in fact she 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.030

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.220

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.530
 fly which attracted me in priority 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.220
 cultivate this organic and ethical approach 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.530

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.150
