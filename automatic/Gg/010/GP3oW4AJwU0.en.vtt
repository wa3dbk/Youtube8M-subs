00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
this last few weeks so that's why I

you<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:23.850> find<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.240> bottom

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you do that it will find for the bottom

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.999 
you do that it will find for the bottom
corner<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.140> fantastic<00:01:25.740> start

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
corner like that so fantastic start

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
corner like that so fantastic start
first<00:01:26.640> goal<00:01:26.820> pretty<00:01:27.090> early<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> game

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
first goal pretty early on in the game

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
first goal pretty early on in the game
to<00:01:28.220> just<00:01:29.220> settle<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> nerve<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.970> always

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to just settle the nerve it's always

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
to just settle the nerve it's always
good<00:01:30.329> when<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.630> an<00:01:30.720> early<00:01:30.780> goal<00:01:31.110> because

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
good when you get an early goal because

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.899 
good when you get an early goal because
then<00:01:31.829> there's<00:01:31.979> no<00:01:32.100> pressure<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> understand

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
then there's no pressure you understand

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
then there's no pressure you understand
that<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.119> score<00:01:33.570> against<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> guy<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that you can score against this guy and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
that you can score against this guy and
you<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.829> play<00:01:35.570> strange<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you just go out and play strange the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
you just go out and play strange the
second<00:01:37.049> goal<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> highlights

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
second goal now so that the highlights

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
second goal now so that the highlights
and<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> replays<00:01:39.270> died<00:01:39.509> after<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.110> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and the replays died after the on this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530 
and the replays died after the on this
game<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.710> good<00:01:41.460> 12<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.880> actually<00:01:42.360> call

nodding it in for quite a good goal that
one<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> thought<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.600> pretty<00:01:48.720> funny

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

who<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.509> fantastic<00:02:10.080> through<00:02:10.259> ball

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
who in a fantastic through ball

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.820 
who in a fantastic through ball
for<00:02:11.540> Fernando<00:02:12.540> Torres<00:02:12.780> again<00:02:13.140> he<00:02:13.470> spring

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
for Fernando Torres again he spring

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
for Fernando Torres again he spring
down<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.130> line<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.610> think<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:15.450> going<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.630> be

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
down the line you think it's going to be

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.190 
down the line you think it's going to be
a<00:02:15.780> goal<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.410> then<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.540> get<00:02:18.540> nailed<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.960> think

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
a goal and then I get nailed I think

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.140 
a goal and then I get nailed I think
yeah<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.890> free-kick<00:02:20.430> I'm<00:02:20.730> looking<00:02:21.000> at<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
yeah a free-kick I'm looking at the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.750 
yeah a free-kick I'm looking at the
right<00:02:21.300> goal<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> free<00:02:22.380> kick<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.640> I

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
right goal so this is a free kick and I

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.920 
right goal so this is a free kick and I
would<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.030> much<00:02:24.180> preferred<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.630> school<00:02:24.840> from

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
would have much preferred to school from

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.420 
would have much preferred to school from
that<00:02:25.110> breaks<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.500> was<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.070> was<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.310> very

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
that breaks I was really it was a very

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.280 
that breaks I was really it was a very
nice<00:02:26.640> move<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.060> didier<00:02:27.330> stops<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.840> steps<00:02:28.170> up

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
nice move but didier stops that steps up

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.740 
nice move but didier stops that steps up
anyway<00:02:28.650> gives<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.310> an<00:02:29.430> absolute<00:02:29.550> smash<00:02:30.120> it

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
anyway gives it an absolute smash it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.650 
anyway gives it an absolute smash it
bobbles<00:02:31.110> around<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> box<00:02:32.480> overhead<00:02:33.480> kick

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
bobbles around the box overhead kick

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600 
bobbles around the box overhead kick
cross<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:34.380> Fernando<00:02:34.830> buns<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.400> from

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
cross and then Fernando buns it in from

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.120 
cross and then Fernando buns it in from
four<00:02:35.820> yards<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.840> very<00:02:37.410> very<00:02:37.590> scrappy<00:02:37.890> goal

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
four yards so a very very scrappy goal

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.230 
four yards so a very very scrappy goal
but<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.370> take<00:02:38.520> whatever<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.910> get<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.180> that's

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
but you take whatever you get and that's

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.050 
but you take whatever you get and that's
a<00:02:39.390> necessarily<00:02:40.490> extravagant<00:02:41.490> celebration

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
a necessarily extravagant celebration

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.940 
a necessarily extravagant celebration
for<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.240> 4-yard<00:02:42.630> tapping<00:02:42.930> from<00:02:43.080> Fernando<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:43.740> I

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
for a 4-yard tapping from Fernando but I

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.890 
for a 4-yard tapping from Fernando but I
suppose<00:02:44.400> when<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.610> score<00:02:44.850> as<00:02:44.940> rarely<00:02:45.600> as<00:02:45.720> he

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
suppose when you score as rarely as he

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.840 
suppose when you score as rarely as he
did<00:02:46.080> she<00:02:46.170> got<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.410> celebrate<00:02:46.560> every<00:02:46.950> goal<00:02:47.130> now

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
did she got to celebrate every goal now

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.580 
did she got to celebrate every goal now

that was a little bit too much for the
dude<00:02:49.740> I<00:02:49.860> was<00:02:49.890> playing<00:02:50.220> he<00:02:50.490> kicks<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.820> along

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
dude I was playing he kicks it along

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.520

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.199 
for a nice easy one lil bleed once again
just<00:03:32.160> got<00:03:32.280> pretty<00:03:32.580> early<00:03:32.910> i<00:03:32.940> think<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
just got pretty early i think it's the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.690 
just got pretty early i think it's the
18th<00:03:33.600> minute<00:03:33.780> there<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.310> it's<00:03:35.310> good<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:35.640> a

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
18th minute there so it's good it's a

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.070 
18th minute there so it's good it's a
good<00:03:35.730> sign<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.090> I'm<00:03:36.300> scoring<00:03:36.540> early<00:03:36.690> i'm<00:03:36.959> not

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
good sign that I'm scoring early i'm not

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.479 
good sign that I'm scoring early i'm not
taking<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.440> entire<00:03:37.680> game<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.040> break<00:03:38.250> teams

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
taking the entire game to break teams

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.550 
taking the entire game to break teams
down<00:03:38.700> which<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.880> always<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.239> good<00:03:39.420> sign<00:03:39.630> however

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
down which is always a good sign however

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.990 
down which is always a good sign however
i<00:03:40.650> think<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.950> takes<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.190> little<00:03:41.430> bit<00:03:41.610> longer<00:03:41.790> for

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
i think it takes a little bit longer for

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.449 
i think it takes a little bit longer for
the<00:03:42.390> second<00:03:42.630> goal<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.900> come<00:03:43.019> in<00:03:43.170> it's<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.739> 32nd

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the second goal to come in it's the 32nd

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.220 
the second goal to come in it's the 32nd
minute<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.730> think<00:03:44.790> they're<00:03:45.060> being<00:03:45.780> Maria<00:03:45.959> plays

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
minute I think they're being Maria plays

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.080 
minute I think they're being Maria plays
it<00:03:46.380> into<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> feet<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.830> Aguero<00:03:47.130> gets<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.910> back

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
it into the feet of Aguero gets it back

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.850 
it into the feet of Aguero gets it back
and<00:03:48.360> then<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> fantastic<00:03:49.019> finish<00:03:49.739> from

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
and then this is a fantastic finish from

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.990 
and then this is a fantastic finish from
the<00:03:49.980> edge<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.250> area<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.550> don't<00:03:50.580> get<00:03:50.880> too

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
the edge of the area you don't get too

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.610 
the edge of the area you don't get too
much<00:03:51.180> better<00:03:51.390> than<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.690> brilliant<00:03:52.500> finish

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
much better than that brilliant finish

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.990 
much better than that brilliant finish
that's<00:03:52.800> probably<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.130> best<00:03:53.250> collops<00:03:53.640> good<00:03:53.790> so

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
that's probably the best collops good so

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.310 
that's probably the best collops good so
far<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.239> though<00:03:54.480> here<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.690> another<00:03:54.959> one<00:03:55.110> which

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
far but though here is another one which

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.140 
far but though here is another one which
is<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> lot<00:03:55.650> better<00:03:55.800> coming<00:03:56.220> up<00:03:56.310> there<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:57.030> to

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
is a lot better coming up there just to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.750 
is a lot better coming up there just to
keep<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.810> interested<00:03:58.050> in<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.320> video<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:58.830> that

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
keep you interested in the video so that

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.820 
keep you interested in the video so that
makes<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.150> very<00:04:00.180> very<00:04:00.540> easy<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.989> nil<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.410> think

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
makes it a very very easy to nil I think

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.930 
makes it a very very easy to nil I think
this<00:04:01.890> guy<00:04:02.070> was<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.280> little<00:04:02.550> bit<00:04:02.670> better<00:04:02.760> at

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
this guy was a little bit better at

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.130 
this guy was a little bit better at
defending<00:04:03.060> them<00:04:03.480> two<00:04:03.690> guys<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:04.050> been

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
defending them two guys have been

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.750 
defending them two guys have been
playing<00:04:04.200> before<00:04:04.530> he<00:04:05.040> kept<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.430> little<00:04:05.550> bit

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
playing before he kept it a little bit

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.240 
playing before he kept it a little bit
tighter<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.360> it's<00:04:07.350> always<00:04:07.530> good<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.830> take<00:04:08.070> some

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
tighter so it's always good to take some

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.860 
tighter so it's always good to take some
good<00:04:08.400> chances<00:04:08.550> like<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.239> know<00:04:09.360> neither

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
good chances like this you know neither

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.210 
good chances like this you know neither
of<00:04:10.019> those<00:04:10.170> two<00:04:10.230> goals<00:04:10.620> our<00:04:10.860> goals<00:04:11.040> you'd

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
of those two goals our goals you'd

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.280 
of those two goals our goals you'd
expect<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.519> school<00:04:11.760> every<00:04:12.239> single<00:04:12.780> time<00:04:12.989> but

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
expect to school every single time but

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.080 
expect to school every single time but
once<00:04:13.860> again<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.280> was<00:04:14.370> too<00:04:14.580> much<00:04:14.610> for<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.000> guy

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
once again it was too much for the guy

early in the second half I think that

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.200 
early in the second half I think that
was<00:06:36.370> pretty<00:06:36.580> much<00:06:36.699> straight<00:06:36.969> from<00:06:37.120> the

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
was pretty much straight from the

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.640 
was pretty much straight from the
kickoff<00:06:37.330> and<00:06:37.719> I'm<00:06:38.050> back<00:06:38.229> to<00:06:38.259> 21<00:06:38.710> up<00:06:38.800> so<00:06:38.979> not

not<00:06:39.830> on<00:06:39.919> level<00:06:40.190> terms<00:06:40.340> for<00:06:40.580> too<00:06:40.729> long<00:06:40.880> and

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
not on level terms for too long and

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.390 
not on level terms for too long and
already<00:06:42.350> going<00:06:42.650> towards<00:06:42.949> winning<00:06:43.160> the<00:06:43.250> game

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.260 
so you've gotta try and bounce back as
fast<00:06:46.370> as<00:06:46.490> you<00:06:46.550> can<00:06:46.759> and<00:06:46.820> I've<00:06:47.000> been<00:06:47.120> managing
