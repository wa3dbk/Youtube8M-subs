00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
thing that we're going to do is the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.880 
thing that we're going to do is the
eyeliner<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.500> seems<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
eyeliner and I know that that seems a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.319 
eyeliner and I know that that seems a
little<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.250> backwards<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.180> actually

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
little bit backwards but it's actually

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.290 
little bit backwards but it's actually
not<00:00:54.980> because<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.219> eyeliner<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.149> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
not because this eyeliner is what is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.290 
not because this eyeliner is what is
going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.440> prep<00:00:59.010> us<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.879> kind<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
going to kind of prep us to kind of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.510 
going to kind of prep us to kind of
almost<00:01:00.480> color<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> lines<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.370> going

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
almost color in the lines so it's going

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.619 
almost color in the lines so it's going
to<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> shaping<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> be

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
finished off the rest of the liner and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.679 
finished off the rest of the liner and
you<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.850> make<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> little<00:01:48.299> bit<00:01:48.450> thicker

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
just at the top next we can go into our

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.539 
just at the top next we can go into our
double<00:01:51.420> wing<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.649> also<00:01:52.799> pretty<00:01:53.100> tricky

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
double wing this is also pretty tricky

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.770 
double wing this is also pretty tricky
so<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> best<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.720> my

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
ability the most difficult part is going

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.649 
ability the most difficult part is going
to<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.119> getting<00:01:57.360> them<00:01:57.630> even<00:01:59.509> because<00:02:00.509> they

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
to be getting them even because they

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.389 
to be getting them even because they
connect<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.170> our<00:02:01.259> outer<00:02:01.439> brow<00:02:01.770> that's<00:02:02.219> what

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
connect to our outer brow that's what

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.530 
connect to our outer brow that's what
I'm<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> start<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.060> wing<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.390> just

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
I'm going to start the wing and just

I'm going to start the wing and just
connect<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> rest<00:02:04.320> VI<00:02:06.140> from<00:02:07.140> there<00:02:07.290> you

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
connect to the rest VI from there you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.480 
connect to the rest VI from there you
want<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> bring<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.979> down<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.550> lengthen<00:02:09.030> it

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
want to bring it down and lengthen it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.050 
want to bring it down and lengthen it
thicken<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.120> too<00:02:12.520> after<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:13.850> want<00:02:14.000> to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060

thicken it too after that we want to
concentrate<00:02:14.390> on<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.750> bottom<00:02:15.050> line<00:02:15.200> we're

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
concentrate on the bottom line we're

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.560 
concentrate on the bottom line we're
also<00:02:15.590> going<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.920> start<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> inner<00:02:16.490> corner<00:02:19.570> try

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
also going to start the inner corner try

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.760 
also going to start the inner corner try
to<00:02:20.630> make<00:02:20.810> sure<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.110> there's<00:02:21.320> even<00:02:21.650> as

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
to make sure that there's even as

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.740 
to make sure that there's even as
possible<00:02:24.460> draw<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.580> first<00:02:25.910> line<00:02:26.120> in<00:02:26.510> and

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
possible draw that first line in and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.840 
possible draw that first line in and
then<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:27.320> sweep<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.830> along<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.190> bottom<00:02:28.550> wet

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
then just sweep it along the bottom wet

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.520 
then just sweep it along the bottom wet
line<00:02:29.030> right<00:02:29.600> here<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:29.870> where<00:02:29.960> you<00:02:30.200> want<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.470> get

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
line right here is where you want to get

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.100 
line right here is where you want to get
underneath<00:02:31.010> your<00:02:31.520> bottom<00:02:31.880> lashes<00:02:32.060> not<00:02:32.930> all

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
underneath your bottom lashes not all

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:43.330 
underneath your bottom lashes not all
not<00:02:33.470> over<00:02:41.140> create<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.260> paint<00:02:42.620> line<00:02:42.860> just

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
not over create this paint line just

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.180 
not over create this paint line just
underneath<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> black<00:02:44.030> one<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.800> kind<00:02:46.100> of

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
underneath the black one so I kind of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.490 
underneath the black one so I kind of
redid<00:02:46.460> both<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.910> lines<00:02:47.150> because<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.350> both

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
redid both of the lines because on both

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.140 
redid both of the lines because on both
sides<00:02:48.800> because<00:02:49.100> they<00:02:49.430> were<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.580> little<00:02:49.970> bit

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
sides because they were a little bit

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.940 
sides because they were a little bit
temperamental<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.900> didn't<00:02:51.560> want<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.770> work

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
temperamental and didn't want to work

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.820 
temperamental and didn't want to work
the<00:02:52.130> way<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.280> wanted<00:02:52.610> them<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:53.200> if<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.440> happens

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the way I wanted them to if that happens

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.770 
the way I wanted them to if that happens
then<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.310> go<00:02:55.460> on<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.880> change<00:02:56.450> them<00:02:56.630> both

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
then just go on in and change them both

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.110 
then just go on in and change them both
up<00:02:56.990> so<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.650> extended<00:02:58.010> both<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.610> them<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.880> try<00:02:59.090> to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
up so I extended both of them and try to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.030 
up so I extended both of them and try to
make<00:02:59.390> them<00:02:59.600> basically<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.500> same<00:03:00.680> shape

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
make them basically the same shape

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.870 
make them basically the same shape
afterwards<00:03:04.040> I'm<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:04.370> going<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.520> take<00:03:04.640> any

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
afterwards I'm just going to take any

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.580 
afterwards I'm just going to take any
white<00:03:05.120> eyeliner<00:03:05.420> pencil<00:03:05.960> and<00:03:06.140> I'm<00:03:06.230> going<00:03:06.470> to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
white eyeliner pencil and I'm going to

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.820 
white eyeliner pencil and I'm going to
line<00:03:06.770> just<00:03:07.070> in<00:03:07.220> between<00:03:07.370> these<00:03:07.760> two<00:03:08.590> both<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
line just in between these two both the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.130 
line just in between these two both the
gaps<00:03:10.070> on<00:03:10.400> both<00:03:10.610> sides<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.330> that<00:03:11.360> will<00:03:11.990> make

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
gaps on both sides and that will make

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.930 
gaps on both sides and that will make
sure<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.500> our<00:03:12.590> eyes<00:03:12.740> stay<00:03:13.100> bright<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.700> lit
