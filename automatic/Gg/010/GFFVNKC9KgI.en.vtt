these little pots like this and the
powder<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.440> right<00:00:16.680> inside<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.119> they<00:00:18.119> work<00:00:18.330> in

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
powder is right inside here they work in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.689 
powder is right inside here they work in
very<00:00:18.930> much<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> same<00:00:19.410> way<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:20.130> delivery<00:00:20.609> is

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
very much the same way just delivery is

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
very much the same way just delivery is
a<00:00:20.850> little<00:00:21.119> bit<00:00:21.240> different<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
a little bit different so I'm going to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.009 
a little bit different so I'm going to
do<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> fun<00:00:23.430> stenciling<00:00:24.029> technique<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
do a fun stenciling technique and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
do a fun stenciling technique and
probably<00:00:25.650> throw<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.310> little<00:00:26.460> creative

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
probably throw in a little creative

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.990

holes<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.049> top<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:39.159> do<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.310> i<00:01:39.490> have<00:01:39.790> a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
holes in the top so to do that i have a

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.789 
holes in the top so to do that i have a
paper<00:01:40.150> piercing<00:01:40.720> tool<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.500> you're<00:01:41.680> just

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
paper piercing tool and you're just

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.039 
paper piercing tool and you're just
going<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.310> stick<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.760> right<00:01:42.970> through<00:01:43.600> that

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
going to stick it right through that

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.620 
going to stick it right through that
hole<00:01:44.830> is<00:01:45.010> pretty<00:01:45.250> small<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:46.240> got<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.479> kind

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
hole is pretty small so you got to kind

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.020 
hole is pretty small so you got to kind
of<00:01:46.750> widen<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.290> little<00:01:47.439> bit<00:01:47.650> so<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
of widen it a little bit so that the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.520 
of widen it a little bit so that the
powder<00:01:49.270> can<00:01:49.570> come<00:01:49.780> through<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.140> then<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:50.380> can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
powder can come through and then you can

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.920 
powder can come through and then you can
use<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:51.040> use<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.729> just<00:01:52.030> like<00:01:52.119> this<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.570> sprinkle

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
much like the bicester powder just the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.250 
much like the bicester powder just the
colors<00:02:24.790> are<00:02:24.970> different<00:02:25.090> these<00:02:25.570> are<00:02:25.840> very

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260
