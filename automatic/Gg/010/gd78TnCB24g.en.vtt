00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Today, guys, I'll show you how to prepare 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.610
 new shirt as you do 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.559
 let's take a shirt, let's take a new one 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.559
 possibly giant chocolate and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.529
 let's get him to wear it then 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.480
 hug you meet my man in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 shirt , however, maybe a little too much 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.279
 chubby this is my shirt and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.560
 in short , however, the concept is not good 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.449
 is that of course I'm kidding 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.130
 I'll seriously show you how 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.620
 prepare poached or new place 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.239
 lawyer to prepare this recipe 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 we simply need eggs 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.840
 half a cup of white vinegar and salt 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.600
 too much 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.660
 there are two methods of preparation I will 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.079
 I suggest the first one or we put it 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.949
 to boil a pot of water what 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.460
 then we put a little salt in it 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.460
 pleasure 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.570
 about a tablespoon of vinegar and let's do it 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.630
 resume boiling now not 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.380
 we have to boil excessively 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.350
 our water 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.149
 otherwise new will tend to disperse or 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.390
 better in the good will also tend to 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.789
 break away from the yolk emphasis because 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.340
 vinegar serves people to facilitate 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.990
 membership between album and yolk in point 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.270
 where the water is boiling less but we are 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.500
 gently the man and we move 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.880
 immediately of ro.la foam 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.220
 ok off so that we try to avoid the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.530
 album dispersion and we keep it 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:46.340
 close to the yolk and we do 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:52.190
 boil no boil too fast 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.679
 all for about three minutes after three 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.690
 minutes we can also remove ours 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.819
 man in shirt you see that the album and has 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.959
 completely covered the day 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.340
 very beautifull 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:07.250
 now we can put it on a cutting board 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.739
 selection listen to them then this is 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.390
 rather perfect though if there are any 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.190
 imperfections therefore if the album and are 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.910
 went a little here a little beyond with the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.840
 adjust the knife to do it I 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.329
 cut 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.299
 here we are and now let's see a second one 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:26.780
 method in what the second consists 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.090
 method we send a small saucepan e 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.370
 then briko of the ac to understand us in way 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.680
 that the album and everything remains there that stopped 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.620
 what we do we also help each other with 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.620
 bit of vinegar we put a little salt 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:51.880
 and then ok again so we help everything 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.620
 pay with a spoon and leave 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.810
 cook about three minutes 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.060
 in short, based on your tastes if you are 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.890
 like a slightly softer yolk 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.760
 leave yourself two and a half minutes if instead 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.760
 I like a little bit more of a role 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.520
 leave it for three minutes or so 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.350
 after three minutes we go to catch the egg 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.930
 here we are feeling 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.930
 and then we support it on a cutting board 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.480
 you see a little different because clearly 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:29.240
 the shape of the pan was also different 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:33.200
 remove well as in several parts and this 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.760
 I offer you I read in the province if you 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.220
 it happens that you don't really feel like 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.440
 to cook a nice saying in a shirt 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.080
 poached egg what you want maybe 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.150
 combined with a generous portion of 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.780
 raw or cooked vegetables is not bad 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.640
 as an idea, however, be careful 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.080
 consumed in moderation in particular 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.080
 if you suffer from hypercholesterolemia
