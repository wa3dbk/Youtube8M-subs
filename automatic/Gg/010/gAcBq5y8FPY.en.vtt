but I think I probably do with being a
little<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:43.980> taller<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.730> we'll<00:00:44.879> leave

very<00:01:24.119> short<00:01:24.420> even<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.200> short<00:01:25.500> frame<00:01:25.740> it's

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
