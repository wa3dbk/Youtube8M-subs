00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
called base because it doesn't have a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.500

the minute indicator sorry enough it's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.389 
the minute indicator sorry enough it's
pretty<00:00:30.990> nice<00:00:31.199> when<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.679> don't<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.099> count

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
pretty nice when you don't have to count

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.700 
pretty nice when you don't have to count
every<00:00:32.640> second<00:00:33.530> of<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> day<00:00:36.410> besides<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
every second of the day besides that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.260 
every second of the day besides that
it's<00:00:37.860> pretty<00:00:38.460> much<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:40.860> 183<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.850> have

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it's pretty much like the the 183 I have

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.510 
it's pretty much like the the 183 I have
up<00:00:42.480> earlier<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:44.190> 45<00:00:44.879> millimeter<00:00:47.420> dial

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
up earlier was 45 millimeter dial

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
up earlier was 45 millimeter dial
stainless<00:00:50.520> steel<00:00:50.960> with<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:51.989> sapphire

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
stainless steel with the sapphire

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
stainless steel with the sapphire
crystal<00:00:55.910> sandwich<00:00:56.910> dial

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
crystal sandwich dial

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.270 
crystal sandwich dial
I<00:00:57.770> think<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.070> need<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.460> Panerai<00:01:04.280> with

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
I think this you need to Panerai with

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.200 
I think this you need to Panerai with
the<00:01:05.460> display<00:01:06.180> back<00:01:07.580> showing<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> united

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the display back showing the the united

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.929 
the display back showing the the united
and<00:01:15.210> round<00:01:16.189> movement<00:01:18.290> um<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.600> radio<00:01:22.020> Mir<00:01:22.380> is

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
and round movement um the radio Mir is

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:30.910 
and round movement um the radio Mir is
water<00:01:23.939> resistant<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:26.390> 100<00:01:27.390> meters<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.290> think

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.450 

there's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.689> town<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.590> sounds<00:01:37.979> pretty<00:01:38.250> nice

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
there's a town and it sounds pretty nice

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.660 
there's a town and it sounds pretty nice
I<00:01:38.759> would<00:01:39.000> prefer<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.380> gold<00:01:40.650> hands<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.520> be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
I would prefer the the gold hands to be

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.800 
I would prefer the the gold hands to be
a<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:43.020> OEM<00:01:43.470> ones<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.850> fine<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.659> now

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
a the OEM ones but that's fine for now

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.710 
a the OEM ones but that's fine for now
I'm<00:01:46.470> looking<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.159> gold<00:01:47.369> hand<00:01:47.610> because<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
I'm looking for the gold hand because I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.330 
I'm looking for the gold hand because I
think<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:51.240> makes<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.780> less<00:01:52.020> formal<00:01:53.009> over

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
think it it makes it less formal over

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.730 
think it it makes it less formal over
watch<00:01:54.020> stainless<00:01:55.020> steel<00:01:55.579> it's<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.740> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
watch stainless steel it's on the the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:09.070 
watch stainless steel it's on the the
black<00:01:58.969> om<00:02:00.229> calf<00:02:01.310> strap<00:02:02.310> right<00:02:02.549> now

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.820 

26:22<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:11.090> 26<00:02:12.090> at<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:13.260> lugs<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
26:22 I think 26 at the the lugs and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.610 
26:22 I think 26 at the the lugs and
then<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:15.319> tapers<00:02:16.319> down<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:17.100> over<00:02:17.340> 22<00:02:18.620> it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
then it tapers down to over 22 it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.199 
then it tapers down to over 22 it's
really<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.310> not<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.760> picky<00:02:21.920> strap<00:02:22.940> used<00:02:23.940> to

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
really it's not that picky strap used to

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.059 
really it's not that picky strap used to
wing<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.080> thicker<00:02:25.410> strap<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:27.800> I'm<00:02:28.800> probably

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
wing the thicker strap and I'm probably

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.070 
wing the thicker strap and I'm probably
gonna<00:02:29.450> change<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.630> out<00:02:30.780> or<00:02:31.170> something<00:02:31.530> like

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
gonna change it out or something like

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:45.680 
gonna change it out or something like
this<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.480> would<00:02:36.660> look<00:02:36.780> good<00:02:37.019> on<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:42.680> yeah<00:02:44.690> how
