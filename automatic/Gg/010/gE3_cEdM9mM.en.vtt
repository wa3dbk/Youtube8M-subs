00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 this video is sponsored by quero 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.819
 insight bag that helps you find your 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.719
 upper course 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.090
 would get discounts of up to 80% 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.340
 In today's framework, we have one more 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.010
 lesson on predicting spontaneity 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.690
 of oxygen reactions are and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.480
 taking advantage of what was seen in class 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.119
 we can reaffirm that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.670
 mentally above hydrogen in the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.279
 table of potential potentials 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.750
 to displace the hydrogen of an acid by 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.700
 example considers the zinc equation with 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:42.629
 sulfuric acid producing 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 zinc plus hydrogen gas 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.760
 in this reaction the 5 displaced hydrogen 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 of sulfuric acid 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 But that does not mean that metal 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.460
 below the hydrogen can not react 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.399
 with strongly oxidizing acid following 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.219
 a gaming reaction reduction other than 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.500
 hydrogen displacement reaction by 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:17.960
 For example, silver reacts with 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:23.159
 nitrate producing silver nitrate more 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.439
 water plus nitric oxygen in this reaction 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.890
 the silver that is a metal that lies below 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.560
 Hydrogen reacts with the acid 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.020
 oxidant which is the nitrate of 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.439
 silver but you will notice that the reaction 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.210
 reduction games is different from the reaction of 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.390
 displacement of hydrogen 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.729
 from the point of view of oxy 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.380
 notes that there is no release of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.560
 hydrogen gas 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.680
 but the gas has what is the oxide 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.439
 and this reaction can be 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:07.069
 as follows 3 kg plus four water 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:13.900
 more but not 3 - producing 3 more 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:18.689
 two more h2o plus fenii 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:27.370
 In this reaction, silver is the 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:30.549
 therefore it undergoes oxidation the silver nox is 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.319
 initially equal to zero and becomes 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.340
 plus one means that he has lost a 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.430
 electron 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:44.340
 already the nitrogen is the oxidant and therefore 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.340
 suffers reduction 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:53.620
 initially the nitrogen nox is equal to 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.909
 plus 5 and becomes worth two more now 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.760
 let's calculate the delta is 0 of this reaction 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.069
 For this we will use the table of 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.189
 standard potentials and when we went 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.500
 remove the equation from the reducer than silver 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.909
 we will need to reverse it in addition to 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.569
 multiply by three 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:21.340
 so three silvers are produced producing 3 age 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:25.090
 plus three more electrons your potential 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.750
 must also be inverted and it 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.840
 becomes equal to 0.80 volts for the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.639
 the equation is maintained and becomes 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:48.159
 so three electrons plus 4h more more 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:53.790
 no3 - producing 2 h2o more in your 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:57.159
 standard potential holds and is equal to 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.470
 0.96 volts to find the equation 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.010
 global 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.859
 add up these two equations and these 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.949
 electrons will be eliminated on both sides 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.040
 the resulting equation is precisely this 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:14.349
 here we will not even write again 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.729
 but the delta is like that 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:23.770
 the delta is equal to the standard potential of the 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:27.520
 oxidant - the standard potential of the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:31.389
 the standard potential of the oxidant is 0 91 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.530
 6 thousand of the reducer 0.8 but as we go 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.340
 use - this potential standard so less 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.300
 0.8 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:45.129
 you notice that the delta is equal to zero 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:50.280
 book 16 volts with the delta is greater 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:56.710
 that zero means that this equation is 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:00.250
 and shows that it is possible that the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.099
 below hydrogen reacts with the 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.830
 strongly oxidizing acid following a 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:08.889
 Oxidation reaction different from 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.270
 hydrogen displacement reaction is 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.430
 That's it folks I hope they have 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.430
 liked big hug and see you around
