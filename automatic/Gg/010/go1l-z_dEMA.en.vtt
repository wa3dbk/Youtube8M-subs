like pop out of the little holder and
you<00:05:52.350> would<00:05:52.470> think<00:05:52.500> that<00:05:52.770> that<00:05:52.979> would<00:05:53.340> be<00:05:53.400> like

you would think that that would be like
easy<00:05:54.750> enough<00:05:55.140> for<00:05:55.350> them<00:05:55.440> to<00:05:55.500> pull<00:05:55.740> out

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
easy enough for them to pull out

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.500 
easy enough for them to pull out
themselves<00:05:56.190> but<00:05:56.669> it's<00:05:56.820> actually<00:05:57.120> not<00:05:57.270> to<00:05:57.390> have

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
themselves but it's actually not to have

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.290 
themselves but it's actually not to have
a<00:05:57.539> hard<00:05:57.780> time<00:05:57.840> and<00:06:00.770> then<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:02.850> final<00:06:03.240> thing

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300
