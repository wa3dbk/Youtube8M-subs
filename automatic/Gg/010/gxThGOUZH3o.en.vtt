this<00:01:58.439> unit<00:01:58.829> has<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> single<00:01:59.939> has<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.899> single

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
this unit has a single has a single

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.069 
this unit has a single has a single
antenna<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> dual<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
antenna in not a dual one like the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.310 
antenna in not a dual one like the
actual<00:02:04.590> om<00:02:05.159> unit<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> reception<00:02:06.840> isn't<00:02:07.200> as

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
actual om unit so the reception isn't as

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.639 
actual om unit so the reception isn't as
great<00:02:07.550> but<00:02:08.550> other<00:02:09.000> than<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.989> think<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
great but other than that I think it's a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.750 
great but other than that I think it's a
pretty<00:02:10.830> damn<00:02:11.009> good

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
pretty damn good
