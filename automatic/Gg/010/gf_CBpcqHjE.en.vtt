00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
give you the opportunity to anyway if

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.320 
give you the opportunity to anyway if
you<00:03:07.750> don't<00:03:07.930> choose<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.610> relationship

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
you don't choose to have a relationship

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.350 
you don't choose to have a relationship
and<00:03:10.660> affair<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.680> them<00:03:11.920> then<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.519> your

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
and affair with them then that is your

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.900
