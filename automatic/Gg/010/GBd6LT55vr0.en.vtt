powerpoints on low-end devices who used
to<00:00:10.710> care<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.400> 5<00:00:11.940> 6<00:00:12.240> MB<00:00:12.870> or<00:00:13.250> 512<00:00:14.250> mb<00:00:15.059> ram<00:00:15.980> there's

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
to care to 5 6 MB or 512 mb ram there's

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.680 
to care to 5 6 MB or 512 mb ram there's
the<00:00:17.100> amount<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.400> ram<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.789> very<00:00:18.029> low<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the amount of ram is very low for to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.820 
the amount of ram is very low for to
this<00:00:18.779> generation<00:00:19.279> so<00:00:21.050> first<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.230> all<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.619> need

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
this generation so first of all you need

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.609 
this generation so first of all you need
a<00:00:23.039> class<00:00:23.430> 10<00:00:23.730> external<00:00:24.420> SD<00:00:24.720> card<00:00:24.930> let's<00:00:25.439> be

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
a class 10 external SD card let's be

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
a class 10 external SD card let's be
important<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:26.849> plus<00:00:27.090> 10's<00:00:27.420> ticket

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
important to have plus 10's ticket

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.089 
important to have plus 10's ticket
because<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> gives<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> max<00:00:28.980> web<00:00:29.310> speed

because it gives you the max web speed
now<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.579> install<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.000> Roy's<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
now you have to install the Roy's a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.920 
now you have to install the Roy's a
program<00:00:33.780> expander<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:36.950> install<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.100> now
