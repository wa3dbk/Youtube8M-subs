single<00:02:14.180> layer<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:16.610> looks<00:02:16.850> perfect<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.300> can

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
single layer this looks perfect you can

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.940 
single layer this looks perfect you can
see<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.660> beef<00:02:17.870> has<00:02:18.020> developed<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.470> really<00:02:18.800> good

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
see the beef has developed a really good

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.710 
see the beef has developed a really good
color<00:02:19.130> but<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.490> really<00:02:19.820> crucial<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.570> this

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
color but it's really crucial that this

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.360 
color but it's really crucial that this
only<00:02:20.900> cooks<00:02:21.200> for<00:02:21.350> about<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> minute<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.070> 30

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
only cooks for about a minute like 30

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.490 
only cooks for about a minute like 30
seconds<00:02:22.820> on<00:02:22.970> each<00:02:23.000> side<00:02:23.390> because<00:02:23.960> if<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.320> cooks

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
seconds on each side because if it cooks

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.340 
seconds on each side because if it cooks
any<00:02:24.770> longer<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.750> would<00:02:26.870> be<00:02:26.930> really<00:02:27.200> tough

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
any longer and it would be really tough

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.740

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
mushrooms and onions and I'm going to

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.949 
mushrooms and onions and I'm going to
stir<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:42.769> until<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.280> can<00:03:43.549> no<00:03:43.940> longer<00:03:43.970> see

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
stir it in until I can no longer see

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.590

that<00:03:45.860> there's<00:03:46.100> any<00:03:46.370> roll<00:03:46.760> bits<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.360> flour

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
that there's any roll bits of flour

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.600 
that there's any roll bits of flour
anywhere<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.410> that's<00:03:48.500> really<00:03:48.890> important

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
anywhere and that's really important

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.970 
anywhere and that's really important
because<00:03:49.850> otherwise<00:03:50.150> if<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.019> don't<00:03:51.260> give<00:03:51.830> the

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
because otherwise if you don't give the

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.220 
because otherwise if you don't give the
flour<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.370> chance<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:53.090> cook<00:03:53.299> it'll<00:03:53.570> clump<00:03:53.810> up<00:03:54.049> in

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
flour a chance to cook it'll clump up in

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.229 
flour a chance to cook it'll clump up in
your<00:03:54.350> sauce<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.920> it'll<00:03:55.730> kind<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:55.970> taste

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
your sauce and it'll kind of taste

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.080 
your sauce and it'll kind of taste
almost<00:03:56.510> like<00:03:56.720> glue<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.470> don't<00:03:57.620> want<00:03:57.769> that

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
almost like glue and you don't want that

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.320 
almost like glue and you don't want that
okay

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
okay

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.350 
okay
give<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:00.380> go<00:04:00.650> that's<00:04:01.040> looking<00:04:01.310> good<00:04:01.549> I'm

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
give that a go that's looking good I'm

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.060 
give that a go that's looking good I'm
going<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.080> add<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.230> splash<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.860> white<00:04:04.040> wine

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.580 
going to add a splash of white wine
totally<00:04:05.060> optional<00:04:05.239> I<00:04:05.690> just<00:04:05.930> think<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.260> adds<00:04:06.440> a

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
totally optional I just think it adds a

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.500 
totally optional I just think it adds a
little<00:04:07.040> something-something<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:07.970> dish

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
little something-something to the dish

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.880 
little something-something to the dish
not<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.230> lot<00:04:09.820> maybe<00:04:10.820> about<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:11.000> quarter<00:04:11.239> cup<00:04:11.890> let

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
not a lot maybe about a quarter cup let

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.650 
not a lot maybe about a quarter cup let
that<00:04:13.040> cook<00:04:13.250> for<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.760> few<00:04:13.940> seconds<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:14.480> can

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
that cook for just a few seconds you can

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.599 
that cook for just a few seconds you can
see<00:04:14.870> Bacon's<00:04:15.440> really<00:04:15.739> nicely<00:04:15.920> because<00:04:16.280> of<00:04:16.519> the

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
see Bacon's really nicely because of the

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.740 
see Bacon's really nicely because of the
flour<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.450> now<00:04:18.260> we<00:04:18.320> are<00:04:18.620> going<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.919> add<00:04:19.130> in<00:04:19.750> the
