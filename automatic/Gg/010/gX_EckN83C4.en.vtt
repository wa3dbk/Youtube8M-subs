and<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.189> five<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> half

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and I use five and a half

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.540 
and I use five and a half
I<00:01:33.530> cut<00:01:34.530> each<00:01:34.740> pack<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.310> half<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.300> then<00:01:37.460> did<00:01:38.460> it

I cut each pack in half and then did it

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.600 
I cut each pack in half and then did it
from<00:01:38.730> that<00:01:38.910> and<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.300> still<00:01:39.570> came<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.930> like

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
from that and it still came out like

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.450 
from that and it still came out like
extremely<00:01:41.610> long<00:01:41.910> so<00:01:42.420> i<00:01:42.770> would<00:01:43.770> suggest<00:01:43.980> not

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
extremely long so i would suggest not

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.570 
extremely long so i would suggest not
cutting<00:01:45.060> them<00:01:46.040> because<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.460> be

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
cutting them because this would be

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:56.300 
cutting them because this would be
pretty<00:01:48.180> intense<00:01:48.860> um<00:01:50.330> i<00:01:52.160> think<00:01:53.160> that's<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:54.650> so<00:01:55.650> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
pretty intense um i think that's it so I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
pretty intense um i think that's it so I
don't<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.210> her<00:01:57.360> name<00:01:57.540> right<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:57.990> this
