00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
strongest boil of this car it will or it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.459 
strongest boil of this car it will or it
does<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.100> them<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.550> lot<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.969> interior<00:00:45.420> space

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
does of them a lot of interior space

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
does of them a lot of interior space
vessels<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> footprint<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
vessels the footprint because we have to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
vessels the footprint because we have to
tackle<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> idea<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.719> efficiency<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.950> only

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
tackle the idea of efficiency not only

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
tackle the idea of efficiency not only
about<00:00:50.489> emissions<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.390> stuff<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
about emissions and stuff like that this

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
about emissions and stuff like that this
has<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.949> course<00:00:52.980> no<00:00:53.340> emission<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.480> be

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
has of course no emission but also be

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.040 
has of course no emission but also be
extremely<00:00:55.530> efficient<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> way<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.750> how

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
extremely efficient in the way that how

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.830 
extremely efficient in the way that how
much<00:00:58.260> space<00:00:58.500> does<00:00:59.190> surgical<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.090> consume<00:01:00.570> fall

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
much space does surgical a consume fall

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
much space does surgical a consume fall
in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> community<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:02.129> urban<00:01:02.520> environment

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
in the community in urban environment

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.840 
in the community in urban environment
and<00:01:03.510> how<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.930> space<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.409> will<00:01:04.559> offer<00:01:04.760> for<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and how much space it will offer for the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
and how much space it will offer for the
driver<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.390> passenger<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:07.979> their

safety whatever I like to is you've got

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.469 
safety whatever I like to is you've got
all<00:01:10.619> kinds<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.979> very<00:01:11.130> premium<00:01:11.610> materials<00:01:12.180> but

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
all kinds of very premium materials but

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.060 
all kinds of very premium materials but
you<00:01:12.659> also<00:01:12.840> leave<00:01:13.110> some<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> carbon<00:01:13.830> fiber

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you also leave some of the carbon fiber

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.490 
you also leave some of the carbon fiber
exposed<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.090> true<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.290> also

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
exposed this is true like it is also

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890 
exposed this is true like it is also
important<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> basically<00:01:17.750> display<00:01:18.750> the

homage<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.050> engineering<00:01:21.650> like<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:22.820> is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
homage to the engineering like this is

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.850 
homage to the engineering like this is
here<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.390> whole<00:01:23.570> carbon<00:01:23.960> structure<00:01:24.260> that<00:01:24.680> you

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
here the whole carbon structure that you

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.630 
here the whole carbon structure that you
see<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.510> of<00:01:27.020> course<00:01:27.350> as<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.370> very

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
see and it of course as a very

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.490 
see and it of course as a very
interesting<00:01:29.150> texture<00:01:29.600> its<00:01:29.900> treated<00:01:30.140> in<00:01:30.410> a

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
interesting texture its treated in a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.560 
interesting texture its treated in a
very<00:01:30.680> hot<00:01:30.860> antique<00:01:31.220> manner<00:01:31.460> which<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.390> also

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
very hot antique manner which is also

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.300 
very hot antique manner which is also
very<00:01:32.840> important<00:01:33.470> when<00:01:33.620> it<00:01:33.650> comes<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:34.130> matters

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
very important when it comes to matters

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.860 
very important when it comes to matters
you<00:01:35.030> see<00:01:35.410> we<00:01:36.410> aim<00:01:36.650> at<00:01:37.100> basically<00:01:37.880> developing

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
you see we aim at basically developing

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.990 
you see we aim at basically developing
design<00:01:39.710> philosophy<00:01:40.250> which<00:01:40.430> we<00:01:40.580> call<00:01:40.760> next

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
design philosophy which we call next

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.760 
design philosophy which we call next
premium<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.900> idea<00:01:42.200> is<00:01:42.260> to<00:01:42.620> basically

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
premium and the idea is to basically

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.690 
premium and the idea is to basically
combine<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:44.750> course<00:01:45.260> very<00:01:45.530> valuable<00:01:46.280> very

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
combine of course very valuable very

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.390 
combine of course very valuable very
premium<00:01:47.000> material<00:01:47.690> but<00:01:47.930> also<00:01:48.220> some<00:01:49.220> more

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
premium material but also some more

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.120 
premium material but also some more
rough<00:01:49.610> material<00:01:50.180> as<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.630> see<00:01:50.870> here<00:01:51.080> which<00:01:51.920> are

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
rough material as you see here which are

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.040 
rough material as you see here which are
some<00:01:52.490> interior<00:01:52.760> trim<00:01:53.090> parts<00:01:53.360> made<00:01:53.690> out<00:01:53.869> of

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
some interior trim parts made out of

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.350 
some interior trim parts made out of
natural<00:01:54.260> fibers<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.030> next<00:01:56.210> step

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
natural fibers and this is the next step

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.120 
natural fibers and this is the next step
of<00:01:56.660> premium<00:01:57.080> we<00:01:57.320> believe<00:01:57.619> like<00:01:57.830> it's<00:01:58.010> not

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
of premium we believe like it's not

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.580 
of premium we believe like it's not
always<00:01:58.400> about<00:01:58.610> adding<00:01:59.330> more<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.810> more<00:02:00.170> than<00:02:00.560> a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
always about adding more and more than a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.680 
always about adding more and more than a
more<00:02:00.920> wood<00:02:01.100> or<00:02:01.430> chrome<00:02:02.030> or<00:02:02.270> stuff<00:02:02.479> like<00:02:02.630> that

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
more wood or chrome or stuff like that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.900 
more wood or chrome or stuff like that

and<00:02:05.150> with<00:02:05.479> low<00:02:05.690> i<00:02:05.990> would<00:02:06.080> say<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:07.119> this<00:02:08.119> is

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
and with low i would say and this is

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.030 
and with low i would say and this is
what<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.660> seem<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:09.140> course<00:02:09.380> in<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.590> future<00:02:09.920> we

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
what you seem of course in the future we

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.310 
what you seem of course in the future we
still<00:02:10.280> need<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.610> steering<00:02:10.970> wheel<00:02:11.120> by<00:02:11.900> low<00:02:12.080> at

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
still need the steering wheel by low at

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.640 
still need the steering wheel by low at
least<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:14.000> see<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.660> course<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.530> are

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
least but you see that of course you are

connectivity<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.510> course<00:02:23.690> very<00:02:23.959> important

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
connectivity is of course very important

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.110 
connectivity is of course very important
and<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:26.209> see<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.620> example<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:28.160> use<00:02:28.400> on

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
and you see that for example we use on

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.690 
and you see that for example we use on
the<00:02:29.239> eye<00:02:29.269> pin<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:30.260> would<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.250> actually

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the eye pin this would this is actually

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.850 
the eye pin this would this is actually
very<00:02:31.730> uniform<00:02:32.630> would<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.110> made<00:02:33.709> out<00:02:33.739> of

very uniform would this is made out of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.240 
very uniform would this is made out of
eucalyptus<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:36.140> doesn't<00:02:36.680> really<00:02:36.830> harm<00:02:37.100> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
growing and cut it eventually this is

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.840 
growing and cut it eventually this is
really<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.140> very<00:02:45.350> simple<00:02:45.769> material<00:02:46.220> but<00:02:46.340> that
