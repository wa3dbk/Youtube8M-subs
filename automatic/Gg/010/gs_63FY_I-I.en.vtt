00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
rifle and first of all we just should

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.740 
rifle and first of all we just should
clarify<00:00:19.610> some<00:00:19.940> things<00:00:19.970> about<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.539> sniper

rifles<00:00:21.199> and<00:00:21.500> just<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.010> game<00:00:22.760> mechanics<00:00:23.150> in

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
rifles and just the game mechanics in

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.180 
rifles and just the game mechanics in
battlefield<00:00:23.570> 3<00:00:23.630> in<00:00:23.869> general<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:24.859> will<00:00:24.980> get

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
battlefield 3 in general you will get

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.630 
battlefield 3 in general you will get
something<00:00:26.000> called<00:00:26.390> bullet<00:00:27.260> drop<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:27.800> you

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
something called bullet drop and you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.340 
something called bullet drop and you
also<00:00:28.789> have<00:00:28.939> something<00:00:29.779> called<00:00:29.900> bullet

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
also have something called bullet

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.830 
also have something called bullet
velocity<00:00:30.519> so<00:00:31.519> the<00:00:31.640> velocity<00:00:31.789> is<00:00:32.090> basically

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
velocity so the velocity is basically

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.120 
velocity so the velocity is basically
what<00:00:33.200> determines<00:00:34.070> both<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.520> those<00:00:35.120> things<00:00:35.180> and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
what determines both of those things and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.040 
what determines both of those things and
one<00:00:37.130> of<00:00:37.160> them<00:00:37.280> would<00:00:37.550> be<00:00:37.730> half<00:00:38.390> how<00:00:38.840> much<00:00:38.870> a

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
one of them would be half how much a

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.600 
one of them would be half how much a
bootable<00:00:39.350> drop<00:00:39.680> of<00:00:39.860> resistance<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:40.520> the

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
bootable drop of resistance and the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.280 
bootable drop of resistance and the
other<00:00:40.700> one<00:00:40.880> would<00:00:41.059> be<00:00:41.090> how<00:00:41.390> fast<00:00:41.989> will<00:00:42.230> it

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
other one would be how fast will it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.290 
other one would be how fast will it
travel<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:43.309> faster<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:43.670> bullet<00:00:43.940> travels

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
travel and the faster a bullet travels

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.020 
travel and the faster a bullet travels
the<00:00:44.570> less<00:00:44.989> rub<00:00:45.290> it<00:00:45.410> has<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:46.219> um<00:00:46.579> this<00:00:46.790> means

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
the less rub it has so um this means

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.690 
the less rub it has so um this means
m40a5<00:00:47.750> had<00:00:48.260> has<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.800> most<00:00:49.010> drop<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.430> all<00:00:49.579> the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
m40a5 had has the most drop of all the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.080 
m40a5 had has the most drop of all the
bold<00:00:50.059> actions<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:51.290> n<00:00:51.379> 9<00:00:51.530> kb<00:00:51.710> has<00:00:52.160> left<00:00:52.579> so

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
bold actions and the n 9 kb has left so

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.790 
bold actions and the n 9 kb has left so
few<00:00:53.360> zyk<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:53.780> rub<00:00:54.200> off<00:00:54.289> all<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.530> bolt-action

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
few zyk and rub off all the bolt-action

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.510 
few zyk and rub off all the bolt-action
rifles<00:00:55.570> just<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.719> get<00:00:57.050> those<00:00:57.309> legs<00:00:58.309> out

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
rifles just to get those legs out

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.459 
rifles just to get those legs out
straight<00:00:58.579> and<00:00:59.059> something<00:00:59.899> else<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.140> have<00:01:00.260> to

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
straight and something else I have to

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.920 
straight and something else I have to
them<00:01:00.829> kind<00:01:01.370> of<00:01:01.430> clarify<00:01:01.789> really<00:01:02.210> quick<00:01:02.390> quick

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
them kind of clarify really quick quick

them kind of clarify really quick quick
before<00:01:03.110> I<00:01:03.289> give<00:01:03.530> like<00:01:03.980> some<00:01:04.399> basic<00:01:04.939> sniping

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
before I give like some basic sniping

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.529 
before I give like some basic sniping
tips<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.689> would<00:01:06.469> be<00:01:06.679> that<00:01:07.130> as<00:01:07.520> soon<00:01:08.119> as<00:01:08.329> you're

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539

soon as you're like pushing the right

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.120 
soon as you're like pushing the right
trigger<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:15.350> have<00:01:15.560> one<00:01:15.829> hundred<00:01:16.099> percent

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
trigger you have one hundred percent

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.639 
trigger you have one hundred percent
accuracy<00:01:16.819> so<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:17.599> don't<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.289> do<00:01:18.499> not

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
accuracy so you don't you do not

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.289 
accuracy so you don't you do not
actually<00:01:18.859> have<00:01:19.189> to<00:01:19.369> wait<00:01:19.579> until<00:01:19.819> the<00:01:20.060> scope

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
actually have to wait until the scope

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.300 
actually have to wait until the scope
comes<00:01:20.630> up<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.409> will<00:01:21.529> have<00:01:21.709> one<00:01:22.099> hundred

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
comes up you will have one hundred

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.800 
comes up you will have one hundred
percent<00:01:22.340> accuracy<00:01:22.909> as<00:01:23.209> soon<00:01:23.420> as<00:01:23.539> you<00:01:23.659> press

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
percent accuracy as soon as you press

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.209 
percent accuracy as soon as you press
the<00:01:23.990> button<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.409> if<00:01:24.499> you're<00:01:24.619> kind<00:01:24.799> of<00:01:24.859> doing<00:01:25.009> a

the button so if you're kind of doing a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.819 
the button so if you're kind of doing a
tactic<00:01:25.609> and<00:01:25.810> even<00:01:26.810> those<00:01:26.929> yob<00:01:27.200> won't<00:01:27.560> be<00:01:27.679> up

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
tactic and even those yob won't be up

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:28.809 
tactic and even those yob won't be up
you<00:01:28.069> will<00:01:28.219> have<00:01:28.340> one<00:01:28.399> hundred<00:01:28.789> percent

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.659 
you will have one hundred percent
accuracy<00:01:29.419> keep<00:01:30.169> in<00:01:30.289> mind<00:01:30.529> though<00:01:30.709> that<00:01:30.740> the

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:31.669 
accuracy keep in mind though that the

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:33.459 
accuracy keep in mind though that the
scopes<00:01:31.909> way<00:01:32.119> will<00:01:32.299> kind<00:01:32.539> of<00:01:32.630> bring<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.169> off<00:01:33.289> so

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
scopes way will kind of bring you off so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.260 
scopes way will kind of bring you off so
if<00:01:33.590> you're<00:01:33.740> testing<00:01:34.039> that<00:01:34.159> out<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:34.549> am<00:01:34.819> like

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
if you're testing that out on am like

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.050 
if you're testing that out on am like
against<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.689> wall<00:01:35.929> then<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:37.130> you're<00:01:37.249> like<00:01:37.490> 50

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
against the wall then and you're like 50

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.550 
against the wall then and you're like 50
meters<00:01:38.719> of<00:01:38.840> Y<00:01:38.929> or<00:01:39.049> something<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.469> you're

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
meters of Y or something and you're

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.929 
meters of Y or something and you're
shooting<00:01:39.799> against<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.069> wall<00:01:40.249> with<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.429> little

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
shooting against the wall with a little

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.239 
shooting against the wall with a little
trick<00:01:41.149> you<00:01:41.779> can<00:01:41.959> see<00:01:42.109> that<00:01:42.139> they<00:01:42.560> won't<00:01:42.889> always

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
trick you can see that they won't always

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.089 
trick you can see that they won't always
sit<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.609> exam<00:01:43.939> sex<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:44.679> they're<00:01:45.679> kind<00:01:45.979> of

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
sit the exam sex but they're kind of

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.429 
sit the exam sex but they're kind of
like<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.729> little<00:01:47.179> circle<00:01:47.659> but<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.259> really

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
view is to be considered as close range

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.720 
view is to be considered as close range
even<00:03:29.450> though<00:03:29.720> for<00:03:29.889> any<00:03:30.889> other<00:03:31.129> weapon<00:03:31.579> its

long-range<00:03:32.569> already<00:03:33.370> then<00:03:34.370> again<00:03:34.459> we<00:03:34.790> would

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
long-range already then again we would

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.970 
long-range already then again we would
have<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.180> long-range<00:03:35.629> kind<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.169> sniping<00:03:36.799> and

rifle<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.410> have<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.650> know<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:43.190> bullet

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
rifle and you have to know the bullet

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.979 
rifle and you have to know the bullet
drop<00:03:43.639> how<00:03:44.000> far<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.329> bootable<00:03:44.540> drop<00:03:44.810> for

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
drop how far the bootable drop for

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.210 
drop how far the bootable drop for
example<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.459> m40<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.269> first<00:03:47.510> note

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
example and with the m40 the first note

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.119 
example and with the m40 the first note
symbolizes<00:03:49.269> 350<00:03:50.269> meters<00:03:50.810> between<00:03:51.109> 300<00:03:52.040> and

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
symbolizes 350 meters between 300 and

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.559 
symbolizes 350 meters between 300 and
350<00:03:52.730> meters<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:54.849> yet<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:55.910> target<00:03:56.209> has<00:03:56.299> to<00:03:56.449> be

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
350 meters and yet the target has to be

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.300 
350 meters and yet the target has to be
that<00:03:56.930> far<00:03:57.169> away<00:03:57.199> in<00:03:57.560> order<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:57.829> get<00:03:57.980> their<00:03:58.129> head

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
that far away in order to get their head

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.729 
that far away in order to get their head
shot<00:03:58.519> for<00:03:59.480> example<00:03:59.810> with<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.989> m<00:04:00.079> 98<00:04:00.260> be<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:00.650> the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
shot for example with the m 98 be on the

shot for example with the m 98 be on the
other<00:04:00.859> hand<00:04:01.040> with<00:04:01.310> head<00:04:01.579> which<00:04:02.209> has<00:04:02.419> a<00:04:02.569> lot

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
other hand with head which has a lot

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.580 
other hand with head which has a lot
less<00:04:03.169> bullet<00:04:03.980> drop<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:05.239> will<00:04:05.419> probably<00:04:06.290> come

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
less bullet drop you will probably come

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.210 
less bullet drop you will probably come
out<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:06.919> 500<00:04:07.639> to<00:04:08.120> 600<00:04:08.599> meters<00:04:09.079> with<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.949> first

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
out to 500 to 600 meters with the first

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.250 
out to 500 to 600 meters with the first
nodal<00:04:10.579> so<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.180> lot<00:04:11.780> more<00:04:11.930> accurate<00:04:12.290> again<00:04:12.590> but

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
nodal so and lot more accurate again but

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.870 
nodal so and lot more accurate again but
again<00:04:15.260> they<00:04:15.530> have<00:04:15.799> like<00:04:16.070> different<00:04:16.250> sets<00:04:16.609> in

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
again they have like different sets in

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.180 
again they have like different sets in
exchange<00:04:17.690> for<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.260> m40<00:04:18.680> has<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:19.010> first

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
exchange for that the m40 has the first

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.300 
exchange for that the m40 has the first
three<00:04:19.430> chambering<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.180> on<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.140> forth

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
three chambering and so on and so forth

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.980 
three chambering and so on and so forth
so<00:04:22.310> this<00:04:22.460> is<00:04:22.520> just<00:04:22.640> like<00:04:22.789> in<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.360> really<00:04:23.780> basic

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
so this is just like in a really basic

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.879 
so this is just like in a really basic
tip<00:04:24.289> I<00:04:24.440> want<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:24.830> give<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.039> guys

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
tip I want to give you guys

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.969 
tip I want to give you guys
and<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:28.020> crosshairs<00:04:28.439> right<00:04:28.530> on<00:04:28.770> top<00:04:28.949> of

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
and so the crosshairs right on top of

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.999 
and so the crosshairs right on top of
the<00:04:29.189> enemy<00:04:29.460> if<00:04:29.669> you<00:04:30.419> kind<00:04:31.169> of<00:04:31.319> trying<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.740> hit

if you want to try hitting moving

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.489 
if you want to try hitting moving
targets<00:04:35.219> use<00:04:35.969> the<00:04:36.150> shoulders<00:04:36.599> as<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.900> like

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:37.499 
targets use the shoulders as a like

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:41.749 
targets use the shoulders as a like
little<00:04:38.629> help<00:04:39.629> in<00:04:40.289> order<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.740> get<00:04:41.249> your<00:04:41.279> target

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
and if they're kind of running in a 45

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.059 
and if they're kind of running in a 45
degrees<00:04:44.759> angle<00:04:44.789> you<00:04:45.599> normally<00:04:45.960> can<00:04:46.199> go

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
degrees angle you normally can go

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.429 
degrees angle you normally can go
between<00:04:47.610> head<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.150> shoulders<00:04:48.749> you<00:04:48.870> normally

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
between head and shoulders you normally

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.779 
between head and shoulders you normally
get<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.680> kill<00:04:49.830> like<00:04:50.009> that<00:04:50.189> if<00:04:50.340> they're<00:04:50.490> kind

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
get the kill like that if they're kind

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.869 
get the kill like that if they're kind
of<00:04:50.849> close<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.569> to<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.099> then<00:04:53.099> again<00:04:53.310> the

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
of close it and to you then again the

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.019 
of close it and to you then again the
long-range<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:55.080> m40<00:04:55.580> first<00:04:56.580> move<00:04:56.789> load<00:04:56.909> is

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
long-range the m40 first move load is

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:02.600 
long-range the m40 first move load is
about<00:04:57.710> 350<00:04:58.710> 300<00:04:59.460> s<00:04:59.580> and<00:05:00.319> D<00:05:01.319> maab<00:05:01.889> it's<00:05:02.520> about

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
about 350 300 s and D maab it's about

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.129 
about 350 300 s and D maab it's about
five<00:05:03.000> from<00:05:03.150> six<00:05:03.210> hundred<00:05:03.719> meters<00:05:03.960> for<00:05:04.080> the

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
five from six hundred meters for the

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.290 
five from six hundred meters for the
first<00:05:04.319> mode<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:04.919> all<00:05:05.669> the<00:05:05.759> other<00:05:05.879> rifles<00:05:06.210> are

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
first mode so all the other rifles are

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.170 
first mode so all the other rifles are
kind<00:05:06.599> of<00:05:06.719> in<00:05:06.870> between<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.879> normally<00:05:08.879> all<00:05:09.060> the

kind of in between and normally all the
other<00:05:09.330> bolt<00:05:09.930> actions<00:05:10.319> have<00:05:10.529> to<00:05:10.919> first<00:05:11.189> mold

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
other bolt actions have to first mold

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.820 
other bolt actions have to first mold
out<00:05:11.490> at<00:05:11.610> around<00:05:11.840> 350<00:05:12.840> meters<00:05:13.110> because<00:05:13.319> then

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
out at around 350 meters because then

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.309 
out at around 350 meters because then
the<00:05:14.219> bullet<00:05:14.759> velocity<00:05:14.819> of<00:05:15.240> those<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:15.840> weapons

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
the bullet velocity of those and weapons

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.420 
the bullet velocity of those and weapons
aren't<00:05:16.620> too<00:05:17.069> different<00:05:17.449> they're<00:05:18.449> kind<00:05:18.719> of<00:05:18.779> I

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
aren't too different they're kind of I

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.140 
aren't too different they're kind of I
think<00:05:20.430> for<00:05:20.759> 24<00:05:21.569> 40<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.110> 464<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.189> l<00:05:23.550> 96<00:05:23.729> James

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
think for 24 40 and 464 the l 96 James

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.459 
think for 24 40 and 464 the l 96 James
ens<00:05:24.599> v98<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.770> they're<00:05:26.099> kind<00:05:26.759> of<00:05:26.879> similar<00:05:27.469> the

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
ens v98 so they're kind of similar the

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.980 
ens v98 so they're kind of similar the
only<00:05:28.710> real<00:05:29.039> two<00:05:29.759> rifles<00:05:29.939> which<00:05:30.300> are<00:05:30.539> out<00:05:30.810> of
