next<00:00:05.279> question<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.640> from<00:00:05.759> absolute<00:00:06.420> silence

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
next question is from absolute silence

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.100 
next question is from absolute silence
who<00:00:08.519> has<00:00:08.940> asked<00:00:09.300> what<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> ultimate<00:00:09.809> goal

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
who has asked what is the ultimate goal

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.350 
who has asked what is the ultimate goal
of<00:00:10.290> transhumanism<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.490> how<00:00:11.880> does<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.150> serve

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
of transhumanism and how does it serve

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.829 
of transhumanism and how does it serve
democracy<00:00:12.990> if<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.710> serves<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.130> at<00:00:14.280> all<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.210> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
democracy if it serves this at all and I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.150 
democracy if it serves this at all and I
guess<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> respect<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.740> does<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.039> offer

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
guess in the respect that does it offer

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.660 
guess in the respect that does it offer
more<00:00:17.490> personal<00:00:17.940> freedom<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.449> less<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.310> think<00:00:20.310> it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
more personal freedom or less I think it

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.599 
more personal freedom or less I think it
depends<00:00:21.270> where<00:00:21.689> you're<00:00:22.160> coming<00:00:23.160> from<00:00:23.189> if

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
depends where you're coming from if

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.349 
depends where you're coming from if
you're<00:00:24.119> coming<00:00:24.570> as<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.160> human<00:00:26.160> who<00:00:26.430> values<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
you're coming as a human who values the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.810 
you're coming as a human who values the
human<00:00:27.810> race<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.470> once<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> human<00:00:29.279> race<00:00:29.519> to

thing go out get together and I think
but<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> cyborg<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:58.290> goal<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
but as a cyborg the goal of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.590 
but as a cyborg the goal of
transhumanism<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.969> possibly<00:02:00.479> be
