00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.330
 or the cough minutes a new video news 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.749
 that I think is the news of the day 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.900
 news of the month news of the year of the year 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.429
 entered goya 2013 I think I already know this 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.190
 is going to become the news 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.199
 spoken of at least this year and in 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.580
 If confirmed even more we will 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.789
 take the first thing as a rumor 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.529
 because it is a rumor for now we 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.359
 take it easy we will not say things 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.820
 hasty but yes I will give my 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.199
 opinion point is really worth so 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.759
 well for now it's just a rumor 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.680
 game to mark it is a comfortable no 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.260
 have to be true with which by 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.230
 do not take it easy so 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.120
 well let's take it with those calmly 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.070
 because I say that the news of the year of 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.559
 month and day you will see it right now 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.769
 it just seems to have patented a 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.260
 system to basically avoid the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.870
 piracy and especially the second hand 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.679
 of what worries me the most because the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.449
 second hand 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.820
 well the second hand seems to be not the 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.559
 second hand for me is a very system 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.480
 good for people to get from 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.659
 very cheap prices 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.150
 and an exchange of basically things 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.940
 that we achieved in some way 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.140
 sincerely, according to day to me what 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.090
 we are missing if the money for some 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.190
 good reason I can sell all my game 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.680
 no and recover some money like that but 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.000
 with this measure in you and second hand 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.500
 Well I could not do it good what 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.690
 consists of this measure before and second hand 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.490
 anti-piracy as you want to call it in 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.910
 basically what is involved is to link 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.100
 the game with your playstation 4 console in 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.140
 the case that it leaves for play if they are 4 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.430
 for now it 's basically one is a 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.020
 patent that can basically be 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.119
 use for next consoles then 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.880
 I will give my opinion on all this 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.990
 but first I will explain a little 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.630
 basically because the game would be linked 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.940
 what our playstation 4 console 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.580
 in three axes for play four or in that 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.770
 whether in case you are 41 pc call 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.960
 would link and the game and what not 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.850
 we know what we all have doubts is not 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.070
 it is known if it will be linked to an account 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.300
 of prices online work is not known if 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.119
 we will have to be connected always 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.730
 to play and especially do not know what 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.380
 it will happen if your console breaks 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.500
 what can happen because it is 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.310
 imagine if you only link with your 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.710
 precise are 4 and 7 it breaks what the fuck 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.920
 do what the fuck you do with all your 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.990
 games if linked to the account 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.940
 that you have precious the network and 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.850
 you lose the password what the fuck are you doing 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.180
 in which you go or steal or steal said 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.510
 tell what the hell are you doing in which we're going to 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.340
 see is all this a huge paranoia like that 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.410
 how good all those questions I hope 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.390
 that yes in case of putting this are and 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.890
 answer because I see this as the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.660
 end of video games in case of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.890
 confirm them and declared what I see I see 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.440
 like the end of video games or by 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.880
 example the end of sony so that I think that 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.860
 it is this patent I believe that this patent 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.770
 it's for how to say have them a how 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.020
 say it as saying it clearly to 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.000
 have them sure that for example if 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.970
 Microsoft did the same thing they did 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.910
 the same thing because to be clear that it is in 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.640
 microsoft case to do this are and 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.690
 would do this and in case they are made 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.180
 this probably microsoft 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.100
 I do not know what I would do but I do not think that seeing 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.600
 the result you may have to do 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.470
 the same so I think this is 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.630
 how to say a shield of if they do 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.550
 someone the same I do the same and we 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.500
 we all benefit 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.300
 everyone and it's possible that all of them 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.640
 the consoles because if you have one 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.650
 they have master and everyone so good 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.240
 everyone to pc or everyone to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.100
 hack games or everyone is going to 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.420
 know what but doing the consoles of 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.580
 the video games could be quite 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.290
 quite in my mind because in case of 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.750
 spend this increase piracy 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.270
 many developers would go from 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.640
 produce of developing games the poster 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.020
 they will no longer be given any benefit or 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.460
 we would even let you have super 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.890
 productions in videogames themes 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.990
 also so this is not for nothing 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.460
 good if confirmed, let's hope 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.140
 that is not confirmed we have already had 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.610
 many opinions on this topic about 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.020
 the subject of the second hand and such and 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.750
 many rumors about these issues too 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.580
 that could have a link like that 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.130
 to avoid games or a hand both 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.680
 in xbox as in playstation as in xbox 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.240
 720 as accuracy 4 but for now as 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.709
 I repeat again and manages to mark a thousand 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.660
 Millions of times it's a rumor 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.810
 you have to take it as a rumor and it's like that 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.280
 jack tretton on the other hand said good 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.500
 jack tretton is one of the maximum 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.570
 responsible after sony computer 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.070
 entertainment america has already said in 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.770
 several times how good it is in 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.210
 against this to unlock games and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.590
 since he did this, no, but of course 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.050
 he does not have the last decision the 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.700
 I would have sony japan, I say, and with 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:45.150
 for this would be a great great great great 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.480
 putada we could but also by part 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.830
 from crytek and from the rise and 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.810
 you know dais developer of 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.430
 battlefield 3 and developer credits 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.190
 of the most well-known part of game 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.260
 as a crisis they are against the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.060
 second hand mysteriously good 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.680
 dais said basically that is 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.080
 found a hand because basically 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.460
 to be able to kill creativity or logos I do not 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.320
 I remember very well you speak is not theft 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.750
 against the second hand now it's 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.820
 totally horrifying hairy orri and 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.190
 super ugly that you're against that from 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.430
 a person who does not have a lot of money 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.300
 can buy a better game because I do not know 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.590
 can allow 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.590
 really directly me 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.300
 when I did not work when I did nothing 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.789
 we really bought played for me it was 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.650
 the luxury of my environment has to go to 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.759
 the second bad and also resorts to the 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.620
 second hand to buy a game 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.599
 Logically, that's what pulls you the most 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.490
 cheap and what will be more profitable and 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.050
 really good if they want to think 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.220
 They lose money, well, I think 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.740
 that they will lose more money by putting 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.060
 games at 60 to 70 euros and above is not 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.430
 can buy second hand much 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.169
 people will think it 115 times more the 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.460
 buy a game not and especially the 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.180
 people are going to look at the opinions of everything 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.819
 the rest for that and logically I if 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.930
 they put this shit logically I'm going 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.949
 to have good opinions about 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.740
 games I will do very how to say it very 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.030
 hard with the analysis of the 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.860
 games logically so that people do not 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.930
 make a mistake so good nothing else 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.430
 I already given my point of view for now 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.960
 it's just a rumor we'll see what 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.699
 is what happens let's hope it does not happen 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.110
 nothing because it could be the end of the 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.639
 world of video games so good 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.020
 nothing more kids we all see it in the 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.020
 next and to be people
