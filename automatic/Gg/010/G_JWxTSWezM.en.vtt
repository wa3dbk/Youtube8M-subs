00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.570 
to tip over you know it's just your
personal<00:05:38.380> preference<00:05:38.800> but<00:05:38.860> my<00:05:39.130> opinion<00:05:39.430> these

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
personal preference but my opinion these

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.140 
personal preference but my opinion these
