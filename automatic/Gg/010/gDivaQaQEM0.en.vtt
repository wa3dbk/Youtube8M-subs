foods like tempura and this is called
daikon<00:01:15.750> oroshi<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> let's<00:01:18.600> start<00:01:18.869> um<00:01:19.189> cut<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
daikon oroshi so let's start um cut the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.539 
daikon oroshi so let's start um cut the
daikon<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.900> rounds<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:23.000> try<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.080> make<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
daikon in rounds and try to make the

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:34.060 
daikon in rounds and try to make the
pieces<00:01:27.590> similar<00:01:30.619> then<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.740> peel<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.159> skin

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
pieces similar then you peel the skin

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.530 
pieces similar then you peel the skin
very<00:01:35.070> thin

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:49.610 

once<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.290> peal<00:01:38.620> then<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:40.980> cut<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:43.660> edges

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.190 

once<00:01:50.620> you<00:01:50.710> cut<00:01:50.920> all<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.340> edges<00:01:52.090> on<00:01:52.510> both<00:01:52.570> sides

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
once you cut all the edges on both sides

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:06.840 
once you cut all the edges on both sides
then<00:01:54.510> you<00:01:55.510> make<00:01:55.720> an<00:01:55.870> X<00:01:56.080> on<00:02:01.590> both<00:02:02.590> sides<00:02:02.890> -<00:02:05.850> now

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
then you make an X on both sides - now

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.240 
then you make an X on both sides - now
we<00:02:07.000> put<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.330> in<00:02:07.510> all<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.440> daikon<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.040> pot

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
we put it in all the daikon in the pot

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.380 
we put it in all the daikon in the pot
and<00:02:11.310> now<00:02:12.310> we're<00:02:12.520> going<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.910> cover<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.360> with

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
and now we're going to cover it with

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.960 
and now we're going to cover it with
water<00:02:13.780> now<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.530> water<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.640> could<00:02:15.760> use

simmering I leave it there without
washing<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:56.200> rice<00:02:56.230> because<00:02:57.220> what<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.700> want<00:02:58.209> is
