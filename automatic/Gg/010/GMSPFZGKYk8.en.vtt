00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.090 
kind of followed the natural curl of the
hair<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> curl<00:01:34.380> was<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.829> way<00:01:35.070> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
hair so if the curl was going this way I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.429
