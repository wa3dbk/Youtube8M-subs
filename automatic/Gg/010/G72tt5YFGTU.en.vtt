uh test on these it says battle scars if

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.879 
uh test on these it says battle scars if
you're<00:03:35.299> running<00:03:35.660> hard<00:03:35.840> enough<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.560> chrome

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
you're running hard enough the chrome

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.490 
you're running hard enough the chrome
paint<00:03:37.250> could<00:03:37.700> chop<00:03:38.000> off<00:03:38.389> chip<00:03:38.900> off<00:03:39.079> all<00:03:39.350> right

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
paint could chop off chip off all right

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.870 
paint could chop off chip off all right
good<00:03:39.650> that's<00:03:39.889> and<00:03:40.340> that's<00:03:40.430> something<00:03:40.700> was

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
good that's and that's something was

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.030
