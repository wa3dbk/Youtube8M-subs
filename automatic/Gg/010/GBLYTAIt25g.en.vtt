00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
problems in chaos but my argument is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.430 
problems in chaos but my argument is
that<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:39.209> time<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.569> American<00:02:40.260> soldiers

highway<00:03:39.709> expenditures<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.250> would<00:03:41.519> say<00:03:41.730> that

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
highway expenditures so I would say that

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.089 
highway expenditures so I would say that
in<00:03:42.660> some<00:03:42.930> ways<00:03:43.139> yes<00:03:43.410> they<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:43.889> some

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
in some ways yes they have some

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.860 
in some ways yes they have some
differences<00:03:44.579> but<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.910> other<00:03:45.120> ways<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.629> think

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
differences but in other ways I think

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.319 
differences but in other ways I think
Republicans<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.799> grown<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.370> act<00:03:47.849> just<00:03:48.269> like
