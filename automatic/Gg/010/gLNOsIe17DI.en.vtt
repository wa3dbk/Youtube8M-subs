00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello dear fans friends today I show 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.610
 Do a tutorial on how to do it relatively 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.100
 simple way of putting a pool on one 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.180
 Stilts fundament builds and that over the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.840
 sea ​​now I choose the stilts 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.949
 foundation and pull with pressed old 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.320
 Taste the fundament direction country 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 pressed old button you can do it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.170
 but not 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.700
 It aims at the surface of 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.219
 stilts very close to the foundation 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.850
 sea level is so low it goes 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.510
 not anymore 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.500
 which would be feasible for the pools 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.280
 so now we pull our pool but 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.379
 For this we take the wall tool and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.790
 quite simply create a space and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:13.320
 this room then defines our pool 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:16.619
 big load at least one box from 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:22.140
 stilts free here at all 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:25.590
 At least one box so now 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.799
 did you draw your room and that is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.079
 Now the definite pool size and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.299
 wide and we want to have that i have 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.610
 me here for a sun deck 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.860
 decided where to go then 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.759
 If necessary a bar can sit down couple 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.490
 beach chairs and so the brown that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.670
 is the pool edge and the bed area 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.280
 and the blue will be the definitive one 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.820
 pool 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.149
 now comes the chat with in action 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.340
 control c types her constraints flow 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.340
 elevation if one 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:11.680
 press enter and now we lower 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:15.550
 the whole surface down and that means 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:22.390
 a staircase that sit here so times 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:25.480
 in the middle you see the ceiling lowers and 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:31.930
 Now you are right where the stairs 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:35.260
 left the second staircase and there 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.470
 again the third is the maximum 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.800
 what we do deep often three stairs 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.900
 deeper is not likely to go otherwise 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.700
 the pool does not work anymore 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.010
 We change back to our terrain 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:54.760
 tool and take the terrain straightening 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:02.110
 and start at the lowest point 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:06.540
 and pull here our entire area 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:10.380
 step by step until the whole pool 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.380
 completely lowered 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.040
 so 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.280
 she is well out of the whole pool now 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.700
 nice flat stairs you can now 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.700
 Clear 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.410
 that's half the rent here 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:52.310
 Now we give the cheat concenter 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:57.590
 flow elevation true 1 switch one 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:04.820
 lower level and delete the now 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:08.090
 entire floor completely ok the floor 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.570
 is deleted that looks like this and now 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.460
 the blanket is still drawn what else 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.580
 important to mention is this grid 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.710
 Raster should necessarily still be such 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.070
 There are no holes in there 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:23.480
 that it is very important to come this way and now 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.810
 we can go to the beautiful part now 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.460
 finally put a pool 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.280
 before we activate again 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.560
 our chat the konz trier flow 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:44.030
 We now focus on innovation 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:50.620
 go to the pool and get hot here 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:53.540
 we longed pool we straighten the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.150
 stilts edges which he namely 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.150
 also pulled down 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.200
 All are just made alike 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.120
 now also the pool edges will be here 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.510
 pulled up again that should not you 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.200
 irritate that it is quite normal 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:17.520
 she straightened everything up first 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.520
 finish here 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:27.190
 so now are the whole stilts surfaces 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:30.730
 straight again and now we straighten 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:38.590
 the pool in exactly the same way 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:41.940
 We draw and wise and level tool 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.940
 here hand by hand 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:58.970
 so that everything is just fine once 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:02.120
 by controlling it well so 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.340
 it should look like you too 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.000
 a control view in the pool itself 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.410
 in 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:15.200
 I see there is a box from the pool 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:17.890
 border itself also increased that is 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:29.140
 he does not have to do it right now either 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:29.140
 so now everything is right 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:40.280
 we give the cheat concentrated again 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:45.320
 flow innovation and what is coming now is 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:49.690
 actually deco story who wants 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:53.390
 he can now edit the pool 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.020
 this one box projecting stilts 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.340
 Clear 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:01.880
 I think that's very nice because then sees 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:06.250
 It looks like the pool would be like one 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.250
 kind overflow school into the sea 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:15.800
 I'll say my poodle now 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.830
 this looks like here is the 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.870
 result, what have i done yet 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.700
 have the stairs still set one 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.900
 Poolbar set at a later time 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:29.300
 And most important here is the staircase 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.430
 so that you even get into the pool 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.610
 the sims can not overcome this hurdle 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.800
 Cope alone so you have to 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.590
 still put the stairs nicely and here 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.700
 we are now at the end 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:44.210
 I have a little more 

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:47.450
 decorate the portholes that are boxed 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:50.470
 content I have still used there 

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.470
 a little bit of blood 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:08:00.320
 and garden chairs etc 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.940
 that is so finished here i hope 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.729
 you have the tutorial a bit 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.570
 helped and wish you a lot of fun 

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:07.570
