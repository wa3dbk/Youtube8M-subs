00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it's the same with hypnotism it usually

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.809 
it's the same with hypnotism it usually
involves<00:01:19.170> getting<00:01:19.319> people<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.979> relax<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
involves getting people to relax and

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.149 
involves getting people to relax and
focus<00:01:21.179> on<00:01:21.569> a<00:01:21.600> particular<00:01:21.810> spot<00:01:22.440> or<00:01:22.770> internal

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
focus on a particular spot or internal

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
focus on a particular spot or internal
function<00:01:23.550> like<00:01:23.700> breathing<00:01:23.940> and<00:01:24.320> people

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
function like breathing and people

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.920 
function like breathing and people
become<00:01:25.590> more<00:01:25.920> susceptible<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.090> suggestion<00:01:27.689> in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
become more susceptible to suggestion in

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.850 
become more susceptible to suggestion in
this<00:01:28.110> state<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:29.040> only<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.090> want<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.860> so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
this state but only if they want to so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.160 
this state but only if they want to so
as<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.610> enter<00:01:32.939> into<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.570> state<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.990> hypnosis

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
as you enter into that state of hypnosis

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.340 
as you enter into that state of hypnosis
and<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.579> EEG<00:01:35.969> would<00:01:36.360> pick<00:01:36.540> up<00:01:36.719> more<00:01:36.960> alpha

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and the EEG would pick up more alpha

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
and the EEG would pick up more alpha
waves<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> your<00:01:37.710> brain<00:01:38.689> indicating<00:01:39.689> an<00:01:39.810> awake

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
waves in your brain indicating an awake

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.120 
waves in your brain indicating an awake
but<00:01:40.500> relaxed<00:01:40.860> state<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:43.590> people<00:01:43.890> use

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
but relaxed state and some people use

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
but relaxed state and some people use
hypnosis<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.759> try<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> retrieve<00:01:45.689> memories

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
hypnosis to try to retrieve memories

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.700 
hypnosis to try to retrieve memories
which<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.979> kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.490> dangerous<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> not

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
which is kind of dangerous and not

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.770 
which is kind of dangerous and not
scientific<00:01:50.090> because<00:01:51.090> memory<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.509> very

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
scientific because memory is very

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
scientific because memory is very
malleable<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.500> since<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.070> record

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
malleable and since we don't record

actually create false memories that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
questions or expectations even if they

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
don't intend to and some people also

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.130 
don't intend to and some people also
think<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.220> hypnosis<00:02:11.640> helps<00:02:12.299> them<00:02:12.450> refocus

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
think that hypnosis helps them refocus

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.410 
think that hypnosis helps them refocus
their<00:02:13.320> attention<00:02:13.400> which<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.430> why<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.390> be

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
their attention which is why it can be

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.289 
their attention which is why it can be
used<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.959> treat<00:02:16.350> pain<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:17.640> example<00:02:17.700> there's

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
used to treat pain for example there's

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.970 
used to treat pain for example there's
some<00:02:18.570> evidence<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.109> people<00:02:19.530> under<00:02:19.769> hypnosis

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
some evidence that people under hypnosis

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.880 
some evidence that people under hypnosis
have<00:02:20.670> reduced<00:02:21.540> brain<00:02:21.840> activity<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.590> areas

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
have reduced brain activity in areas

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.490 
have reduced brain activity in areas
that<00:02:23.310> process<00:02:23.790> sensory<00:02:24.209> input<00:02:24.660> even<00:02:25.380> though

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
that process sensory input even though

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.620 
that process sensory input even though
the<00:02:25.680> areas<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.040> receive<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.090> sensory<00:02:27.450> input

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
the areas that receive the sensory input

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.210 
the areas that receive the sensory input
the<00:02:27.930> sensory<00:02:28.230> cortex<00:02:28.410> are<00:02:28.799> functioning

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the sensory cortex are functioning

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.220 
the sensory cortex are functioning
normally<00:02:29.329> so<00:02:30.329> this<00:02:30.480> could<00:02:30.690> mean<00:02:30.900> that

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
normally so this could mean that

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.140 
normally so this could mean that
although<00:02:31.530> hypnosis<00:02:32.220> doesn't<00:02:32.489> completely

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
although hypnosis doesn't completely

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.070 
although hypnosis doesn't completely
block<00:02:33.419> out<00:02:33.600> sensor

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
block out sensor

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.050 
block out sensor
in<00:02:34.260> put<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.650> might<00:02:34.860> help<00:02:35.070> inhibit<00:02:35.820> our

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
in put it might help inhibit our

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.120 
in put it might help inhibit our
attention<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.720> input<00:02:37.200> which<00:02:37.740> enables

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
attention to that input which enables

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.070 
attention to that input which enables
some<00:02:38.340> people<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.970> deal<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:39.180> more<00:02:39.660> painful

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
some people to deal with more painful

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.710 
some people to deal with more painful
stimuli<00:02:40.560> than<00:02:40.770> they<00:02:40.860> normally<00:02:41.040> would<00:02:41.720> but

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
stimuli than they normally would but

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.150 
stimuli than they normally would but
again<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.230> bottom<00:02:43.380> line<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.070> you

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
again the bottom line is that if you

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.980 
again the bottom line is that if you
think<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.520> will<00:02:44.610> work<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:45.120> has<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> good<00:02:45.930> chance

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
think it will work it has a good chance

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.260 
think it will work it has a good chance
of<00:02:46.320> working<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.460> think<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.090> won't

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
of working but if you think it won't

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.760 
of working but if you think it won't
work<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.750> you're<00:02:48.990> stuck<00:02:49.290> with<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> more

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
work then you're stuck with the more

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.970 
work then you're stuck with the more
traditional<00:02:50.370> pain-killing<00:02:50.640> techniques<00:02:52.790> and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
traditional pain-killing techniques and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.560 
traditional pain-killing techniques and
another<00:02:55.980> induced<00:02:56.700> state<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.120> consciousness

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
another induced state of consciousness

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.840 
another induced state of consciousness
is<00:02:57.900> meditation<00:02:58.610> there<00:02:59.610> are<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.730> lot<00:02:59.820> of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
is meditation there are a lot of

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.060 
is meditation there are a lot of
definitions<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.720> meditation<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.500> we're

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
definitions of meditation but we're

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.770 
definitions of meditation but we're
going<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.250> focus<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.880> type<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.330> involves

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
going to focus on the type that involves

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.080 
going to focus on the type that involves
training<00:03:04.320> people<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.670> self-regulate<00:03:05.670> their

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
training people to self-regulate their

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.930 
training people to self-regulate their
attention<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.900> awareness<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.940> meditation

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
attention and awareness so meditation

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.840 
attention and awareness so meditation
can<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.570> guided<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.770> focused<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.370> something

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
can be guided and focused on something

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.470 
can be guided and focused on something
in<00:03:12.030> particular<00:03:12.950> like<00:03:13.950> breathing<00:03:14.490> oftentimes

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
in particular like breathing oftentimes

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.660 
in particular like breathing oftentimes
are<00:03:15.810> relaxing<00:03:16.680> muscles<00:03:17.040> or<00:03:17.280> something<00:03:17.580> like

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
are relaxing muscles or something like

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.540 
are relaxing muscles or something like
that<00:03:18.380> but<00:03:19.380> meditation<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.100> also<00:03:20.220> be

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
that but meditation can also be

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.220 
that but meditation can also be
unfocused<00:03:21.150> when<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.570> let<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> mind<00:03:22.080> wander

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
unfocused when you let the mind wander

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.520 
unfocused when you let the mind wander
freely<00:03:23.420> during<00:03:24.420> light<00:03:24.690> meditation<00:03:25.290> people

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
freely during light meditation people

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.130 
freely during light meditation people
experience<00:03:26.310> more<00:03:26.670> alpha<00:03:27.209> waves<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.720> during

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
experience more alpha waves that during

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.980 
experience more alpha waves that during
normal<00:03:28.410> relaxation<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.550> then<00:03:30.450> during<00:03:30.630> deep

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
normal relaxation and then during deep

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.199 
normal relaxation and then during deep
meditation<00:03:31.740> this<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.550> type<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.790> usually

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
meditation this is the type that usually

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.720 
meditation this is the type that usually
only<00:03:33.330> experts<00:03:33.900> achieve<00:03:34.290> like<00:03:34.650> Tibetan<00:03:35.430> monks

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
only experts achieve like Tibetan monks

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.660 
only experts achieve like Tibetan monks
but<00:03:36.720> they<00:03:36.870> have<00:03:37.110> increased<00:03:37.680> theta<00:03:38.100> waves<00:03:38.430> in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
but they have increased theta waves in

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.479 
but they have increased theta waves in
the<00:03:38.850> brain<00:03:39.590> which<00:03:40.590> also<00:03:41.010> happened<00:03:41.370> during

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the brain which also happened during

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.830 
the brain which also happened during
some<00:03:41.940> sleep<00:03:42.239> stages<00:03:42.510> but<00:03:43.200> you're<00:03:43.530> still<00:03:43.709> awake

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
some sleep stages but you're still awake

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.120 
some sleep stages but you're still awake
there<00:03:45.840> aren't<00:03:46.050> very<00:03:46.080> many<00:03:46.290> scientific

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
there aren't very many scientific

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.650 
there aren't very many scientific
studies<00:03:47.489> on<00:03:47.519> long-term<00:03:48.239> effects<00:03:48.510> of

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
studies on long-term effects of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.630 
studies on long-term effects of
meditation<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:49.440> some<00:03:49.709> studies<00:03:50.040> do<00:03:50.280> indicate

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
meditation but some studies do indicate

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.780 
meditation but some studies do indicate
that<00:03:51.000> in<00:03:51.120> people<00:03:51.480> who<00:03:51.690> regularly<00:03:52.290> get<00:03:53.250> into

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
that in people who regularly get into

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.030 
that in people who regularly get into
deep<00:03:54.090> meditation<00:03:54.380> there's<00:03:55.380> increased

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
deep meditation there's increased

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.240 
deep meditation there's increased
activity<00:03:56.790> when<00:03:57.209> they're<00:03:57.510> not<00:03:57.630> agitating

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
activity when they're not agitating
