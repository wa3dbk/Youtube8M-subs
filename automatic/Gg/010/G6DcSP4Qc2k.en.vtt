00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
here is the Sony CX 760 and I'm going to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.039 
here is the Sony CX 760 and I'm going to
go<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.340> galaxy<00:01:53.909> camera<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> can

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
go up to the galaxy camera then you can

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.840 
go up to the galaxy camera then you can
see<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.070> InFocus<00:01:56.520> I'm<00:01:56.729> gonna

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
see that it is not InFocus I'm gonna

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.530 
see that it is not InFocus I'm gonna
hold<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.149> there<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.579> doesn't<00:01:59.880> focus<00:02:00.000> now

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
hold it there and it doesn't focus now

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.590 
hold it there and it doesn't focus now
if<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.320> focus<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.850> Samsung

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
if I want it to focus on the Samsung

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.200 
if I want it to focus on the Samsung
words<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.409> surely<00:02:04.530> tap<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> screen

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
words here I can surely tap the screen

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.700 
words here I can surely tap the screen
which<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.659> did<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.290> there<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.649> go

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
which I just did and now there you go

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.279 
which I just did and now there you go
it's<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.340> focus<00:02:08.520> now<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.720> pull<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> away

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it's in focus now if I pull it away

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.619 
it's in focus now if I pull it away
it's<00:02:10.950> incredibly<00:02:11.549> out<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.849> focus<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.480> will

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
it's incredibly out of focus and it will

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.319 
it's incredibly out of focus and it will
not<00:02:12.810> refocus<00:02:13.349> itself<00:02:13.650> again<00:02:14.010> unless<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.700> touch

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
not refocus itself again unless I touch

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.539 
not refocus itself again unless I touch
to<00:02:15.599> focus<00:02:15.959> now<00:02:16.620> Apple<00:02:16.950> has<00:02:17.069> done<00:02:17.159> this<00:02:17.370> on

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
to focus now Apple has done this on

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.580 
to focus now Apple has done this on
purpose<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.810> their<00:02:19.019> reasoning<00:02:19.470> is

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
purpose and I do like their reasoning is

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.170 
purpose and I do like their reasoning is
that<00:02:19.709> sometimes<00:02:20.129> with<00:02:20.310> continuous<00:02:20.849> autofocus

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
that sometimes with continuous autofocus

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.440 
that sometimes with continuous autofocus
it<00:02:21.959> will<00:02:22.260> search<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> focus<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.970> it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
it will search for what the focus for it

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.479 
it will search for what the focus for it
will<00:02:24.569> kind<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.840> bounce<00:02:25.019> around<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:26.129> it

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
will kind of bounce around like this it

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.009 
will kind of bounce around like this it
won't<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:26.849> what<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.180> looking<00:02:27.540> at<00:02:27.659> and<00:02:27.959> you

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
won't know what it's looking at and you

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.750 
won't know what it's looking at and you
can<00:02:28.049> see<00:02:28.170> all<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.560> exposure<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.159> changing<00:02:29.670> it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
can see all the exposure is changing it

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.819 
can see all the exposure is changing it
becomes<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.269> disaster<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:31.379> that's<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.650> very

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
becomes a disaster so that's a very

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.610 
becomes a disaster so that's a very
smart<00:02:32.129> choice<00:02:32.510> what<00:02:33.510> makes<00:02:33.690> me<00:02:33.900> upset<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.349> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
smart choice what makes me upset is the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.490 
smart choice what makes me upset is the
fact<00:02:34.829> that<00:02:34.950> they<00:02:35.250> don't<00:02:35.459> offer<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.450> option<00:02:36.780> so

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
fact that they don't offer the option so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.890 
fact that they don't offer the option so
that<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:38.099> use<00:02:38.640> autofocus<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.359> I<00:02:39.450> need<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.659> to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that I can use autofocus if I need it to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.869 
that I can use autofocus if I need it to
sometimes<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:40.890> don't<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.220> an<00:02:41.430> extra<00:02:41.609> finger

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
sometimes I don't have an extra finger

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.000 
sometimes I don't have an extra finger
free<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.810> sit<00:02:42.989> there<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.349> tap<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.890> screen

free to sit there and tap on the screen
to<00:02:44.489> focus<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.510> for<00:02:45.720> some<00:02:45.930> people<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.859> works

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
to focus but for some people this works

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.319 
to focus but for some people this works
fine<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:49.040> right<00:02:50.040> here<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.430> perfect<00:02:50.760> focus<00:02:50.940> is

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
fine so right here in perfect focus is

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.839 
fine so right here in perfect focus is

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
focus and lock focus as well so we're

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.199 
focus and lock focus as well so we're
going<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:02.730> look<00:03:03.090> now<00:03:03.150> at<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.989> galaxy<00:03:04.680> camera

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
going to look now at the galaxy camera

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.640 
going to look now at the galaxy camera
and<00:03:06.209> see<00:03:06.359> that<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.629> able<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.870> auto<00:03:07.139> adjust

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and see that it's able to auto adjust

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.970 
and see that it's able to auto adjust
focus<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.549> it's<00:03:09.030> not<00:03:09.120> able<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.629> auto<00:03:10.409> adjust

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980

focus and it's not able to auto adjust
the<00:03:11.280> lighting<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:12.329> it's<00:03:12.690> able<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.049> do<00:03:13.170> this

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
the lighting so it's able to do this

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.439 
the lighting so it's able to do this
just<00:03:13.620> fine<00:03:13.889> and<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.609> don't<00:03:14.669> see<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.030> comes<00:03:15.329> to

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:15.449 
just fine and I don't see it comes to

lease searching for focus it will once

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.039 
lease searching for focus it will once
in<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.250> while<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:18.060> that's<00:03:18.269> when<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.629> tap<00:03:18.900> the
