00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
push enough power in the USB ports it's

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.770 
push enough power in the USB ports it's
got<00:01:10.540> two<00:01:11.230> here<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:11.890> use<00:01:12.100> both<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:13.630> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
got two here so you use both in the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.320 
got two here so you use both in the
computer<00:01:14.290> when<00:01:14.830> you're<00:01:15.070> when<00:01:15.640> there's<00:01:16.240> not

computer when you're when there's not
enough<00:01:16.570> power<00:01:16.750> going<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.350> thing<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.650> does

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
enough power going to the thing it does

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.340 
enough power going to the thing it does
not<00:01:17.980> use<00:01:18.250> an<00:01:18.400> external<00:01:18.850> power<00:01:19.060> source<00:01:19.450> it's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
not use an external power source it's

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.640 
not use an external power source it's
just<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.640> hard<00:01:21.880> drive<00:01:22.120> and<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:23.020> USB<00:01:23.470> cable

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
just the hard drive and the USB cable

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.510 
just the hard drive and the USB cable
which<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.430> what<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.730> like<00:01:25.000> I've<00:01:25.360> had<00:01:26.520> external

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
which is what I like I've had external

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.180 
which is what I like I've had external
hard<00:01:27.880> drive<00:01:28.290> hard<00:01:29.290> drives<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.710> enclosures

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
hard drive hard drives and enclosures

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.820 
hard drive hard drives and enclosures
before<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.870> what<00:01:31.870> I<00:01:31.900> didn't<00:01:32.230> like<00:01:32.290> about<00:01:32.410> them

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
before and what I didn't like about them

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.060 
before and what I didn't like about them
was<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.550> external<00:01:34.030> power<00:01:34.810> supply<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.770> had

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
was the external power supply that I had

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.830 
was the external power supply that I had
to<00:01:36.280> attach<00:01:36.520> so<00:01:36.730> you<00:01:36.820> plug<00:01:37.000> in<00:01:37.150> your<00:01:37.240> USB<00:01:37.300> and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
to attach so you plug in your USB and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.950 
to attach so you plug in your USB and
then<00:01:38.050> you<00:01:38.200> needed<00:01:38.380> another<00:01:39.300> plug<00:01:40.300> for<00:01:40.330> power

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
then you needed another plug for power

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.010 
then you needed another plug for power
which<00:01:41.350> I<00:01:41.650> really<00:01:42.340> did<00:01:42.610> not<00:01:42.790> like<00:01:43.150> so<00:01:43.660> this<00:01:43.960> is

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020
