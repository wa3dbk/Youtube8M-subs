grandpa's do your economically their
gram-negative<00:01:28.080> okay<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> bacilli<00:01:30.240> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
gram-negative okay are the bacilli of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
gram-negative okay are the bacilli of
the<00:01:30.450> coca<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:30.960> are<00:01:31.049> bacilli<00:01:31.650> remember

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the coca they are bacilli remember

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.140 
the coca they are bacilli remember
whereas<00:01:32.850> s<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.360> pestis<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> rod<00:01:34.460> okay<00:01:35.460> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
whereas s in a pestis is a rod okay so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.499 
whereas s in a pestis is a rod okay so
they<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.600> non<00:01:36.869> lactose<00:01:37.380> fermenters<00:01:37.799> non

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
they are non lactose fermenters non

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.160 
they are non lactose fermenters non
lactose<00:01:39.890> fermenters<00:01:40.890> okay<00:01:41.820> very<00:01:42.750> important

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
lactose fermenters okay very important

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:53.420 
lactose fermenters okay very important
points<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.149> non<00:01:45.290> h2s<00:01:49.040> producers<00:01:52.280> okay<00:01:53.280> guys

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
points and non h2s producers okay guys

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
points and non h2s producers okay guys
so<00:01:55.159> gram-negative<00:01:56.159> bacilli<00:01:56.820> non<00:01:57.090> lactose

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so gram-negative bacilli non lactose

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510 
so gram-negative bacilli non lactose
fermenters<00:01:57.719> non<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.500> producers<00:01:59.009> okay

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
fermenters non is just producers okay

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.420 
fermenters non is just producers okay
and<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.780> other<00:02:00.960> important<00:02:01.439> point<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.920> about

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and the other important point is about

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.810 
and the other important point is about
this<00:02:02.610> bacteria<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.950> they<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> body<00:02:05.579> called

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
this bacteria is they have a body called

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.710 
this bacteria is they have a body called
cold<00:02:06.149> growth

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.380 

cold<00:02:10.720> growth<00:02:11.280> okay<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.520> they<00:02:12.700> are<00:02:12.760> mortal<00:02:13.030> and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
cold growth okay and they are mortal and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.620 
cold growth okay and they are mortal and
immortal<00:02:14.100> mortal<00:02:15.100> at<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.970> temperature

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
immortal mortal at the temperature

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.360 
immortal mortal at the temperature
around<00:02:17.580> 25<00:02:18.580> degrees<00:02:18.720> centigrade<00:02:19.720> and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
around 25 degrees centigrade and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.930 
around 25 degrees centigrade and
immortal<00:02:21.370> as<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> non<00:02:22.060> motile<00:02:23.100> non<00:02:24.100> motile<00:02:24.610> at

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
immortal as a non motile non motile at

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.820 
immortal as a non motile non motile at
the<00:02:25.300> temperature<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:27.090> around<00:02:28.090> what<00:02:28.780> equal<00:02:29.080> 37

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the temperature of around what equal 37

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.449 
the temperature of around what equal 37
degree<00:02:30.840> centigrade<00:02:31.840> okay<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.560> remember<00:02:32.830> 25

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
degree centigrade okay so remember 25

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.309 
degree centigrade okay so remember 25
then<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:33.790> are<00:02:33.940> 37<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:34.690> are<00:02:34.780> non<00:02:34.959> motile

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
then what are 37 they are non motile

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.490 
then what are 37 they are non motile
okay<00:02:37.140> right<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.360> let's<00:02:40.569> talk<00:02:40.780> about<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.230> and

okay right so let's talk about this and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.560 
okay right so let's talk about this and
let<00:02:41.709> me<00:02:41.860> move<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.400> what<00:02:42.670> he<00:02:42.760> call<00:02:43.000> law<00:02:43.239> there

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
let me move on to what he call law there

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.270 
let me move on to what he call law there
is<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.720> world<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.530> var<00:02:44.830> for<00:02:45.100> this

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
is a world that is a var for this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.900 
is a world that is a var for this
bacteria<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.060> nothing<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:46.600> it's<00:02:46.780> not<00:02:47.140> ik

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
bacteria is nothing but it's not ik

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.040 
bacteria is nothing but it's not ik
zoonotic<00:02:48.910> okay<00:02:51.480> similar<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.630> what<00:02:52.780> he<00:02:52.870> called

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
zoonotic okay similar to what he called

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.150 
zoonotic okay similar to what he called
at<00:02:53.230> senior<00:02:53.620> pestis<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:55.530> transmission<00:02:56.530> very

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
at senior pestis so transmission very

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.710 
at senior pestis so transmission very
important<00:02:57.640> transmission<00:02:58.180> here<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
important transmission here the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.259 
important transmission here the
important<00:02:59.140> point<00:02:59.350> over<00:02:59.590> here<00:02:59.650> is

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
important point over here is

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.790 
important point over here is
transmission<00:03:01.269> is<00:03:01.510> by<00:03:01.810> unpasteurized<00:03:02.620> milk

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
transmission is by unpasteurized milk

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:15.360 
transmission is by unpasteurized milk
and<00:03:03.370> poke<00:03:04.980> unpasteurized<00:03:05.980> okay<00:03:09.510> milk

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.300 

and<00:03:15.910> poke<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.620> kind<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:17.950> disease<00:03:18.250> is

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
and poke so this kind of disease is

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.520 
and poke so this kind of disease is
really<00:03:18.640> very<00:03:18.849> common<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.720> what<00:03:20.230> we<00:03:20.319> call<00:03:20.500> a

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
really very common in what we call a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.430 
really very common in what we call a
Michigan<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.720> some<00:03:22.720> other<00:03:22.840> states<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.290> you're

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
Michigan and some other states of you're

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.850 
Michigan and some other states of you're
saying

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
saying

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.610 
saying
so<00:03:24.459> for<00:03:26.010> let's<00:03:27.010> talk<00:03:27.190> about<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.519> pathogenesis

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
so for let's talk about the pathogenesis

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.410 
so for let's talk about the pathogenesis
screen<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:29.709> full<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.280> pathogenesis<00:03:30.790> over

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
screen is full the pathogenesis over

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.110 
screen is full the pathogenesis over
here<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.410> pathogenesis<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.580> produces<00:03:34.090> what

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
here the pathogenesis it produces what

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.420 
here the pathogenesis it produces what
it<00:03:34.390> was<00:03:34.510> an<00:03:34.629> antitoxin<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.890> Dido<00:03:36.370> talks<00:03:36.910> in

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.800 

endotoxin<00:03:45.510> okay<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:48.209> multiplies<00:03:49.209> really

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
endotoxin okay and multiplies really

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.809 
endotoxin okay and multiplies really
very<00:03:50.019> fast<00:03:50.319> in<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.590> cold<00:03:50.890> climate<00:03:51.099> okay

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
very fast in a cold climate okay

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.100 
very fast in a cold climate okay
remember

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
remember

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.220 
remember
okay<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.069> enterocolitis<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:55.480> nothing<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.019> it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
okay so enterocolitis is nothing but it

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.589 
okay so enterocolitis is nothing but it
caused<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.739> Cena<00:03:57.099> into<00:03:57.579> a<00:03:57.610> political<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:58.480> it

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
caused a Cena into a political so it

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.509 
caused a Cena into a political so it
causes<00:03:58.959> into<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.319> colitis<00:03:59.890> okay

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
causes into a colitis okay

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.509 
causes into a colitis okay
so<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.390> caused<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.629> febrile<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.319> area<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:03.370> is

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
so it caused a febrile the area this is

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.580 
so it caused a febrile the area this is
across<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.239> area

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.400 

okay<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.730> can<00:04:09.940> cause<00:04:10.150> sido<00:04:10.959> C<00:04:11.650> dosey<00:04:12.549> doe

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
okay and it can cause sido C dosey doe

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.440 
okay and it can cause sido C dosey doe
appendicitis

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.970 

okay

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.520 

right<00:04:24.580> so<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.450> also<00:04:25.720> can<00:04:26.050> cause<00:04:26.260> arthritis

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
right so it also can cause arthritis

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:34.800 
right so it also can cause arthritis
also<00:04:30.840> okay<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:32.530> how<00:04:33.430> do<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.670> treat<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.630> a

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
also okay so how do you treat that and a

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.690 
also okay so how do you treat that and a
sorry<00:04:35.020> how<00:04:35.260> do<00:04:35.320> you<00:04:35.470> diagnose<00:04:35.890> that<00:04:36.040> as<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.310> said

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
sorry how do you diagnose that as I said

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.670 
sorry how do you diagnose that as I said
you<00:04:36.850> before<00:04:37.270> that<00:04:37.510> student<00:04:38.200> culture<00:04:38.350> is<00:04:38.560> the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
you before that student culture is the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.670 
you before that student culture is the
best<00:04:38.920> method<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.490> because<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.900> has<00:04:41.140> what<00:04:41.650> I

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
best method and because it has what I

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.150 
best method and because it has what I
call<00:04:41.770> a<00:04:42.010> cold<00:04:42.790> enrichment<00:04:43.660> stool<00:04:44.560> culture<00:04:45.070> you

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
call a cold enrichment stool culture you

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.060 
call a cold enrichment stool culture you
can<00:04:45.340> do<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:47.220> culture<00:04:48.960> okay<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.200> what<00:04:50.980> do<00:04:51.040> you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
can do and culture okay and what do you

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.930 
can do and culture okay and what do you
call<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.370> grows<00:04:51.670> it<00:04:51.850> 25<00:04:52.390> degree<00:04:52.690> Celsius<00:04:53.050> and

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
call it grows it 25 degree Celsius and

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.020 
call it grows it 25 degree Celsius and
25<00:04:54.940> degrees<00:04:55.060> is<00:04:55.360> very<00:04:55.390> well<00:04:55.810> motile<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:57.030> you

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
25 degrees is very well motile and you

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.420 
25 degrees is very well motile and you
can<00:04:58.180> use<00:04:58.420> as<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:58.690> cold<00:04:58.990> enrichment<00:04:59.710> because<00:05:00.310> the

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
can use as a cold enrichment because the

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.190 
can use as a cold enrichment because the
growth<00:05:00.610> is<00:05:00.790> really<00:05:00.820> good<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.930> cold

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
growth is really good and the cold

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.870 
growth is really good and the cold
temperature<00:05:02.680> cold<00:05:02.920> enrichment

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
temperature cold enrichment

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.360 
temperature cold enrichment
okay<00:05:04.270> guys<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:05.440> these<00:05:05.740> are<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:05.980> important

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
okay guys so these are the important

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.450
