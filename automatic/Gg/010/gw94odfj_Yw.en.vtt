00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.550 
something like that super good deal I
mean<00:02:07.360> sometimes<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.869> kept<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.110> little<00:02:08.350> glitchy

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
mean sometimes it kept a little glitchy

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.120 
mean sometimes it kept a little glitchy
and<00:02:09.240> starts<00:02:10.240> acting<00:02:10.720> up<00:02:10.840> but<00:02:11.320> for<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.980> most

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
and starts acting up but for the most

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.660 
and starts acting up but for the most
part<00:02:12.400> it's<00:02:12.580> pretty<00:02:12.790> solid<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.320> go<00:02:14.670> from

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
part it's pretty solid so you go from

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.140 
part it's pretty solid so you go from
the<00:02:16.240> guitar<00:02:16.750> into<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.730> processor<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.970> then

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
the guitar into the processor and then

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.780 
the guitar into the processor and then
you<00:02:19.300> go<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.110> right<00:02:20.410> out<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:21.459> come<00:02:21.640> all

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
you go to the right out it's come all

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.660 
you go to the right out it's come all
the<00:02:21.970> way<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.360> lovely<00:02:22.690> little<00:02:23.050> amp<00:02:23.670> called

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
know other guitars but on YouTube I

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.960 
know other guitars but on YouTube I

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970
