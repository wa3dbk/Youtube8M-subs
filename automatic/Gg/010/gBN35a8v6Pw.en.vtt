00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello raga here we are again talking about 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.620
 consul 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.540
 today we look at evolution 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.999
 of the spring portable console of 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.940
 planetary success ie the gameboy 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:21.770
 so I'll talk about the gameboy advance 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.770
 but first initials 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.980
 the man said 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:54.399
 lotito 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:56.230
 often the gameboy advance actually 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.909
 arrives in chronological order after 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.739
 game boy color and for the first time 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.540
 nintendo manages to beat the sublime 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.239
 technical qualities of the paris linz 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.399
 producing a 32 handheld console 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.070
 bit much closer to super nintendo 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.290
 that the old gameboy the console even 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.030
 having also adopted a different form 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.009
 of their cartridges remains 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.899
 perfectly backwards compatible with 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.570
 logos of the old game boy thanks to the 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.130
 presence of a z80 processor that it 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.830
 guarantees perfect emulation 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.630
 hardware the gameboy advance while being 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.509
 holding a powerful processor from 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.660
 16.8 myers is unable to reproduce 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.369
 3d polygonal graphic even if mediated 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.990
 special software and the chip was 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.420
 possible to recreate 3d environments 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.649
 our laptop is very simple 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.899
 nintendo is part of the same 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.940
 videogame generation was presented 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.490
 printing in 2000 is put on sale in 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.729
 the whole world in 2001 apart from China 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.979
 and saw it in 2004 the console presents 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.290
 a color LCD screen but without 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.180
 backlight in fact come 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.189
 put on the market bari approaches to 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.890
 actually illuminate the screen 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.619
 too dark game boy advance was taken away 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.450
 of production and 12 February 2008 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.079
 and the last game released in Europe was 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.500
 the legend of fire the eternal light la 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:14.079
 console sold 76 million units e 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.140
 most popular game and pokÃ©mon rubinho is 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.239

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.000
 the console to a restyling called game 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.160
 boy advance sb introducing a screen 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.140
 lcd backlit batteries 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.060
 rechargeable and forming incredible in 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.340
 style with the new portable consoles of 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.600
 nintendo but now let's see how it is 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.600
 present the two consoles 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:39.280
 the boy advance was put on the market in 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.859
 multiple colors are in possession 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.379
 of the transparent one on the left 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.680
 we find the cross directional keys 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:51.340
 start and select and the keys a and b communicate 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.889
 loudspeaker under the two taxes a and b the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.099
 on off button the volume rocker e 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.659
 the headphone jack the entrance for the 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.750
 link that apple just like that of 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.480
 game boy to join two consoles together i 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.180
 dorsal keys lr 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.370
 the compartment for two stylus batteries and the 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.010
 compartment for cartridges as I said before 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.590
 the fully backward compatible console 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.540
 with all the games for children 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:23.169
 in fact, just insert one and turn on the 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:25.629
 console and we can unfortunately play a 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.430
 due to lack of backlight 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.169
 of the console lcd screen 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.879
 we will spend our time more than a 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.280
 play to find the right angle 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.819
 of light to see what we are 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.010
 doing 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.159
 and indeed in the next game model 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.870
 boy sp we find various improvements starting 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.599
 from a totally renewed form a 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.120
 snail like the modern nintendo ds 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.579
 nintendo 3ds the on off button the opposite 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.859
 on the left behind we find the 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.689
 dorsal ler keys 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.769
 the connector for the charger 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.150
 inside the connector for the cable link 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.669
 on the right side the balance wheel of the 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.519
 pendulum volume we find the cross 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:05.859
 directional keys a and b starter surf 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.959
 classics is a cast in opposite top 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.140
 what you need to turn on or off the 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.450
 console backlight 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.300
 what else to say about game boy advance a 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.109
 console well made powerful but with 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.920
 that flaw of the lcd screen without 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.350
 backlight also in the model 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.390
 next in the sp where it comes from 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.640
 introduced the lighting network la 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.860
 visual game is not the best 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.570
 unfortunately to really appreciate i 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.580
 so many beautiful games that have come out 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.870
 for this portable console 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.180
 my advice is to use a 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.580
 emulator on PC because you can 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.280
 see fully the graphic rendering of those 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.870
 video games yes i know you shouldn't 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.500
 say possible we should say buy me 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.320
 the console actually played though 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.720
 you can hardly see anything 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.550
 I invite you to pamper yourself and sign up 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.350
 always share this video if there is 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.140

 linking description and getting them covered 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.830
 all other networks reviews if there is 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.800

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.800
