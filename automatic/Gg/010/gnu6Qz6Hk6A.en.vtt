00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:01:09.950 

parentheses<00:00:47.700> because<00:01:08.390> sometimes<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.840> a

parentheses because sometimes it's a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.010 
parentheses because sometimes it's a
really<00:01:10.260> severe<00:01:10.799> blow<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
really severe blow to that or you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.410 
really severe blow to that or you
actually<00:01:13.229> feel<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.950> your<00:01:14.130> eyes<00:01:17.420> that's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
actually feel it in your eyes that's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.039 
actually feel it in your eyes that's
where<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.259> paralysis<00:01:19.830> comes<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
where this paralysis comes in it's a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.740 
where this paralysis comes in it's a
simple<00:01:22.470> movement<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.310> arms<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
simple movement your arms just one of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
simple movement your arms just one of
your<00:01:24.900> advantages<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> nerve

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
your advantages but you get that nerve

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840 
your advantages but you get that nerve
which<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> key<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.369> sensitive

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
which is the key to the sensitive

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
which is the key to the sensitive
sensing<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.110> sense<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> touch<00:01:31.680> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
sensing of all your sense of touch and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.660 
sensing of all your sense of touch and
position<00:01:33.150> ok<00:01:33.570> body<00:01:33.840> space<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> hit<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
position ok body space and you hit that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.780 
position ok body space and you hit that
nerve<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> split<00:01:36.900> second<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.790> can't

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
nerve and for a split second you can't

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.050 
nerve and for a split second you can't
move<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.350> all<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:41.899> yeah<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.759> paint

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
move it all it is yeah and and the paint

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.920 
move it all it is yeah and and the paint
you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.600> anything<00:01:45.720> about<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> paint<00:01:46.290> just

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
you can do anything about the paint just

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.660 
you can do anything about the paint just
that's<00:01:48.930> another<00:01:49.619> thing<00:01:49.920> that's<00:01:50.130> controlled

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that's another thing that's controlled

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.280 
that's another thing that's controlled
in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> frontal<00:01:51.479> lobes<00:01:51.979> okay<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:55.259> reason

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
in the frontal lobes okay now the reason

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.709 
in the frontal lobes okay now the reason
I<00:01:55.649> put<00:01:55.680> discounts<00:01:58.159> we're<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.969> year<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.479> have

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
I put discounts we're this year we have

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.490 
I put discounts we're this year we have
a<00:02:01.049> member<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> class<00:02:01.860> who<00:02:02.850> has<00:02:03.210> had<00:02:03.500> more

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
a member of the class who has had more

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.539 
a member of the class who has had more
than<00:02:04.560> one

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
than one

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.999 
than one
of<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.939> type<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> injury<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.990> year<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
of this type of injury this year in the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.639 
of this type of injury this year in the
way<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.220> concussion<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.019> has<00:02:10.170> affected

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
way of concussion and it has affected

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.930 
way of concussion and it has affected
what<00:02:10.830> several<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.370> areas<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.000> yes<00:02:12.239> is

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
what several of these areas of yes is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.309 
what several of these areas of yes is
sequencing<00:02:15.980> okay<00:02:17.840> not<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.110> counting

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
sequencing okay not just counting

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.940 
sequencing okay not just counting
numbers<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:19.980> order<00:02:21.049> sequencing<00:02:22.049> for<00:02:22.500> example

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
numbers in order sequencing for example

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.559 
numbers in order sequencing for example
you<00:02:23.069> get<00:02:23.280> up<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.610> morning<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.360> get

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
you get up in the morning and you get

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.709 
you get up in the morning and you get
dressed<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> certain<00:02:25.590> order
