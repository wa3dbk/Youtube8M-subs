for a reference sake I am NC 42 and 43
in<00:01:00.140> Mac<00:01:01.140> foundations<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.570> lets<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
in Mac foundations so that just lets you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.370 
in Mac foundations so that just lets you
know<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.610> consistency<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.510> pretty<00:01:06.810> thick

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
know so the consistency is pretty thick

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.149 
know so the consistency is pretty thick
out<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:09.060> normal<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.750> would<00:01:10.409> say<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.950> in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
out or just normal I would say it's in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.969 
out or just normal I would say it's in
between<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.990> feel<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.619> gives

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
between so and I just feel like it gives

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.120 
between so and I just feel like it gives
a<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.820> great<00:01:15.710> coverage<00:01:17.659> now<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:19.020> terms<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
a really great coverage now in terms of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
a really great coverage now in terms of
coverage<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.909> believe<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.470> sheer<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
coverage I believe that this is sheer to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.870 
coverage I believe that this is sheer to
medium<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.799> reason<00:01:26.640> why<00:01:26.790> I'm

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
medium and what I the reason why I'm

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.170 
medium and what I the reason why I'm
saying<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.689> depending<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:29.180> tool

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
saying that is depending on what tool

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.069 
saying that is depending on what tool
you<00:01:30.420> use<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.650> could<00:01:31.829> tell<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.970> demo<00:01:33.659> on

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you use as you could tell in the demo on

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.850 
you use as you could tell in the demo on
one<00:01:34.920> side<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.460> use<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.450> Beauty<00:01:36.930> by<00:01:37.560> Beauty

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
one side I use the Beauty by Beauty

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.499 
one side I use the Beauty by Beauty
Blender<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> other<00:01:38.790> side<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.299> my

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
Blender and on the other side I use my

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.010 
Blender and on the other side I use my
Real<00:01:39.750> Techniques<00:01:40.250> buffing<00:01:41.250> brush<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:42.750> I

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
Real Techniques buffing brush now I

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.710 
Real Techniques buffing brush now I
preferred<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.369> buffing<00:01:44.729> brush<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
preferred the buffing brush because it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.560 
preferred the buffing brush because it
just<00:01:45.990> gave<00:01:46.229> more<00:01:47.100> medium<00:01:47.520> coverage<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.360> saw

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
just gave more medium coverage you saw

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.060 
just gave more medium coverage you saw
that<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> Beauty<00:01:49.110> Blender<00:01:49.259> which<00:01:49.680> most<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that the Beauty Blender which most of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.010 
that the Beauty Blender which most of
the<00:01:50.130> time<00:01:50.430> gives<00:01:50.790> us<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.180> coverage<00:01:51.540> but

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the time gives us your coverage but

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.200 
the time gives us your coverage but
there<00:01:52.229> are<00:01:52.380> times<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.759> pretty

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
there are times when I can get pretty

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.749 
there are times when I can get pretty
good<00:01:54.450> coverage<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.140> Beauty<00:01:55.380> ball

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
good coverage with the Beauty ball

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.359 
good coverage with the Beauty ball
abuser<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:58.560> coverage<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
abuser I can get good coverage with the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.429 
abuser I can get good coverage with the
Beauty<00:01:59.610> Blender<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.229> particular

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
Beauty Blender but in this particular

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.249 
Beauty Blender but in this particular
case<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.640> liked<00:02:02.939> how<00:02:03.329> my<00:02:03.750> buffing<00:02:04.110> brush

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
case I really liked how my buffing brush

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
case I really liked how my buffing brush
gave<00:02:05.100> me<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.610> nice<00:02:06.110> finish<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.910> course<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
gave me a nice finish of course I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.150 
gave me a nice finish of course I
believe<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.959> buildable<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
believe that this is buildable as you

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.620 
believe that this is buildable as you
could<00:02:11.340> tell<00:02:11.550> because

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
could tell because

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.080 
could tell because
I took<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.080> from<00:02:13.230> Shearer<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:14.090> medium

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I took it from Shearer to medium

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.140 
I took it from Shearer to medium
coverage<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:16.320> terms<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.550> texture

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
coverage in terms of texture

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.740 
coverage in terms of texture
I<00:02:18.410> feel<00:02:19.410> like<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.950> does<00:02:20.160> not<00:02:20.430> matte<00:02:20.910> but

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
I feel like this does not matte but

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.920 
I feel like this does not matte but
because<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> primer<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.970> course<00:02:24.300> this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
because this is a primer of course this

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.970 
because this is a primer of course this
is<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.830> make<00:02:26.070> your<00:02:27.380> this<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
is going to make your this is going to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.000 
is going to make your this is going to
make<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.580> product<00:02:29.820> last<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.870> claims<00:02:31.590> that
