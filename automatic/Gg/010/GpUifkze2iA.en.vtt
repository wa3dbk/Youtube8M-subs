feel is just laser on but not headlights

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.520 
feel is just laser on but not headlights
and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.329> second<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.929> turns<00:01:16.319> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530

headlights on which you can see here

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.809 
headlights on which you can see here
with<00:01:18.719> the<00:01:18.840> LEDs<00:01:19.380> now<00:01:19.890> depending<00:01:20.249> which<00:01:20.340> car<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
with the LEDs now depending which car it

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.459 
with the LEDs now depending which car it
is<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.270> LEDs<00:01:21.719> light<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.289> little

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
is the LEDs light up a little

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.580 
is the LEDs light up a little
differently<00:01:22.649> most<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.399> them<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.729> blue<00:01:24.590> also

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
differently most of them are blue also

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.279 
differently most of them are blue also
here's<00:01:26.039> your<00:01:26.369> reset<00:01:26.880> button<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:28.170> whatever

here's your reset button if for whatever

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.859 
here's your reset button if for whatever
reason<00:01:28.859> when<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.069> plug<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.520> dongle<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.299> which

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
reason when you plug the dongle in which

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.629 
reason when you plug the dongle in which
I<00:01:31.109> have<00:01:31.289> over<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:33.210> very<00:01:33.539> USB<00:01:34.170> dongle<00:01:34.639> when

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
I have over here in very USB dongle when

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.340 
I have over here in very USB dongle when
you<00:01:35.729> plug<00:01:35.999> that<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.569> for<00:01:36.600> any<00:01:36.840> reason<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you plug that in if for any reason the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
you plug that in if for any reason the
mouse<00:01:37.530> doesn't<00:01:37.859> automatically<00:01:38.490> detect<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
mouse doesn't automatically detect it

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.699 
mouse doesn't automatically detect it
you<00:01:39.479> would<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.659> install<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> drivers

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
you would just install the drivers

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.319 
you would just install the drivers
software<00:01:41.219> well<00:01:41.490> actually<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.969> will<00:01:42.060> probably

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
software well actually it will probably

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.270 
software well actually it will probably
automatically<00:01:43.049> download<00:01:43.469> off<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:43.920> dongle

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
automatically download off of the dongle

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.789 
automatically download off of the dongle
and<00:01:44.459> then<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.569> push<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> reset<00:01:46.770> button

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and then just push in the reset button

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.849 
and then just push in the reset button
and<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.999> should<00:01:48.030> pick<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:49.530> all

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
and it should pick it up from there all

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.580 
and it should pick it up from there all
right<00:01:50.159> now<00:01:50.429> each<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.659> features<00:01:51.959> right<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
right now each one features right and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.889 
right now each one features right and
left<00:01:52.770> mouse<00:01:53.039> clicks<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.939> hood<00:01:54.179> here<00:01:54.659> in

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
left mouse clicks and the hood here in

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.889 
left mouse clicks and the hood here in
here<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.409> also<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.729> scrolling<00:01:57.420> wheel<00:01:57.600> which

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
here and also a scrolling wheel which

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.289 
here and also a scrolling wheel which
also<00:01:58.170> acts<00:01:58.529> as<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.950> third<00:01:59.659> button<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:03.179> are

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
also acts as a third button so there are

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.849 
also acts as a third button so there are
several<00:02:03.569> different<00:02:03.719> makes<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.319> models<00:02:04.649> to
