that<00:01:07.240> I<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:09.820> not<00:01:10.000> expecting<00:01:10.240> much<00:01:10.750> from<00:01:10.810> this

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
that I was not expecting much from this

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.010 
that I was not expecting much from this
figure<00:01:11.440> I<00:01:11.830> was<00:01:12.399> pretty<00:01:12.700> much<00:01:12.789> expecting<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.930> to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
figure I was pretty much expecting it to

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.550 
figure I was pretty much expecting it to
be<00:01:15.000> repainted<00:01:16.000> Master<00:01:16.840> Chief<00:01:17.080> with<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.350> new

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
be repainted Master Chief with a new

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.719 
be repainted Master Chief with a new
helmet<00:01:18.930> while<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.350> am<00:01:20.530> right<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.160> an<00:01:21.310> extent

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
helmet while I am right to an extent

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.650 
helmet while I am right to an extent
that<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.270> actually<00:01:23.070> false<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:25.270> makes<00:01:25.450> any

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
that is actually false that makes any

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.840 
that is actually false that makes any
sense

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
sense

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.669 
sense
just<00:01:27.850> like<00:01:27.970> Master<00:01:28.300> Chief<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.630> mask<00:01:28.869> is<00:01:29.140> very

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
just like Master Chief the mask is very

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.550 
just like Master Chief the mask is very
detailed<00:01:31.050> obviously<00:01:32.050> there's<00:01:32.200> gonna<00:01:32.259> be<00:01:32.410> some

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
detailed obviously there's gonna be some

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560 
detailed obviously there's gonna be some
paint<00:01:32.770> issues<00:01:32.890> cuz<00:01:33.580> it's<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:33.970> smaller<00:01:34.270> scale

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
paint issues cuz it's a smaller scale

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.810 
paint issues cuz it's a smaller scale
figure<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:35.200> kind<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.440> harder<00:01:36.429> to<00:01:36.550> paint

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
figure and it's kind of harder to paint

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.339 
figure and it's kind of harder to paint
but<00:01:37.210> they<00:01:38.200> did<00:01:38.410> a<00:01:38.440> very<00:01:38.830> nice<00:01:39.100> job<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:41.170> what

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:41.349 
but they did a very nice job now what

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.460 
but they did a very nice job now what
really<00:01:41.530> surprised<00:01:42.190> me<00:01:42.340> was<00:01:42.789> that<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:44.170> figure

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
really surprised me was that this figure

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.630 
really surprised me was that this figure
actually<00:01:44.649> does<00:01:44.979> have<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.220> new<00:01:45.369> chest<00:01:45.670> piece<00:01:45.849> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
actually does have a new chest piece and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.139 
actually does have a new chest piece and
that<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.789> because<00:01:49.330> um<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:51.759> what<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.000> arm

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
that is because um this is what the arm

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.359 
that is because um this is what the arm
it<00:01:52.270> looks<00:01:52.300> like<00:01:52.509> in<00:01:52.599> the<00:01:52.690> game<00:01:52.899> this<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:54.039> I

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
it looks like in the game this is I

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.559 
it looks like in the game this is I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
same because pretty much all the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.870 
same because pretty much all the
Spartans<00:02:12.000> share<00:02:13.000> kind<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.450> same<00:02:13.660> llama
