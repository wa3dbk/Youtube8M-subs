going to go from one switch to the other
in<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.659> case<00:01:57.930> we've<00:01:58.290> gone<00:01:58.439> very<00:01:59.070> warm<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.579> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
in this case we've gone very warm as you

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.139 

morning<00:02:04.829> evening<00:02:05.189> looks<00:02:05.549> more<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.850> evening

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
morning evening looks more like evening

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.969 
morning evening looks more like evening
so<00:02:06.299> again<00:02:06.509> nothing<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.049> white<00:02:07.350> no<00:02:07.680> one's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
so again nothing really white no one's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.820 
so again nothing really white no one's
at<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:09.360> Sun<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.869> probably<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.319> number<00:02:10.560> two

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
at all the Sun is probably a number two

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.120 
at all the Sun is probably a number two
over<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:13.050> darkest<00:02:13.440> darks<00:02:13.739> on<00:02:13.860> some<00:02:14.040> of

over here the darkest darks on some of

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.740 
over here the darkest darks on some of
the<00:02:14.190> trees<00:02:14.459> are<00:02:14.790> probably<00:02:15.060> way<00:02:15.269> up<00:02:15.420> into<00:02:15.599> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the trees are probably way up into the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.020 
the trees are probably way up into the
seventh<00:02:16.200> or<00:02:16.319> eighth<00:02:16.519> but<00:02:17.519> look<00:02:17.819> at<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
seventh or eighth but look at the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.059 
seventh or eighth but look at the
difference<00:02:18.390> with<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.810> temperature<00:02:19.319> cool

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
difference with the temperature cool

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.160 
difference with the temperature cool
colors<00:02:20.489> recede<00:02:20.940> warm<00:02:21.239> colors<00:02:21.569> come<00:02:21.750> forward

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
colors recede warm colors come forward

so<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.950> painting<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.459> vibrant<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.330> kind

playing<00:02:54.030> into<00:02:54.269> my<00:02:54.420> paintings<00:02:54.840> there's<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
playing into my paintings there's a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.170 
playing into my paintings there's a
little<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.980> light<00:02:56.190> back<00:02:56.459> behind<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.910> fence

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
little of light back behind the fence

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.690 
little of light back behind the fence
which<00:02:57.450> makes<00:02:57.810> sure<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.019> wonder<00:02:58.590> what<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.370> back

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
which makes sure I wonder what is back

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.400 
which makes sure I wonder what is back
there<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.209> I'd<00:03:00.750> love<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.080> look<00:03:01.230> at<00:03:01.350> my

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
there and I'd love to look at my

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.720 
there and I'd love to look at my
paintings<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:01.859> look<00:03:02.010> at<00:03:02.160> look<00:03:02.340> at<00:03:02.370> other

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
paintings I look at look at other

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.520 
paintings I look at look at other
people's<00:03:03.150> painting<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.930> can<00:03:04.140> go<00:03:04.290> on<00:03:04.410> that

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
people's painting that I can go on that

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.830 
people's painting that I can go on that
little<00:03:04.769> journey<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.489> think<00:03:06.060> probably<00:03:06.570> one<00:03:06.810> of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
little journey I think probably one of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.120 
little journey I think probably one of
the<00:03:06.930> best<00:03:07.019> thing<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.410> all<00:03:07.530> strive<00:03:07.799> for<00:03:08.070> in

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the best thing that we all strive for in

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.650 
the best thing that we all strive for in
the<00:03:08.220> painting<00:03:08.549> it's<00:03:08.940> not<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.299> just<00:03:09.329> someone

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
the painting it's not that just someone

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.300 
the painting it's not that just someone
likes<00:03:09.840> your<00:03:09.959> painting<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.890> when<00:03:11.010> they<00:03:11.130> tell

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310

you I can see more into your paintings
every<00:03:13.440> time<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.650> look<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.489> be<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.760> walk<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.239> and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.270 
every time I look to be the walk in and
out<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> good<00:03:16.170> book<00:03:16.410> or<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.620> good<00:03:16.799> movie<00:03:17.130> you

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.400 
out like a good book or a good movie you
never<00:03:17.489> get<00:03:17.640> tired<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.000> seeing<00:03:18.930> or<00:03:19.109> reading

are<00:05:00.620> hard<00:05:00.979> to<00:05:01.130> pull<00:05:01.280> off<00:05:01.400> too

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
are hard to pull off too

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.909 
are hard to pull off too
but<00:05:02.390> if<00:05:02.510> we<00:05:02.600> go<00:05:02.720> back<00:05:02.870> to<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.140> not<00:05:03.380> seen<00:05:03.680> color

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
but if we go back to this not seen color

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.469 
but if we go back to this not seen color
and<00:05:04.220> if<00:05:04.729> you've<00:05:04.880> seen<00:05:04.940> my<00:05:05.210> other<00:05:05.270> episodes

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
and if you've seen my other episodes

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.080 
and if you've seen my other episodes
they're<00:05:05.990> heard<00:05:06.169> me<00:05:06.289> speaking<00:05:07.039> other<00:05:07.280> tapes

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
they're heard me speaking other tapes

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.480 
they're heard me speaking other tapes
I'm<00:05:08.539> 50<00:05:08.990> percent<00:05:09.320> colorblind<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:09.979> I'm<00:05:10.130> sure

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
I'm 50 percent colorblind so I'm sure

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.330 
I'm 50 percent colorblind so I'm sure
not<00:05:10.820> seeing<00:05:11.180> what<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:11.510> guys<00:05:11.539> see<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.350> color

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
not seeing what you guys see in color

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.850 
not seeing what you guys see in color
but<00:05:14.210> what<00:05:14.630> I<00:05:14.660> said<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.110> my<00:05:15.229> class<00:05:15.440> fact<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:15.830> just

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
but what I said to my class fact I just

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.710 
but what I said to my class fact I just
had<00:05:16.130> classes<00:05:16.580> evening<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.120> told<00:05:17.330> my<00:05:17.479> class

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
had classes evening and I told my class

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.520 
had classes evening and I told my class
my<00:05:18.620> 50%<00:05:19.010> colorblindness<00:05:19.850> is<00:05:20.060> 100%<00:05:20.690> correct<00:05:21.050> to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
my 50% colorblindness is 100% correct to

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.560 
my 50% colorblindness is 100% correct to
me<00:05:21.680> what<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.340> see<00:05:22.669> it<00:05:22.760> what<00:05:22.940> I<00:05:22.970> think<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.360> see

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
me what I see it what I think I see

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.540 
me what I see it what I think I see
where<00:05:23.810> most<00:05:24.410> of<00:05:24.560> you<00:05:24.680> see<00:05:24.830> color<00:05:25.070> better<00:05:25.280> than

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
where most of you see color better than

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.520 
where most of you see color better than
my<00:05:25.669> back<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.570> same<00:05:26.780> color<00:05:27.020> is<00:05:27.140> not<00:05:27.320> real

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
my back to the same color is not real

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.070 
my back to the same color is not real
it's<00:05:27.950> an<00:05:28.100> optical<00:05:28.400> ocean<00:05:28.850> as<00:05:29.000> lights<00:05:29.870> and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
it's an optical ocean as lights and

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.870 
it's an optical ocean as lights and
darks<00:05:30.289> aren't<00:05:30.530> real<00:05:30.710> because<00:05:31.190> at<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.580> dark

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
darks aren't real because at a dark

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.820 
darks aren't real because at a dark
night<00:05:32.090> pitch<00:05:32.360> night<00:05:32.630> where<00:05:33.350> nothing<00:05:33.710> ever

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
night pitch night where nothing ever

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.560 
night pitch night where nothing ever
illuminates<00:05:34.340> that<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:34.910> never<00:05:35.270> dilate<00:05:35.690> too

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
illuminates that I never dilate too

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.870 
illuminates that I never dilate too
so<00:05:37.230> as<00:05:37.320> we<00:05:37.440> can<00:05:37.530> see<00:05:37.590> if<00:05:37.830> you<00:05:37.920> can<00:05:38.040> again<00:05:38.550> look

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
so as we can see if you can again look

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.200 
so as we can see if you can again look
at<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.090> different<00:05:39.530> movement<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.940> always<00:05:41.940> all

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
at the different movement and always all

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.090 
at the different movement and always all
paintings<00:05:42.660> are<00:05:42.810> under<00:05:43.020> here<00:05:43.170> somewhere<00:05:43.410> from

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
paintings are under here somewhere from

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.920 
paintings are under here somewhere from
the<00:05:44.250> darkest<00:05:44.640> dark<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.970> Nocturne<00:05:45.420> to<00:05:45.810> the

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
the darkest dark to Nocturne to the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.990 
the darkest dark to Nocturne to the
lightest<00:05:46.260> light<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.740> this<00:05:47.310> is<00:05:47.370> probably<00:05:47.730> one

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
lightest light and this is probably one

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.310 
lightest light and this is probably one
of<00:05:48.030> those<00:05:48.240> if<00:05:48.450> we<00:05:48.600> had<00:05:48.750> taken<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.170> lower

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
of those if we had taken the lower

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.860 
of those if we had taken the lower
quadrant<00:05:49.920> area<00:05:50.430> out<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:51.090> maybe<00:05:51.300> did<00:05:51.540> this<00:05:51.690> is

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
quadrant area out and maybe did this is

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.830 
quadrant area out and maybe did this is
just<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.200> skyscape<00:05:52.860> Wow<00:05:53.610> how<00:05:53.940> differently<00:05:54.480> the

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
just a skyscape Wow how differently the

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.050 
just a skyscape Wow how differently the
darkest<00:05:55.200> darks<00:05:55.530> would<00:05:55.680> be<00:05:55.830> way<00:05:56.550> over<00:05:56.700> here<00:05:56.970> in

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
darkest darks would be way over here in

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.720 
darkest darks would be way over here in
a<00:05:57.150> two<00:05:57.330> three<00:05:57.570> four<00:05:57.840> and<00:05:58.740> we<00:05:59.190> may<00:05:59.310> do<00:05:59.370> one<00:05:59.640> that

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
a two three four and we may do one that

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.920 
a two three four and we may do one that
I've<00:05:59.880> done<00:06:00.000> those<00:06:00.180> in<00:06:00.300> some<00:06:00.450> of<00:06:00.570> my<00:06:00.660> classes

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
I've done those in some of my classes

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.270 
I've done those in some of my classes
and<00:06:01.140> I<00:06:01.230> tell<00:06:01.440> them<00:06:01.500> when<00:06:01.650> we<00:06:01.740> do<00:06:01.860> this<00:06:02.040> the

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
and I tell them when we do this the

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.650 
and I tell them when we do this the
hardest<00:06:02.550> one<00:06:03.030> of<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.150> hardest<00:06:03.390> pains<00:06:03.570> you

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
hardest one of the hardest pains you

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.360 
hardest one of the hardest pains you
will<00:06:03.780> ever<00:06:03.870> do<00:06:04.110> is<00:06:04.410> like<00:06:04.950> three<00:06:05.250> or<00:06:05.340> four

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
will ever do is like three or four

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.400 
will ever do is like three or four
values<00:06:05.750> because<00:06:06.750> it's<00:06:06.900> hard<00:06:07.050> to<00:06:07.140> do<00:06:07.260> that

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
values because it's hard to do that

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.450 
values because it's hard to do that
especially<00:06:07.620> when<00:06:07.920> you're<00:06:08.070> trying<00:06:08.220> to<00:06:08.310> play

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
especially when you're trying to play

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.920 
especially when you're trying to play
all<00:06:08.670> these<00:06:08.850> little<00:06:09.090> soda<00:06:09.450> leads<00:06:09.720> through

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
all these little soda leads through

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.470 
all these little soda leads through
there<00:06:10.490> so<00:06:11.490> again<00:06:11.700> study<00:06:11.940> some<00:06:12.120> of<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.270> tape

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
there so again study some of the tape

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.690 
there so again study some of the tape
study<00:06:12.750> your<00:06:13.440> own<00:06:13.470> paintings<00:06:13.950> look<00:06:14.100> look<00:06:14.550> at

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
study your own paintings look look at

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.940 
study your own paintings look look at
constantly<00:06:15.390> look<00:06:15.930> at<00:06:16.050> other<00:06:16.170> people's<00:06:16.530> pieces

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
constantly look at other people's pieces

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.520 
constantly look at other people's pieces
I<00:06:17.330> try<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.390> look<00:06:18.570> at<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:18.750> values<00:06:19.080> inside<00:06:19.260> of

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
I try to look at the values inside of

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.070 
I try to look at the values inside of
the<00:06:19.650> colors<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.480> so<00:06:21.480> we're<00:06:21.750> gonna<00:06:21.840> start

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
the colors and so we're gonna start

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.420 
the colors and so we're gonna start
getting<00:06:22.260> some<00:06:22.290> episodes<00:06:22.860> with<00:06:23.040> color<00:06:23.340> and

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
getting some episodes with color and

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.620 
getting some episodes with color and
we'll<00:06:23.610> start<00:06:23.820> talking<00:06:24.000> about<00:06:24.210> the<00:06:24.300> color<00:06:24.480> and

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
we'll start talking about the color and

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.600 
we'll start talking about the color and
values<00:06:25.020> or<00:06:25.290> temperature<00:06:25.770> but<00:06:26.160> we'll<00:06:26.310> always

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
values or temperature but we'll always

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.550 
values or temperature but we'll always
go<00:06:26.850> back<00:06:27.000> into<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.420> values<00:06:27.810> inside<00:06:28.230> of<00:06:28.410> the

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
go back into the values inside of the

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.770 
go back into the values inside of the
colors<00:06:28.890> and<00:06:29.130> temperatures<00:06:29.550> through<00:06:29.760> there<00:06:29.910> so

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
colors and temperatures through there so

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.080 
colors and temperatures through there so
again<00:06:30.930> hope<00:06:31.050> it<00:06:31.170> helps<00:06:31.470> and<00:06:31.620> again<00:06:32.400> send<00:06:32.970> your

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
again hope it helps and again send your

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.300 
again hope it helps and again send your
