00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.360
 Sony has 2 new smartware devisors at the IFA ... 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.759
 introduced. That's the Smartwatch 3 ... 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.749
 and the Smartband Talk. 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.519
 The Smartwatch 3 is the successor ... 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.900
 of the 2 and runs on Android. 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.550
 And the Smartband Talk is actually ... 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.529
 a successor to the regular Smartband, 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.529
 which you cannot talk to and where there is no screen. 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.550
 What stands out with the Smartband Talk ... 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 is that it has an E-ink screen. 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.940
 So it's in black and white. 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.450
 E-ink is the technology that is also used for the screens in e-readers. 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.760
 With direct sunlight you can always read it ... 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.600
 and he should last a little longer although Sony claims ... 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.500
 that this Smartband Talk ... 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.040
 something of 3 days. So that is not really that long. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.620
 What can you do with this smart band? 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.800
 You can receive notifications on it. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.210
 You can listen to music with it. 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.870
 You can also add favorites that you can call. 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.560
 But that does not mean that all your contacts from your phone are also on this band. 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.280
 This smart band also registers whether you walk, run or sleep. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.720
 Sony is building its smartware, 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.920
 the smartband and the smartwatch ... 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.060
 around the Lifelog. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.890
 That actually records everything you do. 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.880
 Here you see, for example, all kinds of things I did at that time. 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.270
 If I click on it, 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.130
 then you see that I have played games and what time and for how long. 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.020
 A while ago I tried the normal smartband from Sony ... 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.170
 together with the Lifelog app. 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.689
 I have to say that I really enjoyed watching when I did something ... 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.350
 and what happened. But at the same time... 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.790
 I didn't know very well what I could do with it. 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.070
 And that also did not always work accurately. 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.710
 for example, because I got into the car and then he counted my steps. 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.750
 The Smartband Talk only goes .... 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.250
 work with mobile devices that have Android 4.4 as operating system. 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.580
 You can get it in black with white from this fall. 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.450
 The price is € 169 ... 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.080
 and you can buy separate colors in terms of straps and I believe ... 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.859
 that there are about 4 of them. 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.689
 I now have the Smartwatch 3 here. 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.739
 Like I said, that's the successor of the 2. 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.489
 Sony has kept the same design ... 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.039
 with a square screen. 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.900
 What is striking is that the quality of the screen ... 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.119
 is a lot better than its predecessor. 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.900
 You can also synchronize the Smartwatch 3 with Lifelog. 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.060
 What I just told you about the Smartband Talk. 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.949
 You control this Smartwatch 3 by swiping ... 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.119
 and you can talk to it. 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.539
 Smartwatch 3 is more advanced than the band I just mentioned. 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:47.859
 You can do more with it. 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.669
 That is how it says on this Android Wear. 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.450
 Google Now is the smart help of Android Wear ... 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.019
 Android ensures that you ... 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.159
 give commands to your watch. 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.800
 So for example 'start app run keeper'. 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.449
 And you can, for example, when a message arrives ... 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:07.589
 to make sure that... 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.289
 that message is answered. 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.289
 That will be done via your telephone. 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.239
 The Smartwatch 3 can also be used without a telephone. 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.519
 You can use it for 2 things. 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.249
 It has GPS. So when you go outside, you walk the circle ... 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:22.509
 and you will come back ... 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:24.419
 and you didn't bring your phone ... 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.929
 then he synchronizes that with Lifelog and so you can see the number of steps. 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:32.100
 And you can download music on it so you just 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:37.389
 can take this watch with you, listen to music and leave your phone at home. 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.629
 According to Sony, the battery lasts about 2 days. 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.699
 I think that if you use it intensively ... 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:48.129
 you make him have to hang on the charger every day. 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.189
 Advantage of this Smartwatch 3 is ... 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.410
 that you do not need a special holder where you then .... 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.219
 plug in your USB cable. 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.119
 But that the USB cable can be used directly in the smartwatch itself. 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.109
 The Smartwatch 3 works with mobile devices ... 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.609
 which have Android 4.3 and higher as operating system. 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.180
 Not with others. 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.089
 It is available from fall, just like the Smartband Talk. 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.839
 He will cost something of € 229. 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:16.299
 You can get it in black and a kind of lime color. 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.680
 And then it is also available in pink and white. 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.029
