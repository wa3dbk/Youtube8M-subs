00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.919
 hello the anchovy or bocarte fishing has always been the most traditional 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.000
 in the Cantabrian sea 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.130
 in recent years due to the change in temperature and overfishing this 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.029
 fishery pp fishing banks that are watching terribly depleted 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.929
 environmental organizations have been denouncing the problems of this 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.609
 species for many years now begins fishing again anchovy 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.470
 after four years of age due to the dramatic reduction in the number of 

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:28.169
 copies 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.949
 for this reason from the oceana conservation organization has been requested 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.430
 to the European Union a precautionary approach when allocating 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.519
 catches the oceana europe project director ricardo aguilar remembered 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.979
 that in March 2006 the ban was lifted with a quota of 5 thousand tons in 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.659
 against the scientific recommendations and in the end the 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.449
 reality because it had to re-close a few months later 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.699
 Given the scarcity of catches, 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.560
 on the situation of anchovy serve as an example the data for the year 2005 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.320
 where it was calculated that the biomass is to say the total volume of animals 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.390
 it was at nine thousand five hundred tons a figure well below 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.470
 the 33 thousand recommended as precautionary biomass 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.040
 and although it seems incredible and with all the data put on the table 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.580
 clear and forceful still the fishing companies see with bad eyes 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.530
 the application of truth to let the species recover seems like a 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.100
 attitude explainable end the same ones who live from anchovy fishing want 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.000
 reach its extermination although the sentence may not be correct because in 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.940
 It is not really those who live by fishing who are pressuring 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.090
 politicians and workers to fish to the limit are the investors whose only 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.740
 goal is to get the maximum benefit in the shortest time possible if 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.610
 the anchovy sabotage simply collects its benefits imposes investment in 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.450
 another product in the end the problem of fishermen and fishing banks 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.260
 it has its origin in other banks those that house the bank accounts and the 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.150
 profit margins of a few opportunists who do not attend and now 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
 all scientists and her social mom 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:12.629
 a goal 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.389
 the frost in
