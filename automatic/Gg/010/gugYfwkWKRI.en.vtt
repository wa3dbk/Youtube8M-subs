00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.940
 the chapters 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.760
 languages ​​they want and replaced it 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.540

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 that I like a lot is called ojeda in the network 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.500
 if you do something in common 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.740

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.540
 after mentioning the direct copy 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.960
 let's see the exceptional club structure 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050
 as you see here 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.980

 we had the strips the millennium stripes 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:57.079
 and we could not manipulate it as they wanted 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.829
 in terms of compression c 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.089
 the container 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.249
