00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.150
 we come back with more 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.150
 abc rural el paraguay was one of the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.170
 first countries that worked in planting 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.949
 direct with very good technicians but 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.710
 we also saw as behind the soy 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.439
 the corn was sown and 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.259
 we did and we saw it done to the engineer 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.220
 you believe but today the dynamics continue 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:37.120
 and follow the elements that make the 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.940
 technologies sir this he simmons us 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.010
 will show what are the details that 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.980
 It must be taken when planting 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 corn something to keep in mind to have 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 good results 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.000
 to crop rotation is a 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.280
 practice that consists in alternating 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.680
 plants of different families and with 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.650
 different nutritional needs in a 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.300
 same place during different cycles 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.100
 preventing the soil from running out and 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.810
 diseases that affect a type of 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.060
 plant are perpetuated in a time 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.980
 determined in this case for those 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.140
 producers that develop large 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.660
 land extensions and where one of 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.490
 Its main crops are soybeans 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.770
 recommends that after its harvest it 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.690
 Sow country and do not plant soy again 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.729
 again since the technicians 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.520
 consider a practice for others 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.650
 negative because it means that it was not cut 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.630
 the cycle suggested what can generate 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.150
 the presence of diseases and pests 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.369
 with more force for the traditional time 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.450
 of the oilseed after taking out the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.960
 soy we bet on corn 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.640
 a second crop not good but 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.670
 always it helps keep the soil 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.340
 also incorporate organic matter and 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.530
 produce some grains too that we 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.140
 they serve for animal nutrition with this 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.509
 let's get to the harvest pretty much 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.429
 end of May because they are varieties of 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.590
 early corn we are going to make a 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.959
 disposition of that grain maybe in a 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.269
 century bag of wet beans because 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.180
 let's harvest before it dries 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.610
 totally to buy time and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.459
 again makes a coverage of 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.130
 winter with oats, remember that the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.799
 Mr Eitel Simmons is also dedicated to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.019
 the rearing livestock and finishing by 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.790
 What producing corn favors 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.370
 concerning the feeding of their 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.569
 animals but why plant oats 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.280
 after corn that oats keeps 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.800
 covered the ground during the time of 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.380
 winter 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.780
 under that oat cover the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.140
 corn stubble is already rotting and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.750
 turning into organic matter that is 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.280
 incorporates to the ground and on that a 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.050
 I raise soybean directly again to 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.350
 the end of September the first days of 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.300
 October when we close the cycle 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.510
 then there is an advantage that is 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.690
 important and there is also a 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.020
 soil conservation move from one 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.930
 oil to a grass is important 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.120
 because they use different nutrients the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.210
 leaves brings us back to the earth nitrogen 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.390
 corn does not consume nitrogen but it does not 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.580
 leaves organic matter so that it is very 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.160
 important true that diversification of 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.650
 production after observing how it was worn 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.110
 out the work of planting corn him 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.600
 we consulted Mr. Simmons what is the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.910
 fertilization that receives the soil in that 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.580
 moment we in this case of corn 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.400
 it needs a lot of nitrogen then in 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.680
 the formulation the fertilizer that 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.469
 considers the content of 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.140
 troje you have no match that is a 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.209
 knowing the deficiency that the 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.189
 red earth of the area so that 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.560
 we have to put plenty of phosphorus and 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.450
 logic of this potassium and others 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.750
 micronutrients now that they go 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.969
 accompanying the formulation but all 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.659
 that is based on studies that have 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:11.959
 made of soil the important thing is that 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:15.500
 to the ground at least we give back what 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.440
 that gave us in good production those not 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.720
 they are costs that are investments because the 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.810
 cost is what we throw in one 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.970
 returns anyone to the query if the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.759
 corn that I was planting was from 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.490
 transgenic or conventional varieties 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.889
 the professional said this are varieties 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.320
 conventional we can not 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:40.280
 talk about a technology of many 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.099
 costs here true because it teaches the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.240
 yields are not as good because 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:50.360
 the temperature goes down the cycle of the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.990
 sunlight is shrinking and we 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.230
 we know what 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.920
 my needs a lot of light a lot of sun 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.060
 So we are using products from 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.490
 medium level they would be in a 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.250
 yield of 5 to 6 tons per 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.460
 hectare but at least give us 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.610
 something in that / zafra and that helps us 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.260
 also to cover the costs of that 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.190
 investment that we are making for 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.190
 keep the soil
