talked with you or not I'm going to kind
of<00:00:13.679> show<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.889> what<00:00:14.099> we've<00:00:14.219> done<00:00:14.540> this<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:15.780> is

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
of show you what we've done this here is

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.590 
of show you what we've done this here is
now<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> exhaust<00:00:16.710> pipe<00:00:17.160> coming<00:00:17.460> out<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.210> cbt

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
now the exhaust pipe coming out the cbt

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.990 
now the exhaust pipe coming out the cbt
exhaust<00:00:18.990> where<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> joins<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.400> out<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.760> went

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
exhaust where a joins in out here went

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.570 
exhaust where a joins in out here went
ahead<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.330> put<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:22.310> some<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
ahead and put some some of the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.120 
ahead and put some some of the
insulation<00:00:24.150> tape<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> all<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> way<00:00:25.769> around

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
insulation tape on it all the way around

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.169 
insulation tape on it all the way around
so<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:27.300> insulated<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> way<00:00:28.199> down

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
so it it's insulated all the way down

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.020 
so it it's insulated all the way down
comes<00:00:30.179> down<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> 90<00:00:32.399> degree<00:00:32.640> elbow

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
comes down here to a 90 degree elbow

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.200 
comes down here to a 90 degree elbow
that<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.719> see<00:00:33.870> right<00:00:34.020> there<00:00:34.969> then<00:00:35.969> goes

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
that you can see right there then goes

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.200 
that you can see right there then goes
into<00:00:36.570> another<00:00:36.660> pipe<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:38.430> comes<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.910> now<00:00:39.059> it's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
into another pipe that comes up now it's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.850 
into another pipe that comes up now it's
cranking<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.770> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
cranking a little bit but with this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.560 
cranking a little bit but with this
being<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.250> exhaust<00:00:41.610> pipe<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
being the exhaust pipe it's not going to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.850 
being the exhaust pipe it's not going to
be<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.870> you're<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.379> gonna<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.680> much

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
be that you're not gonna have that much

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.060 
be that you're not gonna have that much
of<00:00:44.070> an<00:00:44.160> effect<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:46.890> if

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
of an effect on it so that's the one if

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.229 
of an effect on it so that's the one if
you're<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> crank<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.059> that's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you're gonna have to crank on one that's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.520 
you're gonna have to crank on one that's
the<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.360> Abbey<00:00:48.690> sprinkle<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> comes<00:00:51.090> up

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
the one Abbey sprinkle and it comes up

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.610 
the one Abbey sprinkle and it comes up
here<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:54.030> here's<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.570> exit<00:00:55.050> part<00:00:55.289> here

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
here and then here's that exit part here

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.860 
here and then here's that exit part here
where<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.399> gonna<00:00:56.489> come<00:00:56.579> across<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
where it's gonna come across this is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.099 
where it's gonna come across this is
your<00:00:58.050> CVT<00:00:58.770> intake<00:00:59.190> coming<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.780> where<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.870> cut

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
your CVT intake coming up where we cut

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.579 
your CVT intake coming up where we cut
it<00:01:01.260> put<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> pipe<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.640> got<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
it put the pipe down in there got the

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.020 
it put the pipe down in there got the
clamp<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.430> sure<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:05.850> in

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
clamp in there to make sure it's down in

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510 
clamp in there to make sure it's down in
there<00:01:06.150> good<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.390> tight<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.990> sealed<00:01:07.430> then<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
there good and tight and sealed then it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.510 
there good and tight and sealed then it
goes<00:01:08.640> into<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.049> 90<00:01:10.049> degree<00:01:10.409> coupling<00:01:11.400> come

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
goes into a 90 degree coupling come

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.170 
goes into a 90 degree coupling come
across<00:01:12.770> went<00:01:13.770> ahead<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.340> put<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> rubber

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
across went ahead and we put a rubber

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
across went ahead and we put a rubber
boot<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.930> had<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.290> half<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.740> half<00:01:17.100> rubber

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
boot I had one half to one half rubber

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.030 
boot I had one half to one half rubber
boot<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.320> had<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> take

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
boot in there that way if we had to take

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.440 
boot in there that way if we had to take
this<00:01:20.220> thing<00:01:20.460> off<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.060> take<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> off

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
this thing off we can take it off

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.870 
this thing off we can take it off
without<00:01:22.189> having<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> tear<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.670> whole

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
without having to tear up the whole

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
without having to tear up the whole
piping<00:01:24.360> system<00:01:24.710> cut<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.040> whatever<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.970> can

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
piping system cut it or whatever we can

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.200 
piping system cut it or whatever we can
always<00:01:27.420> take<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.729> replace<00:01:29.729> just

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
always take this off and replace just

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.310 
always take this off and replace just
small<00:01:30.420> parts<00:01:30.630> rather<00:01:30.869> than<00:01:31.049> having<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
small parts rather than having to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.649 
small parts rather than having to
replace<00:01:31.530> large<00:01:32.490> parts<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.450> comes

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
replace large parts and then it comes

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.960 
replace large parts and then it comes
out<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.270> that'll<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:37.820> intake<00:01:38.820> for

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
out here so that'll be your intake for

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.280 
out here so that'll be your intake for
your<00:01:39.060> CVT<00:01:39.479> right<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.490> your

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
your CVT right here now this is your

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.859 
your CVT right here now this is your
your<00:01:43.290> intake<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.070> carburetor<00:01:44.729> or<00:01:45.360> for

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
your intake for your carburetor or for

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.980 
your intake for your carburetor or for
your<00:01:45.990> fuel<00:01:46.710> system<00:01:47.210> as<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.509> see<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> goes

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
your fuel system as you can see it goes

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920 
your fuel system as you can see it goes
back<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> fuel<00:01:49.619> box<00:01:49.939> no<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:51.360> I've

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
back to the fuel box no there I've

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.219 
back to the fuel box no there I've
actually<00:01:52.549> got<00:01:53.549> another<00:01:53.820> piece<00:01:54.810> I'm<00:01:55.049> going<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
actually got another piece I'm going to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.469 
actually got another piece I'm going to

there's your air intake snorkel and then

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.190 
there's your air intake snorkel and then
this<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.479> actually<00:02:09.599> gonna<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:09.959> another

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this one is actually gonna have another

this way
and<00:02:13.920> we'll<00:02:14.040> trim<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.460> out<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.850> where<00:02:15.000> it'll

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and we'll trim this out to where it'll

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.600 
and we'll trim this out to where it'll
line<00:02:15.330> up<00:02:15.480> over<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.230> then<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:17.430> one

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
line up over there and then this one

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.510 
line up over there and then this one
will<00:02:17.700> come<00:02:17.910> out<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.770> be<00:02:19.890> about<00:02:20.070> like<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.460> and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
will come out and be about like that and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
then we'll they'll have caps on them up

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.800 
then we'll they'll have caps on them up

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
we did that with the snorkel system also

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.290 
we did that with the snorkel system also
another<00:02:32.280> thing<00:02:32.460> I've<00:02:32.640> done<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.000> I've<00:02:33.150> gone

I'm<00:02:52.080> using<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.500> for<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> go<00:02:53.190> around<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
I'm using that for is to go around the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.400 
I'm using that for is to go around the
hole<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.450> cut<00:02:54.690> into<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.580> gauge<00:02:56.580> cluster

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
hole that I cut into the gauge cluster

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.560 
hole that I cut into the gauge cluster
thing<00:02:58.410> here<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.740> can<00:02:58.830> see<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.250> just<00:03:00.030> use<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.480> a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
thing here you can see I just use it a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.170 
thing here you can see I just use it a
nicer<00:03:01.320> look<00:03:01.560> there<00:03:02.130> go<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.880> there<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.090> I'll

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
nicer look there go in there and I'll

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.570 
nicer look there go in there and I'll
cut<00:03:03.450> here<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:04.620> it'll<00:03:04.800> look<00:03:05.220> like<00:03:05.340> it's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
cut here and then it'll look like it's

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.880 
cut here and then it'll look like it's
meant<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.820> be<00:03:05.910> there<00:03:06.150> instead<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.890> being

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
meant to be there instead of being

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.880 
meant to be there instead of being
jagged<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.520> hedge<00:03:08.850> doc<00:03:09.210> it<00:03:09.390> was<00:03:09.680> that's<00:03:10.680> where

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
jagged and hedge doc it was that's where

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.580 
jagged and hedge doc it was that's where
we<00:03:10.950> are<00:03:10.980> right<00:03:11.130> now<00:03:12.170> slowly<00:03:13.170> getting<00:03:13.560> there

when it gets here I'll be it'll be a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.500 
when it gets here I'll be it'll be a
surprise<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.880> won't<00:03:24.060> tell<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.240> what<00:03:24.360> its<00:03:24.450> gonna

look like but it is gonna be a custom

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.300 
look like but it is gonna be a custom
rad<00:03:26.580> relocate<00:03:27.440> with<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> custom<00:03:28.830> screen<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
rad relocate with a custom screen on it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.720 
rad relocate with a custom screen on it
so<00:03:29.520> gonna<00:03:30.390> be<00:03:30.480> pretty<00:03:30.660> sharp<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.730> that's

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
so gonna be pretty sharp and that's
