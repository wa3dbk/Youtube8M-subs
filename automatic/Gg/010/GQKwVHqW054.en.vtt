plus um this is often like being linked
it's<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.199> pretty<00:00:26.099> much<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> Bible<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.849> drop

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119

it's like pretty much the Bible of drop
chance<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> problem<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.439> it's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
chance but the problem with this is it's

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.630 
chance but the problem with this is it's
outfitted<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.880> wrong<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.109> arm

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
difficulties and on top of that they

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
difficulties and on top of that they
have<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.149> 50<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> legendary<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.230> for

have like 50 was a legendary here for
two<00:00:49.980> percent<00:00:50.250> action<00:00:50.520> down<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:51.120> like

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
two percent action down here that's like

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.209 
two percent action down here that's like
those<00:00:51.750> were<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.020> recent<00:00:52.440> implemented<00:00:52.980> paths

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
those were like recent implemented paths

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.950 
those were like recent implemented paths
who<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> comic<00:00:54.239> drop<00:00:54.420> chance<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.750> rift

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
who like the comic drop chance of rift

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080 
who like the comic drop chance of rift
so<00:00:55.440> rifts<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.860> torment<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.640> higher<00:00:56.820> drop

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so rifts on torment have higher drop

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.729 
so rifts on torment have higher drop
chance<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.199> lift<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.590> like

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
chance actually not just lift but like

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.560 
chance actually not just lift but like
the<00:00:59.039> empty<00:00:59.340> game<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.820> also<00:01:00.059> pump<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the empty game like also pump this and

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.599 
the empty game like also pump this and
whatever<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:01.260> her<00:01:01.410> drop<00:01:01.739> chance<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.399> that

at<00:03:19.669> least<00:03:19.790> 10<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.239> 20<00:03:20.599> samples<00:03:20.810> but<00:03:21.410> obviously

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
at least 10 to 20 samples but obviously

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.890 
at least 10 to 20 samples but obviously
water<00:03:22.040> better<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.940> type<00:03:23.209> those<00:03:23.450> samples

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
water better and you type those samples

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.199 
water better and you type those samples
of<00:03:23.989> every<00:03:24.139> different<00:03:24.919> difficulty<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:25.700> you

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
of every different difficulty so you

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.420 
of every different difficulty so you
ready<00:03:26.359> to<00:03:26.389> get<00:03:26.540> an<00:03:26.660> idea<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:27.019> okay<00:03:27.739> this<00:03:28.250> is

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
ready to get an idea of okay this is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.680 
ready to get an idea of okay this is
going<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.639> take<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.790> very<00:03:29.060> long<00:03:29.150> time<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.480> i

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
going to take a very long time that i

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.659 
going to take a very long time that i
could<00:03:29.780> find<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:30.169> good<00:03:30.470> approximation<00:03:30.709> for<00:03:31.519> how

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
could find a good approximation for how

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.920 
could find a good approximation for how
long<00:03:31.819> a<00:03:31.880> rift<00:03:32.180> on<00:03:32.299> average<00:03:32.510> takes<00:03:32.750> because

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
long a rift on average takes because

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.110 
long a rift on average takes because
every<00:03:33.650> rift<00:03:33.829> is<00:03:33.980> different<00:03:34.459> like<00:03:34.669> for<00:03:35.090> example

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
every rift is different like for example

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.050 
every rift is different like for example
cookie<00:03:35.690> we<00:03:36.620> can<00:03:36.769> be<00:03:36.859> a<00:03:36.889> really<00:03:37.130> fast<00:03:37.430> rift<00:03:37.819> with

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
cookie we can be a really fast rift with

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.909 
cookie we can be a really fast rift with
let's<00:03:38.239> say<00:03:38.510> we're<00:03:38.930> completely<00:03:39.230> very<00:03:39.500> fast<00:03:39.769> you

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
let's say we're completely very fast you

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.530 
let's say we're completely very fast you
can<00:03:40.040> get<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.190> super<00:03:40.579> good<00:03:40.700> level<00:03:41.030> but<00:03:41.180> there's<00:03:41.480> a

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
can get a super good level but there's a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.970 
can get a super good level but there's a
lot<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.720> releasing<00:03:42.109> process<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.560> complete<00:03:42.709> the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
lot of releasing process to complete the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.830 
lot of releasing process to complete the
rift<00:03:43.160> fast<00:03:43.430> then<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.120> could<00:03:44.239> for<00:03:44.389> example<00:03:44.419> say

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
rift fast then you could for example say

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.020 
rift fast then you could for example say
okay<00:03:45.109> there's<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.620> rift<00:03:45.859> before<00:03:46.370> complete<00:03:46.819> you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
okay there's a rift before complete you

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.699 
okay there's a rift before complete you
and<00:03:47.269> it's<00:03:47.419> much<00:03:47.810> faster<00:03:48.019> than<00:03:48.260> normal<00:03:48.380> then

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
and it's much faster than normal then

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.720 
and it's much faster than normal then
they<00:03:48.739> get<00:03:48.919> it<00:03:49.069> r<00:03:49.130> if<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.370> have<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.639> go

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
they get it r if you have to go

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.909 
they get it r if you have to go
delivered<00:03:50.060> eight<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.510> PT<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.349> it<00:03:51.500> takes<00:03:51.680> much

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
delivered eight to PT so it takes much

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.190 
delivered eight to PT so it takes much
longer<00:03:52.069> than<00:03:52.250> average<00:03:52.519> but<00:03:52.700> that's<00:03:53.569> what<00:03:53.810> you

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
longer than average but that's what you

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.960 
longer than average but that's what you
have<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.349> do<00:03:54.530> many<00:03:54.739> rounds<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.099> like<00:03:55.250> even<00:03:55.609> all

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
have to do many rounds to like even all

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.080 
have to do many rounds to like even all
those<00:03:56.480> special<00:03:57.139> rifts<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:58.250> ask<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.879> have<00:03:59.000> a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
those special rifts and ask you have a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.449 
those special rifts and ask you have a
few<00:03:59.269> examples<00:03:59.329> um<00:03:59.930> obviously<00:04:00.859> like<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.340> high

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
few examples um obviously like the high

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.220 
few examples um obviously like the high
apartment<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.090> longer<00:04:02.599> should<00:04:02.780> take<00:04:02.930> like<00:04:03.109> if

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
apartment the longer should take like if

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.020 
apartment the longer should take like if
for<00:04:03.889> example<00:04:03.919> you<00:04:04.190> calculate<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.970> for

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
for example you calculate that for

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.750 
for example you calculate that for
example<00:04:05.209> 24<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:06.049> fast<00:04:06.319> implement<00:04:06.769> five<00:04:06.980> then

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
example 24 is fast implement five then

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.059 
example 24 is fast implement five then
this<00:04:07.940> must<00:04:08.150> be<00:04:08.389> wrong<00:04:08.569> they<00:04:08.720> need<00:04:08.930> more<00:04:09.079> tries

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
this must be wrong they need more tries

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.289 
this must be wrong they need more tries
to<00:04:10.280> like<00:04:10.400> really<00:04:10.549> get<00:04:10.699> that<00:04:10.849> good<00:04:11.060> time

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
to like really get that good time

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.050 
to like really get that good time
because<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:13.040> could<00:04:13.220> be<00:04:13.250> that<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.760> opponent

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
because it could be that the opponent

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.400 
because it could be that the opponent

those<00:04:51.200> times<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:51.710> will<00:04:51.890> just<00:04:52.070> randomly<00:04:52.220> made

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
those times that will just randomly made

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.430 
those times that will just randomly made
up<00:04:52.700> because<00:04:53.420> it<00:04:53.600> takes<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.810> long<00:04:53.900> time<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.140> test

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
up because it takes a long time to test

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.320 
up because it takes a long time to test
that<00:04:54.650> but<00:04:55.400> for<00:04:55.580> me<00:04:55.640> the<00:04:55.760> highest<00:04:56.030> efficiency

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
that but for me the highest efficiency

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.820 
that but for me the highest efficiency
of<00:04:56.480> a<00:04:56.510> pre-deployment<00:04:56.750> free<00:04:57.170> at<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.470> lowest

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
of pain perlman six and you can also

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.890 
of pain perlman six and you can also
like<00:05:00.620> rank<00:05:00.860> this<00:05:01.070> or<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.280> can<00:05:01.430> make<00:05:01.580> an<00:05:02.510> extra

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
like rank this or I can make an extra

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.930 
like rank this or I can make an extra
sheet<00:05:03.140> where<00:05:03.350> for<00:05:03.440> example<00:05:03.670> insert<00:05:04.670> the<00:05:04.730> rules

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
sheet where for example insert the rules

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.370 
sheet where for example insert the rules
and<00:05:05.180> automatically<00:05:05.660> shows<00:05:05.840> you<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.170> highest

and automatically shows you the highest
one<00:05:06.740> I'm<00:05:07.100> probably<00:05:07.310> going<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.580> make<00:05:07.700> another

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
one I'm probably going to make another

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.210 
one I'm probably going to make another
video<00:05:08.330> but<00:05:08.450> really<00:05:09.140> like<00:05:09.350> press<00:05:09.680> entity<00:05:10.160> that

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
video but really like press entity that

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.370 
video but really like press entity that
exit<00:05:10.730> every<00:05:11.030> one<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.150> you<00:05:11.330> guys<00:05:11.480> can<00:05:11.750> use<00:05:11.930> we're

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
exit every one of you guys can use we're

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.900 
exit every one of you guys can use we're
just<00:05:12.530> insert<00:05:13.010> like<00:05:13.160> your<00:05:13.310> own<00:05:13.490> numbers<00:05:13.820> you

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
just insert like your own numbers you

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.100 
just insert like your own numbers you
insert<00:05:14.120> your<00:05:14.150> own<00:05:14.270> time<00:05:14.630> so<00:05:14.810> it's<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:14.960> only

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
insert your own time so it's the only

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.720 
insert your own time so it's the only
thing<00:05:15.230> you<00:05:15.320> have<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.470> test<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.920> calculate<00:05:16.310> and

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
thing you have to test and calculate and

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.120 
thing you have to test and calculate and
then<00:05:16.850> it's<00:05:17.000> going<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.210> like<00:05:17.560> show<00:05:18.560> you<00:05:18.620> well

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
then it's going to like show you well

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.530 
then it's going to like show you well
you<00:05:19.250> should<00:05:19.310> go<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.760> blow<00:05:19.970> you<00:05:20.030> should<00:05:20.270> farm

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
you should go and blow you should farm

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.720 
you should go and blow you should farm
and<00:05:21.010> yeah<00:05:22.010> that's<00:05:22.160> pretty<00:05:22.280> much<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.520> basic

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
and yeah that's pretty much the basic

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.080 
and yeah that's pretty much the basic
idea<00:05:23.150> behind<00:05:23.240> drifting<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.140> drop<00:05:24.560> chances<00:05:25.090> by

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
idea behind drifting and drop chances by

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.390 
idea behind drifting and drop chances by
logic<00:05:26.540> speaking<00:05:26.990> as<00:05:27.110> I<00:05:27.200> said<00:05:27.410> one<00:05:27.950> quote<00:05:28.190> a

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
logic speaking as I said one quote a

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.720 
logic speaking as I said one quote a
rule<00:05:28.700> of<00:05:28.730> fan<00:05:29.000> base<00:05:29.240> 16<00:05:29.660> 15<00:05:30.290> 21<00:05:30.710> with<00:05:30.920> 26<00:05:31.640> is

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
rule of fan base 16 15 21 with 26 is

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.160 
rule of fan base 16 15 21 with 26 is
places<00:05:32.150> let<00:05:32.270> you<00:05:32.360> know<00:05:32.450> a<00:05:32.480> chance<00:05:32.750> so<00:05:32.930> you<00:05:32.990> can

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
places let you know a chance so you can

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.050 
places let you know a chance so you can
roughly<00:05:33.800> estimated<00:05:34.220> that<00:05:34.460> you<00:05:34.550> can<00:05:34.700> kill<00:05:34.850> them

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
roughly estimated that you can kill them

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.260 
roughly estimated that you can kill them
like<00:05:35.780> I<00:05:36.110> mean<00:05:36.920> half<00:05:37.100> of<00:05:37.220> times<00:05:37.490> comment1<00:05:37.910> rift

like I mean half of times comment1 rift

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.810 
like I mean half of times comment1 rift
or<00:05:38.530> actually<00:05:39.530> rectification<00:05:39.860> cleared<00:05:40.430> one

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.110 
roof in half of times from in six swift
if<00:05:42.890> you're<00:05:43.070> faster<00:05:43.460> than<00:05:43.490> that<00:05:43.760> unemployment

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
if you're faster than that unemployment

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.480 
if you're faster than that unemployment
one<00:05:44.470> then<00:05:45.470> you<00:05:45.500> should<00:05:45.680> go<00:05:45.830> comment<00:05:46.220> one<00:05:46.340> if

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
one then you should go comment one if

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.250 
one then you should go comment one if
you're<00:05:46.580> slower<00:05:46.850> should<00:05:47.120> go<00:05:47.240> comment6<00:05:47.630> but

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
you're slower should go comment6 but

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.170 
you're slower should go comment6 but
also<00:05:48.380> like<00:05:48.590> most<00:05:49.550> of<00:05:49.670> you<00:05:49.760> probably<00:05:49.790> won't

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
also like most of you probably won't

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.610 
also like most of you probably won't
even<00:05:50.300> babe<00:05:50.480> look<00:05:50.660> people<00:05:50.840> at<00:05:51.080> six<00:05:51.260> is<00:05:51.410> probably

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
even babe look people at six is probably

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.750 
even babe look people at six is probably
gonna<00:05:51.740> be<00:05:51.800> a<00:05:51.890> comparison<00:05:52.310> could<00:05:52.430> me<00:05:52.550> like<00:05:52.670> the

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
gonna be a comparison could me like the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.930 
gonna be a comparison could me like the

if you die a lot in return oh okay that

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.890 
if you die a lot in return oh okay that
can't<00:05:58.520> be<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:58.790> most<00:05:58.940> efficient<00:05:59.390> way<00:05:59.420> I<00:05:59.720> will

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
can't be the most efficient way I will

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.600 
can't be the most efficient way I will
decide<00:06:00.170> rift<00:06:00.500> Guardian<00:06:00.860> except<00:06:01.190> is<00:06:01.280> coming<00:06:01.550> to

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
decide rift Guardian except is coming to

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.220 
decide rift Guardian except is coming to
complete<00:06:01.880> it<00:06:02.060> so<00:06:02.480> let's<00:06:02.720> say<00:06:02.810> for<00:06:02.960> me<00:06:03.080> for

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
complete it so let's say for me for

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.540 
complete it so let's say for me for
example<00:06:03.290> plummet<00:06:03.800> five<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.160> six<00:06:04.310> are<00:06:04.430> no

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
example plummet five and six are no

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.220 
example plummet five and six are no
option<00:06:04.910> then<00:06:05.210> you'd<00:06:05.330> need<00:06:05.480> to<00:06:05.600> like<00:06:05.750> only<00:06:05.960> test

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
option then you'd need to like only test

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.840 
option then you'd need to like only test
the<00:06:06.380> lower<00:06:06.500> lifts<00:06:06.860> but<00:06:07.430> I<00:06:07.490> hope<00:06:07.760> you

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
the lower lifts but I hope you

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.020 
the lower lifts but I hope you
understand<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.300> basics<00:06:08.330> of<00:06:08.870> this<00:06:09.230> video<00:06:09.530> and

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
understand the basics of this video and

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.180 
understand the basics of this video and
maybe<00:06:11.030> find<00:06:11.330> some<00:06:11.480> useful<00:06:11.600> information<00:06:12.190> right

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
maybe find some useful information right

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.370 
maybe find some useful information right
