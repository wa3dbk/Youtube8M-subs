 option in order to be able to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 see how it all looks that is 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.500
 combination of different color straps

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
 motley gadgets that will serve and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.299
 fades away 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.840
 You can use this side button. 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.610
 move through the menu button below listen 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.360
 to confirm actions though in this 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.159
 case, you will notice that there is still 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.340
 indication of steps time in general here 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.700
 quite a lot of functions of this watch 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.119
 they have moisture protection 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.490
 built-in fitness instructor plus here 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.540
 there is data on calls with the name indicated 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.090
 caller legs 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.970

 bluetooth 40 low supported 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.100
 electricity consumption is protection 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.620
 from moisture stressed something ipx7 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.820
 that is, usually the seven is protection from 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.860
 water but what about 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.990
 incomprehensible see her just not this 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.500
 strange if the moisture protection video is 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.960
 and protection Kahlen should be work watch 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 with android 44 above the whole is not 30 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.360
 grams 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.520
 which is not practically charged through 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.380
 universal micro usb connector he 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.540
 is on the side and close such here 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.790
 small 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.670
 stub these straps are different ie here 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.940
 This let's the leather made 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.180
 from the material which is more like 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.830
 rubber white black and brown very 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.850
 the cutest part is interest only they 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.700
 will cost but 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.220
 how will show itself in work this is all 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.280
 stay by the way next to these 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.040
 hours worth stand that serves 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.070
 for shooting then there is such a whole tripod with 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.760
 auto rotate function it 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.890
 allows you to photograph that is how 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.380
 You can see the phone attached and you can 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.739
 shoot the world around you and not only 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.230
 Photo but also video here is micro usb 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.060
 port in general is a handy thing for 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.070
 fashionable now sauces or just 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.290
 photographing any thread objects i 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.239
 I think it is very convenient to shoot panoramas 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.940
 because the device will be fixed 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.980
 the quality of the image will not be twitching 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.410
 must be very good at shooting at 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.630
 360 works via Bluetooth and 40 s 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.060
 sensor that notes 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.000
 activity and is able to degraffenride object 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.020
 curious such from development from lenovo 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.020
 on ces 2015
