going<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> need<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.110> an<00:00:34.440> empty<00:00:34.800> map<00:00:35.010> um<00:00:36.590> paper

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
going to need to an empty map um paper

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.790 
going to need to an empty map um paper
and<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:38.910> you're<00:00:39.149> an<00:00:39.239> ingot<00:00:39.629> redstone<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and a now you're an ingot redstone to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.209 
and a now you're an ingot redstone to
make<00:00:40.920> an<00:00:41.070> empty<00:00:41.340> map<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:42.090> need<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.420> make<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
make an empty map you need to make a

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.500 
make an empty map you need to make a
compass<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:45.120> how<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> make<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
compass and that's how you make a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
compass and that's how you make a
compass<00:00:45.840> will<00:00:45.989> put<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.680> redstone<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
compass will put one redstone in the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.209 
compass will put one redstone in the
middle<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.770> surround<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.950> by<00:00:50.100> our

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
middle and then just surround it by our

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.580 
middle and then just surround it by our
iron<00:00:50.550> ingots<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> compass<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.500> we're

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
iron ingots you get a compass so we're

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.139 
iron ingots you get a compass so we're
going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> take<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> compass<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:55.039> then<00:00:56.149> yeah

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
going to take the compass and then yeah

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
going to take the compass and then yeah
after<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.809> got<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> compass<00:00:58.440> put<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
after you got the compass put the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.340 
after you got the compass put the
compass<00:00:59.570> back<00:01:01.129> into<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> middle<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.870> then

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
compass back into the middle and then

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.520 
compass back into the middle and then
take<00:01:04.559> paper<00:01:05.060> and<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.360> make<00:01:06.570> paper<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:07.110> putting

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
take paper and you make paper by putting

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.570 
take paper and you make paper by putting
three<00:01:08.630> what's<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.750> called<00:01:10.250> sugar<00:01:11.250> canes

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
three what's it called sugar canes

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that and that makes an empty map when

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
that and that makes an empty map when
you<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.720> an<00:01:15.869> empty<00:01:16.110> map<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.250> click<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you get an empty map you right click it

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.960 
you get an empty map you right click it
and<00:01:18.200> then<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.009> let's<00:01:20.250> let<00:01:20.610> alone

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and then you get this so let's let alone

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.499 
and then you get this so let's let alone
and<00:01:21.470> yes<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> want<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.420> make

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and yes so what you want to do to make

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.520 
and yes so what you want to do to make
it<00:01:24.689> bigger<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.409> where<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.720> somme<00:01:27.720> bug

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it bigger this is where the somme bug

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980 
it bigger this is where the somme bug
takes<00:01:28.799> place<00:01:29.070> first<00:01:29.850> off<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> have

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
takes place first off you when you have

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.920 
takes place first off you when you have
the<00:01:31.110> map<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> hold<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.689> well<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the map you want to hold it well and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.130 
the map you want to hold it well and
then<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> click<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> I'm<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
then you want to click so I'm not a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020 
then you want to click so I'm not a
hundred<00:01:37.290> percent<00:01:37.500> sure<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.310> need<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> hold

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
hundred percent sure if you need to hold

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.230 
hundred percent sure if you need to hold
it<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.750> click<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.790> take<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> as

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it when you click but I just take it as

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
it when you click but I just take it as
a<00:01:42.299> precaution<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.710> click<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
a precaution so when you click it and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.030 
a precaution so when you click it and
then<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.479> take<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:47.060> even<00:01:48.060> more

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
then what you do is take on even more

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.429 
then what you do is take on even more
sorry<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:50.490> live<00:01:50.960> but<00:01:51.960> anyway<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it's on an empty map and you surround it

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's on an empty map and you surround it
again<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.320> did<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> compass<00:01:59.040> and
