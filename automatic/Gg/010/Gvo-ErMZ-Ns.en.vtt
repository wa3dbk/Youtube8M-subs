 He leaves the plane and started to fail me 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.980
 started to kind of give the party I think a 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.649
 mechanical failure, right? 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.820
 I do not know how it happened a wave 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.129
 I'm going to be like that. 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.939
 hit the left wing of the plane hence the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.189

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.400

 also to say that the son is saved nothing 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.710
 If I can, I'd tell him to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.009
 The same thing we can do 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.150
 we were tempted only that from there I went 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.000
