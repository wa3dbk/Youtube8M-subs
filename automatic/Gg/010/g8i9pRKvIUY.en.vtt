00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
boards yeah I said four words it's

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.870 
boards yeah I said four words it's
actually<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> modular<00:02:26.800> game<00:02:27.280> board<00:02:27.610> if<00:02:27.790> you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
actually a modular game board if you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.809 
actually a modular game board if you
bear<00:02:28.120> with<00:02:28.300> me<00:02:28.480> while<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.690> get<00:02:28.900> these<00:02:29.020> now<00:02:29.819> which

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
bear with me while I get these now which

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.250 
bear with me while I get these now which
fold<00:02:31.090> will<00:02:31.239> rather<00:02:31.420> oddly<00:02:33.570> there<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.630> go<00:02:34.840> zoom

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
fold will rather oddly there you go zoom

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.280 
fold will rather oddly there you go zoom
out<00:02:35.440> here<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.920> little<00:02:36.190> bit<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.519> can<00:02:36.550> see

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
out here a little bit so you can see

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.640 
out here a little bit so you can see
there<00:02:38.290> are<00:02:38.380> modular<00:02:38.680> boards<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.670> flip<00:02:40.120> over

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
there are modular boards you flip over

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.620 
there are modular boards you flip over
and<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.190> create<00:02:42.430> different<00:02:42.850> maps<00:02:43.269> for

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
and you can create different maps for

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.910 
and you can create different maps for
two<00:02:44.050> three<00:02:44.920> four<00:02:45.100> five<00:02:45.880> players<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.620> boards

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
two three four five players the boards

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.290 
two three four five players the boards
are<00:02:48.010> interesting<00:02:48.430> fold<00:02:48.819> here<00:02:49.750> which<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:51.300> kind

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
are interesting fold here which is kind

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.240 
are interesting fold here which is kind
of<00:02:52.330> odd<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:53.010> Wow

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
of odd but Wow

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.460 
of odd but Wow
we'll<00:02:55.239> figure<00:02:55.390> out<00:02:55.510> how<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.720> works<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.230> play

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
we'll figure out how that works in play

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.740 
we'll figure out how that works in play
down<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.130> road<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.380> box<00:03:00.239> we<00:03:01.239> have<00:03:01.269> lots<00:03:01.600> of

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
down the road in the box we have lots of

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.140 
down the road in the box we have lots of
chits<00:03:02.080> yes<00:03:02.590> these<00:03:02.890> are<00:03:02.950> gold<00:03:03.340> coins<00:03:03.880> already

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
chits yes these are gold coins already

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.330 
chits yes these are gold coins already
coming<00:03:04.420> off<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.900> backing<00:03:05.340> unfortunately

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340

don't<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.970> hate<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.150> when<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.420> get<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.570> game<00:03:07.870> in

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
don't you hate it when you get a game in

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.229 
don't you hate it when you get a game in
it's<00:03:08.290> falling<00:03:08.590> apart<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:09.120> hopefully<00:03:10.120> this

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
it's falling apart but hopefully this

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's falling apart but hopefully this
means<00:03:10.390> they'll<00:03:10.630> be<00:03:10.750> easy<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.170> punch<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.530> out

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
means they'll be easy to punch it out

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.199 
means they'll be easy to punch it out
and<00:03:11.829> I<00:03:11.860> won't<00:03:11.950> tear<00:03:12.220> anything<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.910> there's<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and I won't tear anything so there's a

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.860 
and I won't tear anything so there's a
look<00:03:13.450> at<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.660> coins<00:03:13.930> real<00:03:14.290> quick<00:03:15.570> let<00:03:16.570> me<00:03:16.630> try

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
look at the coins real quick let me try

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.300 
look at the coins real quick let me try
and<00:03:17.100> get<00:03:18.100> these<00:03:18.280> out<00:03:18.519> without<00:03:18.670> losing<00:03:19.600> any

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310
