going to show you how you could Street

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:14.459 
going to show you how you could Street
pass<00:00:03.959> from<00:00:04.140> home

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.720 

now<00:00:15.469> there's<00:00:15.709> several<00:00:15.980> different<00:00:16.160> ways<00:00:16.490> you

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
now there's several different ways you

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.189 
now there's several different ways you
could<00:00:16.849> go<00:00:16.970> about<00:00:17.090> doing<00:00:17.480> this<00:00:17.660> but<00:00:18.110> the

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
could go about doing this but the

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.410 
could go about doing this but the
concepts<00:00:18.619> all<00:00:18.770> pretty<00:00:19.130> much<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.520> same<00:00:19.699> you

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
concepts all pretty much the same you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.440 
concepts all pretty much the same you
could<00:00:20.599> use<00:00:20.779> a<00:00:20.810> Linux<00:00:21.259> box<00:00:21.590> Android<00:00:22.460> device<00:00:22.789> if

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
could use a Linux box Android device if

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.210 
could use a Linux box Android device if
you<00:00:23.509> have<00:00:23.660> an<00:00:23.750> extra<00:00:24.050> router<00:00:24.289> but<00:00:25.009> what<00:00:25.189> I

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
you have an extra router but what I

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.040 
you have an extra router but what I
found<00:00:25.490> works<00:00:25.759> easiest<00:00:26.240> for<00:00:26.390> me<00:00:26.509> is<00:00:26.689> I<00:00:26.900> have<00:00:26.990> a

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
found works easiest for me is I have a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.410 
found works easiest for me is I have a
computer<00:00:27.529> as<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:28.009> wireless<00:00:28.369> network<00:00:28.550> card<00:00:29.180> and

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
computer as a wireless network card and

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.480 
computer as a wireless network card and
an<00:00:30.019> Ethernet<00:00:30.199> card<00:00:30.740> plug<00:00:30.980> in<00:00:31.160> at<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.310> same

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
an Ethernet card plug in at the same

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.700 
an Ethernet card plug in at the same
time<00:00:31.789> I'm<00:00:32.599> going<00:00:32.720> to<00:00:32.780> show<00:00:32.839> you<00:00:32.930> how<00:00:33.260> to<00:00:33.290> set<00:00:33.589> it

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
time I'm going to show you how to set it

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.689 
time I'm going to show you how to set it
up<00:00:33.860> let's<00:00:34.489> go<00:00:34.839> how<00:00:35.839> this<00:00:36.019> all<00:00:36.170> works<00:00:36.699> normally

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
up let's go how this all works normally

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.420 
up let's go how this all works normally
