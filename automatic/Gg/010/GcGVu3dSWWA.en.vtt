 Milanese zucchini are very simple and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.530
 I have the eggs here, pretty egg 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.380
 just the same anyway we had a 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.660
 spectacular tempura class with equal 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.610
 you missed it you have to look for it in the 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.920
 media library of television publication 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.620
 because these cuts were great 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.050
 like a hamster for example, slices of 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.239
 zucchini like this or you can make more sheets 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.060
 thicker thin but this shape is 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.030
 good because bite and is more or less more 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.370
 or minus one centimeter if we're going to 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.380
 go through egg the egg quietly 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.650
 you can season it and one of the 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.620
 options is pretty cut grated 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.620
 simply if the perfect zucchini 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.780
 I do not know if these I have to show in 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.370
 the program because in three minutes I 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.870
 make aubergine and eggplant milanesas 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.330
 Zucchini and food for your whole family 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.000
 do not accompany it with whatever you want 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.140
 then the souvenir we went through 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.690
 egg and breadcrumbs 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.180
 with shell or farms for one of the 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.670
 options is to pass it by cool breadcrumbs 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.690
 and the other option is to pass it through eggs and 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.390
 grated bread mixed with oatmeal if what 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.010
 you have to do is win or not chords 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.540
 that this is for me the option is 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.070
 because you can also directly with 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.960
 a little oil to use 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.770
 iron and put a bowl because that 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.990
 over it 's good I have a pan 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.520
 hot here with a little oil 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.410
 because this is the way that I most 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.480
 like to cook friends pasta 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.810
 then zucchinis the aubergines for 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.150
 a little egg and bread crumbs and what 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.270
 I'm going to put in the pan and this we 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.090
 You can brown this way or if you like 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.280
 more do it in the oven if the vouchers are going 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.960
 to give a first cooking here we go to 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.760
 put here again in gel and also 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.620

 how they take you to like your family 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.580
 same as two centimeters 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.230
 I what carlos cardoso forceful 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.140
 currently only because they call us 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.030
 it is to eat meat cutlets we are 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.710
 realistic is very expensive 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.840
 it is very expensive then good 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.379
 It turns off all cooking gives you a 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:25.270
