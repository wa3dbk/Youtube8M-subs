00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and we'll see how to do that in one of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.070 
and we'll see how to do that in one of
the<00:01:07.590> other<00:01:07.710> tutorials<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.659> addition<00:01:09.659> to

having the green we also have an option

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.730 
having the green we also have an option
of<00:01:12.869> using<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.740> black<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.360> again<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.530> the

which<00:02:06.180> means<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.630> works<00:02:06.869> perfectly<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:08.190> your

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
which means it works perfectly with your

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.969 
which means it works perfectly with your
digital<00:02:08.580> camera<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.840> give<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.619> right

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
digital camera to give you the right

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.350 
digital camera to give you the right
color<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.819> light

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
color of light

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.140 
color of light
so<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.350> can<00:02:13.500> make<00:02:13.680> your<00:02:13.830> image<00:02:14.190> now

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
so that you can make your image now

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.440 
so that you can make your image now
we're<00:02:16.050> looking<00:02:16.200> at<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.920> two<00:02:17.250> flavors<00:02:17.790> one

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
we're looking at this in two flavors one

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.110 
we're looking at this in two flavors one
is<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.140> bare<00:02:19.500> bulb<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.130> then<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.850> other

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
is just a bare bulb and then the other

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.380 
is just a bare bulb and then the other
has<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.290> diffuser<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.280> top<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.820> diffusion

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
has the diffuser on top the diffusion

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.110 
has the diffuser on top the diffusion
material<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.460> little<00:02:26.700> thing<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
material is just a little thing like a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.510 
material is just a little thing like a
shower<00:02:27.450> cap<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.290> pops<00:02:28.650> right<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> front

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
shower cap that pops right on the front

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.320 
shower cap that pops right on the front
and<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:31.140> works<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.130> light<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.940> soften

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
and this works with the light to soften

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.800 
and this works with the light to soften
it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.770 
it
now<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.680> other<00:02:34.980> lamp<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.820> I'm<00:02:36.000> showing<00:02:36.480> here

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
now the other lamp that I'm showing here

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.250 
now the other lamp that I'm showing here
is<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:38.490> background<00:02:39.390> light<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.960> called<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
is a background light this is called a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.770 
is a background light this is called a
boom<00:02:40.500> light<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.490> see<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.880> attaches<00:02:42.630> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
boom light you can see this attaches to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.380 
boom light you can see this attaches to
the<00:02:42.870> table<00:02:43.200> or<00:02:43.290> maybe<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> can't<00:02:43.830> see<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.130> from

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
the table or maybe you can't see it from

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.940 
the table or maybe you can't see it from
from<00:02:45.390> where<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.080> attaches<00:02:46.770> to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
from where you are but this attaches to

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.120 
from where you are but this attaches to
the<00:02:47.040> table<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:48.780> hangs<00:02:49.410> over<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the table and it hangs over the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.160 
the table and it hangs over the
background<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.850> shines<00:02:51.450> onto<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
background and shines onto the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.300 
background and shines onto the
background<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.730> going<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> light<00:02:55.310> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
background and it's going to light the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.340 
background and it's going to light the
background<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.090> also<00:02:57.480> may<00:02:57.810> give<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:57.990> nice

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
background and also may give a nice

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.870 
background and also may give a nice
little<00:02:58.500> rim<00:02:58.890> light<00:02:59.100> around<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> sculpture<00:03:00.320> so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
little rim light around the sculpture so

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.850 
little rim light around the sculpture so
these<00:03:02.880> are<00:03:03.150> our<00:03:03.180> components<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.680> we're

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
these are our components that we're

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.530 
these are our components that we're
going<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.070> be<00:03:05.190> using<00:03:05.430> as<00:03:05.730> far<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.060> our<00:03:06.180> lighting

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
going to be using as far as our lighting

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.330 
going to be using as far as our lighting
the<00:03:07.050> only<00:03:07.350> other<00:03:07.530> thing<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:07.830> we're<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.280> to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the only other thing that we're going to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.250 
the only other thing that we're going to
have<00:03:08.550> well<00:03:09.209> as<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.360> couple<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.780> only<00:03:10.080> other

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
have well as a couple of only other

have well as a couple of only other
things<00:03:10.620> one<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.840> we're<00:03:12.840> going<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.050> be<00:03:13.140> using

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
things one is we're going to be using

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.820 
things one is we're going to be using
some<00:03:14.100> reflector<00:03:14.640> cards<00:03:15.300> now<00:03:16.110> these<00:03:16.260> cards<00:03:16.620> are

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
some reflector cards now these cards are

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.220 
some reflector cards now these cards are
nothing<00:03:17.160> more<00:03:17.340> than<00:03:17.550> this<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.360> like<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.570> white

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
nothing more than this is like a white

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.130 
nothing more than this is like a white
cardboard<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:20.700> I'm<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.300> be<00:03:21.450> placing

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
cardboard that I'm going to be placing

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.650 
cardboard that I'm going to be placing
in<00:03:22.320> here<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:23.340> fill<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.910> some<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.420> shadows

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
in here to fill in some of the shadows

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.020 
in here to fill in some of the shadows
that<00:03:25.350> are<00:03:25.470> going<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.860> showing<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.850> this

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that are going to be showing up on this

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.729 
that are going to be showing up on this
side<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.540> sculpture<00:03:27.840> since<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> light<00:03:28.560> is

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
side of the sculpture since the light is

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.860 
side of the sculpture since the light is
coming<00:03:28.890> from<00:03:29.160> over<00:03:29.489> here<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.880> I'm<00:03:30.360> only<00:03:30.630> going

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
coming from over here and I'm only going

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.040 
coming from over here and I'm only going
to<00:03:30.930> be<00:03:30.989> using<00:03:31.320> one<00:03:32.040> light<00:03:32.340> or<00:03:32.810> possibly<00:03:33.810> two

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
to be using one light or possibly two

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.420 
to be using one light or possibly two
lights<00:03:34.320> if<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.650> choose<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.070> light<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
lights if I choose to light the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.090 
lights if I choose to light the
background<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.810> we're<00:03:37.709> going<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:37.980> be

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
background so that we're going to be

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.930 
background so that we're going to be
using<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.480> even<00:03:39.720> out<00:03:39.840> our<00:03:39.989> lighting

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
using this to to even out our lighting

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.610 
using this to to even out our lighting
if<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.150> isn't<00:03:42.510> strong<00:03:42.750> enough<00:03:43.019> we<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.440> use

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
if this isn't strong enough we can use

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.300 
if this isn't strong enough we can use
one<00:03:44.630> that's<00:03:45.630> like<00:03:46.260> crumpled<00:03:46.709> up<00:03:46.800> aluminum

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
one that's like crumpled up aluminum

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.570 
one that's like crumpled up aluminum
foil<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.290> look<00:03:49.290> at<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:50.220> gives<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.550> the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
foil and look at that that gives it the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.360 
foil and look at that that gives it the
stronger<00:03:51.150> light<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> sometimes<00:03:52.560> if<00:03:52.830> we<00:03:53.100> want

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
stronger light and sometimes if we want

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.970 
stronger light and sometimes if we want
to<00:03:53.430> actually<00:03:53.970> introduce<00:03:54.600> shadows<00:03:55.320> into<00:03:55.620> the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
to actually introduce shadows into the

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.400 
to actually introduce shadows into the
side<00:03:56.280> we<00:03:56.850> can<00:03:57.030> use<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.420> black<00:03:57.780> piece<00:03:58.050> of<00:03:58.080> paper

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
side we can use a black piece of paper

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.530 
side we can use a black piece of paper
now<00:03:59.600> let's<00:04:00.600> walk<00:04:01.260> around<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.739> front<00:04:02.040> here

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
now let's walk around to the front here

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.240 
now let's walk around to the front here
let's<00:04:03.540> start<00:04:03.870> by<00:04:04.140> turning<00:04:04.200> on<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> background

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
let's start by turning on a background

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.020 
let's start by turning on a background
light<00:04:05.489> just<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:06.920> like<00:04:07.920> set<00:04:08.280> up<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.610> little<00:04:08.820> bit

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
light just to like set up a little bit

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.030 
light just to like set up a little bit
and<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.080> see<00:04:10.320> here<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.680> there's<00:04:10.980> a

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
and you can see here that there's a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.059 
and you can see here that there's a
little<00:04:11.280> light<00:04:11.580> coming<00:04:12.030> around<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
little light coming around the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.649 
little light coming around the
most<00:04:14.069> of<00:04:14.219> the<00:04:14.280> light<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.150> background

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
most of the light is on the background

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.460 
most of the light is on the background
now<00:04:16.430> when<00:04:17.430> we<00:04:17.579> work<00:04:18.539> with<00:04:18.750> our<00:04:18.780> final<00:04:19.289> image

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
now when we work with our final image

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.710 
now when we work with our final image
all<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:20.190> area<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:20.789> going<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.060> be<00:04:21.209> knocked<00:04:21.509> out

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
all this area is going to be knocked out

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.170 
all this area is going to be knocked out
it's<00:04:22.289> going<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.560> be<00:04:22.680> eliminated<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:23.430> we<00:04:23.910> really

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
it's going to be eliminated so we really

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.689 
it's going to be eliminated so we really
don't<00:04:24.360> need<00:04:24.509> to<00:04:24.570> worry<00:04:24.720> about<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:26.430> way<00:04:26.550> the

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
don't need to worry about the way the

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.510 
don't need to worry about the way the
light<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:26.910> falling<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.600> that<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.860> mic<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.400> we

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
light is falling on that the mic that we

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.550 
light is falling on that the mic that we
do<00:04:29.759> need<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.120> worry<00:04:30.330> about<00:04:30.419> is<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.080> main<00:04:31.320> light

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
do need to worry about is the main light

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.680 
do need to worry about is the main light
the<00:04:31.740> light<00:04:31.919> that's<00:04:32.100> coming<00:04:32.250> in<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:32.970> light<00:04:33.419> our

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
the light that's coming in to light our

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.120 
the light that's coming in to light our
object<00:04:34.259> and<00:04:34.820> what<00:04:35.820> we're<00:04:36.000> going<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.150> do<00:04:36.449> is

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
object and what we're going to do is

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.100 
object and what we're going to do is
first<00:04:38.130> I'm<00:04:38.400> going<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.580> look<00:04:38.669> at<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.240> light<00:04:39.750> that

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
first I'm going to look at a light that

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.790 
first I'm going to look at a light that
is<00:04:40.340> done<00:04:41.340> without<00:04:41.789> the<00:04:42.449> diffuser<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:43.620> is

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
is done without the diffuser this is

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.249 
is done without the diffuser this is
just<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.160> bare<00:04:44.370> tube<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.360> can<00:04:45.509> see<00:04:45.810> that

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
just the bare tube and you can see that

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.350 
just the bare tube and you can see that
I've<00:04:46.470> got<00:04:46.500> some<00:04:46.680> pretty<00:04:47.009> sharp<00:04:47.130> shadows<00:04:47.910> going

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
I've got some pretty sharp shadows going

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.650 
I've got some pretty sharp shadows going
on<00:04:48.660> here<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.380> what<00:04:50.130> we<00:04:50.370> can<00:04:50.580> do<00:04:50.789> is<00:04:51.060> we<00:04:51.509> can

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
on here and what we can do is we can

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.390 
on here and what we can do is we can
change<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.800> way<00:04:53.539> this<00:04:54.539> object<00:04:54.810> is<00:04:55.289> lit<00:04:55.590> just

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
change the way this object is lit just

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.839 
change the way this object is lit just
by<00:04:56.669> how<00:04:57.000> we<00:04:57.479> move<00:04:57.720> our<00:04:57.930> lamp<00:04:58.229> around<00:04:58.919> so<00:04:59.639> we're

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
by how we move our lamp around so we're

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.850 
by how we move our lamp around so we're
going<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.060> move<00:05:00.240> this<00:05:00.449> to<00:05:00.690> where<00:05:00.930> we'd<00:05:01.470> like<00:05:01.680> to

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
going to move this to where we'd like to

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.640 
going to move this to where we'd like to
see<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.940> looks<00:05:03.150> pretty<00:05:03.240> good<00:05:03.650> now

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
see it and that looks pretty good now

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.520 
see it and that looks pretty good now
what<00:05:05.340> I'm<00:05:05.490> going<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:05.820> do<00:05:06.030> is<00:05:06.360> I'm<00:05:07.320> going<00:05:07.470> to

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.800 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come<00:05:07.710> over<00:05:07.740> here<00:05:08.009> and<00:05:08.580> I'm<00:05:09.120> going<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.360> use<00:05:09.509> one

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
come over here and I'm going to use one

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.810 
come over here and I'm going to use one
of<00:05:09.840> those<00:05:10.020> reflectors<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.949> fill<00:05:11.759> in<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:13.820> side

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
of those reflectors to fill in the side

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.930 
of those reflectors to fill in the side
and<00:05:15.349> by<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:16.410> way<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.889> stand<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.340> reflector<00:05:17.820> up

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
and by the way to stand the reflector up

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.339 
and by the way to stand the reflector up
I'm<00:05:18.150> just<00:05:18.240> going<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.570> use<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.750> bottle<00:05:18.990> of<00:05:19.169> water

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
I'm just going to use a bottle of water

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.300 
I'm just going to use a bottle of water
here<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.220> again<00:05:21.210> if<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.870> reflector<00:05:22.440> is<00:05:22.620> in

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
here and again if the reflector is in

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.300 
here and again if the reflector is in
the<00:05:23.610> shot<00:05:23.990> that's<00:05:24.990> okay<00:05:25.590> because<00:05:26.010> we're<00:05:26.220> going

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
the shot that's okay because we're going

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.640 
the shot that's okay because we're going
to<00:05:26.370> be<00:05:26.520> taking<00:05:26.880> care<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:27.120> this<00:05:27.389> once<00:05:28.050> we<00:05:28.289> get<00:05:28.530> it

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
to be taking care of this once we get it

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.980 
to be taking care of this once we get it
into<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.250> computer<00:05:29.880> now<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:30.330> can<00:05:30.599> see<00:05:30.810> here

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
into the computer now you can see here

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.589 
into the computer now you can see here
by<00:05:31.169> putting<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.500> reflector<00:05:32.070> in<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.180> have

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
by putting the reflector in that I have

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.790 
by putting the reflector in that I have
lightened<00:05:34.139> up<00:05:34.289> this<00:05:35.220> side<00:05:35.580> over<00:05:35.789> here<00:05:36.620> so<00:05:37.620> that

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
lightened up this side over here so that

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.860 
lightened up this side over here so that
we're<00:05:38.190> actually<00:05:38.400> working<00:05:38.760> with<00:05:39.389> one<00:05:39.599> lamp

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
we're actually working with one lamp

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.439 
we're actually working with one lamp
here<00:05:40.169> now<00:05:40.680> remember<00:05:41.280> I<00:05:41.490> told<00:05:41.610> you<00:05:41.909> this<00:05:42.210> is<00:05:42.419> the

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
here now remember I told you this is the

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.870 
here now remember I told you this is the
bulb<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:43.259> does<00:05:43.470> not<00:05:43.710> have<00:05:44.009> the<00:05:44.280> diffusion<00:05:44.669> on

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
bulb that does not have the diffusion on

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.510 
bulb that does not have the diffusion on
it<00:05:45.000> let's<00:05:45.599> take<00:05:45.810> a<00:05:45.870> look<00:05:46.199> here<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:46.830> see<00:05:47.310> what

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
it let's take a look here and see what

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.140 
it let's take a look here and see what
happens<00:05:48.000> when<00:05:48.930> we<00:05:49.440> use<00:05:49.669> something<00:05:50.669> with<00:05:51.000> the

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
happens when we use something with the

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.290 
happens when we use something with the
diffusion<00:05:51.690> you<00:05:52.650> can<00:05:52.830> see<00:05:53.039> now<00:05:53.250> that<00:05:53.580> the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
diffusion you can see now that the

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.200 
diffusion you can see now that the
shadows<00:05:54.750> are<00:05:54.780> much<00:05:55.590> softer<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.340> we<00:05:57.000> have<00:05:57.180> a

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
shadows are much softer and we have a

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.020 
shadows are much softer and we have a
much<00:05:57.479> more<00:05:57.509> even<00:05:58.320> flow<00:05:58.620> it's<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.400> much<00:05:59.610> lower

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
much more even flow it's a much lower

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.529 
much more even flow it's a much lower
contrast<00:06:00.750> image<00:06:01.139> so<00:06:02.120> there's<00:06:03.120> our<00:06:03.860> shot<00:06:04.860> and

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
contrast image so there's our shot and

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.029 
contrast image so there's our shot and
you<00:06:06.539> can<00:06:06.570> see<00:06:06.930> that<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.229> light<00:06:07.409> is<00:06:07.440> coming<00:06:07.650> in

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
you can see that the light is coming in

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.279 
you can see that the light is coming in
from<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.699> side<00:06:09.000> maybe<00:06:09.360> a<00:06:09.479> little<00:06:09.900> bit<00:06:10.050> from

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
from the side maybe a little bit from

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.930 
from the side maybe a little bit from
the<00:06:10.409> front<00:06:10.680> now<00:06:11.930> if<00:06:12.930> I<00:06:13.139> wanted<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.590> have<00:06:13.940> the

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
the front now if I wanted to have the

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.439 
the front now if I wanted to have the
darker<00:06:15.419> side<00:06:15.690> lit<00:06:16.169> up<00:06:16.320> even<00:06:16.740> more<00:06:17.210> then<00:06:18.210> what<00:06:18.419> I

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
darker side lit up even more then what I

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.029 
darker side lit up even more then what I
can<00:06:18.570> do<00:06:18.810> is<00:06:18.960> I<00:06:19.080> can<00:06:19.139> put<00:06:19.289> this<00:06:19.620> silver

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
can do is I can put this silver

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.269 
can do is I can put this silver
reflector<00:06:20.610> in<00:06:20.759> and<00:06:20.969> you<00:06:21.450> can<00:06:21.599> see<00:06:21.840> that<00:06:22.020> that

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:22.279 
reflector in and you can see that that

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:23.469 
reflector in and you can see that that
puts

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
puts

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.469 
puts
some<00:06:24.439> nice<00:06:24.590> bright<00:06:24.889> highlights<00:06:25.520> on<00:06:25.789> the

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
some nice bright highlights on the

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.439 
some nice bright highlights on the
shoulders<00:06:26.930> here<00:06:27.169> and<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:28.550> might<00:06:28.789> be<00:06:28.939> even<00:06:29.240> a

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
shoulders here and that might be even a

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.610 
shoulders here and that might be even a
little<00:06:29.479> bit<00:06:29.840> too<00:06:30.050> much<00:06:30.610> again<00:06:31.779> if<00:06:32.779> I<00:06:33.020> wanted<00:06:33.469> to

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
little bit too much again if I wanted to

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.369 
little bit too much again if I wanted to
put<00:06:33.860> this<00:06:34.309> side<00:06:34.610> of<00:06:34.849> the<00:06:34.969> image<00:06:35.120> in<00:06:35.960> dark

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:36.379 
put this side of the image in dark

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.769 
put this side of the image in dark
shadow<00:06:36.740> then<00:06:37.520> what<00:06:37.759> I<00:06:37.789> would<00:06:38.029> do<00:06:38.210> is<00:06:38.419> just

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:38.779 
shadow then what I would do is just

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.649 
shadow then what I would do is just
bring<00:06:39.020> this<00:06:39.309> dark<00:06:40.309> Guardian<00:06:40.610> and<00:06:40.999> that<00:06:41.479> would

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
bring this dark Guardian and that would

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:42.519 
bring this dark Guardian and that would
take<00:06:41.839> care<00:06:42.110> of<00:06:42.169> it

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:42.529 
take care of it

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:45.489 
take care of it
now<00:06:43.189> one<00:06:44.029> of<00:06:44.120> the<00:06:44.210> things<00:06:44.419> you<00:06:44.599> may<00:06:44.779> be

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:45.499 
now one of the things you may be

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:47.619 
now one of the things you may be
thinking<00:06:45.889> why<00:06:46.490> would<00:06:46.520> I<00:06:46.729> want<00:06:46.969> to<00:06:47.120> shoot<00:06:47.360> a

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629 
thinking why would I want to shoot a

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.549 
thinking why would I want to shoot a
green<00:06:48.999> piece<00:06:49.999> of<00:06:50.029> sculpture<00:06:50.689> on<00:06:50.870> a<00:06:50.930> green

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:51.559 
green piece of sculpture on a green

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.159 
green piece of sculpture on a green
background<00:06:51.889> well<00:06:52.879> it<00:06:53.150> turns<00:06:53.509> out<00:06:53.749> that<00:06:53.960> these

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
background well it turns out that these

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.709 
background well it turns out that these
greens<00:06:54.620> are<00:06:54.979> far<00:06:55.669> enough<00:06:55.789> apart<00:06:56.060> and<00:06:56.479> this<00:06:56.569> is

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:56.719 
greens are far enough apart and this is

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.399 
greens are far enough apart and this is
a<00:06:56.749> very<00:06:56.960> special<00:06:57.289> green<00:06:57.830> that<00:06:58.759> is<00:06:59.089> used<00:06:59.479> so

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:00.409 
a very special green that is used so

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.860 
a very special green that is used so
that<00:07:00.680> it<00:07:00.949> can<00:07:01.339> be<00:07:01.520> isolated<00:07:02.120> and<00:07:02.270> it<00:07:02.479> can<00:07:02.719> be

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
that it can be isolated and it can be

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.350 
that it can be isolated and it can be
dropped<00:07:03.169> out<00:07:03.379> we'll<00:07:04.129> get<00:07:04.249> into<00:07:04.400> this<00:07:04.669> a<00:07:04.939> lot

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
dropped out we'll get into this a lot

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.860 
dropped out we'll get into this a lot
more<00:07:05.689> when<00:07:06.229> we<00:07:06.409> start<00:07:06.710> working<00:07:06.919> with<00:07:07.870> actually

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
more when we start working with actually

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.989 
more when we start working with actually
photographing<00:07:09.349> our<00:07:09.620> image<00:07:09.919> now<00:07:10.550> there's<00:07:10.789> one

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:10.999 
photographing our image now there's one

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.939 
photographing our image now there's one
thing<00:07:11.210> that<00:07:11.629> I<00:07:11.659> didn't<00:07:12.110> tell<00:07:12.289> you<00:07:12.469> that<00:07:12.650> you

need that you do need you really have to

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.439 
need that you do need you really have to
put<00:07:16.729> your<00:07:16.909> camera<00:07:17.120> on<00:07:17.419> a<00:07:17.539> tripod<00:07:18.349> or<00:07:18.979> a<00:07:19.759> monopod

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:20.449 
put your camera on a tripod or a monopod

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.429 
put your camera on a tripod or a monopod
that's<00:07:21.020> attached<00:07:21.409> to<00:07:21.529> the<00:07:21.680> table<00:07:22.870> anything<00:07:23.870> to

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:24.439

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
hold the camera steady because some of

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.040 
hold the camera steady because some of
your<00:07:26.449> exposures<00:07:27.430> may<00:07:28.430> be<00:07:28.490> fairly<00:07:28.939> long<00:07:29.270> and<00:07:29.539> if

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
your exposures may be fairly long and if

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.589 
your exposures may be fairly long and if
you<00:07:30.199> want<00:07:30.560> your<00:07:30.710> image<00:07:31.009> sharp<00:07:31.419> you're<00:07:32.419> going

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 
you want your image sharp you're going

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.719 
you want your image sharp you're going
to<00:07:32.659> need<00:07:32.810> to<00:07:32.960> have<00:07:33.139> it<00:07:33.289> on<00:07:33.439> a<00:07:33.710> sturdy<00:07:34.159> support

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:34.729 
to need to have it on a sturdy support

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:37.779 
to need to have it on a sturdy support
so<00:07:35.569> let's<00:07:36.349> just<00:07:36.589> take<00:07:36.770> one<00:07:36.800> other<00:07:37.129> look<00:07:37.430> here

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:37.789 
so let's just take one other look here

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:39.429 
so let's just take one other look here
and<00:07:38.060> then<00:07:38.389> we<00:07:38.569> can<00:07:38.749> go<00:07:38.870> on<00:07:39.020> to<00:07:39.199> the<00:07:39.229> other

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:39.439 
and then we can go on to the other

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.739 
and then we can go on to the other
tutorials<00:07:40.069> let's<00:07:40.759> turn<00:07:41.120> the<00:07:41.300> background

00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:41.749 
tutorials let's turn the background

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:43.899 
tutorials let's turn the background
light<00:07:41.990> off<00:07:42.259> and<00:07:42.469> you<00:07:42.949> can<00:07:43.099> see<00:07:43.129> what<00:07:43.520> happens

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:43.909 
light off and you can see what happens

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:47.860 
light off and you can see what happens
here<00:07:44.240> that<00:07:45.399> the<00:07:46.399> difference<00:07:47.060> is<00:07:47.209> in<00:07:47.389> that

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:47.870 
here that the difference is in that

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.869 
here that the difference is in that
lighting<00:07:48.319> now<00:07:48.499> the<00:07:48.560> background<00:07:49.189> light<00:07:49.699> is<00:07:49.849> a

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 
lighting now the background light is a

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:52.329 
lighting now the background light is a
little<00:07:50.180> bit<00:07:50.330> darker<00:07:50.749> and<00:07:50.930> maybe<00:07:51.800> we<00:07:52.039> want<00:07:52.219> to

00:07:52.329 --> 00:07:52.339 
little bit darker and maybe we want to

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:55.029 
little bit darker and maybe we want to
turn<00:07:52.580> the<00:07:52.819> lamp<00:07:53.509> here<00:07:53.779> a<00:07:53.810> little<00:07:54.050> bit<00:07:54.319> just<00:07:54.860> to

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 
turn the lamp here a little bit just to

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:56.889 
turn the lamp here a little bit just to
get<00:07:55.279> some<00:07:55.339> more<00:07:55.639> light<00:07:55.849> into<00:07:56.300> the<00:07:56.419> background

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:56.899 
get some more light into the background

00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:59.559 
get some more light into the background
and<00:07:57.110> we<00:07:57.680> can<00:07:57.860> vary<00:07:58.129> this<00:07:58.370> as<00:07:58.610> we<00:07:58.969> need<00:07:59.149> to<00:07:59.180> do<00:07:59.419> it

00:07:59.559 --> 00:07:59.569 
and we can vary this as we need to do it

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:02.529 
and we can vary this as we need to do it
when<00:08:00.110> we<00:08:00.289> shoot
