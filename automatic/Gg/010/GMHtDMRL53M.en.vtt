 holy faith to execute the first round 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.779

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.780
 defenders of the chaco the olympic club 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.700
 known as the dean saw in his new 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 president marcelo recanate a 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.330
 millionaire investment after many 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.189
 years bringing new players to the club and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.500
 repatriating some key figures in the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.590
 consecration of 2002 such as July 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.970
 César Cáceres and Sergio Ortemán the club 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.160
 I would end up in the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.599
 2011 runner-up and fresh 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.550
 in the closing tournament of the same year 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 they would get championship after eleven years of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.210
 wait at the opening 2012 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.559
 olimpia battery his own record of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.899
 seven matches won in form 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.809
 consecutive in a registration championship 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.520
 that did not break since 1959 said 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.170
 historic streak extended to nine 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.280
 victories under the framework of the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.230
 competition 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.969
 It would also complete a total of 21 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.000
 official matches followed without losing 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.260
 of course adding the closing of 2011 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 a streak that did not quite reach 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 time the dean would stay again 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.170
 in the el with the runner-up in this 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.670
 tournament managing to be between the two 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.600
 best of each championship in three 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.400
 consecutive occasions 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.890
 the olympic time lapse would classify 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.240
 to the South American Cups 2011-2012 and 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.310
 I would have presence in the cup 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.500
 liberators 2012 to where he returned after 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.030
 nine years of absence in the cup 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.740
 liberators 2003 the dean of soccer 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.600
 Paraguayan would make a 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.670
 extraordinary campaign with a staff 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.590
 very short and under the baton of the great ever 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.539
 hugo almeida taking the club to its 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.789
 seventh cup semifinal in history 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.770
 his performance outside of Paraguay has been 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.390
 as forceful as his next one 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.250
 rival although in his last five 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.289
 matches the Paraguayan team has won 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.670
 one tied three and lost one in what 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.039
 which are league and cup competitions 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.450
 liberators will depend strongly on the 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.560
 performance of his two goalscorers 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.270
 present tournament 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.610
 fredy bareiro and juan salgueiro los 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.590
 which have five goals each for 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.240
 this reason is important to have them in the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.250
 look for this game that is 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.020
 will be done in a few weeks as a 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.780
 injury can change the balance in favor 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.000
 of the Colombian team on the 27th of 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.009
 January 2013 the capital club team 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.690
 independent santafe would be crowned 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.909
 champion for the first time in its history 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.490
 when faced in the classic against his 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.929
 eternal playground rival millionaires in the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.820
 first encounter the capital team 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.030
 independent club santafé would win the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.830
 match two goals 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.810
 the second party the cardinal team 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.870
 would win 1 by 0 with a global score 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.760
 from 3 goals to 1 crowned champion of the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.890
 superliga of colombia 2013 before his 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.140
 swollen and thus achieving classification 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.080
 together with Buenos Aires brain teams and in 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.610
 freedom to the liberators cup 2013 the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.050
 independent santa colombian faith 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.120
 qualified for the semifinal of the 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.040
 liberators after 52 years without 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.959
 do it by imposing on the real 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.610
 garcilaso in the return meeting of the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.709
 Wednesday with so many of jefferson leather 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.660
 and jhon valencia that accumulates a 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.209
 impressive overall result of 5 to 1 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.830
 and is that the well-known cardinals of 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.870
 Colombian soccer have had a step 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.519
 constant by the liberators achieving 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.110
 the second place in your group just one 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.330
 point below the mighty athletic 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.940
 mineiro and beating the whole of the 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.500
 Guild House in the second round the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.090
 bookmaker has the share of the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.200
 Paraguayan team in two or more 100 in 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.819
 American line the draw at 3.25 225 and 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.000
 the independent quota santa faith is 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.890
 find in 3.40 or more 240 the holy faith 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.450
 he is very strong playing visiting but at 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.100
 same time is olympia of paraguay 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.630
 for that reason a very close match will be seen 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.280
 where the locality the Paraguayan set 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.380
 will set the pattern that places them as 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.210
 favorites 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.560
 but depending on the possible 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.270
 low that we can see the day of 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.860
 I find the possibility of a tie 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.230
 draws attention given the history of 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.280
 both teams in the liberators cup 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.750
 but we believe that a safe bet 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.370
 can make at least two and a half 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.360
 goals with a fee of 1.75 or less 133 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.670

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.050
