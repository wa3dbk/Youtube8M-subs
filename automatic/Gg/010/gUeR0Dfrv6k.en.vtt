 astronaut nasa steven swanson soon 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.390
 however America can lose 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.109
 the ability to send on their own 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.160
 after folding the us shuttle program 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.150
 there are only two delivery methods left

 but again on Russian engines and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.329
 their supply within 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 retaliatory sanctions may end 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.940
 In addition, Russia may go out

 Our colleague Alexander Khristenko usa 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.829
 seems to have imposed sanctions on themselves

 The spy took place just a month ago and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.250
 this configuration may be the last 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.820
 in the story now we will start from 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.799
 without guaranteeing that our 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.189
 engines are used exclusively eat 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.409
 only 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.420
 in order to introduce civilian we 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.970
 we can continue to lay the supply works 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.700

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.750
 the United States put at risk the Russian

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.329
 which get all the contracts for 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 their space companies are now in 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.590
 connection with the response decision of Moscow under 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 threatened launch and in the us in american 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.810

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.509
 united lounge alliance hope that 12 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.520
 will be able to produce effective negotiations 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.680
 over the coming months and allow 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.329
 the issues that have arisen between the alliance and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.640
 US Department of Defense have a plan 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.860
 emergency response 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.619

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.000

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.549
 future stock according to the company 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.830
 enough for two years but can it 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.720
 use because in Moscow said that 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.940
 military launches will stop and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.519
 sales service already delivered 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.379
 Motors unexpectedly streamlined peacefully 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.670
 commented on in the State Department and 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.440
 other plans of Russia 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.230
 collapse work on international 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.000
 space station after 2020 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.310
 and the whole site we have a very long time 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.110
 We cooperate with the Russian space and I 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.879
 I hope so will continue to us 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.010
 still continue to operation on 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.209
 a number of issues the fact is that 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.920
 big plans at least up to us 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.560
 2024 on deep space exploration 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.720
 preparation of the first expedition to the asteroid 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.410
 and prospective manned flight 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.900
 to mars 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.870
 In the meantime, even until microseconds without Russia 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.090
 you will reach Russia now 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.409
 provides delivery of all astronauts and 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.390
 astronauts on microsecond 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.980
 but she cannot manage alone 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.079
 stations as well as us 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.299
 there is a very strong dependence on each 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.980
 friend turned out that there is a dependency and 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.540

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.849
 11 out of 150 and ground stations are located 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.099
 in Russia to increase 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.349
 accuracy of the signal when it comes to 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.000
 placing exactly the same stations only 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.489
 for the Russian system glonass on 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.190
 territory of the usa moscow essentially got 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.109
 denial of Congress resented why should we 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.970
 encourage competitor yes and the pentagon 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.310
 opposed saying it is a threat 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.349
 there was no national security 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.370
 no progress in negotiations on 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.010
 placement 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.199
 similar to embarrassment and procedure 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.540
 GLONASS find tourists states until May 31st 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.560
 we have time 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.780
 on the resolution of this issue from June 1, we 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.790
 suspend operation of the plant tag gps 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.680
 on the territory of the Russian Federation with 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.420
 such a new bargaining position 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.969
 another round will begin 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.709
 discussions if finding a common language is not 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.689
