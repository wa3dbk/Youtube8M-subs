quite a bit with this weapon so you'll

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.819 
quite a bit with this weapon so you'll

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
way to get that extra reload time

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.180

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.399 
you hit them with your explosion it's a
lot<00:01:23.909> easier<00:01:23.939> than<00:01:24.299> trying<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> trace<00:01:24.990> somebody

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
but I can definitely see the strengths

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.920 
but I can definitely see the strengths
of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> SMG<00:01:32.549> moving<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> secondaries

quite<00:01:42.119> efficiently<00:01:42.570> also<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> only<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.070> this

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
quite efficiently also the only way this

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
quite efficiently also the only way this
thing<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.400> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> damage<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.659> are

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
thing is going to damage is if you are

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
thing is going to damage is if you are
hitting<00:01:46.020> somebody<00:01:46.290> else's<00:01:46.710> base<00:01:46.920> assets<00:01:47.369> it's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
hitting somebody else's base assets it's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
hitting somebody else's base assets it's
not<00:01:48.150> super<00:01:48.450> viable<00:01:48.810> especially<00:01:49.229> seeing<00:01:49.439> as

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
not super viable especially seeing as

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.690 
not super viable especially seeing as
you<00:01:49.650> have<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> asset<00:01:50.460> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you have to make it to the asset in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
you have to make it to the asset in
order<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.390> you're<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.140> hidden<00:01:52.350> by<00:01:52.590> any

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
order to do it you're not hidden by any

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.640 
order to do it you're not hidden by any
means<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.810> generally<00:01:54.810> other<00:01:55.110> things<00:01:55.500> are

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
means and generally other things are

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.840 
means and generally other things are
going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.040> much<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.579> more

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
going to do it much much more

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.630 
going to do it much much more
effectively<00:01:57.329> spin<00:01:58.049> fusers<00:01:58.560> even<00:01:59.520> your

effectively spin fusers even your

effectively spin fusers even your
thumper<00:02:00.030> probably<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.540> better<00:02:00.659> route<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> go

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
thumper probably a better route to go

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.389

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
your flag is only going to leave with

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.730 
your flag is only going to leave with
very<00:03:15.810> little<00:03:15.960> energy<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.590> going<00:03:16.680> to

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
very little energy and it's going to

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.440 
very little energy and it's going to
make<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> job<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.250> your<00:03:17.370> chasers<00:03:17.820> much<00:03:18.030> easier

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
make the job of your chasers much easier

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.000 
make the job of your chasers much easier
you<00:03:19.020> can<00:03:19.110> stick<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.440> at<00:03:19.530> any<00:03:19.650> one<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:19.860> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
you can stick it at any one of the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.070 
you can stick it at any one of the
entrances<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.459> your<00:03:20.640> base<00:03:20.870> alerting<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.959> when

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
entrances to your base alerting you when

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.300 
entrances to your base alerting you when
the<00:03:22.170> enemy<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.500> coming<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.040> where<00:03:23.190> they're

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
the enemy is coming and where they're

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.100 
the enemy is coming and where they're
going<00:03:23.610> if<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.330> stick<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.630> in<00:03:24.720> front<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:24.959> one<00:03:25.080> of

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
going if you stick it in front of one of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.160 
going if you stick it in front of one of
your<00:03:25.260> turrets<00:03:25.620> then<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.580> going<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:27.020> zap<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
your turrets then it's going to zap the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.870 
your turrets then it's going to zap the
energy<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.620> anybody<00:03:29.040> who<00:03:29.220> might<00:03:29.400> try<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.730> run

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
energy of anybody who might try and run

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.729 
energy of anybody who might try and run
away<00:03:30.000> from<00:03:30.540> your<00:03:30.720> turret<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.140> most

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
away from your turret and most

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.170 
away from your turret and most
importantly<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.400> going<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.670> make<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> job

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
importantly it's going to make the job

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.270 
importantly it's going to make the job
of<00:03:33.209> infiltrators<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.440> much<00:03:34.680> more<00:03:34.980> difficult

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
of infiltrators so much more difficult

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.550 
of infiltrators so much more difficult
they<00:03:36.209> run<00:03:36.390> over<00:03:36.600> one<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.840> these<00:03:36.870> they<00:03:37.260> become

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
they run over one of these they become

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.530 
they run over one of these they become
visible<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.250> if<00:03:38.670> they're<00:03:39.030> within<00:03:39.209> sight<00:03:39.510> of

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
visible and if they're within sight of

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.729 
visible and if they're within sight of
one<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.810> your<00:03:39.900> turrets<00:03:40.260> they<00:03:40.380> start<00:03:40.620> taking

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
one of your turrets they start taking

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.340 
one of your turrets they start taking
damage<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.459> they<00:03:41.520> can<00:03:41.730> tree<00:03:41.910> stealth<00:03:42.330> on<00:03:43.110> top

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
damage and they can tree stealth on top

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.470 
damage and they can tree stealth on top
of<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.620> its<00:03:43.769> absolute<00:03:44.130> energy<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:45.150> if<00:03:45.330> they

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
of that its absolute energy so if they

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.020 
of that its absolute energy so if they
can<00:03:45.780> hide<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.380> pop<00:03:47.040> back<00:03:47.250> into<00:03:47.459> stuff<00:03:47.760> they

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
can hide and pop back into stuff they

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.250 
can hide and pop back into stuff they
don't<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.360> nearly<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.690> pool<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:48.989> they

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
don't have nearly the pool that they

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.320 
don't have nearly the pool that they
used<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:50.040> makes<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.640> our<00:03:50.820> job<00:03:51.090> of

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
used to have it makes that our job of

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330 
used to have it makes that our job of
infiltrating<00:03:51.989> much<00:03:52.590> much<00:03:52.890> more<00:03:53.100> difficult

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
infiltrating much much more difficult

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.280 
infiltrating much much more difficult
just<00:03:54.150> by<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.390> use<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.630> one<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.930> these<00:03:55.110> little

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
just by the use of one of these little

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.860 
just by the use of one of these little
guys<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.800> then<00:03:56.610> we<00:03:56.700> have<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.940> packs<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.570> only

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
guys and then we have the packs the only

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.660 
guys and then we have the packs the only
one<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.170> course<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.739> light<00:03:58.920> turret<00:03:59.220> which

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
one of course is the light turret which

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.100 
one of course is the light turret which
is<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> technicians<00:04:00.510> bread<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.810> butter<00:04:00.959> this

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
is the technicians bread and butter this

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.090 
is the technicians bread and butter this
is<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.410> reason<00:04:01.680> why<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:01.830> play<00:04:02.070> the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
is the reason why you play the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.670 
is the reason why you play the
technician<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:03.570> excels<00:04:04.170> really<00:04:04.500> really

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
technician it excels really really

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.350 
technician it excels really really
greatly<00:04:04.890> at<00:04:05.100> defense<00:04:05.489> as<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:06.090> might<00:04:06.239> expect

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
greatly at defense as you might expect

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.780 
greatly at defense as you might expect
second<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.350> near<00:04:07.680> your<00:04:07.769> flag<00:04:08.010> or<00:04:08.250> maybe<00:04:08.640> in

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
second it near your flag or maybe in

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.660 
second it near your flag or maybe in
your<00:04:08.880> generator<00:04:09.209> room<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:10.140> great<00:04:10.350> choice

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
your generator room is a great choice

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.620 
your generator room is a great choice
stinking<00:04:11.670> motion<00:04:11.970> sensors<00:04:12.269> around<00:04:12.390> it

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
stinking motion sensors around it

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.090 
stinking motion sensors around it
increases<00:04:12.989> its<00:04:13.140> lethality<00:04:13.440> especially

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
increases its lethality especially

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.000 
increases its lethality especially
against<00:04:14.280> infiltrators<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.600> does<00:04:15.750> about

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
against infiltrators and it does about

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.890 
against infiltrators and it does about
65<00:04:17.010> damage<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.640> shoots<00:04:17.820> quite<00:04:18.060> quickly<00:04:18.299> has<00:04:18.870> a

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
65 damage and shoots quite quickly has a

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.930 
65 damage and shoots quite quickly has a
decent<00:04:19.140> range<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.799> personally<00:04:20.340> would<00:04:20.640> like<00:04:20.820> it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
decent range I personally would like it

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.130 
decent range I personally would like it
to<00:04:21.030> be<00:04:21.150> just<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.390> little<00:04:21.419> bit<00:04:21.630> longer<00:04:21.900> but<00:04:22.080> I

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
to be just a little bit longer but I

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.650 
to be just a little bit longer but I
understand<00:04:22.560> why<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:22.860> not<00:04:23.039> it<00:04:23.340> has<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.880> decent

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
understand why it's not it has a decent

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.420 
understand why it's not it has a decent
health<00:04:24.960> pool<00:04:25.200> as<00:04:25.410> well<00:04:25.440> just<00:04:26.070> about<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.400> only

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
health pool as well just about the only

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.040 
health pool as well just about the only
thing<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.820> can<00:04:26.940> one-shot<00:04:27.150> this<00:04:27.539> is

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
thing that can one-shot this is

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.950 
thing that can one-shot this is
a<00:04:28.080> mortar<00:04:28.680> or<00:04:28.919> maybe<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.370> brute<00:04:29.789> spin<00:04:30.090> fuser<00:04:30.360> the

a mortar or maybe a brute spin fuser the
trick<00:04:31.169> with<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.379> light<00:04:31.530> turrets<00:04:31.830> you're<00:04:31.919> just

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
trick with the light turrets you're just

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.800 
trick with the light turrets you're just
understanding<00:04:32.639> where<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:32.879> place<00:04:33.090> them<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.720> get

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
understanding where to place them to get

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.480 
understanding where to place them to get
the<00:04:33.960> most<00:04:34.110> effect<00:04:34.409> out<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.680> them<00:04:34.800> overall

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
the most effect out of them overall

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.969 
the most effect out of them overall
great<00:04:36.270> great<00:04:36.599> utility<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.319> a<00:04:37.530> great<00:04:37.770> great
