like three or four hits usually it's

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.140 
like three or four hits usually it's
very<00:03:44.359> very<00:03:44.959> fast<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.530> they<00:03:45.620> do<00:03:46.250> drop<00:03:46.609> a<00:03:46.790> lot<00:03:46.940> of

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
very very fast and they do drop a lot of

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
the amount of AB&amp;C as you kill because

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.390 
the amount of AB&amp;C as you kill because
the<00:03:56.329> avian<00:03:56.660> C's<00:03:56.840> drop<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.530> noted<00:03:58.040> adamant

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
the avian C's drop the noted adamant

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.479 
the avian C's drop the noted adamant
bars<00:03:58.609> in<00:03:58.940> fours<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.709> about<00:04:00.919> a<00:04:00.980> one<00:04:01.340> in

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
bars in fours and it's about a one in

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.970 
bars in fours and it's about a one in
four<00:04:01.730> drop<00:04:02.120> rate<00:04:02.389> roughly<00:04:02.750> of<00:04:03.169> course

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
four drop rate roughly of course

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.009 
four drop rate roughly of course
sometimes<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.579> will<00:04:04.730> get<00:04:04.910> more<00:04:05.239> than<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.750> one

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
sometimes you will get more than a one

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.509 
sometimes you will get more than a one
in<00:04:06.139> four<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.470> drop<00:04:06.620> right<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:07.010> sometimes<00:04:07.190> you

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
in four and drop right and sometimes you

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:08.890 
in four and drop right and sometimes you
will<00:04:07.639> get<00:04:07.790> less<00:04:07.970> than<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.359> in<00:04:08.450> four<00:04:08.569> drop

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
will get less than a one in four drop

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.300 
will get less than a one in four drop
right<00:04:09.049> because<00:04:09.380> that's<00:04:09.590> just<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.889> nature<00:04:10.130> of

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
right because that's just the nature of

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.089 
right because that's just the nature of
the<00:04:10.430> game<00:04:10.870> but<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.380> roughly<00:04:12.799> what<00:04:13.010> you

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
the game but that is roughly what you

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.280 
the game but that is roughly what you
can<00:04:13.250> expect<00:04:13.609> and<00:04:13.910> at<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.299> moment<00:04:14.660> at<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.139> time

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
can expect and at the moment at the time

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.900 
can expect and at the moment at the time
of<00:04:15.410> making<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.680> video<00:04:15.889> adamant<00:04:16.459> bars<00:04:16.669> are

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
of making this video adamant bars are

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.270 
of making this video adamant bars are
3.5<00:04:17.599> K<00:04:17.870> each<00:04:18.250> so<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.430> means<00:04:19.669> each<00:04:19.910> drop<00:04:20.329> is

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
3.5 K each so that means each drop is

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.330 
3.5 K each so that means each drop is
just<00:04:22.280> about<00:04:22.659> 14,000<00:04:23.659> GP<00:04:24.020> per<00:04:24.740> adamant<00:04:25.130> bar

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
just about 14,000 GP per adamant bar

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.310 
just about 14,000 GP per adamant bar
drop

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
drop

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.470 
drop
so<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.950> is<00:04:27.100> pretty<00:04:27.490> good<00:04:27.700> for<00:04:27.970> every<00:04:28.300> four

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
so that is pretty good for every four

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.870 
so that is pretty good for every four
Adam<00:04:28.750> for<00:04:29.260> every<00:04:29.590> for<00:04:29.860> avian<00:04:30.250> sees<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.640> kill

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
Adam for every for avian sees you kill

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.900 
Adam for every for avian sees you kill
you're<00:04:31.060> getting<00:04:31.330> 14,000<00:04:32.140> GP<00:04:32.440> that's<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.670> too

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
you're getting 14,000 GP that's not too

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.660 
you're getting 14,000 GP that's not too
