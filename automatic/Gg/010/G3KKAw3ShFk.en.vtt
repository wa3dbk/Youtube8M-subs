out all right first thing to notice on

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.220 
out all right first thing to notice on
handstand<00:00:11.309> push-ups<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.690> fingers

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
handstand push-ups is that fingers

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.400 
handstand push-ups is that fingers
fingers<00:00:14.160> are<00:00:14.309> very<00:00:14.549> important<00:00:15.120> if<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:15.839> legs

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
fingers are very important if your legs

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.189 
fingers are very important if your legs
are<00:00:16.590> leaning<00:00:16.949> too<00:00:17.699> far<00:00:17.730> over<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.600> guess<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.050> can

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
are leaning too far over I guess you can

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.540 
are leaning too far over I guess you can
say<00:00:19.289> your<00:00:19.439> fingers<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.220> they're<00:00:20.340> leaning

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
say your fingers so if they're leaning

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.599 
say your fingers so if they're leaning
too<00:00:20.760> far<00:00:20.789> forward<00:00:21.859> then<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.220> want<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> press

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
too far forward then you want to press

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.120 
too far forward then you want to press
your<00:00:23.699> fingertips<00:00:24.000> into<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> ground<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
your fingertips into the ground to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.560 
your fingertips into the ground to
correct<00:00:26.130> your<00:00:26.220> body<00:00:26.460> weight<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.180> if<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> can

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
correct your body weight so if you can

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.790 
correct your body weight so if you can
see<00:00:27.720> my<00:00:27.869> hands<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:29.189> push<00:00:29.699> push<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.840> them<00:00:30.990> if

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
see my hands you push push on them if

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.740 
see my hands you push push on them if
this<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.219> be<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> ground<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.570> would

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
this would be the ground and this would

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.160 
this would be the ground and this would
be<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:34.350> hand<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.520> see<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> fingertips<00:00:36.930> push

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
be my hand you see the fingertips push

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.430 
be my hand you see the fingertips push
so<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> corrects<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:38.730> legs<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.989> legs<00:00:40.200> go

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
so it corrects your legs if your legs go

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.970 
so it corrects your legs if your legs go
too<00:00:40.649> far<00:00:40.829> back<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.180> want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.980> pretend

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
too far back then you want to pretend

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.049 
too far back then you want to pretend
like<00:00:44.160> you're<00:00:44.309> trying<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> lift<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:44.940> finger

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
like you're trying to lift your finger

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.250 
like you're trying to lift your finger
tips<00:00:45.420> off<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> ground<00:00:45.899> even<00:00:46.110> though<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
tips off the ground even though you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.369 
tips off the ground even though you
really<00:00:46.410> can't<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.670> lift<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
really can't but just lift off and it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
really can't but just lift off and it
releases<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.090> tension<00:00:51.090> off<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.329> fingertips

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
releases a tension off your fingertips

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.290 
releases a tension off your fingertips
so<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.170> brings<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.559> legs<00:00:52.739> back<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
so it brings your legs back you know to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.700 
so it brings your legs back you know to
the<00:00:54.390> center<00:00:54.629> position<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.199> could<00:00:55.350> have

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the center position so you could have

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
the center position so you could have
more<00:00:55.890> balance<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> people<00:00:57.239> use<00:00:57.360> more

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
more balance a lot of people use more

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.880 
more balance a lot of people use more
muscle<00:00:58.050> than<00:00:58.230> balance<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.890> handstands

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
muscle than balance to get up handstands

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.700 
muscle than balance to get up handstands
but<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:03.320> more<00:01:04.320> balanced<00:01:04.680> than

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
but it's it's really more balanced than

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.120 
but it's it's really more balanced than
anything<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.710> find<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.770> center<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
anything so if you find that center of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.810 
anything so if you find that center of
gravity<00:01:08.960> then<00:01:10.100> you'll<00:01:11.100> stay<00:01:11.280> balanced<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
gravity then you'll stay balanced and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840 
gravity then you'll stay balanced and
you<00:01:11.909> won't<00:01:12.060> need<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.840> strength<00:01:13.850> all

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you won't need as much strength all

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
you won't need as much strength all
right<00:01:15.000> after<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> progressively<00:01:15.810> progress

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
right after you progressively progress

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
right after you progressively progress
to<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.040> good<00:01:17.670> handstands<00:01:18.479> start<00:01:19.409> off<00:01:19.500> with

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
to the good handstands start off with

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560 
to the good handstands start off with
the<00:01:19.680> wall<00:01:19.920> first<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.549> progressively<00:01:21.270> just

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the wall first then progressively just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.710 
the wall first then progressively just
come<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> wall<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.360> once<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.450> come<00:01:24.600> off

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
come off the wall and once you come off

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570 
come off the wall and once you come off
the<00:01:24.869> wall<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.340> good<00:01:26.520> at

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the wall and you get really good at

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.410 
the wall and you get really good at
handstands<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.689> stuff<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.310> then<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
handstands and stuff like that then I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
handstands and stuff like that then I
start<00:01:30.420> doing<00:01:30.630> handstand<00:01:30.869> push-ups<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
start doing handstand push-ups and you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.050 
start doing handstand push-ups and you
might<00:01:32.280> want<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> start<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.729> handstand

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
might want to start your handstand

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.690 
might want to start your handstand
push-ups<00:01:33.420> off<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> wall<00:01:34.439> first<00:01:34.740> after<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
push-ups off on the wall first after you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
push-ups off on the wall first after you
progress<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> wall<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> move

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
progress from the wall then you can move

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.580 
progress from the wall then you can move
to<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.960> freestanding<00:01:39.960> handstand

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to you know freestanding handstand

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.550 
to you know freestanding handstand
push-ups<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.430> I'll<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.420> five<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:43.020> ya<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.350> one

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
push-ups and I'll do five for ya do one

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.899 
push-ups and I'll do five for ya do one
for<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.040> back<00:01:44.250> facing<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:46.909> side

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
way so you can see how straight my body

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.420 
way so you can see how straight my body
is<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.630> uh<00:01:51.659> okay
