00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it's still kind of the same you can't do

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
it's still kind of the same you can't do
it<00:00:57.180> inside<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.899> program<00:00:58.820> of<00:00:59.820> Safari<00:01:00.680> there's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
have to do and it's debatable whether

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.469 
have to do and it's debatable whether
this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.470> worth<00:01:07.770> doing<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.939> may<00:01:09.450> be

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
well alright so there's no way to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
well alright so there's no way to
separate<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.049> from<00:01:59.000> Safari<00:02:00.079> but<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.649> you've

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
separate it from Safari but if if you've

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
separate it from Safari but if if you've
bought<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> Mac<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.060> honestly<00:02:03.899> want<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
bought a Mac and you honestly want to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.200 
bought a Mac and you honestly want to
change<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.250> language<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> different

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
change the language to a different

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.089 
change the language to a different
different<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> way<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
different one this is the way to do it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.600 
different one this is the way to do it
so<00:02:08.879> I've<00:02:09.000> put<00:02:09.599> France<00:02:10.259> French<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:11.069> my<00:02:11.310> first

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
so I've put France French as my first

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.840 
so I've put France French as my first
preference<00:02:11.879> there<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.840> I'll<00:02:12.959> close<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
preference there so I'll close that

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.330 
preference there so I'll close that
and<00:02:14.850> then<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.780> hit<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.960> Apple<00:02:16.320> symbol<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.950> log

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and then we hit the Apple symbol and log

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.560 
and then we hit the Apple symbol and log
out<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.830> already<00:02:20.190> partly<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:20.880> French<00:02:21.210> so

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
out and it's already partly in French so

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.630 
out and it's already partly in French so
we'll<00:02:21.750> log<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.720> then<00:02:25.400> log<00:02:26.400> in

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
we'll log out of that and then log in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.800 
we'll log out of that and then log in
again<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:31.070> everything<00:02:32.070> should<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.480> French

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
again and everything should be in French

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.070 
again and everything should be in French
