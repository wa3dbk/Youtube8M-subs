00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.540 

I've<00:04:27.710> tried<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.460> actually<00:04:29.620> use<00:04:30.620> images<00:04:31.340> from

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
I've tried to actually use images from

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.810 
I've tried to actually use images from
the<00:04:31.729> real<00:04:32.000> one<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.540> from<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.020> movies<00:04:33.820> to

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
the real one and from the movies to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.670 
the real one and from the movies to
capture<00:04:35.690> her<00:04:35.900> as<00:04:36.139> best<00:04:36.620> as<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:36.919> could<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:39.500> I've

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
capture her as best as I could and I've

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.870 
capture her as best as I could and I've
gotten<00:04:40.130> pretty<00:04:40.460> close<00:04:40.910> like<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:42.139> think<00:04:45.880> it's

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
gotten pretty close like I think it's

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.580 
gotten pretty close like I think it's
taken<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.330> long<00:04:47.600> time<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.990> build<00:04:48.289> this<00:04:48.590> one<00:04:50.590> of

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
taken a long time to build this one of

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.249 
taken a long time to build this one of
course<00:04:51.680> of<00:04:52.220> off<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:52.880> on<00:04:53.410> for<00:04:54.410> a<00:04:54.440> while

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
course of off and on for a while

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.560 
course of off and on for a while
hardest<00:04:57.259> part<00:04:57.320> was<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.860> find<00:04:58.220> any<00:04:58.570> accurate

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
hardest part was to find any accurate
