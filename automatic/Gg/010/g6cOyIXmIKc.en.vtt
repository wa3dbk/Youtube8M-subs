00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.890
 paid for the simple reason is that no 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.600
 it left me worth not let me characterize 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.909

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.409
 that upload videos to youtube if the sony 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.850

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.920
 chungo theme 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.229
 but good guys since we are and you 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.460
 I come to explain today a little the new 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.430
 lash that comes out the last 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.190
 update the tab of objects worth 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.690
 As you can see , all the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 sections here tells you that still not 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.810
 they have no set of objects here 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.620
 you get all the objects and here you 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.020
 they go out where are you going to put your objects worth 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.680
 we give you here my number 1 objects that 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.680
 let's put for example 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.390
 luke for example is worth if for example 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.370
 and we see that we have many here 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.800
 objects initial objects here we see 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.780
 new block new block and new block 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.190
 it's worth it if you want to divide your but 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.380
 Let's see that many people do 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.590
 basically it is to put all the objects 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.200
 here 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.760
 for example, you start with loops and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.099
 let's start playing with light if not 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.850
 you know that you are going to buy first 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.890
 that is not 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.720
 you do not know or you have doubts and for those 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.730
 example those that are starting but one 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.160
 guide on the internet and they say you look at the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.000
 luxe objects and for example tells you 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.319
 I bought you 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.220
 for example with an example 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.160
 I do not know how to wait 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.620
 this you buy the fairy charm 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.490
 of buying two fairy amulets that are 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:52.540
 a total of cinema I'm wrong 360 worth 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.770
 360 of now we start with 475 you 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.770
 shopping a guard 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.720
 Wait, I have to add up because 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.280
 we took a long time to open 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.190
 let's open the roll calculator 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.190
 name to see oops there we see in your world 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.260
 to see what good 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.730
 summarizing ok I'm not going to put here to 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.530
 have now why why not because 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.730
 is to waste time worth but here put 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.800
 the subjects with what I am starting the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.390
 game is worth what you want to start 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.819
 with the 475 gold that gives you 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.310
 you do not want these good so we 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.310
 you take away and what do you want to start I know 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.689
 with boot and three pots as they put a note 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.750
 and three rivals and once you start on 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:42.450
 the game will come out this way 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.670
 here you get champions choose the maps 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.310
 in those who want to use these objects 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.790
 in that they want to use them well, well, if 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.790
 I want to use 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.020
 in the sender 's booth of the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.030
 Crystal scar also forest 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.730
 twisted and right now I'm sorry it's worth 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.599
 it's worth for success 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.599
 basically 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.380
 choose the champions, well, I 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.180
 I want that 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.930
 for for example of this light 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.190
 to stop to stop to stop to stop 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.100
 lux that is here 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.430
 I want these objects worth 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.430
 I love them so later, good 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.280
 then later we see that the game 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:36.470
 it's going well because we started to let us know 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:41.720
 is the chalice we make ourselves the chalice and not 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:44.510
 the chalice rojito is perfect 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.400
 we are advancing in the game and good 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.380
 normally here you can also put 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.620
 wards you can get more positive than 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.139
 you can put whatever you want 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.510
 that we see that it goes very well perfect 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.870
 If we see that it's going very well, we'll give it 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.570
 the explosive and it is no longer necessary 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.550
 that you put the other rod more than anything 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.930
 to not occupy space you know that if 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.180
 you put that rod and then it's the 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.160
 object is worth as I have done here for 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.070
 except object and then this one you know that you 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.380
 you have to improve directly 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.210
 this yes to not put so much what not 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.740
 Ponds is barack and also if it is not 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.010
 so with the hat and you put it here 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.840
 is worth more than anything to remove 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.180
 spaces later 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.970
 then or even before the hat if 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.690
 you want so you can get rid of seeing 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.690
 Where is 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.789
 and that 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.789
 the mask you can make the mask you 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.310
 you do this and then the 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.710
 finalize is with that it is worth later 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.689
 Well then you put here 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.719
 The following objects are worth you 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:52.030
 you want to realize how can be the 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.129
 they are already can be very many objects worth 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.800
 but of vacuum compacts and so on 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:06:00.719
 Etcetera etcetera is very easy to use 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.719
 It is very easy to use but of course 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.700
 many people maybe you did not know all 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.530
 the champions that was closed I 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.010
 at first I did not find it not what 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.570
 I found and in the end I found it 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.080
 but you can do it very well 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.900
 ways for many champions to 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.630
 get used to your bulls since that's what 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.330
 Many people asked throughout
