power station these things will hold out

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.910 
power station these things will hold out
longer<00:03:16.049> so<00:03:17.049> let's<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.290> pretend<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.680> as<00:03:17.859> a

not happening there appears to be a cave
there<00:04:41.300> but<00:04:41.600> we<00:04:41.900> can't<00:04:42.260> get<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.710> it<00:04:45.010> unless<00:04:46.010> we

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
there but we can't get to it unless we

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.010 
there but we can't get to it unless we
got<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.370> guy<00:04:46.520> with<00:04:46.789> a<00:04:46.850> tunnel<00:04:47.210> scout<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.750> we<00:04:47.840> get

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
got a guy with a tunnel scout and we get

00:04:48.020 --> 00:05:00.129 
got a guy with a tunnel scout and we get
him<00:04:48.139> in<00:04:48.260> aysan<00:04:48.949> oh<00:04:52.120> let's<00:04:53.120> try<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:55.150> that<00:04:59.139> we're

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
him in aysan oh let's try to that we're

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.570 
him in aysan oh let's try to that we're
going<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.320> road<00:05:00.770> then<00:05:01.400> we<00:05:01.700> are<00:05:01.940> going<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.330> stop

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
going to road then we are going to stop

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.460 
going to road then we are going to stop
goodness<00:05:07.150> once<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:08.360> starts<00:05:08.870> eroding<00:05:09.410> and

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
goodness once it starts eroding and

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:20.080 
goodness once it starts eroding and
isn't<00:05:09.740> going<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:09.919> stop<00:05:10.010> quickly<00:05:10.520> is<00:05:10.820> it<00:05:19.090> it's

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
isn't going to stop quickly is it it's

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.089 
isn't going to stop quickly is it it's
also<00:05:20.810> need<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.020> get<00:05:21.199> that<00:05:21.289> support<00:05:21.740> station

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
also need to get that support station

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.110 
also need to get that support station
for<00:05:22.460> some<00:05:22.580> more<00:05:22.760> rock<00:05:23.000> readers<00:05:23.419> I<00:05:24.970> think<00:05:25.970> it's

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
for some more rock readers I think it's

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.689 
for some more rock readers I think it's
better<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.260> discount<00:05:27.680> this<00:05:27.830> area<00:05:28.160> as<00:05:28.310> lost

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
better to discount this area as lost

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.439 
better to discount this area as lost
because<00:05:30.400> Blake<00:05:31.400> liquid<00:05:31.880> might<00:05:32.120> have<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.270> chance

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
because Blake liquid might have a chance

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.290 
because Blake liquid might have a chance
we<00:05:32.780> might<00:05:32.810> have<00:05:33.289> chance<00:05:36.940> need<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.120> at<00:05:38.270> least

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
we might have chance need to at least

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.570 
we might have chance need to at least
get<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.750> geologist<00:05:39.470> thing<00:05:39.680> there's<00:05:39.919> my<00:05:40.130> can<00:05:40.310> see

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
get a geologist thing there's my can see

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.600 
get a geologist thing there's my can see
where<00:05:40.789> it<00:05:40.910> leads<00:05:42.699> if<00:05:43.699> possible<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:46.340> might<00:05:46.550> be

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
where it leads if possible you might be

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.730 
where it leads if possible you might be
