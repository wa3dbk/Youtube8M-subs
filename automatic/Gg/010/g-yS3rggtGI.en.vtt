hi this is Stu from happy wheels and
today<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.629> learn<00:00:03.720> how<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.929> put<00:00:04.200> on

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
today we're going to learn how to put on

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.889 
today we're going to learn how to put on
a<00:00:04.319> skewer<00:00:04.620> properly<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.850> when<00:00:06.569> I'm<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
a skewer properly so when I'm in the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.810 
a skewer properly so when I'm in the
boat<00:00:07.080> sometimes<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.830> see<00:00:08.040> people<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.580> they

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
boat sometimes I see people and they

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.520 
boat sometimes I see people and they
don't<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.480> their<00:00:09.630> skewer<00:00:09.929> done<00:00:10.139> up<00:00:10.230> properly

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
don't have their skewer done up properly

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.259 
don't have their skewer done up properly
and<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.040> could<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> safety<00:00:11.670> hazard<00:00:11.820> as

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and this could be a safety hazard as

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.829 
and this could be a safety hazard as
well<00:00:12.840> as<00:00:12.990> not<00:00:13.170> looking<00:00:13.500> very<00:00:13.530> good<00:00:13.769> either<00:00:14.070> so

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
well as not looking very good either so

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.320 
well as not looking very good either so
down<00:00:15.839> here<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.529> my<00:00:16.680> boat<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.060> skewer

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
down here we have my boat and the skewer

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.279 
down here we have my boat and the skewer
is<00:00:18.390> done<00:00:18.570> incorrectly

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
is done incorrectly

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.160 
is done incorrectly
it's<00:00:19.890> pointing<00:00:20.310> forward<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it's pointing forward and it's it's a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.689 
it's pointing forward and it's it's a
safety<00:00:22.470> hazard<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.430> caught

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
safety hazard because you can get caught

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.750 
safety hazard because you can get caught
on<00:00:23.730> things<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> other<00:00:25.650> place<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> see<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
on things the other place that I see a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.380 
on things the other place that I see a
lot<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> people<00:00:27.150> put<00:00:27.510> their<00:00:27.720> skewer<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.769> is

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
lot of people put their skewer on is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.849 
lot of people put their skewer on is
straight<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.539> against<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> frame<00:00:31.289> thinking

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
straight up against the frame thinking

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
straight up against the frame thinking
that's<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.640> nice<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.850> arrow<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that's all really nice and arrow the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.090 
that's all really nice and arrow the
only<00:00:33.960> problem<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.469> if<00:00:34.590> you're<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> race

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
only problem that is if you're in a race

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.590 
only problem that is if you're in a race
or<00:00:35.610> even<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:35.880> you're<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> side<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
or even if you're on the side of the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
or even if you're on the side of the
road<00:00:36.780> how<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.800> supposed<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.250> your

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
road how you're supposed to get your

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459 
road how you're supposed to get your
fingers<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.180> pull<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> out<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
fingers in there to pull it out like you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
fingers in there to pull it out like you
have<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> either<00:00:41.280> use<00:00:41.489> an<00:00:41.640> allen<00:00:41.940> key<00:00:42.120> or

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
have to either use an allen key or

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.910 
have to either use an allen key or
something<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.110> ineffective

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
something and it's just ineffective

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.020 
something and it's just ineffective
because<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> race<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.430> probably<00:00:44.789> wouldn't

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
because in a race you probably wouldn't

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.760 
because in a race you probably wouldn't
have<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.020> end<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.200> losing<00:00:46.410> time

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
have that so you end up losing time

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.709 
have that so you end up losing time
YouTube<00:00:47.670> either<00:00:47.820> change<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> time<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> change

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
YouTube either change the time to change

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510 
YouTube either change the time to change
your<00:00:48.899> wheel<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.559> bunch<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> gone<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> your

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
your wheel the bunch is gone and your

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.410 
your wheel the bunch is gone and your
race<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.730> over<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:52.940> you're<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
race is over so you're going to get it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.889 
race is over so you're going to get it
off<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.789> correct<00:00:57.210> place<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> put<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
off so the correct place to put the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.970 
off so the correct place to put the
skewer<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.829> behind<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.430> fork<00:00:59.899> that<00:01:00.980> therefore

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
skewer is behind the fork that therefore

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.340 
skewer is behind the fork that therefore
it<00:01:02.789> won't<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.359> caught<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.600> things<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.110> front

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
it won't get caught on things in front

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.710 
it won't get caught on things in front
and<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.670> still<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> open<00:01:06.420> quite

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and you can still get it open quite

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.399 
and you can still get it open quite
easily<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:09.979> that's<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> front<00:01:11.760> form

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
easily so that's how you do a front form

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.270 
easily so that's how you do a front form
coming<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> rear<00:01:15.560> as<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.100> see

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
coming up to the rear as you can see

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.890 
coming up to the rear as you can see
I've<00:01:17.520> got<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.909> pointed<00:01:18.119> backwards<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.840> time

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
I've got it pointed backwards this time

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
I've got it pointed backwards this time
now<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.890> time<00:01:20.130> you're<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> same<00:01:20.970> boat

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
now this time you're in the same boat

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
now this time you're in the same boat
you<00:01:21.590> if<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.799> pointing<00:01:23.130> backwards<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> can

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you if it's pointing backwards it can

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.719 
you if it's pointing backwards it can
get<00:01:23.880> caught<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.150> things<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.229> your

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
get caught on things you know your

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.910 
get caught on things you know your
opponent's<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:26.880> you'll<00:01:27.420> cut<00:01:27.630> your

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
opponent's or you'll cut your

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
opponent's or you'll cut your
competitors<00:01:28.920> wheels<00:01:29.579> might<00:01:29.820> accidentally

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
competitors wheels might accidentally

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.700 
competitors wheels might accidentally
you<00:01:30.420> know<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> bit<00:01:30.900> close<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.530> go

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you know get a bit close and then go

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.499 
you know get a bit close and then go
like<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.340> go<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.670> flick<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.390> your

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
like this and go up flick it then your

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
like this and go up flick it then your
wheel<00:01:33.659> comes<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.490> can

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
wheel comes out then you know it can

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.420 
wheel comes out then you know it can
quite<00:01:35.880> easily<00:01:35.909> happen<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.049> same<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.070> as

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
quite easily happen so same thing as

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.880 
quite easily happen so same thing as
well<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> front<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:40.200> some<00:01:40.409> reason<00:01:40.710> some

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
well in the front for some reason some

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
well in the front for some reason some
people<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.460> put<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:41.820> against<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
people like to put it right against the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.569 
people like to put it right against the
frame<00:01:42.479> same<00:01:43.200> deal<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.619> can't<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> open

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
frame same deal you can't get it open

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.690 
frame same deal you can't get it open
so<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:46.229> correct<00:01:46.590> place<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> skewer

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so the correct place to put the skewer

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700 
so the correct place to put the skewer
depending<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> way<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> frame<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.380> design

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
depending on the way the frame is design

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.859 
depending on the way the frame is design
is<00:01:50.130> sometimes<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> bit<00:01:51.180> bulky<00:01:51.420> here

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
is sometimes you can be a bit bulky here

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.260 
is sometimes you can be a bit bulky here
and<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.200> can't<00:01:52.439> put<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.030> best

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
and you can't put it here but the best

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.319 
and you can't put it here but the best
place<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.780> find<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:56.820> between<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
place I find is there is it between the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.410 
place I find is there is it between the
frame<00:01:57.680> but<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.909> my<00:01:59.939> frame

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
frame but as you can see with my frame

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.920 
frame but as you can see with my frame
it<00:02:00.630> hits<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> frame<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.689> locked

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it hits the frame so that's not locked

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.410 
it hits the frame so that's not locked
enough<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.799> can't<00:02:05.100> put<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
enough so you can't put it there so the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.949 
enough so you can't put it there so the
other<00:02:06.540> good<00:02:06.899> place<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:08.190> under<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> frame

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
other good place is just under the frame

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.390 
other good place is just under the frame
like<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
like that and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.729 
like that and
it<00:02:11.549> tucks<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.970> nicely<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.599> then<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.470> won't<00:02:13.560> get

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
it tucks in nicely and then it won't get

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.619 
it tucks in nicely and then it won't get
caught<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.010> anything<00:02:14.189> and<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.030> looks<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.510> lot

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
caught on anything and it looks a lot

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.880 
caught on anything and it looks a lot
nicer<00:02:15.810> as<00:02:16.140> well<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.349> think<00:02:17.959> now<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.739> other

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
nicer as well I think now the other

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.569 
nicer as well I think now the other
thing<00:02:23.189> is<00:02:23.819> you're<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> mountain<00:02:24.450> boy<00:02:25.579> with

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
thing is you're the mountain boy with

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.119 
thing is you're the mountain boy with
mountain<00:02:26.939> bikes<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:28.109> they<00:02:28.799> have<00:02:29.099> to

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
mountain bikes they they have to

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.640 
mountain bikes they they have to
actually<00:02:29.579> go<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:30.180> because<00:02:30.720> they<00:02:31.079> do<00:02:31.140> it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
actually go up because they do it

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.289 
actually go up because they do it
especially<00:02:31.769> if<00:02:32.250> they<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.519> disc<00:02:32.790> brake<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
especially if they have a disc brake and

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.960 
especially if they have a disc brake and
their<00:02:34.019> fork<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> lot<00:02:34.799> stronger<00:02:35.459> because

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
their fork is a lot stronger because

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.210 
their fork is a lot stronger because
they<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.720> suspension<00:02:37.170> fork<00:02:37.590> so

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
they have it like a suspension fork so

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.149 
they have it like a suspension fork so
they're<00:02:38.489> for<00:02:39.049> their<00:02:40.049> skewer<00:02:40.409> actually<00:02:40.859> has<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
they're for their skewer actually has to

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.210 
they're for their skewer actually has to
go<00:02:41.280> up<00:02:41.459> at<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.269> front<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:43.709> that's<00:02:43.889> really<00:02:44.099> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
go up at the front so that's really the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.500 
go up at the front so that's really the
only<00:02:44.310> place<00:02:44.639> you<00:02:44.790> can<00:02:44.940> do<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.269> with<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
only place you can do that with a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.960 
only place you can do that with a
suspension<00:02:46.409> fork<00:02:46.650> most<00:02:46.889> of<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.190> time<00:02:47.400> some

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
suspension fork most of the time some

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.849 
suspension fork most of the time some
folks<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.359> can<00:02:48.569> put<00:02:48.780> underneath<00:02:49.079> but<00:02:49.650> then

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
folks you can put underneath but then

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.430 
folks you can put underneath but then
it's<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.909> opposite<00:02:51.329> here<00:02:51.629> if<00:02:52.019> then<00:02:52.260> it's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
it's it's the opposite here if then it's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.740 
it's it's the opposite here if then it's
hard<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.680> get<00:02:52.889> to<00:02:53.069> because<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.609> disc<00:02:54.540> brake

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
hard to get to because of the disc brake

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.390 
hard to get to because of the disc brake
because<00:02:55.379> it<00:02:55.590> was<00:02:55.680> here<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.010> there's<00:02:56.129> a<00:02:56.159> lot<00:02:56.280> of

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
because it was here and there's a lot of

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.679 
because it was here and there's a lot of
hardware<00:02:56.670> there<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.150> can't<00:02:57.389> really<00:02:57.540> get

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
hardware there and you can't really get

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.920 
hardware there and you can't really get
to<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.810> but<00:02:58.049> here<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:59.400> can<00:02:59.519> get<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.849> it<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.810> it's

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
to it but here you can get to it so it's

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.800 
to it but here you can get to it so it's
nice<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.109> easy<00:03:04.159> cool<00:03:05.159> and<00:03:05.489> that's<00:03:06.209> how<00:03:06.750> you

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
nice and easy cool and that's how you

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.769 
nice and easy cool and that's how you
put<00:03:07.049> skewers<00:03:07.349> on<00:03:07.470> properly
