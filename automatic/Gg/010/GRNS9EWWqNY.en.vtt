00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240 
it a spin zone just on the side facing
to<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> mirror<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.619> put<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> lava

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
dispenser yes you can see the fire has

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.390 
dispenser yes you can see the fire has
turned<00:01:16.979> off<00:01:17.159> by<00:01:17.490> now<00:01:18.380> then<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.770> want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.040> stack

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
turned off by now then you want to stack

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.660 
turned off by now then you want to stack
up<00:01:20.640> by<00:01:21.090> two<00:01:21.509> blocks<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> place<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.369> arm

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
up by two blocks and place in your arm

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.010 
up by two blocks and place in your arm
stands<00:01:24.350> facing<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:26.040> different<00:01:26.880> ways<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
stands facing in different ways so you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.580 
stands facing in different ways so you
get<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.770> nice<00:01:29.040> cross<00:01:30.030> shape<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:31.290> grab

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
get this nice cross shape then grab

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.490 
get this nice cross shape then grab
yourself<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.100> piston<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.930> place<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.110> facing

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
yourself a piston and place it facing

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
yourself a piston and place it facing
downwards<00:01:35.009> take<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> dot<00:01:35.970> block<00:01:36.240> place<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
downwards take a dot block place it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
downwards take a dot block place it
underneath<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> piston<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.829> push<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.640> down

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
underneath the piston and push it down

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.390 
underneath the piston and push it down
place<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> block<00:01:39.570> above<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.259> put<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> down

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
place a block above and put it down

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.370 
place a block above and put it down
again<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> ground<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.200> can

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
again so it's in the ground but you can

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380 
again so it's in the ground but you can
see<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.850> looking<00:01:45.000> quite

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
see now that this is not looking quite

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.359 
see now that this is not looking quite
good<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.560> maybe<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> reason<00:01:47.159> why

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
good and that's maybe the reason why

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.850 
good and that's maybe the reason why
others<00:01:47.759> made<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.180> quite<00:01:48.420> complicated<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
others made it quite complicated so the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.109 
others made it quite complicated so the
other<00:01:50.009> stones<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.399> standing<00:01:50.700> higher<00:01:50.850> I'm

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
other stones are standing higher I'm

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.609 
other stones are standing higher I'm
just<00:01:51.420> lowering<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> block<00:01:52.200> where<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> am

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just lowering the block where the am

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.080 
just lowering the block where the am
stands<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.729> don't<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
stands are on because you don't have a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.219 
stands are on because you don't have a
fire<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:55.470> grass<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.270> me<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.630> having

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
fire just on grass so for me I'm having

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.730 
fire just on grass so for me I'm having
the<00:01:58.439> fire

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
the fire

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.090 
the fire
on<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:03.509> farmland<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:04.990> this<00:02:05.229> is<00:02:05.259> like<00:02:05.560> burnt

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
on the farmland so this is like burnt

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.850 
on the farmland so this is like burnt
grass<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:07.410> now<00:02:08.410> we<00:02:08.470> only<00:02:09.039> need<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.580> button<00:02:10.569> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
grass and now we only need a button to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.660 
grass and now we only need a button to
target<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:14.349> should<00:02:14.590> also<00:02:14.860> add<00:02:15.370> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
target this and you should also add a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.270 
target this and you should also add a
water<00:02:16.180> source<00:02:16.510> nearby<00:02:16.739> which<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.890> can<00:02:18.069> easily

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
water source nearby which you can easily

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.089 
water source nearby which you can easily
hide<00:02:18.819> underneath<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:21.930> cobblestone<00:02:22.930> stare<00:02:23.800> for

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
hide underneath a cobblestone stare for

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.240 
hide underneath a cobblestone stare for
a<00:02:24.160> seat<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.819> maybe<00:02:25.780> put<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.349> towel<00:02:27.220> or

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
a seat and maybe put a towel or

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.729 
a seat and maybe put a towel or
something<00:02:27.700> next<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.330> your<00:02:28.480> campfire<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
something next to your campfire so it

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.490 
something next to your campfire so it
looks<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:30.160> bit<00:02:30.340> nicer<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:31.450> time<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.690> will<00:02:31.900> use<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
looks a bit nicer this time I will use a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.920 
looks a bit nicer this time I will use a
light<00:02:33.400> blue<00:02:33.640> one<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.090> as<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.569> can<00:02:34.720> see<00:02:34.750> that

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
light blue one and as you can see that

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.190 
light blue one and as you can see that
this<00:02:35.410> campfire<00:02:35.830> doesn't<00:02:36.310> emit<00:02:36.519> light<00:02:36.790> yet

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
this campfire doesn't emit light yet

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.380 
this campfire doesn't emit light yet
while<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.470> other<00:02:38.500> one<00:02:38.860> does<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.850> want<00:02:40.269> to
