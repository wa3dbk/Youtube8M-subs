00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
flash this means that you would not be

able<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.770> take<00:00:37.950> good<00:00:38.489> pictures<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.510> dark

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
able to take good pictures in in dark

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.889 
able to take good pictures in in dark
and<00:00:40.430> we<00:00:41.430> all<00:00:41.550> know<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> fail<00:00:42.239> night<00:00:42.660> mode

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
and we all know what a fail night mode

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:54.950 
and we all know what a fail night mode
really<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> let's<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.809> inside<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> app<00:00:53.960> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
really is so let's get inside the app so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.319 
really is so let's get inside the app so
it<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.649> second<00:00:56.370> maybe<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.910> second<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it is like a second maybe a second and a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.510 
it is like a second maybe a second and a
half<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.899> open<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> camera<00:00:58.410> app<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:59.370> not

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
half to open the camera app that's not

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.040 
half to open the camera app that's not
so<00:00:59.670> bad

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
so bad

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.799 
so bad
now<00:01:01.050> let's<00:01:02.010> let's<00:01:02.399> put<00:01:02.579> an<00:01:02.670> object<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.359> so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
now let's let's put an object here so

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.450 
now let's let's put an object here so
that<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.170> could<00:01:04.350> test<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.799> camera<00:01:07.280> now<00:01:08.280> there

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
that we could test the camera now there

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.050 
that we could test the camera now there
is<00:01:08.610> no<00:01:08.700> tap<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> focus<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:11.450> so

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
is no tap to focus as you can see so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.880 
is no tap to focus as you can see so
that's<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.479> good<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.930> anyway<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.740> does

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that's not so good but anyway it does

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.980 
that's not so good but anyway it does
have<00:01:17.100> autofocus<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.049> let's<00:01:19.049> take<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> picture

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.050 

so<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.740> took<00:01:25.920> around

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
so as you can see that it took around

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.450 
so as you can see that it took around
maybe<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.210> second<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.659> two<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.049> first<00:01:28.799> focus<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
maybe a second or two to first focus and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.440 
maybe a second or two to first focus and
then<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.000> took<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.240> picture<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:32.000> well<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.210> is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
then it took a picture and well this is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.230 
then it took a picture and well this is
a<00:01:33.740> very<00:01:34.740> average<00:01:35.700> camera<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:38.850> it's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
a very average camera and you know it's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.830 
a very average camera and you know it's
not<00:01:39.659> supposed<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.350> very<00:01:41.450> quick<00:01:42.450> images

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
not supposed to take very quick images

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230 
not supposed to take very quick images
so<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.649> expected<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.790> galaxy<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
so that's expected out of the galaxy a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.380 
so that's expected out of the galaxy a
stores<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.729> really<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> see

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
stores but what we really have to see

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.600

so<00:02:08.840> that's<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.410> camera<00:02:10.739> app<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.540> we

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so that's that's the camera app and we

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730 
so that's that's the camera app and we
don't<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> lot<00:02:13.200> of

don't have a lot of

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.520 
don't have a lot of

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
like in most camera apps that we've seen

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.030 
like in most camera apps that we've seen
in<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.890> Android<00:02:18.440> there<00:02:19.440> are<00:02:19.530> three<00:02:19.710> shooting

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040

if you would want but I don't see a

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.920 
if you would want but I don't see a
reason<00:03:12.000> why<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.300> would<00:03:12.510> change<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.780> from

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
reason why you would change it from

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.820 
reason why you would change it from
superfine<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.870> also<00:03:16.050> have<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.320> toggle<00:03:16.530> right

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
here on the right edge so you could just

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.230 
here on the right edge so you could just
go<00:03:19.530> into<00:03:19.680> video<00:03:19.920> mode<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.560> start<00:03:22.560> shooting
