00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.500
 It is more is a different case, but But eh photo 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.880
 To present 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.009
 It is deliberation with Mr. Chuki 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.009
 I would like to see the difference 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.970
 Hey this skill c is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.239
 I think I understand if you look at it 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.239
 Although the alveolar ridge of the administrators I know something like 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 Since the Pavilion itself is not so bad film 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:51.750
 I think that it is not so difficult to make a denture itself. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.690
 It seems that there is a difference between right and left in absorption of a fixed amount of jaw ridge . 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.110
 I would like to see 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:03.720
 It is each of these 8 Anomalous two mountain gold remains in 8 one side 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:09.330
 Especially in the case of science 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:14.820
 If you do so, the fixed amount is not so much, but in the case of science, that mountain kelp 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.940
 The place where the reed is left and the same site on the other side 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.940
 I think whether there is of that shape varies 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.280
 But that's the border 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.100
 So when you cover up and down 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:37.260
 This kind of sex when taking a photo 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:42.860
 I've been out of this may seem a transvestite apparent by the difference in the alveolar ridge 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.860
 It does not look like this when it's in Japan 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:53.520
 You actually put in at 9 chapters the feeling of the garden is so much 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:59.750
 This polished side of the side that is absorbing is not something that has left and right 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.750
 It is that the difference of so-called rural space comes out like this 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:13.370
 I would like to talk about the difficult case technologist next time 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:17.730
 8 I think that the story is divided into several things , but it is roughly divided 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:22.530
 So this is one of the anatomic showways 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 It is a case that seems to be a land before chemistry 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.870
 The difficulty of this is that 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:35.760
 The next one is really in the patient's room. 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:42.930
 Well how do you solve it when blue woke up or 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:45.560
 I want to talk about what kind of thinking should I have in order to solve it 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.560
 think 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.819
 8 is the first to many 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:59.290
 If you open your mouth wide , I think you may have a fixed amount of sister-in-law falling 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.290
 As a way of thinking 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.900
 If the lifetime border is appropriate and set up to prove it 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 Basically 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.069
 I do not think that the flat-rate technician will fall in the usual meeting range
