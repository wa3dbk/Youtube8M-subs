a year and purpose of this video is I
was<00:00:18.539> walking<00:00:18.900> around<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.320> convenience<00:00:19.830> store

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
was walking around a convenience store

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.099 
was walking around a convenience store
one<00:00:20.279> day<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.970> through<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.600> drink<00:00:21.869> aisle

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
one day going through the drink aisle

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.060 
one day going through the drink aisle
and<00:00:22.820> I<00:00:23.820> noticed<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.779> kind<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> particularly

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and I noticed a kind of a particularly

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.240 
and I noticed a kind of a particularly
odd<00:00:26.400> flavor<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> drink<00:00:27.930> I'm<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
odd flavor for a drink I'm not going to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.919 
odd flavor for a drink I'm not going to
really<00:00:29.580> talk<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.420> now<00:00:30.449> because

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
really talk about it right now because

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.450 
really talk about it right now because
it's<00:00:31.140> probably<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.189> future

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it's probably going to be in a future

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
it's probably going to be in a future
video<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.870> uh<00:00:35.000> it<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.149> me<00:00:36.300> thinking<00:00:36.719> like

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
video but uh it got me thinking like

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.040 
video but uh it got me thinking like
what<00:00:38.100> what<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.879> try<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.270> things<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.989> just

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
what what if I try these things and just

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.250 
what what if I try these things and just
record<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:40.920> first<00:00:41.219> reaction<00:00:41.899> without<00:00:42.899> having

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
record my first reaction without having

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.690 
record my first reaction without having
actually<00:00:43.500> tried<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:43.890> before<00:00:43.980> open<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.610> or

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
actually tried them before open them or

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
actually tried them before open them or
anything<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.710> they

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
anything like that just to see what they

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.680 
anything like that just to see what they
are<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.309> there's<00:00:47.640> tons<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.239> weird<00:00:48.480> food

up with the potion a drink a while ago

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.510 
up with the potion a drink a while ago
um<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.829> heard<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.820> wasn't<00:01:36.150> very<00:01:36.299> good<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.520> one

um I heard it wasn't very good and one

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.460 
um I heard it wasn't very good and one
of<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.700> friends<00:01:38.729> can't<00:01:39.659> drank<00:01:39.990> some<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
of my friends can't drank some of it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
of my friends can't drank some of it
when<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:40.979> came<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.700> again<00:01:41.790> for

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
when they came out with it again for

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.870 
when they came out with it again for
dissidia<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.009> he<00:01:44.009> said<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.369> wasn't<00:01:44.520> very<00:01:44.759> good

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
dissidia and he said it wasn't very good

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.069 
dissidia and he said it wasn't very good
either<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> figured<00:01:46.979> I'd<00:01:47.369> give<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.670> shot

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
either so I figured I'd give it a shot

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.039 
either so I figured I'd give it a shot
no<00:01:49.079> I've<00:01:49.320> never<00:01:49.470> had<00:01:49.740> potion<00:01:50.250> before<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.049> this

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
no I've never had potion before and this

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.060 
no I've never had potion before and this
is<00:01:52.200> obviously<00:01:52.320> my<00:01:52.740> first<00:01:52.920> time<00:01:53.220> trying<00:01:53.579> elixir

is obviously my first time trying elixir

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.639 
is obviously my first time trying elixir
so<00:01:56.479> let's<00:01:57.479> crack<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.750> open<00:01:57.960> see<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
guess that's it for this video it's

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.259 
guess that's it for this video it's
probably<00:03:28.930> not<00:03:29.079> going<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.260> be<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.680> very

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
probably not going to be a very

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.400 
probably not going to be a very
recurring<00:03:31.269> thing<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.780> don't<00:03:31.840> know<00:03:31.989> how<00:03:32.079> often

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
recurring thing I don't know how often

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.620 
recurring thing I don't know how often
I'm<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.709> do<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:32.980> I've<00:03:33.910> funny<00:03:34.180> free<00:03:34.450> time

I'm going to do it I've funny free time

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.479 
I'm going to do it I've funny free time
but<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.109> just<00:03:35.139> depends<00:03:35.620> on<00:03:35.709> finding<00:03:35.950> actual

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
but it just depends on finding actual

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.099 
but it just depends on finding actual
weird<00:03:36.730> drinks<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:37.329> I<00:03:37.389> already<00:03:37.569> do<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:37.900> one
