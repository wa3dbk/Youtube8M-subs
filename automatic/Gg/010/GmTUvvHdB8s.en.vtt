is a essentially two things combined
into<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.530> little<00:01:26.490> weed<00:01:26.850> light<00:01:27.150> blue<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
into one little weed light blue it's a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.920 
into one little weed light blue it's a
little<00:01:30.690> weave<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:32.460> standard<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.630> with

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
little weave here the standard we with

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.960 
little weave here the standard we with
my<00:01:34.080> hands<00:01:34.470> cross<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.610> pendulum<00:01:36.440> which<00:01:37.970> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
my hands cross with a pendulum which is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.249 
my hands cross with a pendulum which is
a<00:01:39.030> half<00:01:39.360> circle<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:40.820> then<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> point<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.900> either

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a half circle and then a point on either

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.920 
a half circle and then a point on either
side<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.190> looks<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.880> half<00:01:45.420> circle

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
side it looks like this half circle

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
side it looks like this half circle
point<00:01:46.970> point<00:01:47.970> point<00:01:48.119> half<00:01:48.990> circle<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
point point point half circle and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.200 
point point point half circle and
essentially<00:01:50.810> if<00:01:51.810> you're<00:01:52.140> at<00:01:52.380> three<00:01:52.800> o'clock

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
essentially if you're at three o'clock

and get your boy head over here to nine
o'clock<00:01:58.070> from<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.340> instead<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.940> continuing

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
o'clock from here instead of continuing

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.469 
o'clock from here instead of continuing
the<00:02:00.840> circle<00:02:01.290> over<00:02:01.680> you're<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.610> sustain

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the circle over you're going to sustain

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.760 
the circle over you're going to sustain
it<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:03.810> guide<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.080> across<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.840> my<00:02:06.840> hot<00:02:07.200> guy

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it and guide it across so my hot guy

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.320 
it and guide it across so my hot guy
that

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.880 
that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
can almost think of it as making a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.690 
can almost think of it as making a
little<00:02:13.640> smile<00:02:13.880> with<00:02:14.330> your<00:02:14.750> poise<00:02:15.459> same<00:02:16.459> thing

from here we'll start with the top of
our<00:03:10.400> pendulum<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.959> we're<00:03:12.080> going<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.290> ride

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
our pendulum so we're going to ride

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.660 
our pendulum so we're going to ride
across<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> top<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> point<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:15.200> point

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
across the top to a point the point

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.059 
across the top to a point the point
starts<00:03:16.670> from<00:03:16.819> behind<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.269> scoop<00:03:18.019> beer<00:03:18.620> and

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
starts from behind a scoop beer and

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.490 
starts from behind a scoop beer and
lives<00:03:19.700> directly<00:03:19.940> in<00:03:20.239> front<00:03:20.269> of<00:03:20.540> us<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:20.959> from

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
lives directly in front of us and from

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.020 
lives directly in front of us and from
here<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.310> where<00:03:22.400> you're<00:03:22.550> going<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.730> do<00:03:22.819> a

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
here this is where you're going to do a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.700 
here this is where you're going to do a
little<00:03:23.090> half<00:03:23.569> of<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.810> week

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.600 

get<00:03:28.310> back<00:03:28.580> scoop<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.950> you're<00:03:31.160> half<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.550> a

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
get back scoop so you're half of a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.140 
get back scoop so you're half of a
pendulum<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.720> then

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
pendulum and then

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:44.660 
pendulum and then
scoop

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:04:07.440 

so<00:03:45.670> other<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.800> from<00:04:06.130> here<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:06.640> do<00:04:07.060> loosen

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
so other and from here you do loosen

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.440 
so other and from here you do loosen
your<00:04:07.540> grip<00:04:07.600> little<00:04:08.470> weave<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.880> disguise<00:04:10.270> are

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
your grip little weave so disguise are

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.630 
your grip little weave so disguise are
on<00:04:10.510> your<00:04:10.630> finger

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
on your finger

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:22.520 
on your finger
come<00:04:12.030> back<00:04:12.319> please<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:13.740> figure<00:04:14.069> it<00:04:14.900> around

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.790 

practice<00:04:23.370> on<00:04:23.520> let's<00:04:23.910> go<00:04:24.120> many<00:04:24.570> hoops<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.230> when

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
practice on let's go many hoops and when

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.470 
practice on let's go many hoops and when
you<00:04:26.040> get<00:04:26.220> comfortable<00:04:26.370> we<00:04:26.880> will<00:04:27.060> move<00:04:27.300> on

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
you get comfortable we will move on

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.110 
you get comfortable we will move on
these

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.460 

so<00:04:34.139> combining<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.830> two<00:04:36.099> movements<00:04:37.470> that's

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
so combining the two movements that's

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.619 
so combining the two movements that's
where<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.740> gets<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:39.009> little<00:04:39.160> bit<00:04:39.400> tricky<00:04:39.910> the

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
where it gets a little bit tricky the

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:49.379 
where it gets a little bit tricky the
movement<00:04:40.870> is<00:04:42.840> split<00:04:43.840> time<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:47.909> at<00:04:48.909> first<00:04:49.120> it

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
movement is split time and at first it

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.610 
movement is split time and at first it
might<00:04:49.419> be<00:04:49.659> a<00:04:49.690> little<00:04:49.900> bit<00:04:50.110> overwhelming<00:04:50.560> but

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
might be a little bit overwhelming but

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.710 
might be a little bit overwhelming but
you<00:04:51.520> really<00:04:51.789> just<00:04:52.060> want<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.360> be<00:04:52.479> comfortable

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
you really just want to be comfortable

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.999 
you really just want to be comfortable
with<00:04:53.560> your<00:04:54.490> pendulum<00:04:54.849> scoop<00:04:55.360> we've<00:04:56.349> seek<00:04:56.710> with

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
with your pendulum scoop we've seek with

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:03.059 
with your pendulum scoop we've seek with
in<00:04:57.789> each<00:04:57.970> hand<00:05:00.509> because<00:05:01.770> we're<00:05:02.770> essentially

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
in each hand because we're essentially

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.860 
in each hand because we're essentially
going<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.400> be<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.550> couple<00:05:03.759> steps<00:05:04.210> part<00:05:04.629> with<00:05:04.840> me

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
going to be a couple steps part with me

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.770 
going to be a couple steps part with me
