00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.520
 ah 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.190
 in the first option we start 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.670
 dividing the hair into two partitions 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.930
 and we hold one so it does not bother us 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.850
 we take a lock of three divided into three 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.650
 partitions and let's make a braid 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.420
 of root crossed on the inside when 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.200
 we cross the strands of the ends 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:34.250
 we add hair we cross add 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:38.110
 hair we cross and we add hair and 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.110
 we do the same in each crossing 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.460
 we keep braiding normal 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.530
 and we hold the braid with a rubber band 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.630
 small now on the other side we do 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.720
 another cross-rooted inheritance inside 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.280
 we crossed we added hair we crossed 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.280

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.700
 30 normal mos 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.590

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.090
 At the station we start by taking a lock 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.960
 from the top and we make a 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.960

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.200
 we take the hair from the sides 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.489
 we divide a partition into two and we do 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.489
 another braid 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.870
