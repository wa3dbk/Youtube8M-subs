 various parts of the body 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.280
 its creators marÃ­a de la luz aranda and 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.399
 antonio rosete made them popular 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.500
 first in his home state tlaxcala but 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.800
 his fame came to Puebla and Hidalgo 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.079
 Mexico City where in the year 1880 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.809
 they became the national company of 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.809
 automata brothers rosete aranda for 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.570
 then they already grouped 1300 puppets and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.789
 for 1900 they became more than 5,000 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.490
 all the cultures of the world have had 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:05.850
 the puppets even if you want 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.040
 the Greek theater was first with dolls 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 in bilbao guatemala 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 in the archaeological zone there is a wake 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.540
 where is a character moving a 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.030
 glove puppet but very clear 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 very clear the puppets carved in 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 colored wood and the little faces 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.000
 polished with the ancient technique of 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.010
 burnished with pork bladder played 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.690
 together with the child a fundamental role 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.730
 in the history of theater and society 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.750
 Mexican , hence the proposal of the 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.150
 professor sergio montero 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.490
 it is possible that at some point 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.310
 they came to use again and it's a 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.260
 which I proposed always because 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.740
 put the puppets in a showcase 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.100
 stop being puppets are made to 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.100
 the action 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.140
 800 dolls in a room 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.760
 the agency bored with it the project of 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.830
 restoration directed by the teacher 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.630
 montero seeks to recover memory 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.520
 historical of the puppets in the country 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.790
 established by the company rosete 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.790
