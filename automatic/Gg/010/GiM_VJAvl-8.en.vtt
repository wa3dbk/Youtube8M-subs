hey<00:00:01.170> there<00:00:01.380> everybody<00:00:01.530> collector<00:00:02.070> here<00:00:02.250> and

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hey there everybody collector here and

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey there everybody collector here and
today<00:00:02.639> I'm<00:00:02.909> going<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.149> show<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.419> how<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.750> can

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
today I'm going to show you how you can

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.349 
today I'm going to show you how you can
make<00:00:04.140> an<00:00:04.319> analog<00:00:04.799> drum<00:00:05.040> machine<00:00:05.460> using<00:00:06.299> a

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
make an analog drum machine using a

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.390 
make an analog drum machine using a
subtractive<00:00:06.870> synthesizer<00:00:07.290> so<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.099> need<00:00:08.250> at

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
subtractive synthesizer so you need at

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.910 
subtractive synthesizer so you need at
least<00:00:08.429> two<00:00:08.820> things<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.679> basic

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
least two things and that is a basic

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.910 
least two things and that is a basic
oscillator<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:12.809> noise<00:00:13.049> generator<00:00:13.650> as<00:00:13.860> well

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
oscillator and a noise generator as well

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.980 
oscillator and a noise generator as well
as<00:00:14.730> an<00:00:15.570> envelope<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:17.390> we're<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.720> want<00:00:18.869> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
as an envelope so we're going to want to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.050 
as an envelope so we're going to want to
use<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> envelope<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.800> pitch<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
use the envelope for pitch but on the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.670 
use the envelope for pitch but on the
Pulver<00:00:21.390> setter<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:22.050> don't<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.410> an<00:00:22.560> envelope

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
Pulver setter we don't have an envelope

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.040 
Pulver setter we don't have an envelope
for<00:00:23.039> pitch<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:24.000> do<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.689> assign

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
for pitch so what we can do is assign

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
for pitch so what we can do is assign
the<00:00:25.230> LFO<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.740> work<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.130> sort<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.400> one-shot

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the LFO to work in a sort of one-shot

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.050 
the LFO to work in a sort of one-shot
mode<00:00:27.269> by<00:00:27.779> using<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.230> trigger<00:00:28.529> button

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
mode by using the trigger button

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.279 
mode by using the trigger button
basically<00:00:30.060> what<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> trigger<00:00:30.570> button<00:00:30.929> does

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
basically what the trigger button does

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.700 
basically what the trigger button does
is<00:00:31.560> every<00:00:31.890> time<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.989> notice<00:00:33.989> hit<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> LFO

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
is every time a notice hit the LFO

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
is every time a notice hit the LFO
resets<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.510> basically<00:00:37.020> use

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
resets so you can kind of basically use

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.979 
resets so you can kind of basically use
it<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> one-shot<00:00:38.010> effect<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.840> our

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it like a one-shot effect so we have our

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.590 
it like a one-shot effect so we have our
ask<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.440> set<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> set<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
ask one set here I'm going to set the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.110 
ask one set here I'm going to set the
LFO<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> ask<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> set<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
LFO to ask one then I'm going to set the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.840 
LFO to ask one then I'm going to set the
depth<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.719> negative<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> hundred<00:00:46.500> percent<00:00:46.850> this

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
depth to negative a hundred percent this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.200 
depth to negative a hundred percent this
should<00:00:48.059> make<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> downward<00:00:48.750> pitch<00:00:49.940> I'm<00:00:50.940> going

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
should make a downward pitch I'm going

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.400 
should make a downward pitch I'm going
to<00:00:51.270> set<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.289> LFO<00:00:52.949> waveform<00:00:53.579> type<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.960> ramp

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
to set the LFO waveform type to ramp

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.459 
to set the LFO waveform type to ramp
here<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.449> should<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:57.870> sort<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
here so that should make sort of a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:11.080 
here so that should make sort of a
downwards<00:00:59.340> pitch<00:00:59.640> sound<00:00:59.910> let's<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:04.040> okay<00:01:05.040> so

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.760 

we<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> hear<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.470> we're<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
we can hear that so what we're going to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.140 
we can hear that so what we're going to
want<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:16.790> adjust<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> amplitude

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
want to do now is adjust the amplitude

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.200 
want to do now is adjust the amplitude
envelope<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.189> only<00:01:20.369> goes<00:01:20.640> down<00:01:20.880> one

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
envelope so that it only goes down one

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.960 
envelope so that it only goes down one
time<00:01:21.509> instead<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.320> continuing<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.930> repeating

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
time instead of continuing the repeating

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
time instead of continuing the repeating
so<00:01:26.970> let's<00:01:27.270> set<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.470> I'm<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> set

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
so let's set this here I'm going to set

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:38.319 
so let's set this here I'm going to set
the<00:01:29.100> decay<00:01:29.549> turn<00:01:30.390> off<00:01:30.540> sustain<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.350> release

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:52.789 

now<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> modify<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.079> rate<00:01:40.409> value

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.680 

okay<00:01:53.799> so<00:01:54.280> as<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.580> can<00:01:54.729> hear<00:01:55.030> we<00:01:55.060> have<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.390> sort

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
okay so as you can hear we have a sort

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.450 
okay so as you can hear we have a sort
of<00:01:55.750> basic<00:01:55.810> kick<00:01:56.530> sound<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.530> now<00:01:59.860> we're<00:02:00.340> going

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
of basic kick sound so now we're going

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.969 
of basic kick sound so now we're going
to<00:02:00.549> want<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.759> do<00:02:00.940> is<00:02:01.380> we're<00:02:02.380> going<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.530> add<00:02:02.740> a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
to want to do is we're going to add a

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.150 
to want to do is we're going to add a
noise<00:02:03.310> oscillator<00:02:07.709> okay<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.009> doesn't

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
noise oscillator okay so that doesn't

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.820 
noise oscillator okay so that doesn't
really<00:02:09.280> sound<00:02:09.610> like<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.910> kick<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:11.319> here's

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
really sound like a kick but here's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.750 
really sound like a kick but here's
where<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.100> interesting<00:02:12.940> part<00:02:13.150> comes<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:14.760> what

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
where the interesting part comes in what

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.860 
where the interesting part comes in what
we're<00:02:15.880> going<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.060> do<00:02:16.239> is<00:02:16.420> we're<00:02:16.569> going<00:02:16.600> to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.900 
we're going to do is we're going to
assign<00:02:17.080> keyboard<00:02:17.620> tracking<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.550> filter

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
assign keyboard tracking to the filter

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.540 
assign keyboard tracking to the filter
frequency<00:02:19.380> which<00:02:20.380> will<00:02:20.560> mean<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.709> low<00:02:21.280> notes

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
frequency which will mean that low notes

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.400 
frequency which will mean that low notes
will<00:02:22.030> play<00:02:22.239> without<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.720> noise<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.200> high

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
will play without the noise and high

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.050 
will play without the noise and high
notes<00:02:23.650> will<00:02:23.920> play<00:02:24.070> with<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> noise<00:02:24.610> in

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
notes will play with the noise in

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.090 
notes will play with the noise in
between<00:02:25.930> will<00:02:26.470> play<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:27.040> combination<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.120> noise

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
between will play a combination of noise

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.140 
between will play a combination of noise
because<00:02:30.100> basically<00:02:30.310> what<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.970> keyboard

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
because basically what the keyboard

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390 
because basically what the keyboard
tracking<00:02:31.750> does<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.380> slowly<00:02:32.709> opens<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
tracking does is it slowly opens the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.309 
tracking does is it slowly opens the
filter<00:02:33.730> as<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.390> notes<00:02:34.600> go<00:02:34.780> upward<00:02:35.110> on<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
filter as the notes go upward on the

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.640 
filter as the notes go upward on the
keyboard<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:36.030> way<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.480> very<00:02:38.140> high-end

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
keyboard that way you have very high-end

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.220 
keyboard that way you have very high-end
as<00:02:38.830> hats<00:02:39.100> very<00:02:39.970> low<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.360> this<00:02:40.540> kicks<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:41.080> the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
as hats very low in this kicks in the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.500 
as hats very low in this kicks in the
middle<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.590> use<00:02:41.830> as<00:02:41.980> snares<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:43.360> let's

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
middle you can use as snares so let's

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.570 
middle you can use as snares so let's
try<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.470> adjust<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.890> frequency<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.400> bit

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
try that and adjust the frequency a bit

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:16.770 
try that and adjust the frequency a bit
so<00:02:51.850> we<00:02:51.970> don't<00:02:52.120> really<00:02:52.209> hear<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.630> noise<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.690> as

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
so we don't really hear the noise so as

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.780 
so we don't really hear the noise so as
you<00:03:16.900> can<00:03:17.019> see<00:03:17.079> here<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.739> just<00:03:18.040> kind<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.459> move<00:03:18.640> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
you can see here I just kind of move the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.340 
you can see here I just kind of move the
note<00:03:19.000> up<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.269> bit<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.540> gives<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.840> sort<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.109> little

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
note up a bit and gives a sort of little

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:33.560 
note up a bit and gives a sort of little
snare<00:03:20.950> sound<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:31.269> now<00:03:31.420> if<00:03:31.630> we<00:03:31.750> go<00:03:31.870> all<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.200> way

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
snare sound so now if we go all the way

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:42.089 
snare sound so now if we go all the way
to<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.690> top<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:35.109> our<00:03:35.230> notes<00:03:35.500> here

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.179 

we<00:03:43.099> can<00:03:43.280> add<00:03:43.489> hats<00:03:43.790> now<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:45.620> routing<00:03:46.010> options

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
we can add hats now the routing options

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.459 
we can add hats now the routing options
on<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.670> poker<00:03:46.969> set<00:03:47.150> are<00:03:47.329> a<00:03:47.359> little<00:03:47.540> limited<00:03:47.780> if

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:48.469 
on the poker set are a little limited if

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.349 
on the poker set are a little limited if
there<00:03:48.709> was<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:48.859> few<00:03:49.129> more<00:03:49.340> features<00:03:49.790> where<00:03:50.209> you

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
there was a few more features where you

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.910 
there was a few more features where you
could<00:03:50.540> route<00:03:50.780> keyboard<00:03:51.260> tracking<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.769> other

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
could route keyboard tracking to other

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.890 
could route keyboard tracking to other
parameters<00:03:52.519> this<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.329> where<00:03:53.480> you'd<00:03:53.629> want<00:03:53.659> to

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
parameters this is where you'd want to

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.880 
parameters this is where you'd want to
use<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.230> if<00:03:54.379> you're<00:03:54.530> using<00:03:54.560> another

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
use it if you're using another

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.220 
use it if you're using another
synthesizer<00:03:55.579> but<00:03:56.480> since<00:03:56.780> we<00:03:56.900> don't<00:03:56.989> have<00:03:57.109> that

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
synthesizer but since we don't have that

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.589 
synthesizer but since we don't have that
I'm<00:03:58.219> just<00:03:58.519> going<00:03:58.609> to<00:03:58.700> manually<00:03:59.180> shorten<00:03:59.540> the

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
I'm just going to manually shorten the

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:18.720 
I'm just going to manually shorten the
notes<00:03:59.840> that<00:04:03.430> way<00:04:04.430> they<00:04:04.579> sound<00:04:04.790> more<00:04:04.879> like<00:04:05.030> hats

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.900 

okay<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:19.790> that's<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:21.199> very<00:04:21.500> basic<00:04:22.100> idea<00:04:22.610> of

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
okay so that's the very basic idea of

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.510 
okay so that's the very basic idea of
how<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.389> get<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.750> drum<00:04:23.960> kit<00:04:24.169> started<00:04:24.680> now<00:04:25.460> the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
how to get the drum kit started now the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.400 
how to get the drum kit started now the
interesting<00:04:25.880> thing<00:04:26.090> about<00:04:26.630> making<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.169> drum

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
interesting thing about making a drum

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.250 
interesting thing about making a drum
kit<00:04:27.680> with<00:04:27.710> an<00:04:27.979> analog<00:04:28.280> synthesizer<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:29.260> that

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
kit with an analog synthesizer is that

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.050 
kit with an analog synthesizer is that
there<00:04:30.710> is<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.860> very<00:04:31.130> wide<00:04:31.460> range<00:04:31.520> of

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
there is a very wide range of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.500 
there is a very wide range of
flexibility<00:04:32.720> in<00:04:33.020> automating<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.710> parameters

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
flexibility in automating the parameters

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.950 
flexibility in automating the parameters
for<00:04:35.510> example

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
for example

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:45.360 
for example
I<00:04:38.080> could<00:04:39.080> add<00:04:39.199> in<00:04:39.380> some<00:04:39.770> filter<00:04:40.160> envelope<00:04:40.310> here

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:05:01.450 

or<00:04:46.370> play<00:04:46.580> with<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:46.820> filter<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:01.010> that's<00:05:01.280> the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
or play with the filter so that's the

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.670 
or play with the filter so that's the
basic<00:05:01.790> gist<00:05:02.060> of<00:05:02.330> how<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:02.810> make<00:05:03.169> an<00:05:03.320> analog

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
basic gist of how you make an analog

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.770 
basic gist of how you make an analog
drum<00:05:03.860> machine<00:05:04.280> it's<00:05:05.240> pretty<00:05:05.510> interesting

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
drum machine it's pretty interesting

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.810 
drum machine it's pretty interesting
especially<00:05:06.560> if<00:05:06.770> you<00:05:07.039> have<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.280> synthesizer

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
especially if you have a synthesizer

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.740 
especially if you have a synthesizer
that<00:05:08.210> has<00:05:08.990> split<00:05:09.680> mode<00:05:09.950> or<00:05:10.220> more<00:05:11.150> interesting

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
that has split mode or more interesting

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.080 
that has split mode or more interesting
options<00:05:12.199> for<00:05:12.470> multiple<00:05:12.650> patches<00:05:13.310> in<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.729> single

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
options for multiple patches in a single

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.760 
options for multiple patches in a single
program

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
program

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.950 
program
so<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.250> could<00:05:16.490> create<00:05:16.639> drum<00:05:17.090> sounds<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.720> drum

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
so you could create drum sounds and drum

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.440 
so you could create drum sounds and drum
loops<00:05:18.260> with<00:05:19.010> your<00:05:19.190> analog<00:05:19.430> synthesizer<00:05:20.060> and

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
loops with your analog synthesizer and

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.510 
loops with your analog synthesizer and
of<00:05:20.570> course<00:05:20.780> automated<00:05:21.380> as<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.919> track<00:05:22.190> goes<00:05:22.400> on

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
of course automated as the track goes on

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.510 
of course automated as the track goes on
to<00:05:22.700> create<00:05:22.789> some<00:05:23.030> very<00:05:23.210> interesting<00:05:23.479> rhythms

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
to create some very interesting rhythms

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.710 
to create some very interesting rhythms
anyways<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.550> hope<00:05:25.820> you<00:05:25.910> have<00:05:26.090> some<00:05:26.330> fun<00:05:26.539> with

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
anyways I hope you have some fun with

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.210 
anyways I hope you have some fun with
this<00:05:26.810> idea<00:05:27.200> this<00:05:27.919> is<00:05:28.130> electro<00:05:28.550> signing<00:05:29.060> out
