00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.160 

hi<00:00:01.589> guys<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:02.129> use<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.909> lot<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.270> these<00:00:03.389> 9-volt

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
hi guys I use a lot of these 9-volt

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.950 
hi guys I use a lot of these 9-volt
batteries<00:00:04.740> for<00:00:04.980> my<00:00:05.009> toy<00:00:05.160> projects<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.690> fact

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
batteries for my toy projects in fact

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.660 
batteries for my toy projects in fact
I've<00:00:07.049> got<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.379> many<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.770> them<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.370> never

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
I've got so many of them that I never

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.720 
I've got so many of them that I never
need<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.000> buy<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:10.230> connectors<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.980> just

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
need to buy the connectors I just

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.530 
need to buy the connectors I just
recycle<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> old<00:00:12.660> batteries<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.910> do<00:00:14.910> as<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.269> open

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
recycle the old batteries I do as I open

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.840 
recycle the old batteries I do as I open
them<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:21.859> probably<00:00:22.859> best<00:00:23.070> if<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.250> wear<00:00:23.519> gloves

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
them up probably best if you wear gloves

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:44.840 
them up probably best if you wear gloves
so<00:00:24.289> you<00:00:25.289> don't<00:00:25.470> get<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> sharp<00:00:26.250> bits<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> there

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so you don't get the sharp bits so there

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.330 
so you don't get the sharp bits so there
we<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.700> reuse<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.190> what<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> do

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
we go you can reuse that and what I do

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.670 
we go you can reuse that and what I do
rather<00:00:51.120> than<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.420> reuse<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
rather than just reuse it as it is I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.360 
rather than just reuse it as it is I
solder<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:57.260> switch<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> can

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
solder a little switch on it so I can

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.010 
solder a little switch on it so I can
actually<00:00:59.760> use<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> switch<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.809> power

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
actually use it as a switch to power

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:15.249 
actually use it as a switch to power
supply<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.900> we're<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> cut<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.530> off

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.499 

it's<00:01:15.799> best<00:01:16.039> if<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:16.369> foil<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:16.969> surface

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
it's best if you just foil the surface

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.590 
it's best if you just foil the surface
so<00:01:18.350> we<00:01:18.500> can<00:01:18.619> get<00:01:18.740> down<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.280> base<00:01:19.460> metal<00:01:19.759> for

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
so we can get down to the base metal for

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:41.649 
so we can get down to the base metal for
making<00:01:21.079> a<00:01:21.140> good<00:01:21.289> solder<00:01:21.969> connection<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:41.509> then

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
making a good solder connection and then

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.450 
making a good solder connection and then
all<00:01:41.780> I'm<00:01:41.929> going<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.079> do<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.619> connect<00:01:43.100> this<00:01:45.460> onto

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
all I'm going to do is connect this onto

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.669 
all I'm going to do is connect this onto
one<00:01:46.670> side<00:01:47.000> or<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.240> other<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:48.170> your<00:01:48.380> choice

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
one side or the other it's your choice

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.230 
one side or the other it's your choice
whether<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.280> want<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.580> be<00:01:49.670> positive<00:01:50.149> or

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
whether you want to be positive or

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.940 
whether you want to be positive or
negative<00:01:50.360> for<00:01:50.929> your<00:01:51.080> switch<00:01:51.319> I<00:01:53.799> prefer<00:01:54.799> to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
negative for your switch I prefer to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.339 
negative for your switch I prefer to
have<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.069> on<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.369> positive<00:01:55.789> side<00:01:56.170> which<00:01:57.170> will

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
have it on the positive side which will

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.979 
have it on the positive side which will
be<00:01:57.470> that<00:01:57.649> one<00:01:58.270> remember<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.659> reverse

00:01:59.979 --> 00:01:59.989 
be that one remember this is the reverse

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:08.109 
be that one remember this is the reverse
of<00:02:00.349> the<00:02:00.439> actual<00:02:00.799> factoring<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.520> I'll<00:02:07.640> solder

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
of the actual factoring so I'll solder

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.250 
of the actual factoring so I'll solder
that<00:02:08.149> on

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.890 

and<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.519> trim<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.849> little<00:02:15.000> bit<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.390> off<00:02:15.629> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and if you trim a little bit of off the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.399 
and if you trim a little bit of off the
edge

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
edge

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:28.910 
edge
so<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.069> switch<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:18.060> go<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.420> bit<00:02:18.569> further<00:02:27.920> go

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
so the switch can go in a bit further go

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.380 
so the switch can go in a bit further go
now<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.159> can<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:29.720> two<00:02:30.720> legs<00:02:31.760> soldered<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.879> place

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:49.820 

make<00:02:39.390> sure<00:02:39.420> we've<00:02:39.930> tuned<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.410> surface<00:02:40.890> first

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.710 

this<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> little<00:02:51.000> switch<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.450> I've

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
this is a little switch that I've

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.740 
this is a little switch that I've
recovered<00:02:51.990> out<00:02:52.260> something<00:02:52.770> else<00:02:53.600> that's<00:02:54.600> why

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
recovered out something else that's why

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:05.559 
recovered out something else that's why
it's<00:02:54.900> got<00:02:55.020> wires<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.650> already

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.670 

now<00:03:06.569> we<00:03:06.629> need<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> add<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.049> piece<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.439> wire<00:03:07.650> to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
now we need to add a piece of wire to

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.190 
now we need to add a piece of wire to
their<00:03:08.159> piece<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.730> wire<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.090> there<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:10.019> we're

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
their piece of wire to there and we're

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.220 
their piece of wire to there and we're
done<00:03:11.060> put<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> bit<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.269> red<00:03:12.480> insulation<00:03:13.140> on

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
done put a bit of red insulation on

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.569 
done put a bit of red insulation on
there<00:03:13.439> to<00:03:13.560> remind<00:03:13.799> me<00:03:14.010> which<00:03:14.159> one's<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.549> to

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
there to remind me which one's going to

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.780 
there to remind me which one's going to
be<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.819> positive<00:03:16.129> which<00:03:17.129> again<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.609> going<00:03:17.700> to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
be the positive which again is going to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.530 
be the positive which again is going to
be<00:03:17.909> the<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.750> goes<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.230> switch<00:03:20.540> I'll

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
be the one that goes to the switch I'll

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.280 
be the one that goes to the switch I'll
just<00:03:21.750> give<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.079> nice<00:03:22.230> layer<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.620> hot<00:03:22.980> glue

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:04:02.410 

spread<00:03:28.290> nicely

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:42.760 

there<00:04:03.420> we<00:04:03.600> go

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.980 

drop<00:04:43.770> down
