00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.490
 we're back and now I'm receiving 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.779
 here in the studio doctor melina de abre 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.119
 who will talk a little bit for us 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.940
 about orthodontic appliance good morning 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.220
 doctor rca good, we'll start 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.690
 with that basic question that everything 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.510
 world has a doubt as to what age 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.730
 you can place the appliance with this 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.160
 doubt one of the most frequent consultant 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.770
 uÃ© and you can put the device 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.900
 from 4 years old around 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.910
 that is when we can already have 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.340
 started early treatment since 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.579
 Child patient collaboration 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.040
 and parents also to cimpor that people 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.710
 thinks four years is a very young age 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.750
 yet what are the reasons that lead to 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.800
 mother already with the athlete a son of four 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.020
 years to seek treatment 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.760
 we usually find one more 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.829
 those patients who have the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.300
 open bite is one that you 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.189
 patients who can not close the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.590
 mouth in the anterior region, the patient 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.810
 can not bite a food then 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.450
 this is usually generated by patients 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.280
 who sucks the finger or use pacifiers and 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.780
 also we have crossed the bites 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.609
 which are normally identified by the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.249
 pediatric dentistry and are referred to 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.649
 treatment with orthodontics 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:23.810
 but there the child who is four years old she 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.999
 not yet changed all the patients, right? 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.310
 they are not fixed appliances do not win 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:30.979
 orthopedic appliances that will 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.049
 work on bone remodeling and also 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.329
 muscle that child making it 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.429
 this orthodontic problem does not 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.649
 it does not turn into surgery for 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.740
 this patient are then cases well 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.630
 treated at this stage in the city and 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.450
 has good results in the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.069
 clinic on a daily basis with that but then 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.219
 So how will I tell him the gift? 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.469
 othon padco she wears it for a while and 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.599
 then it is mandatory to use 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.700
 orthodontic treatment or may correct it 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.039
 nor need an occlusion many times she 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.539
 It is already corrected at that stage ahead 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.479
 when to change permanent teeth 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.639
 he does not need the latter normally 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.250
 you will not need to use any fixed day 

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:12.830
 some cases we can already 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.830
 identify this already at that stage of origin 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.140
 from parents 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.210
 has a break in treatment and then 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.190
 they come back cart make and continue the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.990
 fixed treatment plus a case of a 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.100
 much lighter than it would be if the 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.750
 people had not dealt with that 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.670
 early moment 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.430
 So you, Mom, there's a 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.500
 four-year-old son who noticed that he 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.420
 do not change the crusader any difficulty 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.070
 Did not do it right, you can search the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.740
 treatment also that it is going 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.750
 using this orthopedic device is that 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.130
 will prevent further problems ahead and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.920
 for those already with the old one 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.780
 little teenager already has the 10 and 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.550
 that you need to know what the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.900
 procedural principles means that the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.970
 step by step 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.930
 usually the orthodontist receives this 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.340
 General clinical forwarded right patient 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.709
 dentist or mother already looking 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.540
 directly orthodontist then the 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.790
 procedure would be initial 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.620
 first request request from 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.220
 documentation at the diagnostic clinic 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.990
 by image consists of photos 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.610
 radiographs and study models for 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.770
 that we can plan 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.900
 make a diagnosis and draw a 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.750
 planning for these patients 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.550
 and then the second consult the people 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.260
 with more as treatment be it 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.870
 orthopedic approach that would be a 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.030
 that is, it would be another 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.200
 line garden of work that people 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.080
 but the treatment already 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.930
 soon the pair it important the visits 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.989
 monthly netter and optics they need 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.600
 Yes, it's monthly because of the activation 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.980
 this device because the treatment he is 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.440
 counted from the number of 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.230
 maintenance in the case of treatment of 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.989
 two years 24 months would have to be 24 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.820
 maintenance would be 24 months 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.980
 the patient sees the consultant do 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.680
 treatment in the case of that patient who 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.720
 lack and all his treatment with 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.790
 sure will have to be rented for that 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.620
 Why those maintenances? 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.680
 need to be made they need to have 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.820
 actions to be taken to ensure that a 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.120
 occurs the way we programmed it. 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.580
 if it does not go the treatment time 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.770
 consequently it will be increased 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.180
 It is actually I experience 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.360
 then you want air conditioner does not 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.360
 maintenance
