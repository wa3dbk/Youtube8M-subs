glass here's um here's what I use to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.170

better<00:00:40.880> wants<00:00:41.270> this<00:00:41.390> dries<00:00:41.720> because<00:00:42.079> all<00:00:42.890> that

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
better wants this dries because all that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.979 
better wants this dries because all that
dust<00:00:43.400> basically<00:00:44.030> what<00:00:44.180> it<00:00:44.270> does<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.630> that<00:00:44.810> more

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
dust basically what it does is that more

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.170 
dust basically what it does is that more
or<00:00:45.020> less<00:00:45.110> just<00:00:45.200> forces<00:00:45.829> it<00:00:45.950> out<00:00:46.100> of<00:00:46.250> out<00:00:46.970> of<00:00:47.030> the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
or less just forces it out of out of the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.900 
or less just forces it out of out of the
gap<00:00:47.950> you<00:00:48.950> know<00:00:49.040> that<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.340> put<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.579> bondo<00:00:49.880> in

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
gap you know that you put the bondo in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.040 
gap you know that you put the bondo in
and<00:00:50.420> then<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:50.690> won't<00:00:50.780> work<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:52.930> since<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:54.020> don't

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
and then it won't work so since I don't

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.479 
and then it won't work so since I don't
have<00:00:54.260> an<00:00:54.350> air<00:00:54.440> compressor<00:00:54.590> this<00:00:55.190> is<00:00:55.340> what<00:00:55.460> I

camera here you just run a single line
all<00:01:47.859> the<00:01:48.069> way<00:01:48.130> across<00:01:49.530> through<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.619> center<00:01:50.890> of

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
all the way across through the center of

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.910 
all the way across through the center of
the<00:01:52.719> most<00:01:52.959> mass<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.409> your<00:01:53.530> bondo<00:01:53.859> and<00:01:55.920> that's

your question so you just go ahead and

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.520 
your question so you just go ahead and
mix<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.569> up<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:05.349> this<00:02:06.009> should<00:02:06.159> give<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.399> about

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530

20-25<00:02:08.530> minutes<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:10.479> should<00:02:10.660> be<00:02:10.780> more

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
20-25 minutes and that should be more

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.740 
20-25 minutes and that should be more

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.180 
then just just put it on there real
thick<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.810> then<00:02:29.079> you<00:02:29.170> want<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.410> hit<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.769> almost

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
thick and then you want to hit it almost

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.849 
thick and then you want to hit it almost
like<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> 90-degree<00:02:31.060> angle<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.900> forces<00:02:32.709> it

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
like a 90-degree angle so it forces it

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.319 
like a 90-degree angle so it forces it
inside<00:02:33.220> those<00:02:33.400> little<00:02:33.670> long<00:02:33.849> those<00:02:34.090> little

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
inside those little long those little

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.930 
inside those little long those little
gaps<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> little<00:02:36.099> bit<00:02:36.190> really<00:02:36.549> does<00:02:36.700> go<00:02:36.910> a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
gaps so a little bit really does go a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.259 
gaps so a little bit really does go a
long<00:02:37.150> way<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.160> I'll<00:02:39.160> hit<00:02:39.370> these<00:02:39.579> hit<00:02:40.120> these

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
long way so I'll hit these hit these

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.120 
long way so I'll hit these hit these
doors<00:02:40.569> again<00:02:40.630> with<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> little<00:02:41.169> bit<00:02:41.290> more<00:02:41.530> bondo

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
doors again with a little bit more bondo

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.970 
doors again with a little bit more bondo
and<00:02:42.660> then<00:02:43.660> I'll<00:02:44.230> show<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.680> finished

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
and then I'll show you the finished

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.409 
and then I'll show you the finished
result<00:02:47.489> okay<00:02:48.489> we<00:02:48.730> hit<00:02:48.910> him<00:02:49.030> one<00:02:49.209> more<00:02:49.389> time

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:49.419 
result okay we hit him one more time

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:54.780 
result okay we hit him one more time
with<00:02:49.959> Lyra<00:02:50.919> bondo<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:51.989> had<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.190> idea<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.519> don't

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
with Lyra bondo I had this idea I don't

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.979 
with Lyra bondo I had this idea I don't
know<00:02:54.849> whether<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.120> gonna<00:02:55.239> be<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> good<00:02:55.660> idea

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
know whether it's gonna be a good idea

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.920 
know whether it's gonna be a good idea
or<00:02:56.109> not<00:02:56.139> but<00:02:56.530> um<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:57.329> all<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.450> staple<00:02:58.810> marks

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
or not but um of all the staple marks

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.879 
or not but um of all the staple marks
and<00:02:59.169> everything<00:02:59.230> there's<00:02:59.680> kind<00:02:59.859> of

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
and everything there's kind of

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.229 
and everything there's kind of
deformities<00:03:00.430> right<00:03:00.609> here<00:03:00.790> because<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
deformities right here because the

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.170 
deformities right here because the
grille<00:03:01.510> fabric<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.380> used<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.760> just<00:03:03.970> went<00:03:04.120> ahead

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
grille fabric I used and just went ahead

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.360 
grille fabric I used and just went ahead
and<00:03:04.299> I'm<00:03:04.480> gonna<00:03:04.599> just<00:03:05.410> bond<00:03:05.680> all<00:03:05.829> over<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.130> top

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
and I'm gonna just bond all over the top

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.300 
and I'm gonna just bond all over the top
of<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:08.620> will<00:03:08.709> happen<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.250> will

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
of it and what will happen is it will

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.659 
of it and what will happen is it will

end up looking pretty smooth I got a

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.789 
end up looking pretty smooth I got a
better<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.329> did<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> better<00:03:13.959> job<00:03:14.109> on<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.620> one
