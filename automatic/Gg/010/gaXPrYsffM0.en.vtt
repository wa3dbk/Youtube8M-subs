00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.160
 i have wolverine away for you 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.470
 warrior looked at whether the movie really 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.890
 a drastic experience will be that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.890
 you will learn now 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.739
 fast 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.250
 and since 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.460
 In Bulgaria, of course, it's about 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.220
 our favorite logan from the x-men 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.050
 movie that has died after jones death 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.080
 Canada moved to the mountains and leads 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.940
 live there a very lonely hermit 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.580
 but then he meets one 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.470
 another mother who asks him to come along 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.000
 to come to Japan because you master yes 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.580
 China is dying 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.350
 and he wants to get away from wolverine 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.320
 Say goodbye to him then in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.960
 Nagasaki at the drop of the atomic bomb the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.210
 rescued life has reluctance goes logan 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.760
 with to japan and learns there that 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.190
 Company china has the opportunity for him 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.229
 his power his self-healing too 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.610
 take and make him mortal 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.770
 which really is really his biggest 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.660
 wish is the hook at the whole thing 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.060
 is only the force would then on the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.170
 master and that would do with it 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.240
 become immortal 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.850
 this unexpectedly dies, however 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.830
 already on the same evening and on the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.900
 burial then becomes an assassination 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.869
 his daughter the heir to the giant 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.490
 doing business and lying makes it 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.179
 of course, to the task of this 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.860
 to protect 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.240
 that that will not be easy 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.710
 clear to everyone 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.990
 I would like to work here 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.790
 no longer betraying that, of course 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.130
 main focus with the actors in 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.030
 wolverine on hugh jackman how could it 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.490
 be otherwise 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.500
 There is also no remainder to the rest of the cast 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.910
 much to say the only ones to me 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.140
 I personally noticed where I am 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.470
 thought I've known from 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.690
 other films are hiroyuki sanader den 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.780
 man from the last samurai for example 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.120
 knows and bryant at that time the tk in 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.340
 I personally played tokyo drift 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.650
 I was very happy that after x-men 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.240
 origins another movie about logan 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.760
 was turned over wolverine 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.280
 because let's face it wolverine is 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.319
 the darling of the x-men-film everyone 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.510
 want to know more about him everybody wants 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.010
 get more story set that has 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.650
 marvel with x-men origins too 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.120
 However, they tried it at the time 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.610
 not quite done because the movie was 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.410
 just too much heaped with lice 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.569
 and you do not really have a new story 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.830
 that's why I got over logan 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.450
 now hoping that maybe 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.090
 wolverine creates the warrior's way 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.220
 unfortunately there is the x-men vacation too 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.000
 again a bit disappointed because you 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.310
 gets a new story set out 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.620
 however, that you are not exactly 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.840
 When does this story know now? 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.450
 it is between x-men 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.510
 origins under trilogy it is after the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.280
 triology you can not classify it 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.350
 that's what you think about a lot in the cinema 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.240
 after and pay attention to some already almost 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.830
 not really on the story again 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.380
 Grad happened mainly on the canvas 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.700
 that's really a shame a 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.860
 little spark hope there is 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.510
 but then because of the credits 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.550
 there is another scene and one 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.170
 you will notice that here too 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.090
 have worked a second 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.590
 or with origins a third 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.209
 to bring out part and maybe 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.780
 finally, you can do it in the third one 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.780
 second part to us a clever sorry too 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.030
 wolverine to deliver lodge 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.920
 You never know, maybe skin 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.400
 us this part then really from the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.260
 sorts 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.570
 because of this power gets the 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.000
 film by me 5 out of 10 points for everyone 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.250
 loyal x-men and wolverine followers is 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.470
 There is a movie theater movie, however 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.900
 your expectations a little down 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.670
 for the normal average 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.919
 Cinema visitors are the little cinema 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.400
 The movie can be as well up 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.630
 but wait for blu ray or dvd release 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.100
 Do not be sad now 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.479
