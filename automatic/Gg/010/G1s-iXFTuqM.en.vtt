all<00:00:02.669> right<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.500> 4.7<00:00:04.500> liter<00:00:04.529> Toyota

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
all right this is the 4.7 liter Toyota

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.190 
all right this is the 4.7 liter Toyota
Tundra<00:00:05.730> I've<00:00:06.629> been<00:00:06.779> getting<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> lot<00:00:07.020> of

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
Tundra I've been getting a lot of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.410 
Tundra I've been getting a lot of
questions<00:00:07.620> about<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.340> air<00:00:08.670> intake<00:00:09.000> valve<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
questions about the air intake valve and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.740 
questions about the air intake valve and
how<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.630> fix<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.639> well<00:00:11.639> not<00:00:11.910> fix<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:12.509> I

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
how you fix it well not fix it but I

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.600 
how you fix it well not fix it but I
guess<00:00:12.990> put<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> bandaid<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.280> your<00:00:14.429> truck

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
guess put a bandaid on it so your truck

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.359 
guess put a bandaid on it so your truck
will<00:00:14.759> run<00:00:14.880> all<00:00:15.000> right<00:00:15.859> two<00:00:16.859> things<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.250> go

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
will run all right two things I can go

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.150 
will run all right two things I can go
wrong<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:18.449> valve<00:00:18.690> keeps<00:00:18.930> sticking<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
wrong the valve keeps sticking or the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
wrong the valve keeps sticking or the
air<00:00:20.250> pumps<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.640> shot<00:00:20.820> valve<00:00:21.510> keeps<00:00:21.720> sticking

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
air pumps are shot valve keeps sticking

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.599 
air pumps are shot valve keeps sticking
is<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.859> easiest<00:00:23.100> problems<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.519> can

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
is one of the easiest problems you can

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.170 
is one of the easiest problems you can
have<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.810> pumps<00:00:25.140> are<00:00:25.230> shot<00:00:25.439> then

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
have with it the pumps are shot then

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.980 
have with it the pumps are shot then
well<00:00:27.180> I'll<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.320> how<00:00:28.500> both<00:00:28.740> work<00:00:29.039> here

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
well I'll show you how both work here

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.179 
well I'll show you how both work here
here's<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> valve<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.500> sometimes<00:00:31.890> sticks

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
here's the valve that sometimes sticks

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
here's the valve that sometimes sticks
gets<00:00:32.910> water<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.480> gets<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.840> cruddud

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
gets water in there and gets all cruddud

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
gets water in there and gets all cruddud
up<00:00:34.320> all<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> take<00:00:35.730> off<00:00:35.940> these<00:00:36.180> four

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
up all you do is take off these four

up all you do is take off these four
screws<00:00:38.059> take<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> top<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:42.440> get<00:00:43.440> inside<00:00:43.770> there

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
screws take the top off get inside there

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.950 
screws take the top off get inside there
you'll<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.280> valve<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.239> wd-40<00:00:45.809> or

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you'll see the valve get some wd-40 or

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.209 
you'll see the valve get some wd-40 or
something<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> work<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> back<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.920> forth<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
something to work it back and forth and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.260 
something to work it back and forth and
free<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.200> put<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.289> back<00:00:49.410> together

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
free it up and put it back together

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.900 
free it up and put it back together
reset<00:00:51.270> your<00:00:51.390> computer<00:00:51.870> clear<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.920> codes

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910

reset your computer clear all the codes
off<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.160> see<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.430> works

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
off it and see if that works

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.180 
off it and see if that works
worst<00:00:58.230> case<00:00:58.440> scenario<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:59.250> pumps<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.640> shot

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
worst case scenario your pumps are shot

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
worst case scenario your pumps are shot
what<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> did<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.329> went<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.719> behind<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
what I did is I went back behind the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
what I did is I went back behind the
motor<00:01:04.350> back<00:01:04.979> behind<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.489> air<00:01:05.700> intake

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
motor back behind the air intake

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.020 
motor back behind the air intake
manifold<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:07.340> don't<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.670> see<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
manifold I don't know if you can see it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.570 
manifold I don't know if you can see it
but<00:01:10.670> there's<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.729> clip<00:01:13.070> wiring<00:01:14.070> harness<00:01:14.369> back

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
but there's a clip wiring harness back

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.399 
but there's a clip wiring harness back
here<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.479> clips<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.869> behind<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> motor

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
here that clips in behind the motor

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.800 
here that clips in behind the motor
that's<00:01:17.280> where<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.640> air<00:01:17.820> pump<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that's where one air pump is you want to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.740 
that's where one air pump is you want to
plug<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> come<00:01:21.450> around<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
right there that runs the second pump

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.410 
right there that runs the second pump
that<00:01:35.719> actually<00:01:36.350> runs<00:01:36.829> down<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.070> into<00:01:37.609> the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
that actually runs down and into the
