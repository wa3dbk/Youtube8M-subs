source<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.230> environment<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
source in this environment is

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.529 
source in this environment is
interactive<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.660> dynamic<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.210> see

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
interactive and dynamic and you can see

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.119 
interactive and dynamic and you can see
it<00:00:57.690> creates<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.289> very<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.789> predictable<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
it creates this very and predictable and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:14.260 
it creates this very and predictable and
suspenseful<00:01:02.129> mood<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.090> interior

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.030 

now<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.480> is<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.720> vortex<00:01:16.200> power<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
now this is the vortex power it

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
now this is the vortex power it
generates<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:18.000> electromagnetic<00:01:18.390> field<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
generates an electromagnetic field that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.640 
generates an electromagnetic field that
pulls<00:01:19.800> metallic<00:01:20.580> objects<00:01:21.330> inside<00:01:21.690> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
pulls metallic objects inside the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
pulls metallic objects inside the
electric<00:01:22.980> rays<00:01:23.250> interact<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.030> everything

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
electric rays interact with everything

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380 
electric rays interact with everything
metallic<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.970> chargeable<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
metallic and chargeable and the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
metallic and chargeable and the
environment<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.410> can<00:01:28.620> clearly<00:01:28.980> see<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
environment you can clearly see that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.660 
environment you can clearly see that
here<00:01:30.120> when<00:01:31.110> creating<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.680> vortex<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.490> can

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
here when creating the vortex you can

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.940 
here when creating the vortex you can
see<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.270> operates<00:01:33.510> within<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.620> certain

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
see that it operates within a certain

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
see that it operates within a certain
range<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.570> when<00:01:36.900> objects

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
range you can see that when objects

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.330 
range you can see that when objects
approach<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.160> vorlix<00:01:38.580> they<00:01:39.120> respond<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.870> it

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
approach the vorlix they respond to it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.060 
approach the vorlix they respond to it
it<00:01:41.340> works<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.820> other<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:43.070> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it works the other way around to the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.760 
it works the other way around to the
vortex<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.940> be<00:01:45.150> used<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.570> gather<00:01:45.750> objects<00:01:46.560> as

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
vortex can be used to gather objects as

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.610 
vortex can be used to gather objects as
well<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.400> show<00:01:48.150> them<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.690> large<00:01:49.020> anime

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
well and show them at a large anime

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.330 
well and show them at a large anime
which<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:51.240> make<00:01:51.630> battles<00:01:52.290> more<00:01:52.710> fun<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
which will make battles more fun and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.160 
which will make battles more fun and
exciting<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.280> also<00:01:56.430> use<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.780> set

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
exciting you can also use it to set

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.280 
exciting you can also use it to set
traps<00:01:58.440> for<00:01:58.800> smaller<00:01:59.400> enemies<00:02:00.090> because<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
traps for smaller enemies because you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.760 
traps for smaller enemies because you
can<00:02:01.500> place<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.190> on<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:02.460> scenario<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:04.110> forces

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
can place it on the scenario the forces

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.520 
can place it on the scenario the forces
inside<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.460> vortex<00:02:05.970> will<00:02:06.690> pull<00:02:07.050> these

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
inside the vortex will pull these

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.840 
inside the vortex will pull these
enemies<00:02:08.100> inside<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.830> throw<00:02:11.580> some

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
enemies inside and you can throw some

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.090 
enemies inside and you can throw some
explosive<00:02:12.630> bottles<00:02:13.140> into<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.530> mix<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.890> use

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
explosive bottles into the mix and use

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.309 
explosive bottles into the mix and use
that<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.520> destroy<00:02:14.970> them

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
that to destroy them

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.259 
that to destroy them
as<00:02:16.409> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.159> see<00:02:17.400> there<00:02:17.549> are<00:02:17.609> many

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
as you can see there are many

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.280 
as you can see there are many
possibilities<00:02:20.030> laid<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.239> for<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.989> player

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
possibilities laid out for the player

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.899 
possibilities laid out for the player
and<00:02:24.019> hopefully<00:02:25.019> this<00:02:25.650> will<00:02:26.010> give<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.609> hint

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
and hopefully this will give you a hint

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.629 
and hopefully this will give you a hint
on<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.629> potential<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.560> responsiveness<00:02:29.249> of
