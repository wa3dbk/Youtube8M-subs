want to show you guys it's called

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.029 
want to show you guys it's called
l-carnitine<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:53.640> I've<00:00:53.820> been<00:00:53.940> seeing<00:00:54.239> this

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
l-carnitine now I've been seeing this

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.349 
l-carnitine now I've been seeing this
amino<00:00:56.039> acid<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.760> quite<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.239> time<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
amino acid for quite some time and I

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.810 
amino acid for quite some time and I
finally<00:01:00.359> decide<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> give<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.820> after

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
finally decide to give it a go and after

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.210 
finally decide to give it a go and after
doing<00:01:02.969> some<00:01:03.660> research<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.500> them<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.830> turns<00:01:05.040> out

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
doing some research on them it turns out

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.730 
doing some research on them it turns out
that<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.670> amino<00:01:06.060> acid<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:07.470> really

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that this amino acid is really really

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700 
that this amino acid is really really
great<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> lot<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.180> benefits<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.780> but

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
great it has a lot of benefits to it but

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
great it has a lot of benefits to it but
let<00:01:10.830> me<00:01:10.950> talk<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> main

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
let me talk about one of the main

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.100 
let me talk about one of the main
benefits<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:15.110> let

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
benefits it has and it's all about let

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.289 
benefits it has and it's all about let
me<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.229> break<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.770> down<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.369> hopefully<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> am

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
me just break it down and hopefully I am

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.990 
me just break it down and hopefully I am
correct<00:01:18.600> about<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.500> thing<00:01:20.000> takes

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
correct about this but this thing takes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390 
correct about this but this thing takes
fat<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> turn<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.530> into<00:01:22.710> energy

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
fat and turn it into energy

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.109 
fat and turn it into energy
now<00:01:24.119> how<00:01:24.390> awesome<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.130> awesome<00:01:26.729> so

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
forward to some serious weight and to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.620 
forward to some serious weight and to
build<00:01:32.369> lean<00:01:32.610> muscle<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.299> person

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
build lean muscle if you're a person

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.390 
build lean muscle if you're a person
that<00:01:33.659> works<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:35.070> needs<00:01:35.250> some

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that works out and really needs some

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.480 
that works out and really needs some
help<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.820> lean<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.619> would

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
help to lean out and on that I would

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.359 
help to lean out and on that I would
definitely<00:01:38.970> suggest<00:01:39.180> taking<00:01:39.990> these

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
definitely suggest taking these

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.039 
definitely suggest taking these
l-carnitine

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
l-carnitine

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.950 
l-carnitine
along<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> lru<00:01:44.280> 9<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.700> well<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> am

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
along with the lru 9 as well that I am

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.889 
along with the lru 9 as well that I am
also<00:01:46.590> taken<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
also taken but I don't think that one I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.130 
also taken but I don't think that one I
have<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> quality<00:01:49.920> type<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:51.140> but

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
have is a quality type so up but

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.450 
have is a quality type so up but
l-arginine<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:53.070> good<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.310> well

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
l-arginine is really good as well

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.240 
l-arginine is really good as well
contain<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.409> also<00:01:55.560> reduces

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
contain you know and it also reduces

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
contain you know and it also reduces
them<00:01:57.049> getting<00:01:58.049> body<00:01:58.439> fat<00:01:58.920> well<00:01:59.670> getting<00:01:59.969> fat

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
them getting body fat well getting fat

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.620 
them getting body fat well getting fat
periods<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.350> sort<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:03.479> can

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
periods so it's sort of like you can

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.600 
periods so it's sort of like you can
think<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> filter<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.460> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
think of it as like a filter so if you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.429 
think of it as like a filter so if you
take<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> lot<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.360> calories<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.810> fat<00:02:07.140> amount

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
take a lot of calories and fat amount

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.490 
take a lot of calories and fat amount
stuff<00:02:08.000> think<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.149> Elkington<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> filter<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
stuff think of Elkington as a filter to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.890 
stuff think of Elkington as a filter to
sort<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.250> fill<00:02:11.430> up<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.879> filter<00:02:12.330> out<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.599> fat

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
sort of fill up the filter out the fat

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.430 
sort of fill up the filter out the fat
