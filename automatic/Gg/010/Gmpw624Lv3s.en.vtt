00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
Valentine's Day and that's actually the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.350 
Valentine's Day and that's actually the
finished<00:04:41.620> makeup<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.280> really<00:04:42.850> really<00:04:43.120> like<00:04:43.330> it

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.290 

yeah<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:46.780> think<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.319> looks<00:04:47.350> really<00:04:47.650> pretty

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.040 

it<00:04:50.750> might<00:04:51.229> not<00:04:51.740> be<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:52.370> most<00:04:52.669> natural<00:04:53.360> kind<00:04:53.960> of

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
it might not be the most natural kind of

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.830 
it might not be the most natural kind of
look<00:04:54.289> but<00:04:54.979> I<00:04:55.190> think<00:04:55.280> it's<00:04:55.610> really<00:04:55.879> dramatic

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
look but I think it's really dramatic

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.590 
look but I think it's really dramatic
and<00:04:57.280> also<00:04:58.280> kind<00:04:58.490> of<00:04:58.520> cute<00:04:58.789> I<00:04:58.879> think

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.010
