 support of two SIM cards ak 4403 and not 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.130
 g3 got its name from 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.529
 battery capacity which 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.840
 second is 4000

 milliamp-hours 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.619
 design plan if you look at the phone 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 we can see again that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.480
 apple is still 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.670
 trendsetter and iphone 4 apparently still

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.710
 star for many manufacturers but 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.989
 considering aiki 4403 from behind 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 traces of personality 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.730

 however with regard to the mass 180 3 grams 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.909
 of almost 13 millimeters thick then here 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.070
 already observed quite solid 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.200
 deviation from the norm that actually 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.060
