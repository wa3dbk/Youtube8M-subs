00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
drove Easton DUIs you've lost your

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.019 
drove Easton DUIs you've lost your
record<00:05:25.529> a<00:05:25.649> decent<00:05:26.129> what<00:05:26.610> are<00:05:26.669> you<00:05:26.729> doing<00:05:26.939> about

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
record a decent what are you doing about

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.749 
record a decent what are you doing about
it<00:05:27.179> I<00:05:27.329> thought<00:05:27.719> we<00:05:28.619> lost<00:05:28.829> the<00:05:29.039> record<00:05:29.369> this<00:05:29.579> is

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
it I thought we lost the record this is

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.379 
it I thought we lost the record this is
January<00:05:29.999> 4<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:31.139> so<00:05:31.559> we<00:05:32.549> got<00:05:32.699> together<00:05:32.879> that<00:05:33.149> we

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
January 4 and so we got together that we

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.859 
January 4 and so we got together that we
decided<00:05:33.779> to<00:05:33.989> producer<00:05:34.979> 120<00:05:35.759> that<00:05:36.659> would

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:36.869 
decided to producer 120 that would

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.709 
decided to producer 120 that would
probably<00:05:37.229> go<00:05:37.439> a<00:05:37.469> bit<00:05:37.679> quicker<00:05:37.799> than<00:05:38.099> 154<00:05:38.969> so

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
probably go a bit quicker than 154 so
