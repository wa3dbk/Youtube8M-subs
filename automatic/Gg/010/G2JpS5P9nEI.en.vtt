this<00:00:53.129> enough<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.449> need<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> determine

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
this enough is you need to determine

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
this enough is you need to determine
what<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.340> subject<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.510> generally

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
what your subject is and generally

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.080 
what your subject is and generally
speaking<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.649> subject<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.460> something<00:00:59.670> on

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
speaking that subject is something on

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
speaking that subject is something on
the<00:01:00.300> ground<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> landscape<00:01:01.710> itself<00:01:02.100> but

the ground in the landscape itself but

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.210 
the ground in the landscape itself but
yet<00:01:03.180> we're<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> utilize<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.470> sky<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
yet we're going to utilize the sky in a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.990 
yet we're going to utilize the sky in a
way<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:06.119> emphasizes<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.740> overall<00:01:08.310> feeling

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
way that emphasizes the overall feeling

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.270 
way that emphasizes the overall feeling
of<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.420> landscape

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
of that landscape

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.710 
of that landscape
generally<00:01:11.280> speaking<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> ask

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
generally speaking you have to ask

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
generally speaking you have to ask
yourself<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.439> really<00:01:13.619> simple<00:01:14.070> question<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
yourself a really simple question and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480 
yourself a really simple question and
this<00:01:14.880> question<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:17.009> interest

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this question is this is the interest

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
this question is this is the interest
greatest<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.509> landscape<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> interest

greatest in my landscape is the interest

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.719 
greatest in my landscape is the interest

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
in this broad landscape in the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.340 
in this broad landscape in the
background<00:01:55.159> there<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.119> shot<00:01:58.079> that

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
background there we can see a shot that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.109 
background there we can see a shot that
normally<00:01:58.890> most<00:01:59.040> people<00:01:59.219> would<00:01:59.610> shoot<00:01:59.909> which

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
normally most people would shoot which

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.560 
normally most people would shoot which
would<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.390> something<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:01.020> this

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
would be something like this

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.040 
would be something like this
just<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.560> silos<00:02:04.040> themselves<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.630> not<00:02:05.810> that

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
just the silos themselves it's not that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.800 
just the silos themselves it's not that
interesting<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:07.520> fact<00:02:07.760> of<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.060> matter<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.539> we

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
interesting the fact of the matter is we

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.990 
interesting the fact of the matter is we
want<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.140> emphasize<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:10.039> overall<00:02:10.670> landscape

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
want to emphasize the overall landscape

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.110 
want to emphasize the overall landscape
here<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.050> do<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:13.160> need<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.340> go<00:02:13.610> wider

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
here and to do that we need to go wider

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.600 
here and to do that we need to go wider
and<00:02:14.600> then<00:02:15.050> make<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.440> decision<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and then make the decision is the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.490 
and then make the decision is the
interest<00:02:16.940> greatest<00:02:17.420> below<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.200> horizon
