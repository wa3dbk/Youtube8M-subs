00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.370 
take moves but if it can take one may as
well<00:03:23.639> preserve<00:03:24.030> ruin<00:03:24.720> coke<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:25.079> later<00:03:25.260> on

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
well preserve ruin coke for later on

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.860 
well preserve ruin coke for later on
like<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.099> after<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.970> Dido<00:03:27.239> comes<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.630> I

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
like this and after a Dido comes in I

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.870 
like this and after a Dido comes in I
can<00:03:28.440> have<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.799> that's<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.069> def<00:03:29.250> are<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.670> guess

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
can have it that's a def are so I guess

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.000 
can have it that's a def are so I guess
that<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.150> Lulu<00:03:30.660> tones<00:03:30.840> true<00:03:31.200> purpose<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.829> life

all<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.319> predicts<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.010> want<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.370> in

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
all the predicts I just want to have in

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.979 
all the predicts I just want to have in
lunatone<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.209> far<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:51.599> in<00:03:51.780> case

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
lunatone so that far just in case

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.069 
lunatone so that far just in case
something<00:03:52.560> like<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.709> happens<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:54.079> after

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
something like that happens and after

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.170 
something like that happens and after
that<00:03:55.230> switch<00:03:55.980> now<00:03:56.160> hunter<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.700> proceed<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.000> go

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
that switch now hunter and proceed to go

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.390 
that switch now hunter and proceed to go
from<00:03:57.359> there<00:03:57.540> now<00:03:57.569> he<00:03:58.319> does<00:03:58.470> make<00:03:58.680> an<00:03:58.799> exception

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
from there now he does make an exception

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.640 
from there now he does make an exception
to<00:03:59.459> move<00:03:59.609> switch<00:03:59.910> out<00:04:00.120> man<00:04:00.359> get<00:04:00.660> him<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:00.959> case<00:04:01.470> I

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
to move switch out man get him in case I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.629 
to move switch out man get him in case I
do<00:04:01.709> something<00:04:02.130> reckless

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
do something reckless

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.199

unfortunate do get a crit against this

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.860 
unfortunate do get a crit against this
our<00:04:07.859> model<00:04:08.190> right<00:04:08.220> here<00:04:08.370> which<00:04:08.849> was<00:04:09.060> mighty

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
our model right here which was mighty

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.199 
our model right here which was mighty
unfortunate<00:04:10.530> but<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.980> don't<00:04:11.400> know<00:04:11.459> I'm<00:04:11.730> not<00:04:12.090> too

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
unfortunate but I don't know I'm not too

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.490 
unfortunate but I don't know I'm not too
sure<00:04:12.389> how<00:04:12.419> much<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.780> one<00:04:13.169> matter

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
sure how much that one matter

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.000 
sure how much that one matter
considering<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:14.730> shadow<00:04:15.599> Bo<00:04:15.780> afterwards

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
considering that shadow Bo afterwards

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.099 
considering that shadow Bo afterwards
may<00:04:17.280> have<00:04:17.459> taken<00:04:17.640> him<00:04:17.880> down<00:04:17.909> regard<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.810> store

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
may have taken him down regard to store

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:19.879 
may have taken him down regard to store
that<00:04:19.229> crit

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
that crit

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.730 
that crit
but<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.549> critters<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.939> critic<00:04:21.329> so<00:04:21.539> yeah<00:04:22.500> I

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
but the critters a critic so yeah I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.469 
but the critters a critic so yeah I
guess<00:04:23.099> not<00:04:23.400> much<00:04:23.520> we<00:04:23.669> can<00:04:23.699> do<00:04:23.909> about<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.150> but

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
guess not much we can do about it but

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.510 
guess not much we can do about it but
still<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.810> do<00:04:24.990> have<00:04:25.259> trick<00:04:25.590> up<00:04:25.740> my<00:04:25.770> skis<00:04:26.129> I<00:04:26.340> can

still I do have trick up my skis I can

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.510 
still I do have trick up my skis I can
at<00:04:26.639> least<00:04:27.020> exchange<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.169> items<00:04:28.500> install<00:04:28.979> his

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
at least exchange the items install his

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.899 
at least exchange the items install his
TV<00:04:29.909> light<00:04:30.060> which<00:04:30.300> was<00:04:30.479> probably<00:04:30.870> my<00:04:31.680> main<00:04:32.610> plan

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909

defensive dragon ear with rust that can

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.909 
defensive dragon ear with rust that can
pose<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.300> problem<00:04:39.569> even<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.530> know<00:04:40.680> especially

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
pose a problem even you know especially

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.980 
pose a problem even you know especially
if<00:04:41.159> I<00:04:41.280> allow<00:04:41.610> him<00:04:41.849> to<00:04:42.030> get<00:04:42.180> too<00:04:42.389> many<00:04:42.569> dragon

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
if I allow him to get too many dragon

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.050 
if I allow him to get too many dragon
dances<00:04:43.259> involved<00:04:43.770> under<00:04:44.039> his<00:04:44.189> belt<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.669> that

dances involved under his belt and that

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.179 
dances involved under his belt and that
thing<00:04:45.270> can<00:04:45.449> be<00:04:45.599> a<00:04:45.840> major<00:04:46.379> problem<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.919> can

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
thing can be a major problem that can

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:49.309 
thing can be a major problem that can
probably<00:04:47.610> sweep<00:04:48.150> through<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.930> rest<00:04:49.110> of<00:04:49.259> my

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
probably sweep through the rest of my
