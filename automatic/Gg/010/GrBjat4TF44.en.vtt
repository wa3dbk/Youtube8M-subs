00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
through it you want to make sure if you

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.530 
through it you want to make sure if you
have<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:33.920> scale<00:00:34.309> like<00:00:34.339> I<00:00:34.699> do<00:00:34.760> here<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.210> pull<00:00:35.420> it

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
have a scale like I do here you pull it

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.030 
have a scale like I do here you pull it
off<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.930> tip<00:00:36.110> of<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.260> hook<00:00:36.409> and<00:00:36.559> it<00:00:36.680> came<00:00:36.829> off

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
off the tip of that hook and it came off

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.819 
off the tip of that hook and it came off
and<00:00:37.940> that<00:00:37.970> gives<00:00:38.300> that<00:00:38.360> bluegill<00:00:39.199> a<00:00:39.229> chance<00:00:39.649> to

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
and that gives that bluegill a chance to

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.649 
and that gives that bluegill a chance to
freely<00:00:40.489> swim<00:00:40.699> around<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.210> make<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:41.390> lot<00:00:41.629> of

freely swim around and make a lot of

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.450 
freely swim around and make a lot of
motion<00:00:42.140> which<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.649> going<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:42.920> attract<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.280> big

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460
