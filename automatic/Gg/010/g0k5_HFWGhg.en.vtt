potential

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.870 
potential
it<00:02:51.920> goes<00:02:52.400> up<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.730> an<00:02:53.030> 89<00:02:53.690> or<00:02:53.960> 90<00:02:54.460> because<00:02:55.460> I<00:02:55.730> have

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
it goes up to an 89 or 90 because I have

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.120 
it goes up to an 89 or 90 because I have
played<00:02:56.210> him<00:02:56.330> today<00:02:56.780> as<00:02:56.990> well<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.470> he<00:02:57.830> got<00:02:57.980> up

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
played him today as well and he got up

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.880 
played him today as well and he got up
to<00:02:58.310> an<00:02:58.400> 89<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.390> don't<00:02:59.840> know<00:02:59.990> how<00:03:00.200> much<00:03:00.380> higher<00:03:00.650> he

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
could get but I don't think he will get

higher<00:03:03.800> he<00:03:04.280> has<00:03:04.550> really<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.330> best<00:03:05.870> shot<00:03:06.260> I
