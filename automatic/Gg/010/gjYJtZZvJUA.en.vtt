00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
little wingnut one thing I've learned

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
little wingnut one thing I've learned
while<00:01:50.490> scoring<00:01:50.820> bottles<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.960> need

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
while scoring bottles is you don't need

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.530 
while scoring bottles is you don't need
a<00:01:52.170> lot<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> pressure<00:01:52.970> all<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.180> doing<00:01:54.450> is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
a lot of pressure all you're doing is

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.719 
a lot of pressure all you're doing is
making<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.960> very<00:01:55.110> fine<00:01:55.470> score<00:01:55.829> line<00:01:56.100> more

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
making a very fine score line more

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.209 
making a very fine score line more
pressure<00:01:57.090> will<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.719> impact<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.649> glass<00:01:58.920> more

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
pressure will just impact the glass more

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.670 
pressure will just impact the glass more
and<00:01:59.520> you'll<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> mess<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.500> nice

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and you'll have a mess so just a nice

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.499 
and you'll have a mess so just a nice
score<00:02:02.040> line<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> separation

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
score line and then the separation

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.260 
score line and then the separation
process<00:02:04.110> will<00:02:04.290> take<00:02:04.320> care<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> rest

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
process will take care of the rest

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.510 
process will take care of the rest
make<00:02:06.840> sure<00:02:07.049> your<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.530> backyard<00:02:07.950> battle<00:02:08.220> stays

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
make sure your the backyard battle stays

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.990 
make sure your the backyard battle stays
against<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.060> back<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:09.989> line<00:02:10.200> stays

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
against the back here so your line stays

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.400 
against the back here so your line stays
consistent

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
consistent

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.760 
consistent
