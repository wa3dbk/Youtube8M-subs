 right six months ago 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.120

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.949
 this material is high but 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.060
 brothers' relationship with wood is already 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.399
 something old 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.519
 so we are the third generation of 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:31.239
 family that now works with wood 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.370
 in fact it is and the glasses was a bit of that 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.329
 that we had to work at the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.629
 people already had a little desire 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.320
 working with wood and an idea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.300
 My brother is when he arrived in the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.789
 create a course completion job 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.820
 humble people in creating the 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.070
 drawings and graphic of each is rodri 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.870
 by the graphic designer student who 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.600
 the work of developing the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.089
 models having created four styles in 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.239
 four different shades of wood 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:04.950
 With the college, we learn a lot from 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.890
 create and encourage your mind to 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 look for new things and I edit it 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.590
 Identify people as we got 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.189
 this analysis of what is happening there 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.969
 coming out before and immediately realize that 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.610
 to get here what it is like it is 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.500
 a focus of reference, we began to 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.869
 seek those ideas and 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.390
 analyzing each product and taking 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.360
 some features such as the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.060
 pee and baby until the glasses are ready 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.579
 They go through many steps themselves 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.640
 brothers prepare the wood still raw 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.009
 after the party is cut, do it for the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.340
 the lens is placed on the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.680
 hinges and lacquer the retro style in this 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.049
 type of product is also strong is 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.210

 they have a classic design even 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.689
 compatible with this vintage style is a 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.290
 a timeless miller who will be able to 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.300
