 with some light limes of his own 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.220
 device that knows that e3 is a 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.230
 low-cost apparatus and a weak medium 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.610
 With you, you can see and I can 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.430
 I recommend you download the app 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.290

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.300
 you can play the videos that 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.820
 as you know here the mx player or 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.620
 here does not have the folder but then you have 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.660
 in your recording a page appears with the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.220

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.760

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.350
 can leave recording gameplay of any 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.090
 because it can be heavy and can 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.810
 fuck off 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.430
 we know that r3 is very weak and 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.610
 This is the street I've done until one 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.690

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.810
 It has to be a very light game. 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.760

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.630

 he can record up to 30 fpf or 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.760
 more but clear that the lg will not support 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.620
 all this and the maximum resolution that the lg 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.829
 available up to 240p 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.390
