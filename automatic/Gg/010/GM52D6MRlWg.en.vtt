to ask that question to people but not

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.109 
to ask that question to people but not
really<00:00:25.080> much<00:00:25.920> anymore<00:00:26.250> because<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.699> realized

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
really much anymore because I realized

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.529 
really much anymore because I realized
that<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:29.099> main<00:00:29.279> reason<00:00:29.340> why<00:00:29.880> I'm<00:00:30.029> asking<00:00:30.179> is

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
that the main reason why I'm asking is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.470 
that the main reason why I'm asking is
not<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> own<00:00:31.529> person's<00:00:32.480> interest

it's<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.290> own<00:00:34.550> it's<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:37.190> it's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
it's really for my own it's because it's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.420 
it's really for my own it's because it's
a<00:00:38.370> way<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> put<00:00:38.820> people<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> box<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.250> this<00:00:41.250> is

me I've just left that paradigm because
really<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.059> truly<00:01:00.270> when<00:01:01.020> people<00:01:01.379> actually

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
really and truly when people actually

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.619 
really and truly when people actually
enter<00:01:02.280> their<00:01:02.399> organic<00:01:02.760> state<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.359> being

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
enter their organic state of being

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
enter their organic state of being
really<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> truly<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.460> already<00:01:06.240> doing

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
really and truly they are already doing

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.080 
really and truly they are already doing
their<00:01:06.840> 24/7<00:01:07.680> job<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
their 24/7 job which is really just to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
their 24/7 job which is really just to
be<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.750> don't<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.290> anything<00:01:10.530> we're

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
be we don't have to do anything we're

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.899 
be we don't have to do anything we're
already<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.890> for<00:01:13.890> me<00:01:14.040> more<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.820> more

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
already there so for me more and more

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.039 
already there so for me more and more
I'm<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.390> realizing<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.580> as<00:01:17.580> humanity<00:01:18.240> just

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I'm just realizing that as humanity just

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.890 
I'm just realizing that as humanity just
like<00:01:19.259> oh<00:01:19.470> does<00:01:19.770> Huxley<00:01:20.130> once<00:01:20.310> said<00:01:20.900> what's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
like oh does Huxley once said what's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.289 
like oh does Huxley once said what's
happened<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.470> we've<00:01:22.770> actually<00:01:23.090> come<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
happened is that we've actually come to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.700 
happened is that we've actually come to
accept<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.110> come<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.710> love<00:01:25.950> our<00:01:26.250> slavery<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
accept and come to love our slavery and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.880 
accept and come to love our slavery and
that's<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> problem<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:30.030> we've<00:01:30.180> actually

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
that's the problem when we've actually

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.100 
that's the problem when we've actually
come<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.159> embrace<00:01:32.579> our<00:01:32.970> servitude<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
come to embrace our servitude on the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.280 
come to embrace our servitude on the
planet<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.970> people<00:01:35.970> are<00:01:37.400> fighting<00:01:38.400> over<00:01:38.759> jobs

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
planet and people are fighting over jobs

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.180 
planet and people are fighting over jobs
over<00:01:40.290> slavery

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.510 

and<00:01:43.280> for<00:01:44.090> me<00:01:44.210> it's<00:01:44.680> it's<00:01:45.680> really<00:01:46.010> about<00:01:46.310> having

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
and for me it's it's really about having

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.800 
and for me it's it's really about having
a<00:01:46.760> more<00:01:47.000> expansive<00:01:47.480> state<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:49.480> being<00:01:50.480> on<00:01:50.690> the

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
a more expansive state of being on the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.740 
a more expansive state of being on the
planet<00:01:50.990> where<00:01:51.320> essentially<00:01:52.180> all<00:01:53.180> of<00:01:53.450> us<00:01:53.570> we

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
planet where essentially all of us we

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.220 
planet where essentially all of us we
should<00:01:53.930> be<00:01:53.960> helping<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.620> contribute<00:01:54.980> humanity

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
should be helping to contribute humanity

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.630 
should be helping to contribute humanity
but<00:01:57.230> essentially<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.770> lot<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.190> jobs<00:01:58.430> we

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
but essentially a lot of the jobs we

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.350 
but essentially a lot of the jobs we
have<00:01:58.880> are<00:01:59.270> all<00:01:59.570> about<00:01:59.900> our<00:02:00.110> own<00:02:00.290> personal<00:02:00.620> game

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
have are all about our own personal game

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.970 
have are all about our own personal game
it's<00:02:02.360> not<00:02:02.570> really<00:02:02.960> about<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.380> upliftment<00:02:03.830> of

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
it's not really about the upliftment of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.310 
it's not really about the upliftment of
humanity<00:02:04.580> it's<00:02:04.730> not<00:02:04.880> really<00:02:05.180> about<00:02:05.300> what<00:02:06.140> can

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
humanity it's not really about what can

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.670 
humanity it's not really about what can
I<00:02:06.410> give<00:02:06.680> back<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.160> humanity<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:08.170> we<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.350> jobs

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
I give back to humanity and we have jobs

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.680 
I give back to humanity and we have jobs
such<00:02:09.890> as<00:02:09.920> artists<00:02:10.610> we<00:02:10.640> call<00:02:10.910> them<00:02:11.060> artists<00:02:11.540> but

dimension it's really the artist is the
alchemist<00:02:24.290> which<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.310> about<00:02:25.580> turning<00:02:25.880> lead

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
alchemist which is about turning lead

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.240 
alchemist which is about turning lead
into<00:02:26.300> gold<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.900> essentially<00:02:27.410> that's<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:27.770> we

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
into gold and essentially that's what we

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.430 
into gold and essentially that's what we
all<00:02:28.430> should<00:02:28.460> become<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.450> already<00:02:29.810> are<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.290> as

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
all should become we already are that as

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.100 
all should become we already are that as
children<00:02:30.890> already<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.760> because<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.720> pineal

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
children already that because the pineal

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.050 
children already that because the pineal
gland<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.560> open<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.950> third<00:02:34.070> eye<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.340> open<00:02:34.820> so

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
gland is open the third eye is open so

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.750 
gland is open the third eye is open so
for<00:02:35.990> me<00:02:36.140> it's<00:02:36.410> really<00:02:37.040> about<00:02:37.190> letting<00:02:37.610> go<00:02:37.730> of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
for me it's really about letting go of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.230 
for me it's really about letting go of
these<00:02:38.090> limiting<00:02:38.660> perceptions<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.560> really

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
these limiting perceptions and really

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.330 
these limiting perceptions and really
becoming<00:02:41.240> more<00:02:41.480> expansive<00:02:42.140> seeing<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.190> world

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
becoming more expansive seeing the world

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.120 
becoming more expansive seeing the world
in<00:02:43.610> new<00:02:44.030> eyes<00:02:44.980> but<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.760> Sun<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.090> up

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
in new eyes but this is it the Sun is up

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.800 
in new eyes but this is it the Sun is up
so<00:02:49.130> let's<00:02:49.430> celebrate<00:02:49.610> infinite<00:02:50.480> waters

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
so let's celebrate infinite waters

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.070
