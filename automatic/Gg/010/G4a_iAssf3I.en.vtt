Salvage which of the three brand new

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440 
Salvage which of the three brand new
maps<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.650> definitely<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.459> smallest<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:15.209> takes

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
maps is definitely the smallest it takes

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.170 
maps is definitely the smallest it takes
place<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.050> snow-covered<00:02:16.620> junkyard<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:18.030> one

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
thing when I first jumped into this map

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.009 
thing when I first jumped into this map
what<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.220> was<00:02:20.459> really<00:02:20.730> blown<00:02:20.849> away<00:02:20.940> by<00:02:21.180> was<00:02:21.690> was

what I was really blown away by was was

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.780 
what I was really blown away by was was
the<00:02:22.140> atmosphere<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.099> grit<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the atmosphere just the grit and the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.110 
the atmosphere just the grit and the
Quran<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.870> really<00:02:25.349> kind<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.860> know

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
Quran is really kind of you know

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
Quran is really kind of you know
solidified<00:02:27.120> everything<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.660> second<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
solidified everything the second that I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.199 
solidified everything the second that I
actually<00:02:28.290> saw<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.099> know<00:02:29.190> myself<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:30.000> map

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
actually saw you know myself on this map

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.089 
actually saw you know myself on this map
I<00:02:30.569> actually<00:02:30.720> started<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.410> chilly<00:02:31.739> looking

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
I actually started to get chilly looking

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.160 
I actually started to get chilly looking
at<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.370> well<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.360> other<00:02:33.420> thing<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.989> mean

at it well the other thing that I mean

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.479 
at it well the other thing that I mean
aside<00:02:34.500> from<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.769> address<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.190> kind<00:02:35.400> of

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
aside from the address for the kind of

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.390 
aside from the address for the kind of
pops<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.299> me<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.660> look<00:02:37.349> up<00:02:37.530> there's<00:02:38.190> no

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
pops up for me is look up there's no

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.699 
pops up for me is look up there's no
place<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.700> go<00:02:38.879> this<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:40.110> one<00:02:40.440> level

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
place to go this is all on one level

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.220 
place to go this is all on one level
this<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.549> this<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.150> me<00:02:42.269> its<00:02:42.510> simplicity<00:02:42.720> in

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
this is this is to me its simplicity in

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.830 
this is this is to me its simplicity in
and<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.500> itself<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.160> not<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.970> bad<00:02:45.269> way<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.630> mean

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
and of itself and not a bad way I mean

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.740 
and of itself and not a bad way I mean
the<00:02:46.410> thing<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> high<00:02:46.829> notice<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:48.000> all

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
the thing the high notice is that all

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.809 
the thing the high notice is that all
these<00:02:48.989> little<00:02:49.620> alleyways<00:02:50.130> all<00:02:50.370> these<00:02:50.519> roads

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
these little alleyways all these roads

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.780 
these little alleyways all these roads
have<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.120> very<00:02:51.510> very<00:02:52.110> narrow<00:02:52.410> focus<00:02:53.010> right<00:02:53.579> and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
have a very very narrow focus right and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.970 
have a very very narrow focus right and
i<00:02:53.849> think<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:54.900> modern<00:02:55.319> warfare<00:02:55.470> 2<00:02:55.799> it's

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
i think this for modern warfare 2 it's

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.740 
i think this for modern warfare 2 it's
really<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> boil<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.910> down<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.269> skill

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
really going to boil it down to skill

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.339 
really going to boil it down to skill
versus<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.920> know<00:02:58.950> map<00:02:59.280> complexity<00:03:00.290> well<00:03:01.290> I

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
versus you know map complexity well I

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.509 
versus you know map complexity well I
think<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.709> mean<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:01.950> me<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> way<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.280> would

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
think I mean to me the way I would

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.569 
think I mean to me the way I would
describe<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.970> map<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.930> one<00:03:04.380> phrase<00:03:04.709> every

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
describe this map in in one phrase every

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:14.610 
describe this map in in one phrase every
corner<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> be<00:03:06.989> an<00:03:07.079> adventure

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.199 

as<00:03:15.620> soon<00:03:15.800> as<00:03:15.890> we<00:03:15.980> jump<00:03:16.190> on<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.430> storm<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.000> first

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
as soon as we jump on a storm the first

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.580 
as soon as we jump on a storm the first
thing<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.510> pops<00:03:17.690> out<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.050> me<00:03:18.140> again<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.560> that

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
thing that pops out to me again is that

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.559 
thing that pops out to me again is that
is<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.099> atmosphere<00:03:19.760> they<00:03:19.910> created<00:03:20.330> I<00:03:20.390> think

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
is that atmosphere they created I think

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.199 
is that atmosphere they created I think
they<00:03:20.629> captured<00:03:21.050> it<00:03:21.140> again<00:03:21.379> in<00:03:22.220> storm<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:23.180> know

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
they captured it again in storm you know

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.490 
they captured it again in storm you know
it's<00:03:23.360> interesting<00:03:23.480> too<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:23.930> I<00:03:24.080> think<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.379> look

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
it's interesting too is I think you look

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.570 
it's interesting too is I think you look
at<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.980> does<00:03:25.099> have<00:03:25.129> these<00:03:25.430> really

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
at this and it does have these really

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.420 
at this and it does have these really
long<00:03:25.819> sight<00:03:26.120> lines<00:03:26.330> right<00:03:26.629> but<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.800> feel<00:03:28.400> like

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
long sight lines right but I feel like

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.750 
long sight lines right but I feel like
they've<00:03:28.849> done<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.120> good<00:03:29.450> job<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.900> allowing<00:03:30.410> you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
they've done a good job of allowing you

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.580 
they've done a good job of allowing you
to<00:03:31.760> tactically<00:03:32.510> move<00:03:32.660> through<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
to tactically move through so the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.680 
chance those are the guys I feel like
they're<00:03:43.700> going<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.849> get<00:03:43.940> tagged<00:03:44.239> at<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.480> really

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
they're going to get tagged at a really

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.240 
they're going to get tagged at a really
long<00:03:44.840> distance<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.500> think<00:03:45.950> it's<00:03:46.040> going<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.190> be

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
long distance I think it's going to be

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.710 
long distance I think it's going to be
really<00:03:46.519> easy<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.910> pick<00:03:47.090> up<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.360> some<00:03:47.569> of<00:03:47.660> the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
really easy to pick up on some of the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.020 
really easy to pick up on some of the
landmarks<00:03:48.110> some<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:48.890> key<00:03:49.069> elements<00:03:49.280> of

the map that they wanted you to kind of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.740 
the map that they wanted you to kind of
hone<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.829> on<00:03:51.980> or<00:03:52.190> see<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.730> instantly<00:03:53.450> show<00:03:53.690> you

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
where you are because again I mean as

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.520 
where you are because again I mean as
far<00:03:56.000> as<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.360> layout<00:03:56.630> goes<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.200> fairly

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
far as the layout goes it is a fairly

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.130 
far as the layout goes it is a fairly
big<00:03:57.769> map<00:03:58.069> there<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.849> some<00:03:59.030> interior<00:03:59.360> but

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
big map there is some interior but

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.970 
big map there is some interior but
mostly<00:04:00.440> out<00:04:00.650> here<00:04:00.920> out<00:04:01.489> period<00:04:01.849> allows<00:04:02.599> it

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
mostly out here out period allows it

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.020 
mostly out here out period allows it
would<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.129> take<00:04:04.340> with<00:04:04.489> them<00:04:04.610> out<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:05.000> you

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
would that take with them out to you

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.690 
would that take with them out to you
mostly<00:04:05.329> out<00:04:05.599> terior<00:04:06.079> as<00:04:06.430> educated<00:04:07.430> people

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
mostly out terior as educated people

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.880 
mostly out terior as educated people
like<00:04:07.879> to<00:04:08.000> say<00:04:08.180> there<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.049> big<00:04:09.260> warehouse

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
like to say there is the big warehouse

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.160 
like to say there is the big warehouse
though<00:04:10.160> I<00:04:10.340> think<00:04:10.579> that's<00:04:10.730> there<00:04:11.720> are<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.019> couple

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
though I think that's there are a couple

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.690 
though I think that's there are a couple
of<00:04:12.319> outbuildings<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.190> can<00:04:13.310> kind<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.549> get

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
of outbuildings that you can kind of get

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.569 
of outbuildings that you can kind of get
into<00:04:13.849> their<00:04:14.150> small<00:04:14.450> kind<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.720> discrete<00:04:15.140> areas

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
into their small kind of discrete areas

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.279 
into their small kind of discrete areas
but<00:04:16.579> germain<00:04:17.090> interior<00:04:17.690> area<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.139> this

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
but germain interior area is this

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.500 
but germain interior area is this
enormous<00:04:18.829> warehouse<00:04:19.639> and<00:04:19.970> it's<00:04:20.090> got<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.299> couple

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
enormous warehouse and it's got a couple

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.629 
enormous warehouse and it's got a couple
of<00:04:20.660> levels<00:04:20.810> yea<00:04:21.470> medgar<00:04:21.709> will<00:04:22.070> be<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.310> focal

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
of levels yea medgar will be the focal

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.640 
of levels yea medgar will be the focal
point<00:04:22.669> people<00:04:23.180> might<00:04:23.330> gravitate<00:04:23.630> towards<00:04:24.470> it

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.740

it's<00:04:25.460> definitely<00:04:25.729> an<00:04:26.090> interesting<00:04:26.300> place<00:04:26.720> to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
it's definitely an interesting place to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.140 
it's definitely an interesting place to
have<00:04:27.110> kind<00:04:27.919> of<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:28.070> shootout<00:04:28.400> just<00:04:28.729> due<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:28.910> the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
have kind of a shootout just due to the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.589 
have kind of a shootout just due to the
geometry<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.050> complexity<00:04:30.620> within<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.160> area

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.490 

alright<00:04:35.599> well<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.750> think<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:36.020> pretty<00:04:36.380> much
