00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
how to change the color of full blocks

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.310 
how to change the color of full blocks
on<00:00:21.210> geometry<00:00:21.660> -<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.750> there<00:00:24.750> are<00:00:24.869> only<00:00:24.960> certain

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
on geometry - so there are only certain

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.220 
on geometry - so there are only certain
blocks<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.359> that<00:00:27.359> their<00:00:27.510> color<00:00:27.990> can

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
blocks that can be that their color can

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.939 
blocks that can be that their color can
be<00:00:28.260> changed<00:00:29.179> usually<00:00:30.179> um<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.230> all<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:31.650> cut

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
be changed usually um so all these cut

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.340 
be changed usually um so all these cut
ones<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.790> their<00:00:33.000> color<00:00:33.270> change<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
ones can have their color change so if I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.900 
ones can have their color change so if I
