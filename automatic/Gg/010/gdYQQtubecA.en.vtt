and make sure that they're gonna grow
right<00:01:58.960> I<00:01:59.259> think<00:01:59.800> I<00:01:59.979> remember<00:02:00.070> kept<00:02:00.729> saying

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
right I think I remember kept saying

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.330 
right I think I remember kept saying
what<00:02:01.420> sub<00:02:01.780> seeds<00:02:02.670> wouldn't<00:02:03.670> be<00:02:04.259> good<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.890> you

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
what sub seeds wouldn't be good and you

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.120 
what sub seeds wouldn't be good and you
have<00:02:06.490> them<00:02:06.700> maybe<00:02:06.880> test<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.479> few<00:02:07.509> of<00:02:07.780> them<00:02:07.899> so<00:02:08.229> I

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
have them maybe test a few of them so I

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.400
