tracking data to some 3d application to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.920 
tracking data to some 3d application to
actually<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.980> camera<00:00:41.460> data<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.480> go<00:00:42.660> from

actually use the camera data to go from
the<00:00:43.110> four<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.280> create<00:00:44.579> some<00:00:44.730> 3d<00:00:45.000> objects

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the four and and create some 3d objects

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.779 
the four and and create some 3d objects
etc<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.070> tutorial<00:00:47.250> I'm<00:00:47.550> quickly

going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> show<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> go<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> 3ds<00:00:49.289> max

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
going to show you how to go to 3ds max

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.610 
going to show you how to go to 3ds max
so<00:00:50.430> inside<00:00:51.030> PF<00:00:51.360> track<00:00:51.600> once<00:00:52.320> you've<00:00:52.500> added

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so inside PF track once you've added

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.920 
so inside PF track once you've added
your<00:00:52.739> test<00:00:53.039> object<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:54.030> click<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.449> right

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
your test object just click on right

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.189 
your test object just click on right
click<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.230> test<00:00:55.469> object<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> select<00:00:56.699> export

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
click on test object and select export

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.510 
click on test object and select export
that's<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> create<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.829> export<00:00:59.280> node

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that's going to create the export node

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.819 
that's going to create the export node
and<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.420> double<00:01:00.660> click<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.930> then

and if you double click on that then

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.870 
and if you double click on that then

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 and that script

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
Autodesk 3ds Max 2011 and that script
will<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.170> compatible<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.799> different

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
will be compatible with different

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
I'm going to leave them in for this test

objects<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> also<00:02:09.840> don't<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.470> that

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
objects you also don't have to do that

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.650 
objects you also don't have to do that
these<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.160> all<00:02:11.310> your<00:02:11.550> test<00:02:11.940> objects<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.599> I'm

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
these are all your test objects so I'm

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.400

going to leave them

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.890

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and textures I don't have any so that's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.200 
and textures I don't have any so that's
fine<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.520> click<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.760> export

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.840 
little exclamation mark which is quite
weird<00:02:22.470> but<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.830> actually<00:02:23.100> saying<00:02:23.280> export

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
also my camera move and then from you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.520 
also my camera move and then from you
you<00:03:01.770> can<00:03:01.800> obviously<00:03:02.130> go<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.350> create<00:03:04.350> some

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
you can obviously go and create some

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.070 
you can obviously go and create some
objects<00:03:05.340> import<00:03:05.790> your<00:03:05.880> scene<00:03:06.120> too<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.930> match

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
objects import your scene too to match

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.780 
objects import your scene too to match
it<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:07.830> from<00:03:08.040> here<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.400> go<00:03:08.610> into

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
it up and then from here you go into

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.190 
it up and then from here you go into
your<00:03:08.880> compositor<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.660> put<00:03:09.900> everything

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
your compositor to put everything

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.790 
your compositor to put everything
together<00:03:11.150> alright<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.660> we<00:03:13.230> go<00:03:13.770> to

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
together alright so if we go to

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.370 
together alright so if we go to
perspective<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.480> we<00:03:18.480> zoom<00:03:18.780> out<00:03:18.960> a<00:03:19.020> bit<00:03:19.110> you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
perspective and we zoom out a bit you

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.920 
perspective and we zoom out a bit you
can<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.590> your<00:03:19.830> camera<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.600> if<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.690> scrub

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
can see your camera and if I scrub

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.590 
can see your camera and if I scrub
through<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:22.440> see<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.830> camera<00:03:23.160> move

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
through it you can see the camera move

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.570 
through it you can see the camera move
so<00:03:24.600> as<00:03:24.840> easy<00:03:25.200> as<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.740> go<00:03:25.860> from<00:03:26.040> P<00:03:26.250> F<00:03:26.340> track

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
so as easy as that to go from P F track

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.850 
so as easy as that to go from P F track
