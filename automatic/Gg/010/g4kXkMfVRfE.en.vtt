what most young kids aspire to be once

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.170 
what most young kids aspire to be once
they<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.780> grow<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> certainly<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they they grow up I know I certainly and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.830 
they they grow up I know I certainly and
head<00:01:12.270> but--look<00:01:12.630> Manasa<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> young<00:01:13.710> kid<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
head but--look Manasa as a young kid and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
head but--look Manasa as a young kid and
yeah<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> success<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> team<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
yeah just on the success of the team I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.760 
yeah just on the success of the team I
think<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.909> got<00:01:18.060> something<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.770> 90%

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
think we got something like a 90%

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.690 
think we got something like a 90%
success<00:01:20.490> rate<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.320> just

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
success rate and I think that's just

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.100 
success rate and I think that's just
comes<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.390> guess<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> hard<00:01:24.810> work<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
comes down to I guess the hard work that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.350 
comes down to I guess the hard work that
the<00:01:25.200> guys<00:01:25.380> put<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> legacy<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the guys put in and now the legacy that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.420 
the guys put in and now the legacy that
that<00:01:27.840> has<00:01:28.020> little<00:01:28.200> Beck's<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.280> you're

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that has little Beck's so you're

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.480

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
something that you go up saying as a kid

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.530 
something that you go up saying as a kid
and<00:01:43.549> not<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.790> feared<00:01:45.000> New<00:01:45.149> Zealand's<00:01:45.450> in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and not to be feared New Zealand's in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.819 
and not to be feared New Zealand's in
your<00:01:45.659> country<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.049> four<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> half<00:01:46.470> million

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
your country all four and a half million

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
your country all four and a half million
I<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.659> classic

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
I think it is so you know it's a classic

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.179 
I think it is so you know it's a classic
case<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.500> where<00:01:49.770> our<00:01:49.860> national

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
case of that's where our national

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.440 
case of that's where our national
identity<00:01:50.220> comes<00:01:50.759> from<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.270> we're

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
identity comes from because we're

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
identity comes from because we're
punching<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:51.960> above<00:01:52.020> our<00:01:52.320> weight<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.680> terms

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
punching well above our weight in terms

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.800 
punching well above our weight in terms
of<00:01:53.009> when<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.220> play<00:01:53.820> other<00:01:53.939> bigger<00:01:54.180> nations<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
of when we play other bigger nations and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.810 
of when we play other bigger nations and
to<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.200> their<00:01:55.380> success<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.070> success<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
to have their success that success in

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.120 
to have their success that success in
such<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> small<00:01:57.719> nation<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.860> know<00:01:58.979> for

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
such a small nation I think you know for

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
such a small nation I think you know for
us<00:01:59.250> that's<00:01:59.490> hugely<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.240> gives<00:02:00.420> us<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.540> lot

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
us that's hugely you know gives us a lot

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.630 
us that's hugely you know gives us a lot
of<00:02:00.659> pride<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.890> us<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.460> that's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
of pride and for us you know that's

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.709 
of pride and for us you know that's
probably<00:02:02.939> pretty<00:02:03.119> much<00:02:03.329> where<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> pressure

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
probably pretty much where the pressure

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.090 
probably pretty much where the pressure
comes<00:02:03.960> right<00:02:04.229> from<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.469> start<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:04.829> got

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
comes right from the start you just got

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.289 
comes right from the start you just got
to<00:02:05.189> keep<00:02:05.310> winning<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.939> guys<00:02:06.270> are

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
to keep winning because the guys are

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.089 
to keep winning because the guys are
there<00:02:06.509> before<00:02:06.689> us<00:02:06.899> never<00:02:07.439> really<00:02:07.680> lost<00:02:07.829> much

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
there before us never really lost much

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.669 
there before us never really lost much
so<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.450> big<00:02:10.289> reason<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.619> to

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so I think that's a big reason as to

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.440 
so I think that's a big reason as to
whether<00:02:10.920> success<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:11.970> so

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
whether success is there and so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.780 
whether success is there and so
basically<00:02:12.750> what<00:02:12.930> you're<00:02:13.080> seeing<00:02:13.290> is

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
basically what you're seeing is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.130 
basically what you're seeing is
