people we're going to we're going to do

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.179 
people we're going to we're going to do
just<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> action<00:00:19.590> movie<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.039> like

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
just like the action movie it's like

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.470 
just like the action movie it's like
that's<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> first<00:00:20.490> place<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.029> brain<00:00:21.270> goes

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
that's the first place my brain goes

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.970 
that's the first place my brain goes
it's<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> second<00:00:22.500> place<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.830> what

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.179 
it's like that the second place is what
we<00:00:23.070> gotta<00:00:23.250> send<00:00:23.460> into<00:00:23.640> outer<00:00:23.670> space<00:00:25.189> which

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
we gotta send into outer space which

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.529 
we gotta send into outer space which
