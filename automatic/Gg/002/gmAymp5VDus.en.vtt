just to try to get them straight and

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.340

onto<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:19.950> block<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.850> then

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
onto my block from there and then

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020 
onto my block from there and then
instead<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> testing<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:23.130> trusting<00:01:23.880> myself

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
instead of testing or trusting myself

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.570 
instead of testing or trusting myself
and<00:01:24.570> thinking<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> got<00:01:26.100> them<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and thinking that I got them right the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.640 
and thinking that I got them right the
first<00:01:26.759> time<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:27.960> scrap<00:01:28.350> test

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
first time I just do a little scrap test

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.670 
first time I just do a little scrap test
here<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.790> could<00:01:29.970> already<00:01:30.119> tell<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.570> my<00:01:31.470> ol

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
here and I could already tell that my ol

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.550 
here and I could already tell that my ol
looked<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.280> low<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:33.210> me<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> thought<00:01:33.900> from

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
looked a little low to me I thought from

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
looked a little low to me I thought from
what<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.740> wanted<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.350> adjust

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and then I test again and then I get

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.810 
and then I test again and then I get
perfect<00:01:42.030> placement<00:01:42.210> every<00:01:42.630> time<00:01:43.700> all<00:01:44.700> right

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820

butter<00:03:29.760> really<00:03:30.390> really<00:03:30.750> nice<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.110> used<00:03:31.350> two

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
butter really really nice I used two

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.759 
butter really really nice I used two
extra<00:03:31.920> pieces<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.370> cardstock<00:03:33.110> when<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.140> make<00:03:34.620> my

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
extra pieces of cardstock when I make my

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.770 
extra pieces of cardstock when I make my
sandwich<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.400> my<00:03:35.430> big<00:03:35.880> shot<00:03:36.090> just<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> make

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
sandwich in my big shot just to make

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.110 
sandwich in my big shot just to make
sure<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:36.959> get<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.200> really<00:03:37.440> clean<00:03:37.650> cut<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.160> now<00:03:39.000> I

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
sure I get a really clean cut so now I

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.490 
sure I get a really clean cut so now I
have<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.360> little<00:03:39.510> framelit<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.140> we<00:03:40.260> cut

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
have that little framelit that we cut

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.440 
have that little framelit that we cut
earlier<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.880> actually<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.269> biggest

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
earlier and that is actually the biggest

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.449 
earlier and that is actually the biggest
frame<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.290> comes<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.799> set<00:03:44.100> that's<00:03:44.280> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
frame that comes in that set that's the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.850 
frame that comes in that set that's the
biggest<00:03:44.610> label<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.780> wanted<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.290> have<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.620> be

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
biggest label and I wanted to have it be

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.550 
biggest label and I wanted to have it be
matted<00:03:47.239> so<00:03:48.239> I'm<00:03:48.630> sort<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.019> doing<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.410> little

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
matted so I'm sort of doing a little

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.910 
matted so I'm sort of doing a little
trickery<00:03:49.829> here<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.489> I've<00:03:51.030> done<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.299> before

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
trickery here and I've done this before

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.979 
trickery here and I've done this before
when<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.980> just<00:03:53.130> out<00:03:53.280> trace<00:03:53.910> around<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.570> outside

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
when I just out trace around the outside

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.949 
when I just out trace around the outside
of<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.799> biggest<00:03:56.310> framelit<00:03:57.180> die<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.810> give

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
of the biggest framelit die just to give

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.130 
of the biggest framelit die just to give
myself<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.620> little<00:03:58.860> mat<00:03:59.150> so<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.900> traced

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
myself a little mat so I just traced

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.330 
myself a little mat so I just traced
around<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.560> using<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.860> little<00:04:02.070> copic

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
around it using a little copic

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.979 
around it using a little copic
multiliner<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.269> now<00:04:03.360> I'm<00:04:03.450> gonna<00:04:03.540> go<00:04:03.750> ahead

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
multiliner and now I'm gonna go ahead

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.360 
multiliner and now I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:04:04.140> color<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.590> there<00:04:04.769> with<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.040> same

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
and color it in there with that same

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.360 
and color it in there with that same
strong<00:04:05.730> red<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.260> put<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:07.680> my<00:04:07.860> snowflakes

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
strong red so I put it on my snowflakes

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.160 
strong red so I put it on my snowflakes
just<00:04:08.760> sort<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.000> scattered<00:04:09.390> them<00:04:09.480> around<00:04:09.630> and

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
just sort of scattered them around and

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.870 
just sort of scattered them around and
now<00:04:10.320> I'm<00:04:10.410> going<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.620> grab<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:11.070> set<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.730> is

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
now I'm going to grab this set this is

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.240 
now I'm going to grab this set this is
from<00:04:12.090> Avery<00:04:12.540> Elle<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.590> let<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.890> snow

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
from Avery Elle this is the let it snow

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.210 
from Avery Elle this is the let it snow
set<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.910> I'm<00:04:15.030> gonna<00:04:15.150> take<00:04:15.450> these<00:04:15.660> little

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
set and I'm gonna take these little

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.080 
set and I'm gonna take these little
snowflakes<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.489> think<00:04:17.609> they<00:04:17.850> could<00:04:17.970> also

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
snowflakes so I think they could also

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.270 
snowflakes so I think they could also
double<00:04:18.479> as<00:04:18.600> stars<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.709> I'm<00:04:19.829> gonna<00:04:19.950> use<00:04:20.070> them

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
double as stars but I'm gonna use them

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.060 
double as stars but I'm gonna use them
as<00:04:20.400> snowflakes<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.150> stamp<00:04:22.140> them<00:04:22.380> all<00:04:22.560> over

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
as snowflakes and stamp them all over

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.420 
as snowflakes and stamp them all over
the<00:04:23.630> background<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:24.960> piece<00:04:25.169> here<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.710> I

just

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.330 
just
rotate<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.780> little<00:04:28.470> segment<00:04:28.710> there<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:29.250> they

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
rotate that little segment there so they

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.210 
rotate that little segment there so they
don't<00:04:29.520> start<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.240> look<00:04:30.360> too<00:04:30.600> uniform<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.530> I'm

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
don't start to look too uniform and I'm

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.460 
don't start to look too uniform and I'm
stamping<00:04:32.670> them<00:04:33.000> using<00:04:33.810> some<00:04:34.080> hero<00:04:34.380> arts

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
it shows up very nicely on craft and you

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.780 
it shows up very nicely on craft and you
can<00:04:40.560> see<00:04:40.740> I've<00:04:40.860> just<00:04:41.070> done<00:04:41.250> them<00:04:41.370> all<00:04:41.460> over

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790
