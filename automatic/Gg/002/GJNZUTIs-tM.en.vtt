00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.599
 and good hello to all and all his 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.080
 fox calls and I have to present you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.940
 the tweak 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.309
 sb flip that allow you to do 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.900
 like on the iphone 6 plus what wants 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.590
 tell to put your iphone in mode 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.150
 landscape 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.130
 so we can see that it works great 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 alright so I want a page two shots 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 Tismed in landscape mode 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.430
 all fit perfectly and we're going 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.599
 to pass right away we remain tweak 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.010
 a folk casta and you'll see a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.689
 back section of the settings so sent 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 right now so that's all letting 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.559
 tweak configuration so we have the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 button on off we forced the rotation by 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.430
 default so here we have the flip style 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.079
 so we have either iphone 6 plus 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 ipad but I do not know what it is 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.250
 do we advance right now it's me 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.770
 seems like it's the same so 20 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.480
 pts ira spring so here it seems to me 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 that it's the same thing it's okay 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.910
 not change a lot of things by 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.670
 compared to the iphone 6 they tire more 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.110
 fashion because its part the same thing in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.430
 made 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:12.240
 so here we go to see that all of 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.580
 next and no it's almost the same in fact 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.110
 maybe it's a little bit more 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.080
 slow I do not know I do not perceive 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.640
 see no difference if you see bad 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.570
 write them in the comments because 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.960
 that I do not see the difference 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.770
 so we go the values ​​remain of the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.490
 settings so we have the style so we're going 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 to put six more we forced the dock to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.100
 bring into 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.560
 so we have a button to put the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.759
 folders in skate so folders after 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.890
 which I do not know what that means 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.899
 in one button to delete the title of the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.970
 folders to enable rotation on the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.560
 lockscreen so it's still in beta and 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.119
 in a daniel button to remove the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.310
 flow of files and doc 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.350
 so we tested on the lockscreen pro this 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.240
 that it makes everything colas 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.799
 so I'm not giving up anything that can give 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.299
 so that's really how he does not 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.590
 so it's still in beta we can see 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.909
 that there is a small bug for the code on 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.560
 does not have any numbers so this is 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.170
 necessarily it's a beta that makes sense 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.929
 or so did not like on the lockscreen 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.420
 an ipad it works well for a beta 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.390
 still there is not too much bee so 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.280
 this is for the screen so the thing that 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.190
 is called sbf flip which is available 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.180

 do not hesitate to install it so if you 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.630
 want to have the same effect as the iphone 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.730
 6 more so for me it's small this 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.260
 tested on iphone 6 so it works very 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.670
 as well 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.049
