that<00:00:31.260> I've<00:00:31.410> cut<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.070> unit<00:00:32.489> since<00:00:33.020> washing

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that I've cut in the unit since washing

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.910 
that I've cut in the unit since washing
it<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.890> used<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.399> vo5<00:00:36.180> conditioner<00:00:36.920> blew

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it I just used some vo5 conditioner blew

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.340 
it I just used some vo5 conditioner blew
dry<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.250> hair<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.239> flat<00:00:39.660> ironed<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> so

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
dry the hair and then flat ironed it so

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.030 
dry the hair and then flat ironed it so
I<00:00:40.379> feel<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.980> flow<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.329> nicer<00:00:43.040> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I feel like the flow is a lot nicer and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
I feel like the flow is a lot nicer and
then<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.239> all-over<00:00:45.510> aesthetic

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
then the just the all-over aesthetic

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.900 
then the just the all-over aesthetic
looks<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.559> little<00:00:46.680> bit<00:00:46.860> better<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> what

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
looks a little bit better this is what

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
looks a little bit better this is what
I'm<00:00:47.969> working<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.860> bangs<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> little

bit<00:00:50.700> shorter<00:00:51.180> than<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.930> would<00:00:52.260> have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.450 
bit shorter than I think I would have
wanted<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.469> use<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> same<00:00:55.829> technique<00:00:56.280> that

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

lot<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.439> my<00:01:55.649> units<00:01:56.070> once<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.700> starts<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.479> feel

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
lot of my units once it starts to feel

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.870 
lot of my units once it starts to feel
like<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.960> gets<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.320> little<00:01:58.530> bit<00:01:58.770> entangled<00:01:59.520> more

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880

nothing to do with RPG shows quality
however<00:03:37.420> it's<00:03:38.420> one<00:03:38.600> thing<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.900> can<00:03:39.019> be<00:03:39.139> said

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
however it's one thing that can be said

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.420 
however it's one thing that can be said
about<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.859> consistency<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:41.709> making<00:03:42.709> wigs<00:03:43.040> I

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
is really giving me a

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.949 
is really giving me a
it's<00:04:18.239> giving<00:04:18.599> me<00:04:18.629> that<00:04:18.870> kind<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.319> quick<00:04:19.590> weaves

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
it's giving me that kind of quick weaves

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.149 
it's giving me that kind of quick weaves
wig<00:04:21.959> cap<00:04:22.319> kind<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.830> look<00:04:23.099> um<00:04:23.479> I<00:04:24.949> don't<00:04:25.949> feel

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
wig cap kind of look um I don't feel

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.809 
wig cap kind of look um I don't feel
like<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.460> lays<00:04:26.729> as<00:04:27.090> nicely<00:04:27.599> as<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.319> could<00:04:28.819> right

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
like it lays as nicely as it could right

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.519 
like it lays as nicely as it could right
here's<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.150> stretchable<00:04:30.599> cap<00:04:30.900> here<00:04:31.259> is<00:04:31.349> the

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:31.529 
here's the stretchable cap here is the

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:36.469 
here's the stretchable cap here is the
lace<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.569> there's<00:04:33.569> this<00:04:33.870> band<00:04:34.349> here<00:04:35.060> with<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
lace and there's this band here with the

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.629 
lace and there's this band here with the
whitcomb<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:38.779> that's<00:04:39.779> exactly<00:04:40.529> where<00:04:41.189> the

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
whitcomb and that's exactly where the

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.950 
whitcomb and that's exactly where the
bangs<00:04:42.379> start<00:04:43.379> so<00:04:44.219> I<00:04:44.819> think<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.689> it's

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
bangs start so I think that it's

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.779 
bangs start so I think that it's
affecting<00:04:46.319> the<00:04:46.650> way<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.949> lays<00:04:47.129> so<00:04:47.430> I'm<00:04:47.610> going

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
affecting the way it lays so I'm going

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.659 
affecting the way it lays so I'm going
to<00:04:47.819> actually<00:04:48.060> remove<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.560> but<00:04:50.009> that's<00:04:50.189> one<00:04:50.520> of

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
to actually remove it but that's one of

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.580 
to actually remove it but that's one of
the<00:04:50.789> only<00:04:51.060> things<00:04:51.629> that<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:51.900> don't<00:04:52.229> really<00:04:52.469> like

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
the only things that I don't really like

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.559 
the only things that I don't really like
about<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.250> way<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.729> sits<00:04:54.270> now<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:56.240> think<00:04:57.240> it's<00:04:57.479> a

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
about the way it sits now I think it's a

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.240 
about the way it sits now I think it's a
quick<00:04:57.750> fix<00:04:58.080> but<00:04:58.289> that's<00:04:58.620> just<00:04:58.740> one<00:04:58.979> thing<00:04:59.009> I

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
quick fix but that's just one thing I

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.679 
quick fix but that's just one thing I
wanted<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.580> notate<00:04:59.969> about<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.479> particular

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
unit that I received it's not a biggie

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.929 
unit that I received it's not a biggie
