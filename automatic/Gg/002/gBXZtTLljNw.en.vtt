00:00:48.310 --> 00:01:20.790 

bye

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:02:39.480 

Oh

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.460 

there<00:02:40.490> were<00:02:40.580> enough<00:02:40.880> good<00:02:41.150> chances<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:42.350> score

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
there were enough good chances to score

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.830 
there were enough good chances to score
the<00:02:42.770> goals<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.550> think<00:02:43.790> right<00:02:44.330> now<00:02:44.510> it's

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
the goals and I think right now it's

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.370 
the goals and I think right now it's
early<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:47.030> team<00:02:47.300> has<00:02:47.510> hasn't<00:02:48.110> been

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
early in the the team has hasn't been

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.920 
early in the the team has hasn't been
together

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
together

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.550 
together
so<00:02:49.859> now<00:02:50.069> it's<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:51.439> technique<00:02:52.439> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
so now it's just the technique of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.440 
so now it's just the technique of
finishing<00:02:53.010> over<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.609> over<00:02:53.700> again<00:02:53.879> until<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
finishing over and over again until the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.959 
finishing over and over again until the
players<00:02:54.719> confident<00:02:55.469> because<00:02:56.189> I<00:02:56.459> think<00:02:56.519> we

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
players confident because I think we

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.970 
players confident because I think we
created<00:02:57.359> all<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.629> chances<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.170> needed<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.829> win

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
created all the chances we needed to win

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.970 
created all the chances we needed to win
this<00:02:59.129> game<00:02:59.340> today<00:02:59.640> I<00:03:00.200> think<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.319> second<00:03:01.739> half

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
this game today I think the second half

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.099 
this game today I think the second half
was<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.640> good<00:03:02.939> indication<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.719> what<00:03:03.959> we're

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
was a good indication of what we're

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:13.399 
was a good indication of what we're
working<00:03:05.269> where<00:03:12.049> that's<00:03:13.049> what<00:03:13.230> we've<00:03:13.379> been

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
understanding of how to go how to attack

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.429 
understanding of how to go how to attack
