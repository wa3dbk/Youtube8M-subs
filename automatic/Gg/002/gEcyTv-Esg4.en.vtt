00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.990 
is what it is she had to go cuz she do I
believe<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.349> was<00:02:32.440> she<00:02:32.860> still<00:02:33.040> quiet<00:02:33.489> too<00:02:33.790> long

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
believe it was she still quiet too long

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.270 
believe it was she still quiet too long
which<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.420> epic<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.989> wasn't<00:02:35.290> like<00:02:35.379> she<00:02:36.010> messed

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
which is epic it wasn't like she messed

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.770 
which is epic it wasn't like she messed
up<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.640> any<00:02:36.790> way<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.209> she<00:02:37.360> would<00:02:37.480> have<00:02:37.599> known

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
up in any way that she would have known

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.119 
up in any way that she would have known
because<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.200> can't<00:02:38.410> know<00:02:38.620> something<00:02:39.010> like

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
because you can't know something like

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.610 
because you can't know something like
that<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.549> got<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.879> got<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> stay<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.049> gotta

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
that I you got you got a stay I gotta

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.800 
that I you got you got a stay I gotta
say<00:02:41.799> something<00:02:41.830> every<00:02:42.760> once<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.180> while<00:02:43.360> so

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
say something every once in a while so

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.470 
say something every once in a while so
in<00:02:44.379> my<00:02:44.560> opinion<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.340> story<00:02:45.640> cheated<00:02:46.120> her<00:02:46.269> out

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
in my opinion the story cheated her out

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.509 
in my opinion the story cheated her out
of<00:02:46.630> like<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:47.049> victory<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:47.980> guess<00:02:48.220> in<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.430> way

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
of like a victory I guess in a way

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.490 
of like a victory I guess in a way
because<00:02:48.790> she<00:02:49.329> just<00:02:49.510> did<00:02:49.690> quiet<00:02:49.989> for<00:02:50.200> too<00:02:50.319> long

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
because she just did quiet for too long

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.770 
because she just did quiet for too long
if<00:02:50.829> anything<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:52.000> know<00:02:52.120> if<00:02:52.329> she<00:02:52.540> would<00:02:52.660> have

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
if anything you know if she would have

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.089 
if anything you know if she would have
known<00:02:52.930> she<00:02:52.959> most<00:02:53.349> likely<00:02:53.440> would've<00:02:53.799> just<00:02:53.920> kept

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
known she most likely would've just kept

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.819 
known she most likely would've just kept
saying<00:02:54.250> something<00:02:54.610> while<00:02:55.030> fighting<00:02:55.299> like<00:02:55.480> um

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
saying something while fighting like um

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.630 
saying something while fighting like um
you<00:02:56.829> know<00:02:56.950> she<00:02:57.010> could<00:02:57.190> have<00:02:57.220> said<00:02:57.430> something

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
you know she could have said something

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.819 
you know she could have said something
but<00:02:57.970> nonetheless<00:02:58.720> she<00:02:59.019> was<00:02:59.260> cheated<00:02:59.650> out<00:02:59.799> of

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
but nonetheless she was cheated out of

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.440 
but nonetheless she was cheated out of
this<00:03:00.129> fight<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.519> my<00:03:00.640> opinion<00:03:00.970> because<00:03:01.060> she<00:03:01.329> was

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
this fight of my opinion because she was

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.720 
this fight of my opinion because she was
kicking<00:03:01.660> some<00:03:01.930> pretty<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.440> lot<00:03:03.099> of<00:03:03.250> butt<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.670> I
