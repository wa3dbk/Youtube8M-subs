exercise<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.880> one<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.239> my<00:03:06.330> favorite<00:03:06.720> exercises

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
exercise is one of my favorite exercises

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.979 
exercise is one of my favorite exercises
of<00:03:07.500> all<00:03:07.650> time<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.160> use<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.849> lot<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.239> warm<00:03:09.569> up<00:03:09.780> I

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
of all time I use it a lot to warm up I

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.289 
of all time I use it a lot to warm up I
use<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.769> practice<00:03:10.950> my<00:03:11.310> speed<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.970> even

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
use it to practice my speed and I even

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.559 
use it to practice my speed and I even
use<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.900> exercise<00:03:13.500> as<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.799> fill<00:03:14.220> very<00:03:15.000> often

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
use this exercise as a fill very often

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.589 
use this exercise as a fill very often
so<00:03:16.319> what<00:03:16.620> we<00:03:16.769> do<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.220> we're<00:03:17.610> playing<00:03:18.030> triplets

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
so what we do is we're playing triplets

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.960 
so what we do is we're playing triplets
around<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.230> drumkit<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.829> we<00:03:20.069> start<00:03:20.430> off<00:03:20.640> with

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
around the drumkit and we start off with

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.319 
around the drumkit and we start off with
the<00:03:21.209> Tom's<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.319> what<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.970> start

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
the Tom's so what you do is you start

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.199 
the Tom's so what you do is you start
off<00:03:24.569> with<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.410> first<00:03:25.829> note<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:26.819> your<00:03:27.000> right

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
off with the first note with your right

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.509 
off with the first note with your right
hand<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.840> rack<00:03:28.019> Tom<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.310> other

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
hand on the rack Tom and then the other

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.880 
hand on the rack Tom and then the other
two<00:03:29.849> on<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.120> floor<00:03:30.360> Tom<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.500> that's<00:03:31.680> going<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
two on the floor Tom so that's going to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.530 
two on the floor Tom so that's going to
sound<00:03:32.130> like<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.870> one<00:03:33.870> trip<00:03:34.440> Lin<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:36.239> then

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
sound like this one trip Lin so then

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.110 
sound like this one trip Lin so then
your<00:03:37.319> left<00:03:37.650> hand<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.459> come<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
your left hand is going to come to the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.509 
your left hand is going to come to the
rack<00:03:39.299> Tom<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.840> then<00:03:40.410> your<00:03:40.680> other<00:03:40.860> two<00:03:41.190> are

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
rack Tom and then your other two are

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.309 
rack Tom and then your other two are
going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> come<00:03:41.970> back<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.390> floor<00:03:42.599> tom<00:03:42.810> like

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
going to come back to the floor tom like

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.720 
going to come back to the floor tom like
this<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:44.720> triplet<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.440> every<00:03:46.920> quarter<00:03:47.250> note<00:03:47.609> is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
this to triplet so every quarter note is

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.759 
this to triplet so every quarter note is
going<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.269> hitting<00:03:48.540> on<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.290> rack<00:03:49.530> Tom

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
going to be hitting on the rack Tom

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.620 
going to be hitting on the rack Tom
you're<00:03:50.340> going<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.519> be<00:03:50.670> alternating<00:03:51.359> from

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
you're going to be alternating from

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.879 
you're going to be alternating from
right<00:03:51.930> left<00:03:52.500> right<00:03:52.799> left<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:54.540> played<00:03:55.530> four

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
right left right left so played four

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.930 
right left right left so played four
times<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.760> would<00:03:56.970> sound<00:03:57.150> like<00:03:57.299> this<00:03:57.920> one

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
times that would sound like this one

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:08.090 
times that would sound like this one
triplet<00:03:59.940> two<00:04:00.090> triplet<00:04:05.690> so<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.260> play<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.769> for

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
triplet two triplet so we play that for

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.699 
triplet two triplet so we play that for
one<00:04:08.310> measure<00:04:08.579> which<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.780> little<00:04:10.230> bit<00:04:10.350> up<00:04:10.560> to

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
one measure which a little bit up to

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.380 
one measure which a little bit up to
speed<00:04:11.040> sounds<00:04:11.489> like<00:04:11.639> this

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.050 

it<00:04:15.020> sounds<00:04:15.920> pretty<00:04:16.040> cool<00:04:16.310> especially<00:04:16.519> when

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
it sounds pretty cool especially when

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.400 
it sounds pretty cool especially when
you<00:04:17.180> play<00:04:17.329> it<00:04:17.480> very<00:04:17.540> very<00:04:18.140> fast<00:04:20.049> it's<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.140> really

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
you play it very very fast it's a really
