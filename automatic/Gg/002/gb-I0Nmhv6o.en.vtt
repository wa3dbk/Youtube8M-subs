that dry signal which means it's

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.800

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
never let my bass player use it because

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.700 
never let my bass player use it because

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
he'd just be over there screwing with it

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.940 
he'd just be over there screwing with it
the<00:05:47.860> whole<00:05:48.070> night<00:05:48.970> I<00:05:49.360> mean<00:05:50.350> there's<00:05:50.590> just<00:05:50.740> too

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
the whole night I mean there's just too

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.460 
the whole night I mean there's just too
many<00:05:51.070> options<00:05:51.670> for<00:05:51.790> him<00:05:52.180> but<00:05:52.690> that's<00:05:53.050> my<00:05:53.260> bass

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
many options for him but that's my bass

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.770 
many options for him but that's my bass

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
player maybe yours has a little more

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.200 
player maybe yours has a little more
self<00:05:56.080> control<00:05:56.520> that's<00:05:57.520> why<00:05:57.670> they<00:05:57.910> play<00:05:58.060> the

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
self control that's why they play the

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:05.190 
self control that's why they play the
bass<00:05:58.390> right

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200
