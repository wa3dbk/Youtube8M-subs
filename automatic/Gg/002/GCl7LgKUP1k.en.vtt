yes<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:37.110> good<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
yes a very good one I think that is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
yes a very good one I think that is
actually<00:01:38.400> linked<00:01:38.790> relatively<00:01:39.450> strongly<00:01:39.990> with

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
actually linked relatively strongly with

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.020 
actually linked relatively strongly with
them<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.500> could<00:01:40.680> happen<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:41.939> it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
them that could happen I don't think it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.149 
them that could happen I don't think it
will<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.630> possible<00:01:42.869> next<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.829> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
will but it is possible next one is in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.249 
will but it is possible next one is in
color<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.579> Marseille<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
color from Marseille this is one of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
color from Marseille this is one of
those<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:46.649> loose<00:01:46.890> ones<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> can't<00:01:47.579> really

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
those very loose ones you can't really

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
those very loose ones you can't really
see<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.149> happening<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:48.960> yes<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.590> would<00:01:49.710> be

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
see it happening but yes it would be

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.380 
see it happening but yes it would be
great<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.040> album<00:01:50.399> he<00:01:50.579> was<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> team<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
great to album he was in the team of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
great to album he was in the team of
season<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.840> most<00:01:52.020> consistent<00:01:52.619> i<00:01:52.710> believe

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
season for most consistent i believe

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.910 
season for most consistent i believe
it's<00:01:53.670> got<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:53.970> good<00:01:54.119> start<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.540> 80<00:01:54.810> pace<00:01:55.229> 82

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's got very good start of 80 pace 82

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.880 
it's got very good start of 80 pace 82
out<00:01:56.040> defending<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.149> 78<00:01:57.810> heading<00:01:58.079> good<00:01:58.649> player

out defending and 78 heading good player

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.920 
out defending and 78 heading good player
there<00:01:59.159> he'd<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> dabbing<00:02:00.420> Louie<00:02:00.540> sort

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
there he'd be like a dabbing Louie sort

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.749 
there he'd be like a dabbing Louie sort
of<00:02:01.020> Oh<00:02:01.259> peed<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.490> player<00:02:02.899> next<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
of Oh peed kind of player next is the

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.190 
of Oh peed kind of player next is the
cardo<00:02:05.759> Carvalho<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.570> guy's<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.930> an<00:02:06.990> old

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
cardo Carvalho this guy's get an old

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.290 
cardo Carvalho this guy's get an old
beats<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:07.950> good<00:02:08.160> player<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> he<00:02:09.149> has

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
beats a very good player and he has

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360 
beats a very good player and he has
actually<00:02:09.479> signed<00:02:10.020> for<00:02:10.379> Monaco<00:02:10.860> from<00:02:11.190> Real

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
actually signed for Monaco from Real

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.950 
actually signed for Monaco from Real
Madrid<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.910> think<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.330> was<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> free<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
Madrid for I think it was a free to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.570 
Madrid for I think it was a free to
transfer<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:14.010> least<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.490> be

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
transfer so at least it's going to be

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.460 
transfer so at least it's going to be
getting<00:02:14.730> some<00:02:14.970> football<00:02:15.360> now<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.780> yes<00:02:16.200> he's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
getting some football now and yes he's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.130 
getting some football now and yes he's
I've<00:02:16.740> gone<00:02:16.950> give<00:02:17.460> him<00:02:17.640> writing<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.180> 77<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.050> is

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
I've gone give him writing of 77 that is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.230 
I've gone give him writing of 77 that is
way<00:02:19.530> far<00:02:19.830> down<00:02:20.070> from<00:02:20.340> last<00:02:20.490> year<00:02:20.760> when<00:02:21.060> he<00:02:21.120> was

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
way far down from last year when he was

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.360 
way far down from last year when he was
80<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.470> thought<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> bit<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.340> bit

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
80 and I thought that was a bit a bit

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.340 
80 and I thought that was a bit a bit
unfair<00:02:24.030> really<00:02:24.420> considering<00:02:24.990> he<00:02:25.110> doesn't

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
unfair really considering he doesn't

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.710 
unfair really considering he doesn't

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
you again is one of those players that

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.620 
you again is one of those players that
it's<00:03:01.920> very<00:03:02.160> very<00:03:02.520> weakly<00:03:02.850> length<00:03:03.240> one<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.570> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
it's very very weakly length one of the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.300 
it's very very weakly length one of the
weakest<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.020> them<00:03:04.170> all<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.470> think<00:03:05.190> this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
weakest of them all I think this

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.860 
weakest of them all I think this
actually<00:03:05.550> may<00:03:05.970> have<00:03:06.000> been<00:03:06.270> dismissed<00:03:06.510> that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
actually may have been dismissed that

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.390 
actually may have been dismissed that
years<00:03:07.020> doing<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.470> by<00:03:07.620> thought<00:03:07.860> put<00:03:08.220> him<00:03:08.310> in

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
years doing it by thought put him in

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.950 
years doing it by thought put him in
there<00:03:08.520> anyway<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:09.030> because<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.750> couldn't

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
there anyway just because I couldn't

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.750 
there anyway just because I couldn't
really<00:03:10.110> find<00:03:10.290> make<00:03:10.530> central<00:03:10.980> midfielders<00:03:11.610> to

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
two players of the subs i thought i'd

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.730 
two players of the subs i thought i'd
add<00:06:07.750> these<00:06:07.960> engines<00:06:08.350> because<00:06:08.500> they<00:06:08.680> were

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
add these engines because they were

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.350 
add these engines because they were
funny<00:06:09.040> and<00:06:09.160> i<00:06:09.310> think<00:06:09.520> well<00:06:09.850> if<00:06:09.970> they<00:06:10.120> went

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
funny and i think well if they went

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.780 
funny and i think well if they went
that'd<00:06:10.540> be<00:06:10.720> kind<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.140> weird<00:06:11.320> again<00:06:12.310> to<00:06:12.520> very

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
that'd be kind of weird again to very

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.850 
that'd be kind of weird again to very
highly<00:06:13.180> rated<00:06:13.330> players<00:06:13.690> going<00:06:13.930> to<00:06:14.110> Monaco<00:06:14.650> and

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
highly rated players going to Monaco and

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.250 
highly rated players going to Monaco and
that<00:06:15.040> was<00:06:15.220> first<00:06:15.630> Carlos<00:06:16.630> Tevez<00:06:17.050> she's

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
that was first Carlos Tevez she's

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.840 
that was first Carlos Tevez she's
actually<00:06:17.440> been<00:06:17.710> right<00:06:18.100> linked<00:06:18.490> but<00:06:18.670> now<00:06:18.820> I

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
actually been right linked but now I

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.780 
actually been right linked but now I
think<00:06:18.970> Falcao<00:06:19.480> he<00:06:20.050> won't<00:06:20.260> go<00:06:20.470> and<00:06:20.790> finally

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
think Falcao he won't go and finally

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.670 
think Falcao he won't go and finally
