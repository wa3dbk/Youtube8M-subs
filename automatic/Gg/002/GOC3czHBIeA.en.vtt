00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.960
 the Australian company critical 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.660
 robotics is known for special 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.940
 light strong motorized aerobatics 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.400
 Models in the field of 3D aerobatics 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.730
 set standards 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.880
 the latest geniestreich is the xr 52 one 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.190
 medium decker with 1321 meter span 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.510
 and less than 1000 kilograms of flight 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.129
 weight the xl 52 is unmistakably the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.020
 successor of the successful 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.600
 but finished in all dimensions 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.970
 significantly larger with a new develop 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.379
 which is over profile and is for 1 4 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.379
 nico setup optimized 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.300
 characteristic of precision 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.550
 europatags models is the fusion 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.469
 called construction a clever 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.409
 Connection of white plywood and 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.570
 carbon fiber allows this technology 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.580
 extremely lightweight at maximum 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.220
 stability 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.860
 the completion of the xf 52 is about 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.090
 ten hours to complete 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.640
 You are reliably supported by 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 a gapless well understood and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.170
 helpful illustrated instructions 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.040
 three color variants red green blue respectively 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.350
 combined with white and gray you are 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.350
 German importer brackmann available 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.850
 aviator convincing the xl 52 on 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.310
 whole line 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.680
 the speed spectrum is enormous 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.450
 at full throttle, the model is impressive 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.060
 fast in slow flight, however 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.119
 lambish the art is airworthiness 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.310
 unlimited in 3d flight presents itself 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.310
 the xr 52 also talented 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.770
 recommended by the two in propeller 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.650
 the 13 65 inch type is our favorite 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.740
 he turns extremely quietly and produces one 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.840
 significantly higher ground speed 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.060
 three room 5 inch propeller has one 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.200
 stronger braking effects down passages 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.720
 and when landing 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.100
 This is advantageous if you are with small 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.100
 landslofen must take
