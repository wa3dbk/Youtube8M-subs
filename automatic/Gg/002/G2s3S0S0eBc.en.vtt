 things and a lot of fun as one 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.670
 video game the intro please first tip 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.140
 you can single words from the google 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.880
 banish search results 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.580
 very easy we just look for 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.920
 Uli Hoeneß 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.090
 hoeness and maybe interested 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.239
 his whole tax evasion 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200
 history but now he was the other day 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.489
 blackmailed here is this squeeze 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.050
 History does not interest us at all 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.940
 that's why we're going to uli hoeneß 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.829
 distance - extortion and now was missing 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.660
 google all pages out of duty something 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.550
 tell about the blackmail story 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 not only can you get individual values ​​from the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 banish search request 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.840
 it goes in the other direction and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.489
 though google would be so small for example 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.149
 words like and just on request 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.280
 to brush 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 go even a tintin google 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 look for tim struppi now 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.799
 if I want that and explicitly 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.510
 with in the search request is then set 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.430
 me in front of that and influence and google 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.900
 search back to tim and struppi 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 that is not a good example 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.810
 a fall google of course it tim 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.580
 and struppi a fixed concept 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.140
 you have you know that others 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.939
 Meaningful use of this tip 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.740
 There is also a special one 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.780
 picture search with which one can some 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.939
 make meaningful things when we are in the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.110
 internet and find some picture of him 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.729
 do not know what you see on it or 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.840
 want to have more information then 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.479
 we can just right click 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.490
 then make it the address of that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.290
 save image as graphic adress 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.570
 copy and then go with this 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.700
 address on images from google.com 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.189
 press on the small photo symbol comes 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.409
 this mask and here we copy the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.500
 jurors of the picture and press 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.670
 picture search and surprises google 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.659
 betrays us paying for that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.610
 Brandenburg Gate 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 and here we also see relevant ones 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.110
 left to the picture but some 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.700
 long complicated search term in the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.770
 the order of the words and everything 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.240
 really very relevant then you have to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.460
 it will be in quotation marks with 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.990
 google really looks exactly like that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.759
 example is that the model name 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.649
 from a tablet if I do this so 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.239
 search then google could looks like 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.500
 Namely spit out results 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.330
 like ace stops on it and then im 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.130
 away unia and then a 71 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.200
 far back on the page when I am 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.610
 put it in quotation marks 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.900
 Google just pages with them really 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.970
 asic b 171 at the bottom on whoever him 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.590
 I give relevant searches to give 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.060
 stood there google search mask knows everyone 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.040
 We see that a dozen times a day 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.650
 but there is also an advanced search 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.420
 can be found at google.de / bands 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.010
 by the way also everything in the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.140
 description on it to type it 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.800
 is and here you can still many things 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.870
 refine 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.430
 For example, you can enter and 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.080
 determine which words are not in 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.240
 search results should be available 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.470
 and the language the results I have 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.610
 I just go to this search 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.380
 As you can say many more 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.570
 Did you know you did that? 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.400
 with google internet addresses can be found 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.930
 which contain a certain word for 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.790
 example sword dancing works 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.420
 follows one enters the command 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.250
 into a colon and danone distance 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.080
 the word just in the domain 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.390
 should be included for example dance 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.709
 Now all of our search results are 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.700
 word hansen, for example, is dancing 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.190
 dance without film.de that for one side 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.590
 fell then dance music point de 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.260
 invites everyone to have the word dance 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.900
 in there we have to get out of this if that 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.709
 dance and film it is dance classes and 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.180
 parties in climate and the next tip is 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.160
 maybe one of my favorite tips 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.010
 sometimes internet sites jack one 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.820
 you also know about google 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.800
 search 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.300
 an example I want on the 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.580
 website www.muenchenticket.de nach 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.590
 looking for the environmental zone 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.880
 but I know that the inflation is direct 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.380
 on the side is not when I am 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.180
 have any other search results 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.700
 but only search results from direct 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.670
 the page www.muenchenticket.de as saying 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.950
 I google with the command site 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.230
 colon and danone distance just that 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.830
 domain www points muenchen.de that on 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.230
 this side 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.870
 to look for the environmental zone now 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.880
 I get as result just that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.200
 info from the environmental zone in munich 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.549
 the page muenchen.de 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.230
 and I did not have to be complicated 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.250
 the side in munich looking for the honor 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.700
 but google has that for me 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.769
 accepted 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.750
 as often as google possible right after 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.580
 to search for particular file formats 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.530
 pdf for example, there's the code 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.510
 Filaments colon so filaments colon 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.680
 pdf now it only looks for pdfs to 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.750
 for example, the topic 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.870
 instructions iphone 5 below and i get 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.400
 pdf instructions for the iphone directly from 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.050
 Apple found here from google 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.370
 if you feel like me then 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.990
 he likes to forget a few things 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.910
 for example, not after use 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.860
 Google has a word in the middle 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.389
 forget and then can not google that 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.620
 with part namely a star to the 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.270
 I do not think of this word 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.930
 more white so example I have 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.030
 forget this then asterisk now 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.889
 Search google just for a sentence in 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.360
 corresponds to this pattern and that 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.250
 asterisk is just left empty 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.229
 For example, I have this one 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.120
 dumb pattern forgot now after 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.130
 wanted because I found this 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.410
 sternchen trick could now be the last 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.360
 tip like all internet sites 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.490
 especially like and maybe 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.750
 we still have the need for the wish 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.030
 on the part of find that are similar to 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.000
 I like the page for example 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:26.400
 page google.com now i can do all ' 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.349
 gated colon www.google.com not 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.990
 Chamber point com and google search me 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.479
 these pages are similar to google as 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.039
 for example yahoo or bing or others 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.990
 search engines were tried with theirs 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.030
 favorite pages so that was the ten 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.610
 Useful tips now my buddy 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.349
 bmi with filming here helps me in 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.330
 Canadian cool format will be announced soon 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.690
 I will describe my description box brd 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.889
 show heard brother people give what 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.599
 I am here too and will show you 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.270
 five more little search terms with 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:58.110
 genii could have fun on google 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.030
 the first one would be you can on the 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.460
 play gugl that just gives a press 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.810
 on enter or seek wait briefly and 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.409
 now you see many small usd 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.909
 come and destroy my ad 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.780
 want 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.520
 and i have to face death with it 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.990
 nothing happens you can do all this much 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.599
 I settle on the cross clicks 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.180
 Another game you can play 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:20.190
 is the classic breakout of atari 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.560
 For that he goes to images point 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:27.900
 google.com and is there an atari here 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.509
 look for a break 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.580
 Now we wait very briefly and you see 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.420
 already what happens i can breakout 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.800
 should 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.410
 with quite classic oldschool eight 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.600
 songs very nice very very sorry 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.640
 The whole I found myself breaking off 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.350
 we go back to the picture search the 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.300
 I show you the last three search terms 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.870
 but I will not tell you what 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.800
 they effect 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:57.030
 the first one would be who is jörg norris wo 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:03.160
 Chuck Norris is the second one you are 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:04.570
 enter barrel and the last window 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.100
 and the thing is already displayed 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.660
 what is the pretty long search term 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.030
 the institute of the universe and 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.610
 everything goes these three things times 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.230
 one sees what happens and if you 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.150
 Know where these reports come from 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.610
 write in the comments 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.050
 that makes me have this one is next 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.470
 week's back to normal without 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:29.550
 Lucky me right there I am 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:29.550
 behind the camera again and that 's it
