00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
gonna go up here to the curves and click

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.099 
gonna go up here to the curves and click
that<00:00:57.039> now<00:00:57.339> as<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:57.969> can<00:00:58.120> see<00:00:58.179> in<00:00:58.629> your<00:00:58.839> layer

that now as you can see in your layer
mask<00:00:59.499> here<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:01.059> actually<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.960> mask<00:01:02.170> is

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
mask here it's actually the mask is

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.799 
mask here it's actually the mask is
being<00:01:02.620> taken<00:01:03.039> in<00:01:03.249> the<00:01:03.729> white<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.450> now<00:01:04.600> we're

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
being taken in the white so now we're

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.420 
being taken in the white so now we're
gonna<00:01:04.900> want<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.260> do<00:01:05.470> is<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:07.150> up<00:01:07.960> here<00:01:08.190> into<00:01:09.190> the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
gonna want to do is go up here into the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.820 
gonna want to do is go up here into the
properties<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.300> our<00:01:10.480> mask<00:01:10.870> and<00:01:11.230> we're<00:01:11.620> going

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
properties of our mask and we're going

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.070 
properties of our mask and we're going
to<00:01:11.860> invert<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.520> now<00:01:13.180> you<00:01:13.240> notice<00:01:13.660> it's<00:01:13.840> black

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
to invert it now you notice it's black

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.420 
to invert it now you notice it's black
on<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.440> inside<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:14.980> white<00:01:15.160> on<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.400> outside

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
on the inside and white on the outside

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.940 
on the inside and white on the outside
that<00:01:16.120> means<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.630> effect<00:01:17.080> is<00:01:17.320> actually<00:01:17.560> going

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
that means the effect is actually going

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.160 
that means the effect is actually going
to<00:01:18.160> be<00:01:18.250> taking<00:01:18.400> place<00:01:18.700> on<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.060> outside<00:01:19.450> so<00:01:20.050> now

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
to be taking place on the outside so now

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.590 
to be taking place on the outside so now
we<00:01:20.260> go<00:01:20.470> into<00:01:20.590> our<00:01:20.740> curves<00:01:21.070> here<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.850> we<00:01:22.390> can

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
we go into our curves here and we can

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.690 
we go into our curves here and we can
drop<00:01:22.870> it<00:01:23.080> down<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.710> look<00:01:23.950> at<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.190> vignette

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
drop it down and look at that vignette

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.920 
drop it down and look at that vignette
coming<00:01:25.120> in<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.690> looks<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.230> nice<00:01:26.730> now<00:01:27.930> after

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
coming in it looks so nice now after

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.510 
coming in it looks so nice now after
this<00:01:29.260> we're<00:01:29.620> gonna<00:01:29.740> go<00:01:29.980> ahead<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.370> make

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
this we're gonna go ahead and make

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.270 
this we're gonna go ahead and make
another<00:01:30.880> curve<00:01:31.510> selection<00:01:32.260> right<00:01:32.890> on<00:01:33.040> top<00:01:33.250> of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
another curve selection right on top of

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
another curve selection right on top of
that<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.580> we're<00:01:33.700> just<00:01:33.790> gonna<00:01:33.910> make<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.210> simple

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that and we're just gonna make a simple

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.020 
that and we're just gonna make a simple
s-curve<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.460> bring<00:01:36.940> up<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.330> highlights<00:01:39.030> bring

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
s-curve so bring up the highlights bring

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.680 
s-curve so bring up the highlights bring
down<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.690> shadows<00:01:41.760> maybe<00:01:42.760> even<00:01:43.090> go<00:01:43.240> ahead<00:01:43.360> and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
down the shadows maybe even go ahead and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.850 
down the shadows maybe even go ahead and
bring<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.440> mid-tones<00:01:45.040> down<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.400> bit<00:01:45.700> as<00:01:45.880> well

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
bring the mid-tones down a bit as well

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.970 
bring the mid-tones down a bit as well
now<00:01:47.860> from<00:01:48.190> here<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:49.120> key<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:50.350> effect

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
now from here the key to this effect

now from here the key to this effect
you're<00:01:51.400> gonna<00:01:51.550> add<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.850> new<00:01:52.360> layer<00:01:52.690> right<00:01:53.050> here

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
you're gonna add a new layer right here

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.980 
you're gonna add a new layer right here
now<00:01:54.160> however<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:54.700> want<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.000> achieve<00:01:55.480> this

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.980 
it's already set here to black and boom
there<00:02:05.620> goes<00:02:05.650> everything<00:02:06.720> now<00:02:07.720> we're<00:02:07.840> going<00:02:07.930> to

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
there goes everything now we're going to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.220 
there goes everything now we're going to
change<00:02:08.350> our<00:02:08.710> blending<00:02:09.429> options<00:02:09.850> up<00:02:10.090> here<00:02:10.230> to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
change our blending options up here to

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.940 
change our blending options up here to
hue

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
hue

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.740 
hue
so<00:02:13.790> now<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.209> more<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.540> black-and-white

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
so now it's more of a black-and-white

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.420 
so now it's more of a black-and-white
photo<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.709> when<00:02:16.069> we<00:02:16.220> bring<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.239> opacity<00:02:17.569> down

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
photo and when we bring the opacity down

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.460 
photo and when we bring the opacity down
you<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.550> see<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.910> color<00:02:20.239> comes<00:02:20.690> back<00:02:20.959> into

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you can see that color comes back into

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.630 
you can see that color comes back into
the<00:02:21.590> photo<00:02:23.590> now<00:02:24.590> from<00:02:25.160> here<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.580> is

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the photo now from here this is

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.380 
the photo now from here this is
basically<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.690> as<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.319> see<00:02:27.380> when<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.390> hide

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
basically it as you can see when I hide

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.590 
basically it as you can see when I hide
the<00:02:29.630> layers<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.080> difference<00:02:30.860> between<00:02:31.600> then

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
the layers the difference between then

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.340 
the layers the difference between then
and<00:02:32.900> now<00:02:33.910> now<00:02:34.910> what<00:02:35.390> we're<00:02:35.540> gonna<00:02:35.630> do<00:02:36.050> is

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
and now now what we're gonna do is

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.370 
and now now what we're gonna do is
actually<00:02:36.800> go<00:02:37.280> up<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:38.470> our<00:02:39.470> layers<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:41.380> we're

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
actually go up to our layers and we're

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.420 
actually go up to our layers and we're
going<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.769> flatten<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.430> image<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:45.440> now<00:02:45.470> this

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
going to flatten the image so now this

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.540 
going to flatten the image so now this
is<00:02:46.600> what<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.780> image<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.800> we're<00:02:49.069> gonna<00:02:49.280> go

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
is what the image is and we're gonna go

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.190 
is what the image is and we're gonna go
and<00:02:49.910> add<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:51.160> sharpen<00:02:52.420> filter<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.720> it

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and add a sharpen filter to it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.890 
and add a sharpen filter to it
we're<00:02:54.290> going<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.470> go<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.910> filter<00:02:55.910> sharpen<00:02:56.120> and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
we're going to go to filter sharpen and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.979 
we're going to go to filter sharpen and
then<00:02:57.019> unsharpened<00:02:57.799> mask<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.780> actually

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
then unsharpened mask and I actually

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.009 
then unsharpened mask and I actually
have<00:03:00.380> these<00:03:00.530> settings<00:03:01.040> already<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.640> as<00:03:02.019> you

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
have these settings already in as you

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.530 
have these settings already in as you
can<00:03:03.170> see<00:03:03.700> playing<00:03:04.700> around<00:03:04.970> with<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:05.330> you're

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
can see playing around with this you're

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.660 
can see playing around with this you're
gonna<00:03:05.630> get<00:03:05.900> many<00:03:06.620> many<00:03:07.220> different<00:03:07.640> things

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
gonna get many many different things

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.509 
gonna get many many different things
what<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.209> like<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.660> do<00:03:08.840> for<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.410> Lomo<00:03:09.769> effect<00:03:10.220> is

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
what I like to do for the Lomo effect is

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.039 
what I like to do for the Lomo effect is
take<00:03:11.390> my<00:03:11.510> radius<00:03:11.930> 250<00:03:12.620> as<00:03:13.150> well<00:03:14.150> as<00:03:14.330> my<00:03:14.569> amount

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
take my radius 250 as well as my amount

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.539 
take my radius 250 as well as my amount
and<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:16.010> gives<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.310> much<00:03:16.549> more<00:03:16.850> drastic<00:03:17.570> look<00:03:18.549> so

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
and it gives a much more drastic look so

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.660 
and it gives a much more drastic look so
that<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.680> Lomo<00:03:22.070> photography

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
that is it that is the Lomo photography

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.210 
that is it that is the Lomo photography
effect<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.209> that<00:03:23.239> is<00:03:23.739> quite<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.769> bit<00:03:25.190> different

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
effect and that is quite a bit different

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.150 
effect and that is quite a bit different
than<00:03:25.940> what<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.329> originally<00:03:26.690> started<00:03:27.260> off<00:03:27.829> with

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
than what we originally started off with

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.020 
than what we originally started off with
as<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:29.450> can<00:03:29.720> tell<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:31.430> that's<00:03:31.850> how<00:03:31.970> you

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
as you can tell and that's how you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.090 
as you can tell and that's how you
achieve<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.450> Lomo<00:03:32.900> photography<00:03:33.530> effect<00:03:33.890> in

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
achieve a Lomo photography effect in
