00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
now we're not only producing energy but

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.870 
now we're not only producing energy but
we're<00:00:20.910> producing<00:00:21.390> less<00:00:22.380> Lutins<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.699> better

drive through them and then there's a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.380 
drive through them and then there's a
high-speed<00:02:04.460> avoidance<00:02:04.910> where<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.150> go<00:02:05.240> up<00:02:05.360> to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.929 
let's go back so that's what normally
happens<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.650> car<00:03:44.860> gets<00:03:45.069> away<00:03:45.310> from<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.700> yes

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
happens the car gets away from you yes

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.270 
happens the car gets away from you yes
right<00:03:46.299> so<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.230> got<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.620> maintain<00:03:47.799> that

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
right so you got to maintain that

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.910 
right so you got to maintain that
control<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:49.209> all<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.049> lack<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.439> a<00:03:50.470> quicker<00:03:50.709> on

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
control and all you lack is a quicker on

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.479 
control and all you lack is a quicker on
the<00:03:50.950> steering<00:03:51.250> wheel<00:03:51.810> left<00:03:53.159> eye's<00:03:54.159> all<00:03:54.370> the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
all right next up is the stabilitrak

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.860 
all right next up is the stabilitrak
demo<00:05:07.069> this<00:05:07.219> is<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.759> new<00:05:08.270> system<00:05:08.659> that's

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
demo this is a new system that's

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.269 
demo this is a new system that's
supposed<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.199> be<00:05:09.229> standard<00:05:09.680> on<00:05:09.800> all<00:05:09.830> GM

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279 
supposed to be standard on all GM

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.110 
supposed to be standard on all GM
vehicles<00:05:10.729> in<00:05:10.909> a<00:05:10.999> year<00:05:11.180> or<00:05:11.270> two<00:05:11.409> and<00:05:13.120> what's

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
vehicles in a year or two and what's

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.879 
vehicles in a year or two and what's
supposed<00:05:14.779> to<00:05:14.840> be<00:05:14.900> great<00:05:15.169> about<00:05:15.379> it<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:15.680> it

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
supposed to be great about it is it

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.469 
supposed to be great about it is it
cooperates<00:05:16.639> with<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:16.879> anti-lock<00:05:17.180> braking

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
cooperates with the anti-lock braking

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.989 
cooperates with the anti-lock braking
system<00:05:17.629> so<00:05:18.499> that<00:05:18.529> when<00:05:18.889> you<00:05:19.159> dodge<00:05:19.819> an

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:19.999 
system so that when you dodge an

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.929 
system so that when you dodge an
obstacle<00:05:20.360> in<00:05:20.569> the<00:05:20.689> freeway<00:05:20.930> or<00:05:21.669> anywhere<00:05:22.669> and

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
obstacle in the freeway or anywhere and

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.510 
obstacle in the freeway or anywhere and
your<00:05:23.150> wheel<00:05:23.330> starts<00:05:23.689> skidding<00:05:23.960> what<00:05:24.949> what<00:05:25.430> it

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
your wheel starts skidding what what it

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.760 
your wheel starts skidding what what it
does<00:05:25.729> is<00:05:25.939> it<00:05:25.969> somehow<00:05:26.930> transfers<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.740> power

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
does is it somehow transfers the power

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.980 
does is it somehow transfers the power
in<00:05:28.129> the<00:05:28.250> wheels<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:28.759> that<00:05:28.939> you<00:05:29.449> can<00:05:29.629> recover

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
in the wheels so that you can recover

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.510 
in the wheels so that you can recover
quicker<00:05:30.379> and<00:05:30.710> actually<00:05:31.039> get<00:05:31.159> back<00:05:31.340> on<00:05:31.490> course

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
quicker and actually get back on course

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.089 
quicker and actually get back on course
and<00:05:32.029> so<00:05:32.629> what<00:05:33.379> they're<00:05:33.500> going<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.680> do<00:05:33.830> is

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
and so what they're going to do is

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.830 
and so what they're going to do is
they're<00:05:34.490> going<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.699> have<00:05:34.879> one<00:05:35.240> car<00:05:35.449> going

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
they're going to have one car going

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.990 
they're going to have one car going
without<00:05:36.349> stabilitrak<00:05:37.099> dodging<00:05:37.610> an<00:05:37.699> obstacle

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
without stabilitrak dodging an obstacle

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.749 
without stabilitrak dodging an obstacle
heavy<00:05:38.599> braking<00:05:38.870> and<00:05:39.400> they're<00:05:40.400> going<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.610> do

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
heavy braking and they're going to do

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.059 
heavy braking and they're going to do
another<00:05:40.969> one<00:05:41.210> with<00:05:41.539> stabilitrak<00:05:42.169> and<00:05:42.439> we're

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
another one with stabilitrak and we're

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.499 
another one with stabilitrak and we're
going<00:05:43.189> to<00:05:43.250> get<00:05:43.339> shots<00:05:43.610> both<00:05:43.849> inside<00:05:44.240> and<00:05:44.270> out

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
going to get shots both inside and out

00:05:44.509 --> 00:06:11.570 
going to get shots both inside and out
so<00:05:44.839> have<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.020> look

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580
