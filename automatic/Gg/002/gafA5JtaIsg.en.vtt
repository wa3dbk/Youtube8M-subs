method<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.210> minute<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:46.140> both<00:00:46.469> sides<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
method for a minute now both sides of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.319 
method for a minute now both sides of
the<00:00:46.920> shirt<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.340> red<00:00:47.579> wine<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.940> them<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.210> we're

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the shirt have red wine on them so we're

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.819 
the shirt have red wine on them so we're
going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> establish<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:49.260> side<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> shirt

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
going to establish one side of the shirt

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.860 
going to establish one side of the shirt
as<00:00:50.039> our<00:00:50.370> control<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.300> other<00:00:51.480> side<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
as our control and the other side of the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720 
as our control and the other side of the
shirt<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.230> our<00:00:52.469> experiment<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.640> this

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
shirt as our experiment now if this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.549 
shirt as our experiment now if this
party<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.059> even<00:00:54.539> halfway<00:00:54.719> decent<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
party is even halfway decent and it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
party is even halfway decent and it
should<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.340> you're<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:56.699> they'll

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
should be because you're there they'll

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.150 
should be because you're there they'll
probably<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.780> white<00:00:58.020> wine<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.379> well<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.890> get

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
probably have white wine as well so get

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
probably have white wine as well so get
yourself<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> glass<00:00:59.670> or<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> bottle<00:01:00.660> now<00:01:01.260> pour

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
your white wine on to the one side of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
your white wine on to the one side of
the<00:01:03.480> shirt<00:01:03.629> covering<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.379> stain<00:01:04.589> again

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
you're going to gently dab the shirt to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.640 
you're going to gently dab the shirt to
soak<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.090> much<00:01:09.119> moisture<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.750> possible<00:01:10.229> now

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
soak up as much moisture as possible now

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.530 
soak up as much moisture as possible now
already<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.430> looks<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> white<00:01:12.030> wine<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
already it looks like the white wine is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.490 
already it looks like the white wine is
diffusing<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> red<00:01:13.920> wine<00:01:14.130> stand<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> far

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
diffusing the red wine stand so so far

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.170 
diffusing the red wine stand so so far
so<00:01:16.680> good<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.640> comes<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> red<00:01:18.000> wine

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
so good now when it comes to red wine

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.210 
so good now when it comes to red wine
time<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.960> definitely<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.770> side<00:01:19.920> so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
time is definitely not on your side so

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.499 
time is definitely not on your side so
you're<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> wash<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.299> as

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you're going to want to wash this as

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
you're going to want to wash this as
quickly<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.110> possible<00:01:22.140> running<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.250> under

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
quickly as possible running it under

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.179 
quickly as possible running it under
some<00:01:23.759> warm<00:01:24.030> water<00:01:24.299> definitely<00:01:24.990> helps<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.100> if

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
some warm water definitely helps but if

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.410 
some warm water definitely helps but if
you<00:01:26.250> could<00:01:26.369> find<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> washing<00:01:26.850> machine<00:01:26.880> that's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you could find a washing machine that's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.569 
you could find a washing machine that's
the<00:01:27.630> most<00:01:27.780> ideal<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.560> experimentals<00:01:29.130> sake<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the most ideal for experimentals sake I

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.460 
the most ideal for experimentals sake I
