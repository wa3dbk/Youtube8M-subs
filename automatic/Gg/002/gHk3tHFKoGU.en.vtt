guys over at hip voice and that's us
what<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.910> difference<00:00:12.240> between<00:00:12.300> hip<00:00:12.719> voice

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
what the difference between hip voice

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.530 
what the difference between hip voice

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
outside of the network we feel that

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.530 
outside of the network we feel that
there's<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.099> huge<00:00:32.399> market<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.059> outside<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
to communicate with one another so what

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.310 
to communicate with one another so what
we<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.280> an<00:00:41.820> MC<00:00:42.120> 70<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.290> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
we have here is an MC 70 that is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.040 
we have here is an MC 70 that is
connected<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.430> cellular<00:00:44.700> carrier<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.390> just

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
connected to a cellular carrier and just

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.740 
connected to a cellular carrier and just
to<00:00:46.140> prove<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.149> we're<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.600> my

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
to prove it to you we're actually in my

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.139 
to prove it to you we're actually in my
car<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.620> we'll<00:00:50.219> go<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.489> step<00:00:50.730> further<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
car but we'll go one step further and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.479 
car but we'll go one step further and
show<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.930> we're<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.620> even<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> Wi-Fi

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
show you that we're not even on a Wi-Fi

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.110 
show you that we're not even on a Wi-Fi
network

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
network

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.479 
network
we<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.840> actually<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> cellular<00:00:56.280> network

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
we are actually on a cellular network

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.349 
we are actually on a cellular network
and<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> could<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> Wi-Fi<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.670> off

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and you could see that the Wi-Fi is off

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.349 
and you could see that the Wi-Fi is off
the<00:01:01.079> Bluetooth<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.680> off<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.789> connected

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the Bluetooth is off and we're connected

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.539 
the Bluetooth is off and we're connected
on<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> cellular<00:01:05.070> right<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.729> so

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
on to the cellular right down there so

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.420 
on to the cellular right down there so
what<00:01:08.549> we're<00:01:08.700> gonna<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.920> go<00:01:10.920> ahead<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.130> talk

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
what we're gonna do is go ahead and talk

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.190 
what we're gonna do is go ahead and talk
to<00:01:11.580> our<00:01:11.610> dispatcher<00:01:12.150> while<00:01:12.570> we're<00:01:12.780> driving

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
to our dispatcher while we're driving

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.390 
to our dispatcher while we're driving
around<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:15.090> scenario<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.400> we

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
around and the scenario is is that we

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
around and the scenario is is that we
want<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> enable<00:01:18.210> communication<00:01:18.390> between<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
want to enable communication between the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.530 
want to enable communication between the
dispatcher<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.040> drivers<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:20.670> even<00:01:21.030> drivers

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
dispatcher and drivers or even drivers

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.899 
dispatcher and drivers or even drivers
against<00:01:21.960> other<00:01:22.110> drivers<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.490> other

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
against other drivers and other

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.719 
against other drivers and other
personnel<00:01:24.479> even<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.220> does<00:01:26.460> is

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
personnel even so what this does is

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.260 
personnel even so what this does is
enables<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:28.159> better<00:01:29.159> way<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> communicating

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
enables a better way of communicating

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
enables a better way of communicating
with<00:01:30.570> each<00:01:30.600> other<00:01:30.869> versus<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.619> sending<00:01:31.920> text

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
with each other versus just sending text

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.429 
with each other versus just sending text
messages<00:01:32.280> although<00:01:33.119> hip<00:01:33.479> cast<00:01:33.780> does<00:01:34.079> send

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
messages although hip cast does send

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.560 
messages although hip cast does send
text<00:01:35.040> messages<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.640> even<00:01:35.759> sticky<00:01:36.180> notes<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
text messages and even sticky notes and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.730 
text messages and even sticky notes and
we'll<00:01:36.659> show<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.439> bit<00:01:37.530> later

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
we'll show you that a little bit later

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
we'll show you that a little bit later
in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> demo<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:38.939> gonna<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.210> ahead<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
in the demo so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.999 
in the demo so I'm gonna go ahead and
drive<00:01:39.780> around<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.290> might<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> little<00:01:40.860> bit

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
drive around you might see a little bit

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.499 
drive around you might see a little bit
of<00:01:41.130> shadows<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.030> because

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
of shadows here and there because

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
of shadows here and there because
obviously<00:01:42.659> we're<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.470> through<00:01:43.610> we're

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
obviously we're just going through we're

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.399 
obviously we're just going through we're
going<00:01:44.820> through<00:01:44.970> shadows<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> trees<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
going through shadows and the trees and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
going through shadows and the trees and
stuff<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.360> wanted<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> say

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
stuff like that but I just wanted to say

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.690 
stuff like that but I just wanted to say
dispatcher<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.369> I'm

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
dispatcher are you there I think I'm

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
dispatcher are you there I think I'm
lost<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.270> now

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
lost right now

text message me the actual address and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.389 
text message me the actual address and
what's<00:02:02.490> happening<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.149> point<00:02:03.509> is

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
what's happening at this point is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
what's happening at this point is
carriers<00:02:05.399> traditionally<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.390> allow<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
carriers traditionally do not allow you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.100 
carriers traditionally do not allow you
to<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.290> full-on<00:02:08.250> VoIP<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.239> their<00:02:09.569> network

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
to do full-on VoIP on their network

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.490 
to do full-on VoIP on their network
and<00:02:10.290> that<00:02:11.130> means<00:02:11.480> ever<00:02:12.480> since<00:02:12.780> Skype<00:02:13.080> has<00:02:13.290> come

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and that means ever since Skype has come

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.820 
and that means ever since Skype has come
into<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.890> equation<00:02:14.690> they<00:02:15.690> said<00:02:16.140> well<00:02:16.590> we're

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
into the equation they said well we're

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.070 
into the equation they said well we're
not<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> allow<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.430> because<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.690> it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
not going to allow that because it it it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.620 
not going to allow that because it it it
affects<00:02:19.680> their<00:02:19.950> revenues<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.210> cellular

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
affects their revenues on the cellular

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.870 
affects their revenues on the cellular
side<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.020> things<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:23.130> what<00:02:23.430> we're<00:02:23.610> doing

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
side of things but what we're doing

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.120 
side of things but what we're doing
right<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.600> not<00:02:24.810> sending<00:02:25.260> out<00:02:25.500> true<00:02:25.830> VoIP

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
right now is not sending out true VoIP

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.340 
right now is not sending out true VoIP
packets<00:02:26.820> what<00:02:27.450> we're<00:02:27.600> doing<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.930> using<00:02:28.140> our

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
packets what we're doing is using our

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.170

technology and our encryption and our
encryption<00:02:30.920> algorithms<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.160> we're<00:02:32.970> taking

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
encryption algorithms and we're taking

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.110 
encryption algorithms and we're taking
the<00:02:33.390> actual<00:02:33.780> voice<00:02:33.990> compressing<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.800> and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the actual voice compressing it and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.400 
the actual voice compressing it and
putting<00:02:36.120> our<00:02:36.330> algorithms<00:02:36.870> inside<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.320> it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
putting our algorithms inside of it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.370 
putting our algorithms inside of it
sending<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.220> out<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.730> network<00:02:38.910> and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
sending it out to the network and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.750 
sending it out to the network and
pulling<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.500> down<00:02:40.680> decrypting<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.550> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
pulling it down decrypting it and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.390 
pulling it down decrypting it and
playing<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.080> other<00:02:43.200> end<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.980> obviously

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
playing it on the other end so obviously

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.640 
playing it on the other end so obviously
there's<00:02:44.640> going<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.880> be<00:02:44.940> delay<00:02:45.300> in<00:02:45.990> all<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.530> this

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
there's going to be delay in all of this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500 
there's going to be delay in all of this
and<00:02:46.860> you'll<00:02:46.950> see<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.310> our<00:02:47.510> conversations

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and you'll see that our conversations

00:02:48.510 --> 00:03:04.610 
and you'll see that our conversations
are<00:02:48.630> definitely<00:02:48.990> going<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.170> get<00:02:49.260> faster<00:03:03.620> all

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
are definitely going to get faster all

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.670 
are definitely going to get faster all

all of this is that few things anybody
can<00:03:15.840> talk<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.140> anybody<00:03:16.410> across<00:03:17.070> any<00:03:17.430> network

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
can talk to anybody across any network

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.330 
can talk to anybody across any network
across<00:03:18.300> any<00:03:18.630> carrier<00:03:19.110> anywhere<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.130> world

could be in Vodafone in Europe I could
be<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.860> telefónica<00:03:31.860> dimecaco<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.640> all<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.390> us

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
be in telefónica dimecaco and all of us

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.110 
be in telefónica dimecaco and all of us
can<00:03:33.720> communicate<00:03:34.260> with<00:03:34.440> each<00:03:34.590> other<00:03:35.030> as<00:03:36.030> you

can communicate with each other as you

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.030 
can communicate with each other as you
can<00:03:36.450> see<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.930> was<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.110> message<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.530> was<00:03:37.830> just

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
over to the side and so I can actually

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.430 
over to the side and so I can actually
see<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.880> read<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.300> message<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.840> play<00:03:43.260> that

see and read that message and play that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.350 
see and read that message and play that
for<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.769> guys

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.320 

hopefully<00:03:48.170> we're<00:03:48.320> in<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.520> well-lit<00:03:49.520> area

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.190 

okay<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:56.190> can<00:03:56.490> see<00:03:56.640> there's<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.200> sticky

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
okay as you can see there's a sticky

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.990 
okay as you can see there's a sticky
message<00:03:58.530> action<00:03:58.890> one<00:03:59.040> two<00:03:59.220> three<00:03:59.460> I<00:03:59.490> just<00:03:59.670> sent

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
message action one two three I just sent

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.550 
message action one two three I just sent
you<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.180> little<00:04:00.420> sketch<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.960> what<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.260> think<00:04:01.380> you

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
you a little sketch of what I think you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.950 
you a little sketch of what I think you
think<00:04:04.790> what<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:05.940> want<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.240> do<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.570> go<00:04:06.780> around

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
think what you want to do is go around

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.600

there's a pass code can you send me a

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.940 
there's a pass code can you send me a
text<00:04:23.430> message<00:04:24.030> with<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.080> pass<00:04:25.290> code<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.770> can

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
text message with the pass code so I can

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.370 
text message with the pass code so I can
get<00:04:26.100> in<00:04:26.250> please

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
so as you can see we had a sticky note

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
benefit to hip voice is that we have the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.310 
benefit to hip voice is that we have the
ability<00:04:38.730> let's<00:04:38.940> say<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.390> case<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:40.080> actually
