00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.210
 many options first take 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.000
 some building effect 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.090

 ceiling wash but it's long 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.109
 plus you have to pay for electricity that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.650
 still use some kind of chemical but 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.030

 wood so water will help 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.190
 you can see how the paint absorbs water 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.979
 one or two minutes and it will be easy 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.979
