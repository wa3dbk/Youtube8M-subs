so we have like the background we have
details<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.230> extra<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.770> I'm

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
details and then we have extra so I'm

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.950 
details and then we have extra so I'm
gonna<00:00:49.950> start<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.370> light<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.090> background<00:00:51.690> and

gonna start with light in background and
as<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.440> start<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> paint<00:00:52.980> over<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.280> photo<00:00:53.670> it's

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
as I start to paint over this photo it's

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.299 
as I start to paint over this photo it's
actually<00:00:54.629> analyzing<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> photo<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:56.010> only

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
actually analyzing the photo not only

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.540 
actually analyzing the photo not only
the<00:00:56.460> color<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.719> analyzing<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:59.190> shape

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the color but it's analyzing the shape

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000 
the color but it's analyzing the shape
of<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.090> photo<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> data<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
of the photo and all the data in it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
of the photo and all the data in it
basically<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.239> actually<00:01:03.629> using<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
basically and it's actually using that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.149 
basically and it's actually using that
data<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:05.040> apply<00:01:05.549> those<00:01:06.180> strokes<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.380> fact<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
data to apply those strokes in fact if I

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
data to apply those strokes in fact if I
select<00:01:08.549> hide<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.470> I'm

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
select hide you can see that's what I'm

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.770 
select hide you can see that's what I'm
painting<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.280> far<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.670> fact<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.360> gonna<00:01:12.510> select

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
painting so far in fact I'm gonna select

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
painting so far in fact I'm gonna select
heavy<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.860> jump<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.460> see

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
heavy I can jump in here you can see

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.160 
heavy I can jump in here you can see
obviously<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.600> does<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
obviously what it does and this is

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.499 
obviously what it does and this is
typically<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:16.860> you'd<00:01:17.100> work<00:01:17.430> anyway<00:01:17.880> when

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
typically how you'd work anyway when

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300 
typically how you'd work anyway when
you're<00:01:18.659> painting<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.380> you'd<00:01:19.560> apply<00:01:19.830> thick

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you're painting is you'd apply thick

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
you're painting is you'd apply thick
brushstrokes<00:01:21.000> say<00:01:21.270> I'll<00:01:21.630> even<00:01:21.840> take<00:01:22.020> course

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
brushstrokes say I'll even take course

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.679 
brushstrokes say I'll even take course
for<00:01:22.650> instance<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.250> start<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> sketch<00:01:24.150> out<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
for instance and start to sketch out the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.170 
for instance and start to sketch out the
figure<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
figure is what you do here this is

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
figure is what you do here this is
really<00:01:27.659> thick<00:01:27.960> though<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.350> let's<00:01:28.680> select

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
really thick though so let's select

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.390 
really thick though so let's select
manual<00:01:29.700> jump<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.720> make<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.680> size<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.250> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
manual jump in make the size of that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.060 
manual jump in make the size of that
brush<00:01:32.729> smaller<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.680> start<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
brush smaller and then I can start to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950 
brush smaller and then I can start to
work<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.329> starting<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.750> apply

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
work on this and I'm starting to apply

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.749 
work on this and I'm starting to apply
some<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.500> detail<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> face<00:01:38.520> but

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
some of this detail to the face but

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.030 
some of this detail to the face but
really<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> want<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
really what I want to do is I want to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.560 
really what I want to do is I want to
dive<00:01:41.220> into<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.729> details<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.299> keep<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.540> mind

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
dive into the details and keep in mind

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.179 
dive into the details and keep in mind
there<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.869> outlines<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.009> again<00:01:44.070> you

there is outlines in here and again you
can<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.820> how<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:44.970> starts<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.479> analyze

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
can really see how it starts to analyze

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.679 
can really see how it starts to analyze
the<00:01:46.500> shape<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.920> my<00:01:47.100> shoulder<00:01:47.790> things<00:01:48.450> like

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the shape of my shoulder things like

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.910 
the shape of my shoulder things like
that<00:01:48.869> actually<00:01:49.170> gives<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.500> nice<00:01:49.710> like

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that actually gives you these nice like

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340 
that actually gives you these nice like
squiggly<00:01:50.490> lines<00:01:50.759> which<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.270> interesting<00:01:51.720> okay

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
squiggly lines which is interesting okay

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.870 
squiggly lines which is interesting okay
but<00:01:52.710> outlining<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.250> photo<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.670> let's<00:01:53.790> get

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
but outlining that photo but let's get

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.510 
but outlining that photo but let's get
into<00:01:54.149> details<00:01:54.540> selecting<00:01:55.470> structured<00:01:56.159> zooms

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
into details selecting structured zooms

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.130 
into details selecting structured zooms
in<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.119> now<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.479> gonna<00:01:57.689> go<00:01:57.869> start

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
in and now I'm just gonna go start

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.090 
in and now I'm just gonna go start
painting<00:01:58.560> around<00:01:59.430> my<00:02:00.390> new<00:02:00.540> dorky<00:02:00.930> glasses<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
painting around my new dorky glasses and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670 
painting around my new dorky glasses and
I<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.329> start<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> outline<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.229> features<00:02:04.649> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
I just start to outline the features of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.459 
I just start to outline the features of
the<00:02:05.280> face<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.509> could<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.079> brush

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the face and you could see that brush

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.249 
the face and you could see that brush
stroke<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.459> doing<00:02:08.879> there<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:10.140> get

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
stroke what it's doing there I can get

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.990 
stroke what it's doing there I can get
into<00:02:10.470> more<00:02:10.590> organic<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.580> see<00:02:11.819> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
into more organic and you can see that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.510 
into more organic and you can see that
it<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.209> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.450> give<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.900> sort<00:02:13.379> of

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
it is going to give you that sort of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.910 
it is going to give you that sort of
mushy<00:02:13.940> look<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.320> always<00:02:15.560> jump<00:02:15.710> into

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
mushy look and you can always jump into

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.710 
mushy look and you can always jump into
manual<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.610> see<00:02:16.640> what's<00:02:17.030> going<00:02:17.240> on<00:02:17.540> because

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
manual to see what's going on because

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.510 
manual to see what's going on because
you<00:02:17.810> can<00:02:17.990> see<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.440> paintbrush<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.190> it's

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
you can see that paintbrush that it's

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.680 
you can see that paintbrush that it's
adding<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.120> typically<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.690> want<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.340> sort<00:02:22.340> of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
adding and typically I want to sort of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.290 
adding and typically I want to sort of
make<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:24.320> size<00:02:24.590> smaller<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.640> increase<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
make the size smaller and increase the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.510 
make the size smaller and increase the
opacity<00:02:26.420> for<00:02:27.230> even<00:02:27.500> more<00:02:27.740> detail<00:02:28.280> because

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
opacity for even more detail because

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.030 
opacity for even more detail because
even<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:28.940> face<00:02:29.210> that's<00:02:29.540> what<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.780> want<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.410> see

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
even for face that's what I want and see

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.220 
even for face that's what I want and see
how<00:02:31.220> that's<00:02:31.430> actually<00:02:32.060> set<00:02:32.330> up<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.690> and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
how that's actually set up like that and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.500 
how that's actually set up like that and
now<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.710> can<00:02:33.980> jump<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.520> in<00:02:34.790> fact<00:02:35.240> I'm<00:02:35.420> gonna

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
now I can jump in in fact I'm gonna

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.160 
now I can jump in in fact I'm gonna
change<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.230> brush<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:37.060> here<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.690> really<00:02:38.960> get

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
change the brush in here to really get

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.890 
change the brush in here to really get
that<00:02:39.320> detail<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.580> know<00:02:40.700> for<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.540> features<00:02:41.870> of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
that detail you know for the features of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.070 
that detail you know for the features of
the<00:02:42.080> face<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.470> lips<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:43.010> mouth<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:44.080> let's

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
the face the lips the mouth and let's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.930 
the face the lips the mouth and let's
actually<00:02:45.230> change<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.890> brushstroke<00:02:46.430> but<00:02:46.910> I

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
actually change that brushstroke but I

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.430 
actually change that brushstroke but I
encourage<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.870> fun<00:02:48.200> with<00:02:48.260> it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
encourage you to just have fun with it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.010 
encourage you to just have fun with it
all<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.640> all<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.790> can<00:02:50.060> zoom<00:02:50.240> in<00:02:50.420> here<00:02:50.570> even<00:02:50.810> more

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
all in all I can zoom in here even more

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.690 
all in all I can zoom in here even more
and<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.320> can<00:02:51.470> see<00:02:51.710> what's<00:02:51.950> happening<00:02:52.490> there

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and you can see what's happening there

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.730 
and you can see what's happening there
that's<00:02:53.270> more<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.630> stippling<00:02:54.140> effect<00:02:54.290> as

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
that's more of a stippling effect as

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.800 
that's more of a stippling effect as
what's<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.010> on<00:02:55.460> but<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.030> have<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.570> ability

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
what's going on but I have that ability

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.900 
what's going on but I have that ability
to<00:02:57.050> change<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.740> brush<00:02:57.980> stroke<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.430> analyzes

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
to change that brush stroke it analyzes

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.510 
to change that brush stroke it analyzes
the<00:02:59.240> photo<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.590> can<00:03:00.710> always<00:03:00.830> switch<00:03:01.370> it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
the photo and you can always switch it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.210 
the photo and you can always switch it
up<00:03:01.640> at<00:03:01.820> any<00:03:02.000> time<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:03.230> let's<00:03:03.590> make<00:03:03.770> it<00:03:03.800> even

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
up at any time and let's make it even

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.850 
up at any time and let's make it even
smaller<00:03:04.780> because<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.900> think<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.380> really<00:03:06.620> is

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
smaller because I think this really is

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.460 
smaller because I think this really is
the<00:03:07.040> brush<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.880> want<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:08.600> make<00:03:09.110> sure<00:03:09.290> that

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
the brush that I want and make sure that

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.300 
the brush that I want and make sure that
opacity<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.370> at<00:03:10.610> 100%<00:03:11.830> okay<00:03:12.830> so<00:03:12.890> that's<00:03:13.160> what

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
opacity is at 100% okay so that's what

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.100 
opacity is at 100% okay so that's what
I'm<00:03:13.430> getting<00:03:13.790> all<00:03:14.300> in<00:03:14.540> all<00:03:14.660> I'd<00:03:14.810> say<00:03:14.840> that

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
I'm getting all in all I'd say that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.670 
I'm getting all in all I'd say that
looks<00:03:15.140> pretty<00:03:15.620> good<00:03:15.740> and<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.900> can<00:03:18.080> continue<00:03:18.470> to

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
looks pretty good and I can continue to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.530 
looks pretty good and I can continue to
work<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:19.400> face<00:03:19.610> or<00:03:19.820> on<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.209> different

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
work on this face or on the different

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.380 
work on this face or on the different
details<00:03:20.959> as<00:03:21.230> you'd<00:03:21.500> expect<00:03:22.030> clear<00:03:23.030> down<00:03:23.180> in

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
details as you'd expect clear down in

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.740 
details as you'd expect clear down in
here<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.770> get<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.190> idea<00:03:25.700> around<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.450> ear

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
here you get the idea around the ear

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.470 
here you get the idea around the ear
creating<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.620> brush<00:03:28.430> stroke<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.450> that

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
creating that brush stroke and that

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.480 
creating that brush stroke and that
looks<00:03:29.840> pretty<00:03:30.020> darn<00:03:30.260> good<00:03:30.410> now<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:30.950> can<00:03:31.100> switch

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
looks pretty darn good now I can switch

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.430 
looks pretty darn good now I can switch
to<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:31.880> last<00:03:32.209> brush<00:03:32.600> here<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.020> fact<00:03:33.200> if<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.410> go

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
to this last brush here in fact if I go

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.590 
to this last brush here in fact if I go
into<00:03:33.620> presets<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.280> can<00:03:34.670> select<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.030> lines<00:03:35.270> now

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
into presets I can select the lines now

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.699 
into presets I can select the lines now
check<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:35.870> out<00:03:35.990> this<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.200> actually<00:03:36.560> where

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
check this out this is actually where

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.430 
check this out this is actually where
you<00:03:36.740> do<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.220> outlining<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:39.020> doesn't

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
you do the outlining so this doesn't

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.810 
you do the outlining so this doesn't
analyze<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.190> shape<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.640> photo

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
analyze the shape of the photo

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.820 
analyze the shape of the photo
underneath<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.690> actually<00:03:42.050> applies<00:03:42.380> that

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
underneath it actually applies that

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.800 
underneath it actually applies that
brushstroke<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:43.850> that's<00:03:44.030> might<00:03:44.420> be<00:03:44.570> what<00:03:44.780> I

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
brushstroke so that's might be what I

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.540 
brushstroke so that's might be what I
want<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.230> do<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.500> have<00:03:45.620> full<00:03:45.860> control<00:03:46.220> to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
want to do so I have full control to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.220 
want to do so I have full control to
jump<00:03:47.420> in<00:03:47.570> and<00:03:47.780> paint<00:03:48.050> like<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.500> would<00:03:48.940> normally

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
jump in and paint like I would normally

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.530 
jump in and paint like I would normally

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
this works it's going to be better than

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.160 
this works it's going to be better than
any<00:03:58.730> other<00:03:58.850> painting<00:03:59.480> app<00:03:59.600> out<00:03:59.780> there<00:03:59.990> because

it's actually analyzing the data of the
photo<00:04:03.050> not<00:04:03.740> just<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.190> color<00:04:04.370> which<00:04:04.700> is

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850
