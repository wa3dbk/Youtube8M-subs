00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
hi and welcome to sky guy today we're

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.789 
hi and welcome to sky guy today we're
going<00:00:10.299> to<00:00:10.450> keep<00:00:10.600> exploring<00:00:11.019> the<00:00:11.289> planets<00:00:11.650> in

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799 
going to keep exploring the planets in

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.890 
going to keep exploring the planets in
our<00:00:11.860> solar<00:00:11.920> system<00:00:12.360> well<00:00:13.360> okay<00:00:13.599> we're<00:00:13.780> not

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
our solar system well okay we're not

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.720 
our solar system well okay we're not
going<00:00:14.200> to<00:00:14.349> explore<00:00:14.889> them<00:00:15.070> by<00:00:15.190> actually<00:00:15.490> going

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
going to explore them by actually going

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.400 
going to explore them by actually going
there<00:00:16.059> even<00:00:16.299> though<00:00:16.419> that<00:00:16.900> would<00:00:17.080> be<00:00:17.200> really

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
there even though that would be really

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.870 
there even though that would be really
cool<00:00:17.590> but<00:00:18.070> we're<00:00:18.189> going<00:00:18.310> to<00:00:18.490> explore<00:00:18.820> what

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
cool but we're going to explore what

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.480 
cool but we're going to explore what
scientists<00:00:19.450> know<00:00:19.689> about<00:00:19.900> them<00:00:20.110> so<00:00:20.439> far<00:00:20.740> on<00:00:21.369> the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
scientists know about them so far on the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.729 
scientists know about them so far on the
previous<00:00:21.820> episode<00:00:21.970> I<00:00:22.300> asked<00:00:22.750> which<00:00:23.230> planet<00:00:23.649> in

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:23.739 
previous episode I asked which planet in

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.979 
previous episode I asked which planet in
the<00:00:23.829> solar<00:00:24.070> system<00:00:24.250> is<00:00:24.610> the<00:00:24.669> hottest<00:00:24.970> did<00:00:25.899> you

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
the solar system is the hottest did you

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:26.780 
the solar system is the hottest did you
figure<00:00:26.140> that<00:00:26.259> out

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
figure that out

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.280 
figure that out
mercury<00:00:27.790> is<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:27.939> planet<00:00:28.090> closest<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.899> our<00:00:29.079> Sun

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
mercury is the planet closest to our Sun

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.229 
mercury is the planet closest to our Sun
so<00:00:29.710> you<00:00:29.800> might<00:00:29.980> guess<00:00:30.219> that<00:00:30.430> mercury<00:00:30.669> would<00:00:31.119> be

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
so you might guess that mercury would be

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.209 
so you might guess that mercury would be
the<00:00:31.329> hottest<00:00:31.509> planet<00:00:31.809> I<00:00:32.140> mean<00:00:32.619> when<00:00:33.100> you're

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
the hottest planet I mean when you're

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.619 
the hottest planet I mean when you're
very<00:00:33.399> close<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.910> flame<00:00:36.270> whoa<00:00:37.270> that's<00:00:37.480> a

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
very close to a flame whoa that's a

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.430 
very close to a flame whoa that's a
little<00:00:37.780> too<00:00:37.930> close<00:00:38.700> thank<00:00:39.700> you<00:00:39.930> okay<00:00:40.930> when

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
little too close thank you okay when

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.290 
little too close thank you okay when
you're<00:00:41.590> very<00:00:41.920> close<00:00:42.130> to<00:00:42.160> a<00:00:42.310> flame<00:00:42.490> the<00:00:43.180> flame

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
you're very close to a flame the flame

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.000 
you're very close to a flame the flame
feels<00:00:43.630> hotter<00:00:43.930> than<00:00:44.320> when<00:00:44.620> you're<00:00:44.740> farther

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
feels hotter than when you're farther

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.880 
feels hotter than when you're farther
away<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:46.270> that's<00:00:46.600> why<00:00:46.750> it<00:00:46.810> might<00:00:47.230> be<00:00:47.290> tempting

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
away so that's why it might be tempting

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.920 
away so that's why it might be tempting
to<00:00:48.490> guess<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.850> mercury<00:00:49.150> is<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.600> hottest

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
to guess that mercury is the hottest

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.400 
to guess that mercury is the hottest
planet<00:00:50.079> but<00:00:50.650> in<00:00:50.739> fact<00:00:50.890> that's<00:00:51.400> not<00:00:51.640> correct

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.990 

actually<00:00:56.410> Venus<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.250> hottest<00:00:57.340> planet<00:00:57.730> in

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
actually Venus is the hottest planet in

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.300 
actually Venus is the hottest planet in
our<00:00:58.090> solar<00:00:58.149> system<00:00:58.710> here's<00:00:59.710> why<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.160> it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
our solar system here's why and it's

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.220 
our solar system here's why and it's
really<00:01:00.670> kind<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.910> strange<00:01:01.120> Venus<00:01:01.810> is<00:01:01.960> hotter

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
really kind of strange Venus is hotter

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.350 
really kind of strange Venus is hotter
even<00:01:02.470> than<00:01:02.829> mercury<00:01:03.010> because<00:01:03.520> Venus<00:01:04.180> is

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
even than mercury because Venus is

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.999 
even than mercury because Venus is
suffering<00:01:04.750> from<00:01:04.960> what<00:01:05.049> is<00:01:05.229> called<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.649> runaway

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
suffering from what is called a runaway

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.880 
suffering from what is called a runaway
greenhouse<00:01:06.549> effect<00:01:07.049> I'm<00:01:08.049> sure<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.409> know<00:01:08.619> what

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
greenhouse effect I'm sure you know what

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.520 
greenhouse effect I'm sure you know what
a<00:01:09.040> greenhouse<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.689> a<00:01:10.749> greenhouse<00:01:11.109> you<00:01:11.350> can

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
a greenhouse is in a greenhouse you can

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.289 
a greenhouse is in a greenhouse you can
grow<00:01:11.679> strawberries<00:01:12.039> in<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.490> winter<00:01:12.819> because

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
grow strawberries in the winter because

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.029 
grow strawberries in the winter because
the<00:01:13.420> greenhouse<00:01:13.869> traps<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.469> heat<00:01:14.499> coming

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
the greenhouse traps the heat coming

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.209 
the greenhouse traps the heat coming
from<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.310> Sun<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:15.909> doesn't<00:01:16.359> let<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.509> escape

from the Sun and doesn't let it escape
the<00:01:18.219> atmosphere<00:01:18.670> of<00:01:18.759> Venus<00:01:18.789> acts<00:01:19.299> like<00:01:19.569> a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
the atmosphere of Venus acts like a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.050 
the atmosphere of Venus acts like a
greenhouse<00:01:20.020> -<00:01:20.289> it's<00:01:20.889> very<00:01:21.249> very<00:01:21.759> thick<00:01:22.030> and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
greenhouse - it's very very thick and

effect<00:01:56.139> because<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:57.069> basically<00:01:57.520> just

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
effect because it's basically just

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.370 
effect because it's basically just
completely<00:01:58.149> out<00:01:58.389> of<00:01:58.420> control<00:01:58.840> there's

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
completely out of control there's

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.109 
completely out of control there's
nothing<00:01:59.829> to<00:01:59.920> turn<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.159> off<00:02:00.279> and<00:02:00.549> as<00:02:00.729> long<00:02:00.939> as

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
nothing to turn it off and as long as

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.029 
nothing to turn it off and as long as
the<00:02:01.240> Sun<00:02:01.389> keeps<00:02:01.719> shining<00:02:01.779> there's<00:02:02.469> nothing<00:02:02.919> to

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
the Sun keeps shining there's nothing to

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.099 
the Sun keeps shining there's nothing to
cool<00:02:03.249> the<00:02:03.399> planet<00:02:03.549> down<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.659> can<00:02:04.810> think<00:02:04.990> of

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
cool the planet down you can think of

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.349 
cool the planet down you can think of
Venus<00:02:05.380> as<00:02:05.529> the<00:02:05.919> biggest<00:02:06.279> oven<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:07.029> the<00:02:07.179> solar

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
Venus as the biggest oven in the solar

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.839 
Venus as the biggest oven in the solar
system<00:02:07.539> so<00:02:08.530> that's<00:02:08.679> what's<00:02:08.950> hot<00:02:09.340> about<00:02:09.369> Venus

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
system so that's what's hot about Venus

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.760 
system so that's what's hot about Venus
but<00:02:10.090> there<00:02:10.420> are<00:02:10.569> some<00:02:10.810> other<00:02:11.349> things<00:02:11.650> about

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
but there are some other things about

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.039 
but there are some other things about
Venus<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.310> are<00:02:12.400> pretty<00:02:12.730> cool<00:02:12.910> venus<00:02:13.900> is

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
Venus that are pretty cool venus is

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.509 
Venus that are pretty cool venus is
sometimes<00:02:14.349> called<00:02:14.560> Earth's<00:02:14.860> sister<00:02:15.489> planet

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
sometimes called Earth's sister planet

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.520 
sometimes called Earth's sister planet
because<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.510> about<00:02:16.689> the<00:02:16.810> same<00:02:16.989> size<00:02:17.230> and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
because it's about the same size and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.050 
because it's about the same size and
density<00:02:17.709> as<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.250> earth<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:18.909> also

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
density as the earth and it's also

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.800 
density as the earth and it's also
pretty

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
pretty

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.080 
pretty
the<00:02:20.050> same<00:02:20.230> distance<00:02:20.560> from<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.160> Sun<00:02:21.340> well

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
the same distance from the Sun well

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.640 
the same distance from the Sun well
pretty<00:02:22.420> close<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:23.110> about<00:02:23.170> how<00:02:23.380> big

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
pretty close if you think about how big

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.699 
pretty close if you think about how big
our<00:02:23.860> solar<00:02:24.069> system<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.810> even<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.200> Venus

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
our solar system is but even so Venus

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.800 
our solar system is but even so Venus
and<00:02:27.040> Earth<00:02:27.160> aren't<00:02:27.520> very<00:02:27.910> different<00:02:28.330> earth

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
and Earth aren't very different earth

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.330 
has oceans Venus doesn't Venus is
completely<00:02:32.020> covered<00:02:32.319> in<00:02:32.380> clouds<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.950> sulfuric

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340

acid birth has clouds of water ice most

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.479 
acid birth has clouds of water ice most
importantly<00:02:37.600> Earth<00:02:38.170> has<00:02:38.410> life<00:02:38.590> that's<00:02:39.130> us

importantly Earth has life that's us
Venus<00:02:40.239> doesn't<00:02:40.660> or<00:02:40.810> at<00:02:40.870> least<00:02:40.989> scientists

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
Venus doesn't or at least scientists

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.770 
Venus doesn't or at least scientists
think<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.010> would<00:02:42.130> be<00:02:42.250> pretty<00:02:42.459> much<00:02:42.580> impossible

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
think it would be pretty much impossible

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.240 
think it would be pretty much impossible
for<00:02:43.780> life<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.170> exist<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.500> Venus<00:02:44.860> since<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.160> is

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
for life to exist on Venus since it is

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.150 
for life to exist on Venus since it is
so<00:02:45.580> hot<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.000> there's<00:02:46.239> no<00:02:46.390> water<00:02:46.830> now<00:02:47.830> you've

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
so hot and there's no water now you've

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.410 
so hot and there's no water now you've
probably<00:02:48.459> heard<00:02:48.819> that<00:02:49.000> Earth<00:02:49.180> has<00:02:49.209> a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
probably heard that Earth has a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.850 
probably heard that Earth has a
greenhouse<00:02:49.690> effect<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.350> that's

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
greenhouse effect and that's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.110 
greenhouse effect and that's
contributing<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.610> pretty<00:02:51.940> big

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
contributing to a pretty big

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.580 
contributing to a pretty big
environmental<00:02:52.660> problem<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.260> our<00:02:53.380> planet

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
environmental problem on our planet

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.220

called global climate change basically

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.570 
called global climate change basically
the<00:02:56.350> average<00:02:56.500> temperature<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.340> our

atmosphere is gradually increasing most

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.800 
atmosphere is gradually increasing most
scientists<00:03:00.610> agree<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.360> because

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
scientists agree that this is because

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.570 
scientists agree that this is because
there's<00:03:02.260> too<00:03:02.440> much<00:03:02.530> carbon<00:03:02.890> dioxide<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.489> our

there's too much carbon dioxide in our

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
atmosphere these days on earth a lot of

atmosphere these days on earth a lot of
carbon<00:03:06.160> dioxide<00:03:06.190> comes<00:03:06.880> from<00:03:07.090> burning<00:03:07.540> things

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
carbon dioxide comes from burning things

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.110 
carbon dioxide comes from burning things
like<00:03:08.019> coal<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.350> power<00:03:08.830> plants<00:03:09.250> or<00:03:09.580> gasoline

like coal and power plants or gasoline

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.960 
like coal and power plants or gasoline
in<00:03:10.480> car<00:03:10.720> engines<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.800> if<00:03:11.920> Earth<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.310> Venus<00:03:12.370> are

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
in car engines so if Earth and Venus are

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.550 
in car engines so if Earth and Venus are
kind<00:03:13.330> of<00:03:13.420> similar<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.959> if<00:03:14.200> Earth<00:03:14.319> has<00:03:14.530> a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
planet our home someday turn into a hot
