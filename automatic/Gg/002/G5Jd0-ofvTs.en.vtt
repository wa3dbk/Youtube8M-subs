sandwich<00:00:26.510> it<00:00:27.500> has<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:27.710> very<00:00:28.070> weird<00:00:28.400> smell<00:00:29.950> very

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
sandwich it has a very weird smell very

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.250 
sandwich it has a very weird smell very
weird<00:00:31.340> smell<00:00:31.610> so<00:00:31.940> anyway<00:00:32.240> it<00:00:32.630> does<00:00:32.810> really<00:00:33.110> you

weird smell so anyway it does really you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.020 
weird smell so anyway it does really you
think<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:33.590> would<00:00:33.710> smell<00:00:34.100> more<00:00:34.340> like<00:00:34.490> steak<00:00:34.820> but

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
think it would smell more like steak but

think it would smell more like steak but
it's<00:00:35.180> got<00:00:35.300> an<00:00:35.420> odd<00:00:35.680> very<00:00:36.680> odd<00:00:36.800> smell<00:00:37.490> a<00:00:39.700> lot
