00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
quite a while hoping that a fish would

take my shrimp I knew they were here and
the<00:02:45.530> only<00:02:45.650> way<00:02:45.830> out<00:02:46.040> was<00:02:46.220> past<00:02:46.550> me<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.070> sat

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the only way out was past me so I sat

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.940 
the only way out was past me so I sat
here<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.150> waited

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.740 

and<00:02:57.400> they<00:02:57.490> offered<00:02:57.880> up<00:02:58.000> some<00:02:58.180> live<00:02:58.420> shrimp

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.450 

and<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.380> waited<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:06.270> waited<00:03:06.300> some<00:03:06.870> more<00:03:07.460> and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
and I waited and I waited some more and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.750 
and I waited and I waited some more and
I<00:03:08.550> didn't<00:03:08.880> see<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> fish<00:03:09.240> come<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.570> passed<00:03:09.780> me

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
I didn't see the fish come and passed me

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.360 
I didn't see the fish come and passed me
so<00:03:11.760> slowly<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.330> surely<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.830> inched<00:03:13.830> my<00:03:14.010> way<00:03:14.160> up

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
so slowly but surely I inched my way up

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.990 
so slowly but surely I inched my way up
towards<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.790> hole<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.300> trees<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:17.000> thought

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
towards that hole in the trees I thought

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.690 
towards that hole in the trees I thought
for<00:03:18.180> sure<00:03:18.210> they'd<00:03:18.600> come<00:03:18.810> shooting<00:03:19.320> out<00:03:19.700> you

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
for sure they'd come shooting out you

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.950 
for sure they'd come shooting out you
know<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:20.970> I'd<00:03:21.060> find<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.450> there<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> whole

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
know and I'd find that there the whole

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.410 
know and I'd find that there the whole
time<00:03:22.200> they<00:03:22.410> had<00:03:22.530> been<00:03:22.710> sitting<00:03:22.890> there<00:03:23.420> but

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
time they had been sitting there but

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.560 
time they had been sitting there but
what<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.600> found<00:03:24.870> instead<00:03:25.170> was<00:03:26.100> something<00:03:26.570> way

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
what I found instead was something way

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:48.300 
what I found instead was something way
different

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.559 

this<00:03:49.310> little<00:03:49.549> hole<00:03:49.760> in<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.090> trees<00:03:50.299> was

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
this little hole in the trees was

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.490 
this little hole in the trees was
absolutely<00:03:51.349> fantastic<00:03:52.599> my<00:03:53.599> mind<00:03:53.870> raced<00:03:54.260> with

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
absolutely fantastic my mind raced with

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.069 
absolutely fantastic my mind raced with
the<00:03:54.650> idea<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.159> pulling<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.730> two-foot<00:03:56.269> red<00:03:56.810> fish

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
the idea of pulling a two-foot red fish

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.069 
the idea of pulling a two-foot red fish
out<00:03:57.319> from<00:03:57.590> from<00:03:58.519> underneath<00:03:58.819> this<00:03:59.209> mangrove

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
out from from underneath this mangrove

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:11.710 
out from from underneath this mangrove
canopy

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:24.090 

it<00:04:12.720> really<00:04:12.930> was<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.200> magical<00:04:13.740> place

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.510 

Oh

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.540 

I<00:04:44.640> found<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.300> snoop<00:04:45.570> Factory

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
I found a snoop Factory

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.160 
I found a snoop Factory
this<00:04:48.090> one's<00:04:48.300> gonna<00:04:48.420> grow<00:04:48.660> up<00:04:48.690> with<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.930> shape

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170

but<00:04:57.450> he'll<00:04:57.600> grow<00:04:57.720> up<00:05:05.000> well<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.030> wasn't<00:05:06.330> the

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
but he'll grow up well that wasn't the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:14.900 
but he'll grow up well that wasn't the
redfish<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:07.020> was<00:05:07.170> after<00:05:13.370> but<00:05:14.370> this<00:05:14.550> certainly

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
redfish I was after but this certainly

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.280 
redfish I was after but this certainly
was<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.210> very<00:05:15.510> cool<00:05:15.720> spot<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:19.050> further

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
was a very cool spot and the further

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.620 
was a very cool spot and the further
back<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.560> went<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.610> more<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:20.880> realized<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.480> it

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
back I went the more I realized that it

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.270 
back I went the more I realized that it
didn't<00:05:21.870> end<00:05:24.260> this<00:05:25.260> hole<00:05:25.500> in<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.740> tree<00:05:25.980> was

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
didn't end this hole in the tree was

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:37.780 
didn't end this hole in the tree was
very<00:05:27.000> very<00:05:27.360> deep

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.919 

it<00:05:38.790> actually<00:05:39.150> opened<00:05:39.420> up<00:05:39.540> at<00:05:39.780> some<00:05:39.990> point

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:43.929 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:47.619 

we're<00:05:44.929> still<00:05:45.169> very<00:05:45.409> shallow<00:05:46.360> but<00:05:47.360> there<00:05:47.539> were

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:47.629 
we're still very shallow but there were

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.449 
we're still very shallow but there were
deep<00:05:47.839> pockets<00:05:48.259> here<00:05:48.439> and<00:05:48.589> there

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:51.459 

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:53.619 

unfortunately<00:05:52.459> the<00:05:52.669> tide<00:05:52.879> was<00:05:53.089> going<00:05:53.119> out<00:05:53.449> and

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:53.629 
unfortunately the tide was going out and

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:55.809 
unfortunately the tide was going out and
I<00:05:53.659> didn't<00:05:53.899> really<00:05:54.020> have<00:05:54.199> time<00:05:54.439> to<00:05:54.639> check<00:05:55.639> this

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
I didn't really have time to check this

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.709 
I didn't really have time to check this
area<00:05:56.059> out<00:05:56.240> thoroughly<00:05:58.029> so<00:05:59.029> I<00:05:59.059> made<00:05:59.330> my<00:05:59.539> way

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
area out thoroughly so I made my way

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:06.829 
area out thoroughly so I made my way
back<00:05:59.749> the<00:06:00.199> way<00:06:00.319> I<00:06:00.349> had<00:06:00.619> come

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.179 

and<00:06:07.839> I<00:06:07.929> made<00:06:08.079> a<00:06:08.109> promise<00:06:08.319> to<00:06:08.499> myself<00:06:08.709> that<00:06:08.979> I'd

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
and I made a promise to myself that I'd

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:24.100 
and I made a promise to myself that I'd
come<00:06:09.399> back<00:06:09.549> to<00:06:09.729> this<00:06:09.849> spot<00:06:10.059> someday

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.270 

all<00:06:25.110> in<00:06:25.320> all<00:06:25.440> it<00:06:25.590> was<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.710> pretty<00:06:25.800> good<00:06:26.100> day

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
all in all it was a pretty good day

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.480 
all in all it was a pretty good day
fishing<00:06:27.710> maybe<00:06:28.710> not<00:06:28.950> the<00:06:29.070> best<00:06:29.100> day<00:06:29.460> of

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
fishing maybe not the best day of

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.350 
fishing maybe not the best day of
catching<00:06:31.340> but<00:06:32.340> perhaps<00:06:32.640> somebody<00:06:32.970> out<00:06:33.120> there

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
catching but perhaps somebody out there

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.890 
catching but perhaps somebody out there
can<00:06:34.100> try<00:06:35.100> this<00:06:35.160> for<00:06:35.370> themselves<00:06:35.660> see<00:06:36.660> if<00:06:36.690> they

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
can try this for themselves see if they

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.420 
can try this for themselves see if they
can<00:06:37.050> pull<00:06:37.230> a<00:06:37.260> big<00:06:37.500> redfish<00:06:37.860> out<00:06:38.100> from<00:06:38.310> behind

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
can pull a big redfish out from behind

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.690 
can pull a big redfish out from behind
the<00:06:38.700> trees<00:06:38.910> or<00:06:39.180> a<00:06:39.240> big<00:06:39.420> snook<00:06:40.340> I'd<00:06:41.340> say<00:06:41.490> give<00:06:41.670> it

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700 
the trees or a big snook I'd say give it

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.760 
the trees or a big snook I'd say give it
a<00:06:41.820> shot<00:06:42.030> look<00:06:42.780> for<00:06:42.930> those<00:06:43.020> shallow<00:06:43.290> areas

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
a shot look for those shallow areas

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.030 
a shot look for those shallow areas
where<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.100> water<00:06:44.250> is<00:06:44.490> warm<00:06:45.680> you<00:06:46.680> might<00:06:46.860> just

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
where the water is warm you might just

00:06:47.040 --> 00:07:03.330 
where the water is warm you might just
catch<00:06:47.220> a<00:06:47.370> fish

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.400
