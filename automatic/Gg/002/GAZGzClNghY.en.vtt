00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:02.320 
okay so i just got the entire character

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.340 
okay so i just got the entire character

from<00:00:08.440> scratch<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:10.020> I<00:00:11.020> just<00:00:11.340> just<00:00:12.340> recently

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
from scratch and I just just recently

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.100 
from scratch and I just just recently
had<00:00:12.790> to<00:00:12.850> submit<00:00:13.000> a<00:00:13.090> post<00:00:13.330> that<00:00:13.720> I<00:00:15.780> finished<00:00:16.780> I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
had to submit a post that I finished I

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.160 
had to submit a post that I finished I
got<00:00:18.100> a<00:00:18.160> working<00:00:18.370> character<00:00:18.790> render<00:00:19.060> and<00:00:19.990> I

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
got a working character render and I

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.120 
got a working character render and I
posted<00:00:20.380> some<00:00:20.710> screenshots<00:00:21.010> and<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.800> is<00:00:23.920> just

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
posted some screenshots and this is just

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.420 
posted some screenshots and this is just
to<00:00:24.340> validate<00:00:24.490> those<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:28.289> fact<00:00:29.289> this<00:00:29.920> supports

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
to validate those in fact this supports

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.970 
to validate those in fact this supports
every<00:00:31.060> character<00:00:31.510> model<00:00:31.960> in<00:00:32.169> every<00:00:32.649> character

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
every character model in every character

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.939 
every character model in every character
animation<00:00:33.460> in<00:00:33.699> the<00:00:34.030> game<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:37.949> the

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
animation in the game so to the

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.969 
animation in the game so to the
thousands<00:00:39.489> of<00:00:39.640> source<00:00:39.969> code<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.739> run<00:00:44.889> the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
thousands of source code and we run the

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:50.430 
thousands of source code and we run the
compiled<00:00:45.550> binary<00:00:45.760> here<00:00:48.960> wait<00:00:49.960> let<00:00:50.199> me<00:00:50.260> pick

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
compiled binary here wait let me pick

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.559 
compiled binary here wait let me pick
out<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:50.620> better<00:00:50.829> animation<00:00:54.359> this<00:00:55.359> is<00:00:55.539> a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
out a better animation this is a

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.410 
out a better animation this is a
swimming<00:00:55.989> in<00:00:56.079> emission<00:00:56.409> so<00:00:56.649> limit<00:00:56.949> pick<00:00:57.699> more

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
swimming in emission so limit pick more

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.910 
swimming in emission so limit pick more
reasonable<00:00:58.899> one<00:00:59.079> like<00:00:59.589> phone<00:00:59.920> done<00:01:00.190> in<00:01:04.920> I'm

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
reasonable one like phone done in I'm

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.440 
reasonable one like phone done in I'm
going<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.130> run<00:01:06.219> render<00:01:06.549> exe<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.850> I'm<00:01:10.240> going<00:01:10.390> to

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
going to run render exe and I'm going to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.770 
going to run render exe and I'm going to
show<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.719> entire<00:01:11.049> screen<00:01:14.909> okay

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.530 

and<00:01:19.800> I<00:01:20.800> can<00:01:21.070> move<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:21.880> know<00:01:21.970> move<00:01:22.210> around<00:01:22.390> and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
and I can move you know move around and

and I can move you know move around and
such<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.050> I<00:01:23.560> press<00:01:23.770> end<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.370> animate<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:28.150> now

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
such and I press end to animate and now

such and I press end to animate and now
this<00:01:29.020> is<00:01:29.170> running<00:01:29.410> at<00:01:29.500> 60<00:01:29.890> frames<00:01:29.920> per<00:01:30.250> second

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
this is running at 60 frames per second

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.450 
this is running at 60 frames per second
the<00:01:31.690> animation<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.260> 30<00:01:32.620> frames<00:01:32.950> per<00:01:33.040> second

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
the animation is 30 frames per second

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.020 
the animation is 30 frames per second
interpolating<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.520> translation

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
interpolating all the translation

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.670 
interpolating all the translation
rotation<00:01:37.210> data<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:40.140> yeah<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.170> can<00:01:41.470> do<00:01:41.560> this

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
rotation data and yeah I can do this

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.990 
rotation data and yeah I can do this
full<00:01:41.890> screen<00:01:42.930> completely<00:01:43.930> full<00:01:44.170> screen<00:01:44.470> 1080p

that's a good a good default one just to
pick<00:03:07.900> out<00:03:08.080> phone<00:03:08.620> died<00:03:08.860> him

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.730 

okay<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.250> also<00:03:33.370> another<00:03:34.240> thing<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:35.470> green

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
okay and also another thing the green

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.030 
okay and also another thing the green
dots<00:03:35.950> are<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.610> regular<00:03:37.540> bones<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.470> red<00:03:38.710> dot

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
dots are the regular bones the red dot

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:51.990 
dots are the regular bones the red dot
in<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.400> center<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:50.470> red<00:03:50.680> dot<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.340> root<00:03:51.730> bone

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
in the center the red dot is root bone

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.520 
in the center the red dot is root bone
which<00:03:52.870> acts<00:03:53.350> as<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:53.860> center<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.490> gravity<00:03:55.530> and

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
which acts as a center of gravity and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
which acts as a center of gravity and
the<00:03:56.560> yellow<00:03:57.040> dot<00:03:57.340> gives<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.180> head<00:03:58.330> bone<00:03:59.550> so

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
the yellow dot gives the head bone so

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:13.460 
the yellow dot gives the head bone so
again<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.850> phone<00:04:01.350> animation<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.730> two<00:04:12.790> min

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
again the phone animation it's a two min

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.240 
again the phone animation it's a two min
s<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.830> zoom<00:04:15.040> out<00:04:16.200> Z<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.350> X<00:04:17.500> rotate<00:04:18.040> like<00:04:18.190> a

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
s to zoom out Z and X rotate like a

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:29.629 
s to zoom out Z and X rotate like a
clock<00:04:19.620> arrow<00:04:20.620> keys<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:24.520> end<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.419> animate

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.390 

this<00:04:30.539> has<00:04:30.719> proper<00:04:31.199> time<00:04:31.379> synchronization<00:04:32.360> so

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
this has proper time synchronization so

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.709 
this has proper time synchronization so
nothing<00:04:35.400> will<00:04:35.520> over<00:04:35.729> screw<00:04:35.969> up<00:04:36.120> if<00:04:36.270> like<00:04:36.569> your

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
nothing will over screw up if like your

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.800 
nothing will over screw up if like your
system<00:04:37.080> is<00:04:37.199> lagging<00:04:37.560> or<00:04:37.740> anything<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:39.060> this

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810
