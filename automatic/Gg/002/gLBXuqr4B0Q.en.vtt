I'm not going to pour it in this plastic

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.150 
I'm not going to pour it in this plastic
cup<00:03:50.420> because<00:03:50.630> at<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.020> end<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.770> this<00:03:51.890> session

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
cup because at the end of this session

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.670 
cup because at the end of this session
is<00:03:52.490> going<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.880> be<00:03:53.030> all<00:03:53.510> over<00:03:53.570> this<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.560> an

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
is going to be all over this is an

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.040 
is going to be all over this is an
engine<00:03:54.950> mount<00:03:55.130> we<00:03:55.310> can<00:03:55.430> see<00:03:55.610> is<00:03:55.730> rubber<00:03:56.050> it's

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
engine mount we can see is rubber it's

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.650 
engine mount we can see is rubber it's
an<00:03:57.260> insulator<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.820> have<00:03:59.030> several<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.570> these

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
an insulator you have several of these

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.080 
an insulator you have several of these
on<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.020> vehicle<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:01.040> engine<00:04:01.400> sits<00:04:01.670> think<00:04:02.000> of

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
on the vehicle the engine sits think of

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.480 
on the vehicle the engine sits think of
a<00:04:02.150> rectangle<00:04:02.750> engine<00:04:03.560> engine<00:04:04.160> and

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
a rectangle engine engine and

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.310 
a rectangle engine engine and
transmission<00:04:04.790> rectangle<00:04:05.600> each<00:04:05.720> corner<00:04:06.110> that

rectangle has one of these guys and the

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.810 
rectangle has one of these guys and the
engine<00:04:09.500> produces<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> lot<00:04:10.130> of<00:04:10.160> harmonics

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
engine produces a lot of harmonics

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.330 
engine produces a lot of harmonics
that's<00:04:11.120> fancy<00:04:11.420> for<00:04:11.720> noise<00:04:11.870> what<00:04:12.830> happens<00:04:13.190> is

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
that's fancy for noise what happens is

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.190 
that's fancy for noise what happens is
this<00:04:13.520> dampens<00:04:14.090> those<00:04:14.330> harmonics<00:04:14.690> those

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
this dampens those harmonics those

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.380 
this dampens those harmonics those
noises<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.980> overtime<00:04:16.790> there's<00:04:17.060> two<00:04:17.209> things

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
noises in overtime there's two things

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.509 
noises in overtime there's two things
that<00:04:17.540> will<00:04:17.750> happen<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.260> engine<00:04:18.620> mounts<00:04:18.950> they

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
that will happen to engine mounts they

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.759 
that will happen to engine mounts they
get<00:04:19.700> hard<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.120> brittle<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.480> rubber<00:04:20.769> what

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
get hard and brittle the rubber what

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.680 
get hard and brittle the rubber what
happens<00:04:21.980> to<00:04:22.040> rubber<00:04:22.160> when<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.490> heats<00:04:22.640> up<00:04:22.880> get

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
happens to rubber when it heats up get

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.450 
happens to rubber when it heats up get
hard<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:23.990> brittle<00:04:24.080> over<00:04:24.410> time<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:25.340> other

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
hard and brittle over time the other

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.490 
hard and brittle over time the other
thing<00:04:25.730> is<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:25.970> separates<00:04:26.450> look<00:04:27.290> at<00:04:27.410> that

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
thing is it separates look at that

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.310 
thing is it separates look at that
that's<00:04:27.680> supposed<00:04:27.920> to<00:04:28.010> be<00:04:28.040> one<00:04:28.250> piece

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
that's supposed to be one piece

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
that's supposed to be one piece
typically<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.440> squeaks<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.920> because<00:04:31.220> the

typically the squeaks is because the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.040 
typically the squeaks is because the
