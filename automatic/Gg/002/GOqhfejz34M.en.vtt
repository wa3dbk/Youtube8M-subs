journey no it's more than 150 years old

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
journey no it's more than 150 years old
and<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.829> a<00:01:22.890> pretty<00:01:23.070> large<00:01:23.250> example<00:01:23.579> of<00:01:23.820> its

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and it's a pretty large example of its

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.300 
and it's a pretty large example of its
species<00:01:24.320> but<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.409> has<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:25.740> dead<00:01:25.950> lateral

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
species but it has some dead lateral

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.529 
species but it has some dead lateral
branches<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.030> risk<00:01:27.149> of<00:01:27.299> failing

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
branches that are at risk of failing

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.289 
branches that are at risk of failing
it's<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.289> praying<00:01:28.530> them<00:01:28.649> off<00:01:28.740> before<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.189> do

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
it's all praying them off before they do

it's all praying them off before they do
of<00:01:30.299> course<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.689> cut<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:31.049> branches<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.710> need

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
of course to cut these branches I need

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950 
of course to cut these branches I need
to<00:01:32.039> get<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.310> amongst<00:01:32.729> them<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.750> where

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to get up amongst them and that's where

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.529 
to get up amongst them and that's where
this<00:01:34.110> giant<00:01:34.439> slingshot<00:01:34.679> comes<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.490> won't<00:01:36.390> be

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
this giant slingshot comes in I won't be

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.359 
this giant slingshot comes in I won't be
getting<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.080> will<00:01:37.560> use<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> hurl<00:01:38.189> this

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
getting in it will use it to hurl this

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
getting in it will use it to hurl this
throwback<00:01:38.670> over<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.270> fork<00:01:39.600> that's<00:01:39.840> high<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
throwback over a fork that's high up in

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.590 
throwback over a fork that's high up in
the<00:01:40.409> tree<00:01:40.729> then<00:01:41.729> our<00:01:41.880> climbing<00:01:42.299> rope<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the tree then our climbing rope is

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
the tree then our climbing rope is
pulled<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:43.020> through<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.409> fork<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.890> back<00:01:44.039> down

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
pulled up through the fork and back down

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760 
pulled up through the fork and back down
the<00:01:44.429> other<00:01:44.460> side<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> Trevor's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the other side and now the Trevor's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.559 
the other side and now the Trevor's
hooked<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> climbing<00:01:47.700> rope<00:01:47.820> he's

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
hooked up to the climbing rope he's

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.059 
hooked up to the climbing rope he's
gonna<00:01:48.780> start<00:01:48.959> making<00:01:49.259> his<00:01:49.380> way<00:01:49.530> into<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> tree

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
gonna start making his way into the tree

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.649 
gonna start making his way into the tree
while<00:01:50.429> I<00:01:50.490> stay<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> ground<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.509> make

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
while I stay here on the ground and make

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.699 
while I stay here on the ground and make
sure<00:01:51.780> he's<00:01:51.899> safe<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:55.049> two-two-one<00:01:55.350> rope

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
sure he's safe in the two-two-one rope

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.010 
sure he's safe in the two-two-one rope
system<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.369> use<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.179> branch<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> Rope

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
system we use the branch that the Rope

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.320 
system we use the branch that the Rope
is<00:01:58.170> looped<00:01:58.409> over<00:01:58.530> acts<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> pulley<00:01:59.490> this

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
is looped over acts like the pulley this

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.059

well<00:03:13.770> can<00:03:14.770> fish<00:03:15.130> climb<00:03:15.880> well<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> hunt<00:03:16.840> got

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
well can fish climb well the hunt got

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.280 
well can fish climb well the hunt got
way<00:03:17.080> because<00:03:17.350> we're<00:03:17.530> about<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.830> find<00:03:18.130> out
