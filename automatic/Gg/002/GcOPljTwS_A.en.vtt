00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.549
 so to disassemble your candle on 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.580
 your back 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.110
 there in this case a 103 borg it you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.330
 must you equip with a candle key 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.830
 quite simply 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 so on this model you withdraw 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 directly the anti parasites and you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.420
 put you up the candle you the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 so in the beginning you need 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.859
 of the key after you want everything 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.710
 simply hand then you can 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.649
 look at the color of the candle you 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.820
 see there we can see we can see on 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.980
 the video that the candle is really black 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.750
 therefore the mixture is too rich too 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.250
 of gasoline in the engine and not enough 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.219
 of air that we will adjust either by lowering 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.690
 the size of the gic is increasing them 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.699
 the air intake by changing the filter to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.320
 air in this case we will change the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.760
 size of the time gicl there I put you to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.680
 about three models of candles that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.590
 you could find so dugas 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.790
 opus settings is that when you 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 look well below the electrode 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.270
 here a see where it's white then 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.619
 the more this part will be white then 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.700
 your settings will be dry then there 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.590
 beware it's because you risk 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.619
 to adjust your greenhouse and your engine 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 so we 'll have to go back up we'll say your 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:37.229
 sprinklers of a point or two there you have 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:43.649
 a setting said perfect see it is 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.000
 dark brown red not too dark so there 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.950
 it's impeccable to leave you as it is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.079
 and there you have a candle with a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.720
 setting too rich so there you see to 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.329
 him so there are oils and that's 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.659
 completely black and below 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.659
 electrodes 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.899
 to put the candle back is very nice 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.659
 the reverse operation 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:11.560
 you take your candle you life 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:13.500
 it is to place by hand until 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.080
 blocking 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.340
 you end up with the key so really 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.860
 you go slowly 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.200
 and when you see it started at these 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.459
 reactions the joint begins to crash 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.459
 she just turned a quarter turn 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.090
 no more because after you risk to 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.209
 pass the filtering at the level of the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.180
 breech then you put back lenses 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.040
 parasites without you are checking well 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.680
 it's tight you have models 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.910
 where you have the little hood and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.500
 model or it's without a hood to you 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.569
 aim for you davis and that 6 with the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.010
 little cap 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.060
 when you have the hood tight the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.350
 well, we really do not know who was moving 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.950
 you put that parasitic to your 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.950
 candle is reassembled
