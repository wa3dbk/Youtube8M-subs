00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it they are ahead of it because as I

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.020 
it they are ahead of it because as I
just<00:02:08.050> said<00:02:08.440> they<00:02:08.920> because<00:02:09.550> they're<00:02:09.700> swinging

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.010 
just said they because they're swinging
I<00:02:10.090> think<00:02:10.119> they've<00:02:10.420> got<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.630> get<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.810> club<00:02:10.960> back

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.840 
I think they've got to get the club back
around<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.650> front<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.920> them<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.400> get<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> club

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
around in front of them to get the club

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.120 
around in front of them to get the club
back<00:02:12.910> around<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.570> front<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.840> them<00:02:13.960> big<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:15.010> they

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
back around in front of them big so they

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.830 
back around in front of them big so they
can<00:02:15.250> swing<00:02:15.460> your<00:02:15.580> arms<00:02:15.790> towards<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.480> ball<00:02:16.660> at

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
can swing your arms towards the ball at

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.620 
can swing your arms towards the ball at
the<00:02:16.960> end<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.710> MMI<00:02:18.180> hopefully<00:02:19.180> they

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the end and on the MMI hopefully they

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.960 
the end and on the MMI hopefully they
have<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.200> snap<00:02:20.560> their<00:02:20.770> left<00:02:21.010> hip<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.430> many<00:02:21.850> of

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
have to snap their left hip and many of

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.460 
have to snap their left hip and many of
them<00:02:22.090> think<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.990> snapping<00:02:23.260> their

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
them think that that is snapping their

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.500 
them think that that is snapping their
left<00:02:23.620> hip<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:23.890> your<00:02:24.010> leg<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.340> locking<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.390> up

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
left hip in your leg and locking it up

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.510 
left hip in your leg and locking it up
create<00:02:26.230> speed<00:02:26.590> okay

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
create speed okay

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920 
create speed okay
all<00:02:27.850> that's<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.210> very<00:02:28.360> likely<00:02:28.540> create

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
all that's going to very likely create

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.510 
all that's going to very likely create
is<00:02:29.080> knee<00:02:29.500> problems<00:02:29.890> okay<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:32.250> poor<00:02:33.250> shots

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
is knee problems okay so and poor shots

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.450 
is knee problems okay so and poor shots
because<00:02:33.760> there<00:02:34.440> soon<00:02:35.440> as<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.680> turn<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.160> hard

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
because there soon as you turn that hard

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.160 
because there soon as you turn that hard
you're<00:02:36.910> always<00:02:37.120> going<00:02:37.510> forward<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.900> think<00:02:37.930> it's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you're always going forward I think it's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.920 
you're always going forward I think it's
pretty<00:02:38.260> easy<00:02:38.880> line<00:02:39.880> up<00:02:40.120> line<00:02:40.240> up<00:02:40.390> something<00:02:40.870> on

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
pretty easy line up line up something on

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.450 
pretty easy line up line up something on
the<00:02:40.990> background<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.590> my<00:02:41.680> head<00:02:41.890> back<00:02:42.100> there<00:02:42.280> on

the<00:02:42.760> background<00:02:42.970> back<00:02:43.300> there<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.540> watch<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:44.170> i

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
the background back there and watch if i

the background back there and watch if i
justified<00:02:44.830> there's<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.160> big<00:02:45.340> toe<00:02:45.490> here<00:02:45.520> I<00:02:45.670> can

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
justified there's a big toe here I can

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.330 
justified there's a big toe here I can
do<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.420> mean<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.020> think<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:48.070> looking

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
do this I mean I think and just looking

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.830 
do this I mean I think and just looking
at<00:02:48.490> my<00:02:48.580> shadow<00:02:48.850> my<00:02:49.090> shadow<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.390> moving<00:02:49.690> about

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
at my shadow my shadow is moving about

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.830 
at my shadow my shadow is moving about
that<00:02:50.050> much<00:02:50.290> okay<00:02:51.010> minimum<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.210> so<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.630> means

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
that much okay minimum and so that means

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.930 
that much okay minimum and so that means
i'm<00:02:53.050> getting<00:02:53.380> ahead<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.860> ball<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.220> so

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
i'm getting ahead of the ball and so

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.790 
i'm getting ahead of the ball and so
they<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.780> fire<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.170> need<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
they have to fire the need to get the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.290 
they have to fire the need to get the
hips<00:02:57.100> out<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.400> way<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.820> arms<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.150> come

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
hips out of the way so the arms can come

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.060 
hips out of the way so the arms can come
around<00:02:58.450> them<00:02:58.750> okay<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.200> hopefully<00:02:59.560> get<00:02:59.860> down

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
around them okay and hopefully get down

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.470 
around them okay and hopefully get down
somewhere<00:03:00.430> near<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.670> line<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.030> down<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
somewhere near the line and down the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.880 
somewhere near the line and down the
lines<00:03:01.750> with<00:03:01.960> that<00:03:02.110> what<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.230> call<00:03:02.440> leg<00:03:02.650> drag

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
lines with that what I call leg drag

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.450 
lines with that what I call leg drag
whole<00:03:03.070> block<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:04.770> guess<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:05.800> could<00:03:06.130> simply

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
whole block I guess that could simply

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.770 
whole block I guess that could simply
say<00:03:06.490> they're<00:03:06.850> coming<00:03:07.090> over<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.360> top<00:03:07.390> right

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
say they're coming over the top right

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.850 
say they're coming over the top right
because<00:03:07.960> if<00:03:08.080> I'm<00:03:08.230> doing<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.500> from<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:08.740> thing

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
because if I'm doing it from this thing

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.560 
because if I'm doing it from this thing
I'm<00:03:09.070> feeling<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.820> come<00:03:09.970> around<00:03:10.120> see

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
I'm feeling like this to come around see

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.090 
I'm feeling like this to come around see
that<00:03:10.750> well<00:03:11.200> as<00:03:11.290> we're<00:03:11.500> going<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.710> be<00:03:11.830> we're

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
that well as we're going to be we're

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.290 
that well as we're going to be we're
going<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.340> stay<00:03:12.490> put<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.790> little<00:03:12.940> bit<00:03:13.090> longer

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
going to stay put a little bit longer

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.810 
going to stay put a little bit longer
until<00:03:13.510> impact<00:03:14.170> before<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.100> truly<00:03:15.340> fire<00:03:15.640> the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
until impact before I truly fire the

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.060 
until impact before I truly fire the
right<00:03:16.000> knee<00:03:16.180> all<00:03:16.870> right<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.380> started<00:03:17.950> to

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
right knee all right it's it started to

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.670 
right knee all right it's it started to
move<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.310> little<00:03:18.460> bit<00:03:18.580> but<00:03:19.150> at<00:03:19.330> impact<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:20.260> think

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
move a little bit but at impact I think

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.110 
move a little bit but at impact I think
you'll<00:03:20.800> find<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:21.430> my<00:03:21.640> right<00:03:21.850> foot<00:03:22.090> is

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
you'll find that that my right foot is

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.910 
you'll find that that my right foot is
pretty<00:03:22.420> much<00:03:22.570> it's<00:03:23.170> pretty<00:03:23.440> much<00:03:23.560> still<00:03:23.800> on

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
pretty much it's pretty much still on

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.010 
pretty much it's pretty much still on
the<00:03:24.010> ground<00:03:24.190> all<00:03:24.850> right<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.150> might<00:03:25.390> be<00:03:25.570> it

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
the ground all right it might be it

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.800 
the ground all right it might be it
might<00:03:26.050> be<00:03:26.820> starting<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.090> roll<00:03:28.270> over<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
might be starting to roll over to the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.180 
might be starting to roll over to the
inside<00:03:29.230> but<00:03:29.410> it's<00:03:29.560> certainly<00:03:29.740> not<00:03:29.980> going<00:03:30.130> to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
inside but it's certainly not going to

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.310 
inside but it's certainly not going to
be<00:03:30.340> up<00:03:30.490> like<00:03:30.670> up<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.240> years<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.690> much<00:03:31.990> as<00:03:32.170> you

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
be up like up in years this much as you

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.840 
be up like up in years this much as you
see<00:03:32.530> many<00:03:32.740> many<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.370> modern<00:03:33.640> players

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
see many many of the modern players

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.070 
see many many of the modern players
today<00:03:34.060> they<00:03:34.300> are<00:03:34.330> dead<00:03:34.570> or<00:03:34.660> rotational

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
today they are dead or rotational

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.830 
today they are dead or rotational
players<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:35.980> if<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.190> come<00:03:36.400> in<00:03:36.430> here<00:03:36.840> we're

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
players so if I come in here we're

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.750 
players so if I come in here we're
behind<00:03:37.990> them<00:03:38.290> all<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:38.920> if<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.130> fire<00:03:39.370> my<00:03:39.400> right

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
behind them all so if I fire my right

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.880 
behind them all so if I fire my right
knee<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.360> my<00:03:40.510> if<00:03:40.690> my<00:03:41.080> fire<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.350> might<00:03:41.530> my

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.850 
backwards a little bit because when a
movie<00:05:13.120> bump<00:05:13.390> as<00:05:13.540> you<00:05:13.660> said<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.440> bump<00:05:14.680> goes

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
movie bump as you said the bump goes

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.170 
movie bump as you said the bump goes
this<00:05:15.040> way<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.370> creates<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.670> little<00:05:15.850> bit<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:15.970> bow

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
this way it creates a little bit of bow

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.910 
this way it creates a little bit of bow
in<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.450> body<00:05:16.660> which<00:05:17.110> makes<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.530> spine<00:05:17.770> go

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
in the body which makes the spine go

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.410 
in the body which makes the spine go
backwards<00:05:18.370> dr.<00:05:18.670> Armstrong<00:05:18.940> calls<00:05:19.180> at<00:05:19.330> the

backwards dr. Armstrong calls at the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.330 
backwards dr. Armstrong calls at the
secondary<00:05:19.750> spine<00:05:20.080> angle<00:05:20.170> till<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:20.920> goes<00:05:21.070> back

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
secondary spine angle till it goes back

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.800 
secondary spine angle till it goes back
just<00:05:21.580> a<00:05:21.640> little<00:05:21.670> bit<00:05:21.850> which<00:05:22.330> allows<00:05:22.600> the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
just a little bit which allows the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.080 
just a little bit which allows the
club's<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.590> club<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:23.950> get<00:05:24.070> back<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.850> where<00:05:24.970> the

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
club's the club to get back to where the

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.360 
club's the club to get back to where the
left<00:05:25.300> arm<00:05:25.480> shaft<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.680> triangle<00:05:27.100> is<00:05:27.190> all

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
left arm shaft and a triangle is all

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.070 
left arm shaft and a triangle is all
here<00:05:27.550> with<00:05:27.640> the<00:05:27.730> clubface<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.570> shaft<00:05:28.780> pulling

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
here with the clubface the shaft pulling

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.200 
here with the clubface the shaft pulling
basically<00:05:29.440> at<00:05:29.530> this<00:05:29.980> at<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.370> hip<00:05:30.550> center<00:05:31.060> of

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
basically at this at the hip center of

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.790 
basically at this at the hip center of
our<00:05:31.270> body<00:05:31.510> we<00:05:31.960> hit<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.230> ball<00:05:32.380> we<00:05:32.560> swing<00:05:32.770> into

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
our body we hit the ball we swing into

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.880 
our body we hit the ball we swing into
the<00:05:33.070> forward<00:05:33.220> minton<00:05:33.520> up<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.700> tree<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.480> mean

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
the forward minton up to tree and I mean

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.140 
the forward minton up to tree and I mean
impacts<00:05:35.890> about<00:05:36.100> one-half<00:05:36.430> of<00:05:36.610> one<00:05:36.730> thousands

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
impacts about one-half of one thousands

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.190 
impacts about one-half of one thousands
of<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.300> second<00:05:37.570> is<00:05:37.630> what<00:05:37.750> they<00:05:37.870> mentioned

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
of the second is what they mentioned

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.530 
of the second is what they mentioned
point<00:05:38.650> zero<00:05:38.890> zero<00:05:38.950> zero<00:05:39.190> five<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:39.910> after<00:05:40.330> you

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
point zero zero zero five and after you

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.140 
point zero zero zero five and after you
explode<00:05:43.800> okay<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:45.010> good<00:05:45.430> drill<00:05:45.640> that<00:05:45.730> I<00:05:45.820> like<00:05:46.000> to

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
explode okay a good drill that I like to

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.090 
explode okay a good drill that I like to
think<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.810> do<00:05:46.990> this<00:05:47.170> is<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.350> just<00:05:47.620> put<00:05:47.770> my<00:05:47.890> hand

think to do this is I just put my hand
here<00:05:48.160> like<00:05:48.400> we're<00:05:48.550> impact<00:05:48.880> would<00:05:49.000> be<00:05:49.030> and<00:05:49.390> I

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
here like we're impact would be and I

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.870 
here like we're impact would be and I
just<00:05:49.870> practice<00:05:50.380> this<00:05:50.560> come<00:05:51.250> here<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.550> once<00:05:51.730> at

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
just practice this come here and once at

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.410 
just practice this come here and once at
once<00:05:51.910> I<00:05:52.150> slapped<00:05:52.450> my<00:05:52.600> hand<00:05:52.650> BAM<00:05:54.210> slap<00:05:55.210> on<00:05:55.390> the

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
once I slapped my hand BAM slap on the

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.120 
once I slapped my hand BAM slap on the
hand<00:05:55.570> is<00:05:55.780> like<00:05:55.900> explodes<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.590> right<00:05:56.770> foot<00:05:56.980> the

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
hand is like explodes the right foot the

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.790 
hand is like explodes the right foot the
right<00:05:57.280> knee<00:05:57.430> to<00:05:57.550> right<00:05:57.640> hip<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:57.940> shoulder<00:05:58.800> you

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.230 
right knee to right hip and shoulder you
can<00:05:59.950> see<00:06:00.040> there's<00:06:00.220> a<00:06:00.250> little<00:06:00.370> bit<00:06:00.490> of<00:06:00.550> turn<00:06:00.790> the

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
can see there's a little bit of turn the

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.640 
can see there's a little bit of turn the
weights<00:06:01.420> go<00:06:01.600> into<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.900> inside<00:06:02.140> of<00:06:02.200> my<00:06:02.380> foot

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
weights go into the inside of my foot

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.800 
weights go into the inside of my foot
you<00:06:03.340> can<00:06:03.460> see<00:06:03.610> my<00:06:03.730> ankle<00:06:04.090> saina<00:06:04.420> moving<00:06:04.750> a

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
you can see my ankle saina moving a

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.780 
you can see my ankle saina moving a
little<00:06:04.930> bit<00:06:05.020> to<00:06:05.230> eat<00:06:05.260> them<00:06:05.530> the<00:06:05.950> lower<00:06:06.520> leg

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
little bit to eat them the lower leg

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.570 
little bit to eat them the lower leg
pulling<00:06:07.060> my<00:06:07.210> ankle<00:06:07.480> in<00:06:07.570> but<00:06:08.560> it<00:06:08.740> is<00:06:08.860> not<00:06:09.100> up<00:06:09.340> in

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
pulling my ankle in but it is not up in

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.520 
pulling my ankle in but it is not up in
the<00:06:09.610> air<00:06:09.790> like<00:06:10.330> we<00:06:10.660> see<00:06:10.840> all<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.050> golf<00:06:11.230> a<00:06:11.470> lot

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
the air like we see all the golf a lot

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.650 
the air like we see all the golf a lot
of<00:06:11.740> golfers<00:06:11.980> do<00:06:12.100> today<00:06:12.280> BAM<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:13.330> I'm<00:06:13.420> through

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
of golfers do today BAM and I'm through

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.480 
of golfers do today BAM and I'm through
okay<00:06:14.560> so<00:06:14.800> hopefully<00:06:15.070> this<00:06:15.130> answers<00:06:15.280> the

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
okay so hopefully this answers the

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.260 
okay so hopefully this answers the
question<00:06:15.880> we<00:06:16.480> are<00:06:16.510> behind<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:17.170> ball<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.560> so

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
question we are behind the ball and so

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.100 
question we are behind the ball and so
the<00:06:19.270> right<00:06:19.450> be<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:20.530> right<00:06:20.710> knee<00:06:21.180> foot<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.450> hip

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
the right be the right knee foot and hip

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.350 
the right be the right knee foot and hip
cannot<00:06:23.440> fire<00:06:23.710> can<00:06:24.280> its<00:06:24.490> thoughts<00:06:24.880> of<00:06:25.090> slow

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
cannot fire can its thoughts of slow

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.470 
cannot fire can its thoughts of slow
firing<00:06:25.870> it's<00:06:26.260> kind<00:06:26.590> of<00:06:26.770> going<00:06:26.920> but<00:06:27.430> BAM<00:06:27.970> impact

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
firing it's kind of going but BAM impact

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.030 
firing it's kind of going but BAM impact
and<00:06:28.660> then<00:06:28.780> it<00:06:28.900> explodes<00:06:29.470> to<00:06:29.710> the<00:06:29.800> finish

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
and then it explodes to the finish

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.980 
and then it explodes to the finish
alright<00:06:30.790> so<00:06:30.940> we<00:06:31.060> got<00:06:31.090> it<00:06:31.330> we<00:06:31.630> have<00:06:31.780> to<00:06:31.900> be

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
alright so we got it we have to be

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.050 
alright so we got it we have to be
behind<00:06:32.140> the<00:06:32.380> ball<00:06:32.530> which<00:06:33.430> means<00:06:33.670> the<00:06:33.850> foot

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
behind the ball which means the foot

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.910 
behind the ball which means the foot
still<00:06:34.300> has<00:06:34.450> to<00:06:34.600> be<00:06:34.630> pretty<00:06:35.500> much<00:06:35.650> in<00:06:35.830> the

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
still has to be pretty much in the

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.140 
still has to be pretty much in the
downward<00:06:36.220> position<00:06:36.340> maybe<00:06:36.760> roll<00:06:37.000> to<00:06:37.120> the

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
downward position maybe roll to the

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.390 
downward position maybe roll to the
inside<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.660> then<00:06:37.750> BAM<00:06:38.050> it<00:06:38.530> just<00:06:38.800> explodes<00:06:39.280> to

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
inside and then BAM it just explodes to

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.010 
inside and then BAM it just explodes to
the<00:06:39.520> finished<00:06:39.910> cos<00:06:40.150> we<00:06:40.300> swing<00:06:40.570> up<00:06:40.690> to<00:06:40.810> the<00:06:40.870> tee

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
the finished cos we swing up to the tee

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.140 
the finished cos we swing up to the tee
finish<00:06:41.350> okay<00:06:42.100> hopefully<00:06:42.760> that<00:06:42.880> answers<00:06:43.120> your

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
finish okay hopefully that answers your

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.140 
finish okay hopefully that answers your
question<00:06:43.270> and<00:06:44.130> now<00:06:45.130> you<00:06:45.190> get<00:06:45.400> you<00:06:45.850> can<00:06:46.030> see

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150
