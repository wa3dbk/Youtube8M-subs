this<00:01:15.509> piece<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> paper<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:18.720> I'm

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
this piece of paper in and now I'm

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.410 
this piece of paper in and now I'm
actually<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> tighten<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> motor<00:01:19.979> up

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
actually going to tighten the motor up

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.580 
actually going to tighten the motor up
crimp<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.659> against<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.350> see

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
crimp it up against here as you can see

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289

right<00:01:22.830> there<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.400> I'm<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.640> pushing<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
right there so I'm just pushing it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.050 
right there so I'm just pushing it
mild<00:01:25.170> force<00:01:25.560> don't<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.340> anything<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.939> know

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
mild force don't do anything you know

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.789 
mild force don't do anything you know
too<00:01:27.119> heavy<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:27.930> make<00:01:28.259> sure<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.619> good

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
too heavy but just make sure it's good

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.249 
too heavy but just make sure it's good
and<00:01:28.829> tight

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
and tight

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.630 
and tight
go<00:01:31.259> ahead<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.530> tighten<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.310> I'm

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
go ahead and tighten it up and then I'm

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.890 
go ahead and tighten it up and then I'm
going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> tighten<00:01:33.119> these<00:01:33.210> bolts<00:01:33.450> up

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.630 

could<00:01:38.470> be<00:01:38.650> kind<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.920> tough<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.250> get<00:01:39.340> in<00:01:39.460> there

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
could be kind of tough to get in there

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.140 
could be kind of tough to get in there
but<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.210> know<00:01:40.470> not<00:01:41.470> too<00:01:41.680> bad<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.850> once<00:01:43.030> we

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
but you know not too bad and once we

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.940 
but you know not too bad and once we
have<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.420> engine<00:01:43.660> tight<00:01:43.840> just<00:01:44.650> spin<00:01:44.920> your

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
have the engine tight just spin your

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.740 
have the engine tight just spin your
spur<00:01:45.280> gear<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.730> it's<00:01:46.150> going<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.330> spit<00:01:46.570> that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
spur gear and it's going to spit that

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.350 
spur gear and it's going to spit that
paper<00:01:47.020> out<00:01:47.260> just<00:01:47.590> like<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.830> as<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:49.030> can<00:01:49.060> see
