00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.490
 different here for you 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.580
 today I will talk about one of the scales 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.740
 most famous are used most often 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.410
 nine taxi drivers I talk about the scale 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.869
 pentatonic but first of all I wanted to 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.940
 ask you to click on the garden here 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.220
 below to enjoy the video of 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.930
 enroll in the channel to make a 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.600
 comment and after you see a 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.929
 video lesson and also share this 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.760
 video on social networks to help 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:40.210
 People here from Brazil work beauty shop. 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.569
 rock 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.690
 so come on the pentatonic scale is 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:49.179
 a scale of eastern origin and as the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.549
 The name itself already says it is a 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:56.440
 composed of five new tonic penta 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:59.109
 structure to build this scale 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.549
 is thus between the first and the second 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.180
 standard 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:06.340
 we have a tone between the second and 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.940
 third in another tone 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.690
 between the third and fourth tone notes 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.520
 and between the fourth and fifth notes 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.430
 one more tone 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.880
 if we construct the scale from the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:27.310
 Note that we will have the following notes from 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:31.270
 one more tone is more a tome but a tone and 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.290
 mail and one more clear tone to 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.930
 perform the 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.210
 the pentatonic scale on the guitar without 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.030
 think of the exact notes we are 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.990
 touching or in the interval structure of the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.090
 scale 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.760
 we declare formats then 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.490
 we will declare five formats each 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.220
 starting from a note on the scale 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.520
 taking as an example the ascap tonic of 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.710
 we will touch following drawings 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.680
 starting from the following houses 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.979
 the first chip or the first format 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.440
 we're going to start from the high dollar here 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.440
 in house eight and it stays like this 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.950
 and the second drawing our part here in the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.950
 house 10 and it stays like this 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.310
 the third drawing 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:40.750
 We're going from here to the 12th house he 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:43.480
 This is the fourth drawing of our 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.810
 part of the third house he stays in 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.810
 like this 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.430
 the fifth and last drawing we leave 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:07.269
 here from house 5 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:09.189
 so stay to decorate the five 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.409
 drawings of the pentatonic scale will do 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.019
 exercise we will play each of the 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.230
 patterns starting here at the beginning of the arm 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.590
 from the guitar to the twelfth house 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.299
 always using two notes for the time I 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.620
 I will make here as an example the first 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.620
 standard and so on 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.700
