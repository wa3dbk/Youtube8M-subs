00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
remember that pawns also capture

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.539 
remember that pawns also capture
diagonally<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:23.829> is<00:02:23.980> what<00:02:24.129> happened<00:02:24.459> in

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
diagonally so this is what happened in

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.839 
diagonally so this is what happened in
the<00:02:24.640> game<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.659> is<00:02:25.720> check<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.579> King<00:02:27.579> moves

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
the game so this is check and King moves

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:36.210 
the game so this is check and King moves
to<00:02:29.430> e8<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:34.049> how<00:02:35.049> will<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.290> continue<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:36.010> if

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
to e8 now how will you continue you if

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.649 
to e8 now how will you continue you if
you<00:02:36.430> have<00:02:36.610> white<00:02:36.790> pieces<00:02:37.349> well<00:02:38.970> if<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.359> take

the<00:02:41.019> rook<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.519> pretty<00:02:42.760> good<00:02:43.030> move<00:02:43.769> but

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
the rook that is pretty good move but

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.220 
the rook that is pretty good move but
there<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.340> even<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.640> better<00:02:45.790> move<00:02:46.060> what<00:02:46.989> could

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
there is even a better move what could

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.440 
there is even a better move what could
be<00:02:47.379> better<00:02:47.590> than<00:02:47.769> winning<00:02:48.220> rook<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.640> getting

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
be better than winning rook and getting

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.280 
be better than winning rook and getting
another<00:02:49.720> Queen

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
another Queen
