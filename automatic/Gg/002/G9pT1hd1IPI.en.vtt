Nintendo realized the significance of
this<00:02:39.290> moment<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.190> they<00:02:40.340> didn't<00:02:40.549> let<00:02:40.640> anything

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
this moment so they didn't let anything

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.009 
this moment so they didn't let anything
get<00:02:41.239> in<00:02:41.299> its<00:02:41.480> way

brilliant staging and use of sound and

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.940 
brilliant staging and use of sound and
again<00:02:46.489> that's<00:02:46.760> just<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> opening<00:02:47.359> scene<00:02:48.079> it's
