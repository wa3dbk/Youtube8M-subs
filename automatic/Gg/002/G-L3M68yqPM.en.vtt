00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.069
 Speak, people , I'm Rodrigo, and today we 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 let's talk about regime 2 the first 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.349
 the Chinese smartphone finds the mir 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.509
 brazil which is the maybe incoming android 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.500
 but I would say a middleman 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.910
 I think you'll agree to the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.630
 General balance that I will make but to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.480
 front 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.660
 it is equipped with a snapdragon chip 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.820
 410 14 string and 1.2 GHz 8GB 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.119
 storage with expansion via micro sd 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.820
 1 GB RAM and 8 Megapixel Camera 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.510
 rear with flash and 2 megapixels 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.809
 front 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.570
 in addition it has of the chip and 4g or it gives 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.040
 to say that there is a good configuration 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.170
 Behaving goes like this. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.850
 as his own look is also 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.129
 behaved does not have any great 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.680
 highlight is all discreet with rear 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
 matte and rounded edges 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.340
 but I would still say that this 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.230
 simplicity has its charm there 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.199
 some people have come to this day 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.870
 his appearance while wearing collaborates 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.690
 with the fact that the screen a ips of 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.540
 4.7 inches with HD resolution 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.220
 she is very cute colors that angles 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.290
 vision are legal 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.850
 I can even say that currently in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.010
 the price range under which scheme 2 is 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.180
 sold does not have any so beautiful screen 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.700
 How old is that? 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.650
 and curiously at least for me 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.689
 which also makes a good impression on the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.330
 scheme 2 is the operating system it 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.369
 behind and yes in that respect I go 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 confess that my language 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.630
 That's because I've always liked android 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.920
 pure as close as possible to pure and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.130
 so it's easy to find a name you created 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.079
 called mio aig version 6 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 at first glance looks very much like the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.350
 apple west 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.229
 and I thought putz this should be a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.500
 in a Chinese clone but in the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.210
 my dear practice I was wrong but the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.520
 icons look like the icons on the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.610
 iphone apps are all in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 home screen like iphone but the truth 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 is that my Haiti has several 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.619
 various design features that are 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.509
 own 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.850
 in the animations utilities that it 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.649
 features or mainly in the functions 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.750
 cool stuff that are included 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.479
 there are good ideas as a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.660
 possible to move her are various icons 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.440
 at the same time they were married and several 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 settings 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.470
 allow you to change a lot whether the function 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.240
 of the capacitive buttons below the screen 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.640
 be the items you display in the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.860
 top bar notifications is 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.990
 crowned led notifications is below 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
 the display power management 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.640
 finally finding through the settings menu 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.950
 You'll realize that you can change a lot. 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.750
 thing , of course, a 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.420
 themes that allow downloading of data 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.940
 new visuals although having a lot of crap 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.040
 among the available options I 've spoken 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.870
 the capacitive buttons and could not 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.030
 to say that they do not have 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.610
 own lighting in addition are of color 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.500
 something different is not a 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.020
 kind of red that shines brightly 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.940
 when you sun is good but what 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.550
 it does not help in the dark so the 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.530
 unusual in life 5 when not 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.690
 There is light, you have to get used to it. 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.940
 in knowing their position 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.930
 still about mine the good news is 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.820
 that it does not appear to have an impact 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.890
 performance of the device 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.100
 on the contrary it looks like an interface 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.140
 light and dated masquerades certain milk 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.860
 and two controls made nice from each other. 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.140
 to see 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.150
 in general I repeat here she really is 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.709
 nice to use but we're not going either 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.720
 travel a lot on the performance of the 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.030
 scheme 2 with the specifications that it 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.010
 is a device that will run very 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.720
 well most of the time but in 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.209
 moments will also suffer with the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.090
 22 lines after opening and closing 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.950
 some heavy applications or after 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.320
 a very intense multi task 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.170
 In other words, you can roll slows 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.850
 that are not serious are expected and 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.310
 certainly has to do with the amount of 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.690
 of the device a gigabyte that today 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.880
 day is just ok 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.100
 I must say that there was also a 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.260
 slowness while turning the asphalt 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.519
 and eight in the middle of a race, which 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.860
 it was very nice 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.900
 after a network if everything returned to the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.910
 normal but still the record 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.330
 and of course you have to leave the remark that 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.340
 turning well or not the m2 will not be the 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.750
 best smartphone in the world for gaming 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.030
 for the simple fact that this version 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.519
 sold in Brazil only has 8 gb of 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.100
 internal storage and there are 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.590
 45 gigas for the user to use 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.870
 and it is not possible to install 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.430
 applications on the memory card 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.560
 Of course if you do hood 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.900
 and if that procedure can even 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.850
 release that installation on the card 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.979
 will lighten the internal memory a little 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.139
 but for those who do not have conca with it the 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.229
 standard space is sufficient to install 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.360
 but does not bring big games 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.110
 you set up where you'll be staying nearby 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.240
 of the limit 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.669
 and whatever the situation may be, put a 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.280
 micro sd card to help with photos and 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.320
 videos will be a good one I recommend on 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.270
 phone advertisement find it tells me 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.080
 he has a battery that lasts all day 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.530
 and I have to say that this is true 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.050
 It is true even the 2200 military now 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.669
 together with the organizations mio ae 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.610
 doing what that citizen can withstand 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.270
 quiet a day of common use with your 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.699
 16 hours on, being four hours and 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.430
 half to five hours of screen on the 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.650
 this in the standard power mode which is the 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.320
 balanced by placing it in the 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.240
 performance the brands fall a little more 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.340
 there is still a legal standard 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.020
 only the parliament and sees no reason to 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.789
 to go out of balance in time 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.990
 Some do not know when I went to test a game 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.490
 heavy and finally the m2 cameras also 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.190
 was viable considering that the 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.870
 smartphone 500 tale competes with you 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.610
 more expensive devices in this 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.490
 which captures images with a good 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.680
 speed and a good level of detail 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.289
 the camera gives a force in saturation 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.789
 when you turn on hdr mode as well 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.840
 take a little longer to take a photo 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.940
 crazy dr 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.979
 but I particularly like the 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.789
 results in open or 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.500
 closed 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.300
 Of course the front camera has that 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.120
 function bill and was the one with that charm 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.759
 so much that it takes away the imperfections of 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.020
 face in elfes let's say like this 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.389
 recommends using in moderation in the 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.080
 low intensity because it is used in the 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.840
 high 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.520
 You will leave the photo, it looks like a doll. 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.699
 on the video part he films in full 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.039
 hd with the rear at 720p with the front 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.470
 I think the states are ok but it's a 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.449
 pity that the microphone will not cancel the noise 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.520
 wind and then outdoors 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.380
 together tend to be quite 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.310
 noise 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.110
 the state is curious because the 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.680
 noise canceling is good 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.180
 already the recording of the videos is not 2 staff 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.040
 I would say in a way that regime 2 is a 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.840
 device that will survive the expectation that 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.770
 the shell created me on it in the networks 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.960
 social 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.090
 see for 500 with another currently 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.700
 people buy a motorcycle, it's how 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.970
 positive point the pure android and the battery 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:55.120
 or an iphone 5 that has 2gb of ram 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.670
 the m2 has good battery has android that does not 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.410
 it is pure but that is a separate case has 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.480
 cameras that are much better than 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.560
 engine and is gaining from cefor in many 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.170
 situations 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.780
 besides the 4g chip that the iphone 5 do not have 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.030
 of course this very partial comparison 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.980
 there are other points but I am 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.600
 I mentioned to illustrate with a key 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.820
 is well positioned in this range 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.650
 price currently as footnote I 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.060
 I did not get to stand out but the device 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.940
 also offers 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.590
 cloud storage of charm and such 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.830
 still on the software while 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.910
 I used two updates 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.920
 I'm hoping that at some point 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.200
 they add support for applications 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.060
 in the micro usb card and it does not cost to dream 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.920
 Anyway, we only have this model of 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.540
 eight gigs here in Brazil 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.860
 I hope you liked this video
