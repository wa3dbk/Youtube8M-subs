00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
market and so we've now moved from just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.759 
market and so we've now moved from just
the<00:00:44.399> execution<00:00:45.180> platform<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.019> we've<00:00:46.199> been

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
the execution platform that we've been

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.490 
the execution platform that we've been
using<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.340> where<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.269> actually<00:00:48.480> haven't<00:00:49.050> got

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
using to where we actually haven't got

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
using to where we actually haven't got
expert<00:00:50.039> bullion<00:00:50.399> consultants<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
expert bullion consultants just to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.750 
expert bullion consultants just to
assist<00:00:52.109> people<00:00:52.320> who<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:53.039> sure<00:00:53.280> about<00:00:53.460> how

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
assist people who are not sure about how

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.900

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to go into the sale and that will give

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.619 
to go into the sale and that will give
the<00:00:57.390> human<00:00:58.309> touch<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.670> guess<00:01:00.059> rather<00:01:00.300> that's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the human touch I guess rather that's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.329 
the human touch I guess rather that's
the<00:01:00.719> computer<00:01:01.019> touch<00:01:01.350> add<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:02.160> our

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
the computer touch add to our

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.100 
the computer touch add to our
relationship<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:02.940> our<00:01:03.030> clients<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.809> you're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
relationship with our clients so you're

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
relationship with our clients so you're
moving<00:01:04.230> into<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.860> professional<00:01:05.430> service

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
moving into a more professional service

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
moving into a more professional service
offering<00:01:06.600> rather<00:01:06.840> than<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.320> execution<00:01:08.160> only

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
offering rather than an execution only

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
offering rather than an execution only
can<00:01:08.610> take<00:01:08.850> four<00:01:09.090> days<00:01:09.299> correct<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.110> that's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
can take four days correct and that's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.140 
can take four days correct and that's
probably<00:01:10.799> been<00:01:10.950> bought<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.000> we've

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
probably been bought for because we've

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
probably been bought for because we've
also<00:01:12.299> expanded<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.009> offering<00:01:14.130> up

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
you look at the amount of charge

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.040 
you look at the amount of charge
from<00:05:37.610> japan<00:05:37.759> hold<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.569> then<00:05:38.720> we<00:05:38.900> go<00:05:39.020> down

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
from japan hold and then we go down

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.820 
from japan hold and then we go down
through<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.680> rest<00:05:41.050> those<00:05:42.050> two<00:05:42.080> big<00:05:42.500> players
