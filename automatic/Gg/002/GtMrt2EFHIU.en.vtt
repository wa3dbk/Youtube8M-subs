00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.490
 The surface must be sound and clean 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.960
 his 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.009
 she must not pose any loose or 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.749
 have holes 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:19.000
 otherwise they would have to be repaired 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:20.949
 important is a drop of about 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.480
 two percent off the house with it 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:28.689
 drainage can be checked that 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.730
 in several places with the judge 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.160
 So a depth of two meters must be 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.550
 There is a difference in height of 4 cm 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.800
 his 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 if you do not have to go with that 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.899
 make equalization and slope mortar 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.850
 All must be before laying 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.899
 Dirt on the plates 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.579
 be washed off 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.769
 They would mortar us on the publisher 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:03.449
 Do not keep mixing your cement 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.449
 bad and natural stone glue on 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.100
 both become wet in wet so directly 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.390
 the one after the other processes 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.540
 Mixing ratio is on the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.540
 packaging 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:48.090
 The cement has got bad with the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:55.830
 applied tassel then you put 24 cm 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:02:03.540
 thick slats on intervening now 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:05.940
 peel off the glue with the set list like that 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.570
 do you have exactly the required 4 cm thick 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.850
 Of glue is important that you always 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.590
 only as much material prepared as you 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.760
 can process until it becomes solid 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.750
 the time span is also on the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.390
 Packing your materials the first 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.170
 plate is placed in front at the corner next to 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.820
 best a plate with straight edge 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.110
 now you feel more plates and 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:42.150
 checked over again with the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:43.680
 wasserwaage search you again and again 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:53.160
 matching plates for a nice 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:55.380
 connection from when the prepared 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.180
 surface is misplaced you mix again 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.300
 cement adhesion bad and publisher mortar 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.300
 on 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:13.950
 Hogan always goes immediately 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.720
 scratch free again if that time 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.060
 dried you get the mortar only 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.540
 Hard to get out and you can see it in the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.540
 fuge always 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.550
 alternative to direct laying can 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.360
 you also fit the plates in advance 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.420
 to put it right 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.920
 that goes so plate for plate on the 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.700
 Publisher surface only without mortar 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.950
 interpret 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.250
 Now you can relax after all 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:29.230
 combine desire then numbered you 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.480
 go through the stones and make yourself some 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.190
 photos before you fix the stones 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.850
 the transfer to the photos is now 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.850
 even easier
