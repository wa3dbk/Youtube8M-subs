00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
okay not even half hour later she's out

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.339 
okay not even half hour later she's out
just<00:00:06.839> has<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.200> be<00:00:07.290> pulled<00:00:07.620> back<00:00:07.799> more<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.160> Lord

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.550 

took<00:00:13.349> out<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.769> tranny<00:00:14.099> yes<00:00:14.849> well<00:00:15.560> yeah

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
took out the tranny yes well yeah

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.880 
took out the tranny yes well yeah
yesterday<00:00:17.539> and<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.820> five-speed<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.890> think

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
yesterday and it is a five-speed I think

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.790 
yesterday and it is a five-speed I think
it's<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.189> MV<00:00:23.699> 3500<00:00:24.689> or<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:26.090> geat<00:00:27.090> reg<00:00:27.800> something

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
it's a MV 3500 or a geat reg something

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.320 
it's a MV 3500 or a geat reg something
or<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.250> pretty<00:00:29.490> much<00:00:29.550> exactly<00:00:29.970> same<00:00:30.300> as

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
or it's like pretty much exactly same as

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.760 
or it's like pretty much exactly same as
the<00:00:30.539> 3500<00:00:31.820> don't<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.940> exactly<00:00:33.500> which<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.739> it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the 3500 don't know exactly which one it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.080 
the 3500 don't know exactly which one it
is<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.460> know<00:00:35.520> they're<00:00:35.760> pretty<00:00:35.940> much

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
is but I know they're pretty much

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.990 
is but I know they're pretty much
identical<00:00:36.239> based<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> same<00:00:37.200> design<00:00:38.000> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
identical based on the same design and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.729 
identical based on the same design and
now<00:00:39.180> when<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.480> swapped<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.379> while<00:00:41.100> ago<00:00:41.489> for

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
now when I swapped in a while ago for

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.459 
now when I swapped in a while ago for
this<00:00:43.739> guy<00:00:44.390> in<00:00:45.390> sm<00:00:45.870> 465<00:00:46.739> no<00:00:47.579> OverDrive's<00:00:48.469> you

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
this guy in sm 465 no OverDrive's you

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.639 
this guy in sm 465 no OverDrive's you
can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> they're<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.660> lot<00:00:51.660> heavier<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
can see it they're a lot heavier but I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.170 
can see it they're a lot heavier but I
know<00:00:53.390> why<00:00:54.390> heavier<00:00:55.170> duty<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.090> wouldn't<00:00:57.090> be

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
know why heavier duty to I wouldn't be

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.389 
know why heavier duty to I wouldn't be
surprised<00:00:57.480> once<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> motors

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
surprised once I got one of the motors

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.319 
surprised once I got one of the motors
into<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.910> guy<00:01:00.120> blows<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:01.140> pretty<00:01:01.410> quick

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
into it this guy blows up pretty quick

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.170 
into it this guy blows up pretty quick
but<00:01:04.220> yeah<00:01:05.390> she's<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.159> gonna<00:01:08.159> put<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
but yeah she's out and gonna put this

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.010 
but yeah she's out and gonna put this
guy<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.470> stand<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.420> do<00:01:12.420> compression

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
guy on to that stand and do compression

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.640 
guy on to that stand and do compression
test<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.450> see<00:01:15.450> which<00:01:15.900> son<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> gone

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
test is to see to see which son is gone

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.100 
test is to see to see which son is gone
and<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.520> help<00:01:17.700> figure<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.750> compression

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and to help figure out if my compression

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.280 
and to help figure out if my compression
test<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.710> leaker<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.640> leaking<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:24.080> then<00:01:25.080> we'll

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
test is leaker is leaking so then we'll

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.429 
test is leaker is leaking so then we'll
then<00:01:26.189> I'll<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.520> everything<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.030> need<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.240> know

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
then I'll know everything I need to know

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
then I'll know everything I need to know
whether<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.009> guy<00:01:29.250> needs<00:01:29.310> rings<00:01:30.200> this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
whether or not that guy needs rings this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.590 
whether or not that guy needs rings this
guy<00:01:31.500> needs<00:01:31.710> rings<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.420> one

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
guy needs rings if it's if it's just one

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.179 
guy needs rings if it's if it's just one
or<00:01:33.720> two<00:01:33.750> cylinders<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.770> guidance

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
or two cylinders going on this guidance

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.030 
or two cylinders going on this guidance
from<00:01:35.400> rings<00:01:35.670> I'll<00:01:36.240> probably<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:37.040> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
from rings I'll probably just do this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560 
from rings I'll probably just do this
engine<00:01:38.520> instead<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.060> engine<00:01:39.240> because

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
engine instead of that engine because

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.819 
engine instead of that engine because
I've<00:01:39.750> already<00:01:39.900> done<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> whole<00:01:40.350> bunch<00:01:40.409> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
I've already done a whole bunch of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.539 
I've already done a whole bunch of
to<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.100> engine<00:01:42.110> your<00:01:43.110> timing<00:01:43.530> chain<00:01:46.549> can't

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to this engine your timing chain can't

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.050 
to this engine your timing chain can't
think<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.970> pretty<00:01:48.360> much<00:01:48.479> nothing<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.229> alva

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
think of it pretty much nothing in alva

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
think of it pretty much nothing in alva
just<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.329> bunch<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> crap<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.130> got

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
just a bunch of crap I know I know I got

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.840 
just a bunch of crap I know I know I got
to<00:01:53.430> do<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.729> seals<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.299> again<00:01:55.969> but

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
to do all the seals on it again but

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.159 
to do all the seals on it again but
I<00:01:58.770> guess<00:01:59.770> that's<00:01:59.950> it
