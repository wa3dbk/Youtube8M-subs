had a couple of holster orders for the
light<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.220> you're<00:00:26.490> seeing<00:00:26.730> right<00:00:26.820> here<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
light that you're seeing right here is

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.939 
light that you're seeing right here is
actually<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.570> generation<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.590> generation

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
actually a generation one at generation

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.160 
actually a generation one at generation
two<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.260> STL<00:00:31.260> -<00:00:31.759> 900<00:00:32.840> light<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
two and it is the STL - 900 light and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.490 
two and it is the STL - 900 light and
laser<00:00:35.239> basically<00:00:36.239> let's<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> safety<00:00:37.320> check

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
laser basically let's do a safety check

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.630 
laser basically let's do a safety check

wonderful<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.600> actually<00:01:07.520> gave<00:01:08.520> me<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.720> couple

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
wonderful they actually gave me a couple

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.499 
wonderful they actually gave me a couple
of<00:01:11.090> these<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.360> these<00:01:12.540> lights<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.900> lasers<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
of these all these lights and lasers and

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
of these all these lights and lasers and
for<00:01:15.509> me<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> try<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:17.009> holsters<00:01:17.460> with

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
for me to try out and make holsters with

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.140 
for me to try out and make holsters with
them<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.530> basically<00:01:19.729> they<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.759> working

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
them and basically they are working

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
them and basically they are working
lasers<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.220> they<00:01:23.220> were<00:01:23.909> very<00:01:24.270> very<00:01:24.390> kind<00:01:24.869> -<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
lasers and they were very very kind - to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.039 
lasers and they were very very kind - to
do<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.040> me<00:01:27.110> but<00:01:28.310> basically<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
do that for me but basically the the

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.890 
do that for me but basically the the
light<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.200> laser<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.799> controlled<00:01:32.340> by

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
light and laser is controlled by

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
light and laser is controlled by
ambidextrous<00:01:33.900> lights<00:01:34.290> switches<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> back

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
ambidextrous lights switches on the back

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.499 
ambidextrous lights switches on the back
the<00:01:36.329> light<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.680> momentary<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.729> or<00:01:39.000> off<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the light for a momentary on or off is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
the light for a momentary on or off is
the<00:01:39.689> green<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> lower<00:01:40.470> black<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the green one and the lower black one is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.480 
the green one and the lower black one is
for<00:01:42.030> on/off<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.350> saw<00:01:43.560> from<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> little<00:01:44.399> bit

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
for on/off as you saw from a little bit

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.819 
for on/off as you saw from a little bit
earlier<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.570> couple<00:01:46.079> seconds<00:01:46.350> ago<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> does

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
earlier a couple seconds ago it does

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.240 
earlier a couple seconds ago it does
have<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> strobe<00:01:47.670> feature<00:01:48.649> which<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.829> pretty

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
have a strobe feature which is pretty

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.990 
have a strobe feature which is pretty
nice<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> also<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> laser

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
nice and and then you also have a laser

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.109 
nice and and then you also have a laser
feature<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.549> light<00:01:56.790> laser

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
feature so it's a light laser

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.990 
feature so it's a light laser
combination<00:01:58.070> this<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.640> second

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
combination this is the second

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.709 
combination this is the second
generation<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:02.299> basically<00:02:03.299> what<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.659> did

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
generation and basically what they did

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.889 
generation and basically what they did
was<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:04.049> put<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> module<00:02:05.420> inside<00:02:06.420> change

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
was they put the module inside change

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.300 
was they put the module inside change
some<00:02:07.110> buttons<00:02:07.500> around<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.619> stl

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
some buttons around and that is the stl

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.930 
some buttons around and that is the stl
-

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
-

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.520 
-
100<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:13.140> first<00:02:13.590> generation<00:02:14.450> had<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.810> laser

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
100 the first generation had the laser

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.080 
100 the first generation had the laser
module<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.550> outside<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> light<00:02:18.570> and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
module on the outside of the light and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.960 
module on the outside of the light and
still<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.410> very<00:02:22.410> nice<00:02:22.680> tactical<00:02:23.370> bright<00:02:23.670> light

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
still a very nice tactical bright light

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.680 
still a very nice tactical bright light
and<00:02:25.610> also<00:02:26.610> has<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.060> laser<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:29.690> momentary

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
and also has the laser on it momentary

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.420 
and also has the laser on it momentary
on<00:02:31.490> or<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.760> off<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.890> they<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.070> added<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
on or on off and they just added a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580 
on or on off and they just added a
couple<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.820> features<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.570> improved<00:02:37.080> upon<00:02:37.230> it

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
couple of features and improved upon it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.150 
couple of features and improved upon it
I<00:02:37.680> think<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:39.260> then<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.380> less<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.980> very

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
I think and then the less it's a very

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.190 
I think and then the less it's a very
nice<00:02:41.370> tactical<00:02:41.910> light<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.720> other<00:02:42.780> one<00:02:43.020> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
nice tactical light the other one that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.160 
nice tactical light the other one that
they<00:02:43.350> sent<00:02:43.620> me<00:02:43.770> was<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.930> guess<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
they sent me was this is the I guess a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.110 
they sent me was this is the I guess a
classic<00:02:46.830> light<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.520> they<00:02:47.640> call<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.000> it's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
classic light is what they call it it's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.910 
classic light is what they call it it's
a<00:02:48.210> Cpl<00:02:48.990> -<00:02:49.410> RM<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.600> just<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.960> laser<00:02:52.170> this

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
a Cpl - RM and this is just a laser this

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.000 
a Cpl - RM and this is just a laser this
fits<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.490> most<00:02:54.180> picatinny<00:02:54.720> rails<00:02:54.990> he<00:02:55.770> has<00:02:55.890> an

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
fits on most picatinny rails he has an

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.990 
fits on most picatinny rails he has an
ambidextrous<00:02:57.770> on/off<00:02:58.770> switch<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.760> just

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
ambidextrous on/off switch and it's just

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.090 
ambidextrous on/off switch and it's just
a<00:03:00.090> laser<00:03:00.300> nice<00:03:01.260> thing<00:03:01.440> about<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.770> is<00:03:01.860> it's<00:03:02.040> very

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
a laser nice thing about it is it's very

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.660 
a laser nice thing about it is it's very
low<00:03:02.520> profile<00:03:03.890> fits<00:03:04.890> on

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670

this is a fairly large behemoth holster
this<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.160> not<00:03:53.459> typically<00:03:53.970> what<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.269> do<00:03:54.769> but<00:03:55.769> this

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
this is not typically what I do but this

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.770 
this is not typically what I do but this
is<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.300> fairly<00:03:57.959> large<00:03:58.290> behemoth<00:03:59.190> gun<00:03:59.570> with<00:04:00.570> a

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
very large tactical light on it so one

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.090 
very large tactical light on it so one
will<00:04:07.980> deserve<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.970> other<00:04:09.410> but<00:04:10.410> basically

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
will deserve the other but basically

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.430 
will deserve the other but basically
that's<00:04:11.850> what<00:04:12.000> we<00:04:12.060> have<00:04:12.420> that's<00:04:12.810> what<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.230> looks

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
that's what we have that's what it looks

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.240 
that's what we have that's what it looks
like<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:15.049> what<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.080> call<00:04:16.380> my<00:04:16.410> outside<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
like this is what I call my outside the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.830 
like this is what I call my outside the
waistband<00:04:17.700> my<00:04:17.850> outside<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.390> waistband

holsters<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:19.890> integrated<00:04:20.400> belt<00:04:20.729> loops

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
holsters you have integrated belt loops

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.090 
holsters you have integrated belt loops
so<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.870> have<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.410> thread<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.800> belt<00:04:22.950> through

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
so you have to thread the belt through

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.040 
so you have to thread the belt through
them<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.610> do

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
them I do

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.140 
can't to it versus a straight draw it's
roughly<00:04:41.389> about<00:04:41.539> 15<00:04:42.110> degrees<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.940> does

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
roughly about 15 degrees and it does

roughly about 15 degrees and it does

have some state channels primarily

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.640 
have some state channels primarily
because<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:47.960> has<00:04:48.199> these<00:04:48.729> fairly<00:04:49.729> large

because it has these fairly large

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.150 
because it has these fairly large
buttons<00:04:51.650> that<00:04:52.009> we<00:04:52.580> have<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.940> stay<00:04:53.389> clear<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:54.160> so

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
buttons that we have to stay clear of so

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.029 
buttons that we have to stay clear of so
they<00:04:55.729> don't<00:04:55.910> drag<00:04:56.090> up<00:04:56.300> on<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.539> whole<00:04:56.690> strip

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
they don't drag up on the whole strip

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.469 
they don't drag up on the whole strip
but<00:04:58.039> nonetheless<00:04:59.770> great<00:05:00.770> retention<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:02.210> it

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
but nonetheless great retention and it

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.740 
but nonetheless great retention and it
does<00:05:02.690> have<00:05:03.250> some<00:05:04.250> screws<00:05:04.580> on<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:05.509> can

does have some screws on it that you can

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.779 
does have some screws on it that you can
adjust<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.319> retention<00:05:06.470> I<00:05:07.069> try<00:05:07.729> to

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
adjust the retention I try to
