00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.350
 you got a little controlled the situation 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.750
 but the situation of the more than possible 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.730
 curse but now thank God the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.220
 judges waving the last tournament 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.690
 we had a little desperate precisely 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.060
 for fulfilling the expectations that 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.820
 I had people why you came with 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.290
 hype and cymbal 'then the part 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.430
 family where he missed us 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.560
 they commented 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.350
 your baby who has just recently 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.970
 born but now more and more coupled 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.040
 quiet even and now yes as 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.080
 we say the mico breaking it not like that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.400
 thank god now my family everything 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:39.150
 my wife is here my daughter the situation 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.700
 with all the partners already adapted 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.220
 with the companions knowing we wait 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.869
 that we can do much more and a little 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.180
 contrast camilo because on the one hand 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.790
 the roosters fighting the classification 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.979
 but on the other hand, because here I am signing it 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.100
 and on a date that the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.550
 title I do not know clear happy but the most 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.550
 important because for the two teams 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.090
 that we depend on only us to 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.619
 that those results help us but what 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.720
 most important here we can get to the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.020
 Liguilla and sharing this leadership 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.330
 Camilo with eleven annotations with a 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.660
 Argentinian Mauro Boselli with Colombian 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.690
 dorlan pabón what it means to you is 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.760
 the scoring leadership compartment 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.610
 they are not very high quality players 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.730
 also name players but I'm 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.100
 happy about this one 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.070
 I hope we can and that it is also more 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.050
 to goal if I do not also make this one 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.110
 let's leave the 3 that virtues 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.200
 would you highlight, for example, Mauro Boselli 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.290
 to a born goal scorer a player who 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.690
 is in area when you have nourished all 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.690
 from dorlan pabón 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.650
 a little more different especially very 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.000
 fast that homeland very well and on the other 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.050
 side that also does not surprise us the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.390
 done to be a scorer since in the m ls 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.400
 you won the golden boot even out there 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.980
 also in the prize puskas already also 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.360
 you're nominated for those 11 goals that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.190
 you take in the Mexican tournament which of the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.240
 which of all you remember more or what has 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.240
 meaning more way 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.980
 with america the first thing was this 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.380
 very important not only for me as for 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.260
 the team too and what does it mean to have 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.390
 achieved the golden boot in the m ls not very 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.930
 rewarding not because I'm forward and 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.900
 live golf fats farewell fun 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.840
 or not terrific and I hope to finish 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.350
 citizens 2000 and something more international 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.150
 the nominee for the trophy looks for what 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.150
 mean in your life this part does not 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.520
 very happy also not because my name 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.660
 is already then nicest goal devil 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.840
 of the world driving look and this fits me 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.690
 very very happy that without any doubt 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.390
 Camilo the fact that he achieved and from 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.819
 since you're doing it because this 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.370
 puts in the highest and above all with the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.860
 reflectors by large equipment 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.500
 of a given moment to take their 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.440
 respective equipment no no yes yes that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.060
 happy not because every fund has 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.060
 a lot of equipment like that 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.050
 through your exceptional work that 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.719
 is doing a good job but I'm 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.430
 focused only on perfect roosters to 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:32.819
 comrades I do not know if they have any 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.819
 question there in the studio for camilo 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.349
 very well you ask me what would be the 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.530
 difference you find between the m ls 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:54.150
 and the league mx way I think you have more 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.099
 forces stronger players that 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.169
 I work a lot and if from small to plain 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:03.580
 and here the players are much more 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.569
 quality and more skillful I think that a 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.279
 little is the difference 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.259
 some other question mates and not 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.879
