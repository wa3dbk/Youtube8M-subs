I<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.729> ahead<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.270> world

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
I think if we look ahead to this world

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.060 
I think if we look ahead to this world
cup<00:01:27.719> I<00:01:28.189> think<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> fact<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.320> fact<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
cup I think it's the fact the fact that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.969 
cup I think it's the fact the fact that
you're<00:01:32.820> obviously<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.240> England<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.259> so

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you're obviously in England that it's so

close<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.399> home<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.759> think<00:01:35.789> that<00:01:36.149> it's<00:01:36.299> really

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
close to home I think that it's really

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.069 
close to home I think that it's really
exciting<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:38.450> dropping<00:01:39.450> point<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.840> view<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
exciting that dropping point of view you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.840 
exciting that dropping point of view you

know it's the pinnacle it's that it's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.120 
know it's the pinnacle it's that it's
the<00:01:42.149> it's<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.719> top<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> game<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> like
