00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
and we all know that I think we were

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.960 
and we all know that I think we were
told<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.980> Google<00:05:37.980> will<00:05:38.070> not<00:05:38.130> be<00:05:38.400> updating

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
told that Google will not be updating

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.230 
told that Google will not be updating
the<00:05:39.390> Motorola<00:05:39.810> Xoom<00:05:39.900> anymore<00:05:40.470> but<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.970> looks

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
the Motorola Xoom anymore but it looks

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.030 
the Motorola Xoom anymore but it looks
like<00:05:42.420> the<00:05:42.540> photorealism<00:05:42.960> can<00:05:43.260> hold<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.590> on<00:05:43.740> as

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
like the photorealism can hold it on as

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.780 
like the photorealism can hold it on as
a<00:05:44.460> device<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.180> can<00:05:45.330> run<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:45.930> hopefully<00:05:46.800> the

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
a device that can run I hopefully the

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.320 
a device that can run I hopefully the
next<00:05:48.060> couple<00:05:48.300> updates<00:05:48.890> come<00:05:49.890> it<00:05:50.730> can<00:05:50.970> support

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
next couple updates come it can support

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.870 
next couple updates come it can support
it<00:05:51.510> so<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:52.500> far<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.860> is<00:05:52.980> supporting<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.640> it<00:05:53.760> is

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
it so so far it is supporting it it is

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.370 
it so so far it is supporting it it is
it<00:05:54.120> is<00:05:54.530> delimited<00:05:55.530> pretty<00:05:56.040> good

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
it is delimited pretty good

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.900 
it is delimited pretty good
so<00:05:58.380> again

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
so again

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.080 
so again
4.2<00:06:00.910> on<00:06:01.300> materialism
