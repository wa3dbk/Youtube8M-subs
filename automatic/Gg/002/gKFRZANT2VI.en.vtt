 by the original color and a cool thing is 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.810
 that she has a soundtrack then a scene 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.870

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.480

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.569
 shelf for storing the memory 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.280
 first goal is to this is to make a 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.890

 the second goal that I will make a 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.989
 animation of a story in the same 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.049
 technology universe a history 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.860
 from the first to the second third 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.750
 season 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.269
 are many stories that happen to the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.769
 same time in technology and they end up 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:48.590
 for crossing and people deported this 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.859
 animation it will be short film 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.230
 up to 15 minutes like everything a 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.560
 animation in law will sound 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.720
 dubbing time until you can join the 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.440
 animation how to explain 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.730
 in that corner on the left where the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.209
 rewards 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.880
 the description of them you can from 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.480
 then your book at home until you have your 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.459
 and an appearance in the animation with 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.070
 to interact with the character 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.829
 now the comrade who is giving the 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.500
 I support the campaign also cool it 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.110
 You know very well what it is you want to do. 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.349
 this type of work he writes as 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.700
 taking it draws excited and yet also 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:41.240
 it's two hours ago 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:42.800
 you probably know is samu is a 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.690
 of Brazilian artists who have the most 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.430
 inspired by the recent times because only 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.490
 to complete an entire season of a 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.740
 graphic novel as the era of rust 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.260
 alone is something very vulnerable is something 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.729
 which is something that inspires me too much and 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.770
 this catharsis project of the 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.840
 rust to become a graphic novel and a 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.400
 animation is something I'm sure 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.810
 It will look spectacular if it went by the hands. 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.960
 because he is a very 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.640
 passionate about really taking on a 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.640
 these endeavors to make a graphic 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.669
 novel in the pilot episode of animation that 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.890
 It's very expensive and takes a lot to do. 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.210
 This is explained with great passion to 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.280
 passion for storytelling 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.930
 the chance to evolve as an artist is this 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.700
 I'm sure that will make samuel 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.200
 I really believe in this project. 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.200
