00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.249
 an incredible delicacy 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.119
 are more versatile than if they were 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.949
 imagine 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.740
 I went from cultivating them to being 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.199
 planted in cups in other shells 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.169
 various utensils in your kitchen 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.390
 so the architect and landscaper maira 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.880
 guarnieri now teaches some ways 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.650
 to plant the flower and leave 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.650
 even more charming and beautiful 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.629
 Hi, how are you? I'm going to teach you. 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.149
 today how to use the has been cooking 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.600
 in planting violet people can use 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.269
 a cup a saucepan even a 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.070
 watering can to plant and another idea 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.769
 are in the shells you can use 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.229
 to plant your violet materials 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.070
 we are going to sand 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:59.199
 their teaching and violence 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.610
 the first step then we will 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.610
 put there to accommodate and 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.039
 You can put about 15 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.930
 inches of sand for adriano 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.409
 then the second step we will put the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.409
 Earth 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.880
 You will put approximately 15 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.240
 inches of soil depending on your 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.210
 It will be a container that walks 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.090
 You will make peace to plant and you. 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.000
 He picks up violet and tightens the void. 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.510
 to let go of the clod 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.510
 easy 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:06.440
 I take it and tighten it so that it stays 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.980
 well in the vessel and complete with 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.980
 the land 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.720
 You can see the planting is very simple. 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.000
 Now, in order to finish, we'll make the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.830
 rule as container is that it does not have 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.740
 holes below the ideal is you use a 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.200
 spray to put water on the 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.270
 violet does not need much water 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.980
 so we will take care of 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.530
 it's too little to keep you from getting 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.910
 very humid and that the unit 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.550
 generating the fungus in violet with violet 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.980
 already planted the ideal you water once 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.200
 in the winter week and twice in the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.600
 week in the summer as maintenance of your 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.730
 violet so that it always looks beautiful 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.820
 and showy full of flowers you 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.770
 use the violet flower every 15 days 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.450
 always being brave and easily 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.450
 leaves and never in flowers 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.750
 another tip for you to do the planting 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.910
 of violets at home and planting in the shell 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.459
 which is a very nice container that you 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.860
 you can drill a few holes down 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.959
 facilitates water drainage 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.660
 the staff is this, I hope you have 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.959
 liked the tips thank you very much and until the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.959
 next 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.370
 ah 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.970
 ah
