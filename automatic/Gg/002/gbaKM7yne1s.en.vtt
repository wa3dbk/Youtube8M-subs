00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
nicely nicely laying so step one we need

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.800 
nicely nicely laying so step one we need
to<00:02:22.860> discern<00:02:23.159> what<00:02:23.730> side<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.180> swoopy<00:02:24.510> bang<00:02:24.659> is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
to discern what side this swoopy bang is

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.680 
to discern what side this swoopy bang is
going<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.140> go<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.409> um<00:02:25.769> for<00:02:26.220> me<00:02:26.340> I've<00:02:27.150> noticed

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
going to go on um for me I've noticed

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.789 
going to go on um for me I've noticed
and<00:02:27.930> everyone's<00:02:28.230> hair<00:02:28.409> line<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.680> all

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
and everyone's hair line is all

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.430 
and everyone's hair line is all
different<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.159> all<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.579> cowlick<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.440> this

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
different we all have a cowlick and this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.949 
different we all have a cowlick and this
just<00:02:31.620> causes<00:02:32.010> our<00:02:32.159> hair<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.690> do<00:02:33.690> different

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
just causes our hair to do different

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.699 
just causes our hair to do different
things<00:02:33.989> on<00:02:34.230> each<00:02:34.319> side

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
things on each side

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.149 
things on each side
so<00:02:35.099> for<00:02:35.640> me<00:02:35.730> I'm<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> bit<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.360> widow's<00:02:36.959> peak<00:02:37.260> my

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
so for me I'm a bit of a widow's peak my

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.100 
so for me I'm a bit of a widow's peak my
hair's<00:02:38.489> tendency<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.569> want<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.930> naturally

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
hair's tendency is to want to naturally

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.059 
hair's tendency is to want to naturally
be<00:02:40.620> kind<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.400> swoop<00:02:42.390> back<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.409> this

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
be kind of like a swoop back on this

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.339 
be kind of like a swoop back on this
side<00:02:44.310> whereas<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.329> this<00:02:45.480> side<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:46.049> very

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
side whereas on this side it very

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.759 
side whereas on this side it very
naturally<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.579> willing<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.470> more<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
naturally is willing to do more of a

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.009 
naturally is willing to do more of a
side<00:02:49.980> bang<00:02:50.160> sort<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.579> thing<00:02:50.760> also<00:02:51.209> when<00:02:51.900> I've

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
side bang sort of thing also when I've

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.569 
side bang sort of thing also when I've
ever<00:02:52.049> had<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:52.890> short<00:02:53.129> bangs

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
ever had really short bangs

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.000 
ever had really short bangs
um<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.599> natural<00:02:55.019> part<00:02:55.230> has<00:02:55.379> been<00:02:55.500> over<00:02:55.769> here

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
um the natural part has been over here

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.649 
um the natural part has been over here
because<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.519> just<00:02:56.640> more<00:02:56.849> naturally<00:02:57.299> wants<00:02:57.510> to

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
because it just more naturally wants to

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.720 
because it just more naturally wants to
lay<00:02:57.840> even<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.739> front<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.010> my<00:02:59.069> face<00:02:59.250> whereas

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.370 
of halfway through because we can see
that<00:05:40.330> these<00:05:40.420> pieces<00:05:40.690> are<00:05:40.870> getting<00:05:41.080> shorter

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
that these pieces are getting shorter

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.570 
that these pieces are getting shorter
but<00:05:41.470> we<00:05:41.560> still<00:05:41.770> have<00:05:41.920> a<00:05:41.950> lot<00:05:42.100> of<00:05:42.130> length<00:05:42.310> here

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
but we still have a lot of length here

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.190 
but we still have a lot of length here
and<00:05:42.730> I<00:05:42.910> want<00:05:43.420> to<00:05:43.480> keep<00:05:43.570> some<00:05:43.810> of<00:05:43.840> that<00:05:43.930> but<00:05:44.140> not

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
and I want to keep some of that but not

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.270 
and I want to keep some of that but not
all<00:05:44.260> of<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:44.680> I'm<00:05:44.770> going<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:44.980> start<00:05:45.160> about

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
all of it so I'm going to start about

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.770 
all of it so I'm going to start about
midway<00:05:46.050> lift<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.530> tiny<00:05:48.070> little<00:05:48.670> trims<00:05:49.030> you

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
midway lift and tiny little trims you

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.840 
midway lift and tiny little trims you
can<00:05:49.930> probably<00:05:50.140> see<00:05:50.470> by<00:05:50.620> now<00:05:50.650> why<00:05:50.980> it's<00:05:51.160> so<00:05:51.490> so

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
can probably see by now why it's so so

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.170 
can probably see by now why it's so so
imperative<00:05:52.420> to<00:05:52.630> have<00:05:53.580> high-ish<00:05:54.580> quality

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
imperative to have high-ish quality

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.990 
imperative to have high-ish quality
shears<00:05:55.420> to<00:05:55.690> do<00:05:55.810> this<00:05:55.960> because<00:05:56.950> if<00:05:57.280> your<00:05:57.610> shears

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
are going to be getting caught up on the

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.310 
are going to be getting caught up on the
hair<00:06:00.250> shaft<00:06:00.550> you<00:06:01.300> have<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.600> possibility<00:06:02.140> of

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
hair shaft you have the possibility of

hair shaft you have the possibility of
breaking<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:03.100> hair<00:06:04.110> which<00:06:05.110> you<00:06:05.290> know<00:06:05.410> is<00:06:05.470> just

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
breaking the hair which you know is just

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
breaking the hair which you know is just
going<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.770> lead<00:06:05.890> to<00:06:05.920> more<00:06:06.130> split<00:06:06.370> ends

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
going to lead to more split ends

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.890 
going to lead to more split ends
especially<00:06:07.060> if<00:06:07.120> you<00:06:07.210> have<00:06:07.360> highly<00:06:07.690> processed

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
especially if you have highly processed

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.300 
especially if you have highly processed
hair<00:06:08.380> you're<00:06:08.710> just<00:06:08.830> gonna<00:06:08.920> have<00:06:09.100> to<00:06:09.160> get<00:06:09.280> a

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
hair you're just gonna have to get a

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.000 
hair you're just gonna have to get a
shorter<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:09.910> it<00:06:10.000> wants<00:06:10.300> that<00:06:10.740> also<00:06:11.740> you<00:06:11.800> need

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
shorter and it wants that also you need

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.890 
shorter and it wants that also you need
the<00:06:12.130> fluidity<00:06:12.430> of<00:06:12.640> movement<00:06:12.730> to<00:06:13.420> go<00:06:13.630> really

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
the fluidity of movement to go really

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.860 
the fluidity of movement to go really
quickly<00:06:14.110> so<00:06:14.350> that<00:06:14.380> you<00:06:14.500> get<00:06:14.620> a<00:06:14.680> smooth<00:06:15.070> line

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
quickly so that you get a smooth line

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:35.989 
quickly so that you get a smooth line
okay<00:06:16.870> let's<00:06:17.020> keep<00:06:17.140> going

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:35.999 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:38.389 

okay<00:06:36.749> at<00:06:37.019> this<00:06:37.169> point<00:06:37.439> we<00:06:37.769> see<00:06:37.919> I<00:06:37.949> have<00:06:38.159> a<00:06:38.189> lot
