00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
bleach water to spray on my pruners to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.759 
bleach water to spray on my pruners to
make<00:00:12.800> sure<00:00:12.950> I'm<00:00:13.130> not<00:00:13.420> adding<00:00:14.420> something<00:00:15.349> bad

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
make sure I'm not adding something bad

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.640 
make sure I'm not adding something bad
to<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:16.189> trees<00:00:16.460> whatever<00:00:16.990> that<00:00:17.990> would<00:00:18.200> be<00:00:18.230> and

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
to the trees whatever that would be and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.029 
to the trees whatever that would be and
I<00:00:19.280> got<00:00:19.400> these<00:00:19.550> young<00:00:19.850> trees<00:00:19.910> and<00:00:21.039> I've

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
I got these young trees and I've

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.200 
I got these young trees and I've
hesitated<00:00:22.310> a<00:00:23.240> few<00:00:23.449> weeks<00:00:24.550> because<00:00:25.550> I<00:00:25.940> don't

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
hesitated a few weeks because I don't

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.410 
hesitated a few weeks because I don't
really<00:00:26.510> like<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:28.100> thought<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.730> people<00:00:29.000> that

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
really like the thought of people that

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.819 
really like the thought of people that
say<00:00:29.689> you<00:00:30.380> got<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:30.710> cut<00:00:30.920> them<00:00:31.010> off<00:00:31.160> at<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.490> knee

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
say you got to cut them off at the knee

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.399 
say you got to cut them off at the knee
in<00:00:33.829> order<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:34.190> get<00:00:34.339> that<00:00:34.460> good<00:00:34.699> growth<00:00:34.969> but<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.839> I

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:36.409 
in order to get that good growth but I I

in order to get that good growth but I I
think<00:00:37.100> I'm<00:00:37.190> going<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.339> go<00:00:37.460> ahead<00:00:37.519> and<00:00:37.699> try<00:00:37.940> it

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
think I'm going to go ahead and try it

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:44.139 
think I'm going to go ahead and try it

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.990 

like<00:01:04.879> they<00:01:05.090> say<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.080> I'm<00:01:06.710> not<00:01:06.860> sure<00:01:06.920> if<00:01:07.610> I

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000

gonna cut below that and this is one of
my<00:01:27.380> pear<00:01:27.650> trees<00:01:30.130> so

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.060 

probably<00:01:38.380> should<00:01:38.500> be<00:01:38.590> using<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.950> police

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070

probably should be using the police
water<00:01:39.370> between<00:01:39.700> each<00:01:39.880> tree<00:01:40.240> that's<00:01:41.050> why<00:01:41.230> I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
water between each tree that's why I

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:59.550 
water between each tree that's why I
brought<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.620> out
