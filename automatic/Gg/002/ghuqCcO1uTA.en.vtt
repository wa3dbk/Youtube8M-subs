your crowning achievement right yeah if
anything<00:00:05.430> it's<00:00:05.730> probably<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> most

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
anything it's probably the most

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.759 
anything it's probably the most
terrifying<00:00:07.550> the<00:00:08.550> most<00:00:08.730> terrifying

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
terrifying the most terrifying

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.070 
terrifying the most terrifying
skateboard<00:00:10.769> from<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.219> depths<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.300> ocean

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
skateboard from the depths of this ocean

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.350 
skateboard from the depths of this ocean
so<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.160> point<00:00:14.610> out<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.790> isn't<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.240> an

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
so I point out this isn't just an

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.760 
so I point out this isn't just an
experiment<00:00:15.690> with<00:00:15.900> deck<00:00:16.139> shape<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.619> wheel

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
experiment with deck shape and wheel

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
experiment with deck shape and wheel
wells<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.190> other<00:00:17.310> stuff<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.000> also<00:00:18.180> an

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
wells and other stuff this is also an

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.130 
wells and other stuff this is also an
experiment<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.740> excursion<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.550> us<00:00:20.990> into<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
experiment and excursion for us into the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.640 
experiment and excursion for us into the
world<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.980> fiberglass<00:00:23.519> yes<00:00:24.289> which<00:00:25.289> by<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.470> way

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
world of fiberglass yes which by the way

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.980 
world of fiberglass yes which by the way
is<00:00:25.769> probably<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.279> most<00:00:26.340> terrifying<00:00:26.990> place

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
is probably the most terrifying place

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.769 
is probably the most terrifying place
out<00:00:28.230> there<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.119> what<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.210> got<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.720> here

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
out there so what we got going on here

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.670 
out there so what we got going on here
is<00:00:31.489> a<00:00:32.960> very<00:00:33.960> complex<00:00:35.690> 3d<00:00:36.890> baltic<00:00:37.890> birch<00:00:38.149> core

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
is a very complex 3d baltic birch core

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.700 
is a very complex 3d baltic birch core
there's<00:00:40.680> kick<00:00:41.100> tales<00:00:41.489> there's<00:00:42.120> concave<00:00:42.930> their

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
there's kick tales there's concave their

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.110 
there's kick tales there's concave their
bowls<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:45.680> it's<00:00:46.680> completely<00:00:47.120> asymmetric

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
bowls and it's completely asymmetric

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.080 
bowls and it's completely asymmetric
there<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> tip<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> tail<00:00:50.160> there's<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
there is a tip there is a tail there's a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.350 
there is a tip there is a tail there's a
front<00:00:51.539> there's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.350> back<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.940> made

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
front there's a back this thing is made

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.250 
front there's a back this thing is made
to<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:55.140> some<00:00:55.710> freestyle<00:00:56.399> longboard<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.960> didn't

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to do some freestyle longboard we didn't

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.740 
to do some freestyle longboard we didn't
go<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:58.410> thick<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.399> wood<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.600> we

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
go very thick on the wood because we

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.070 
go very thick on the wood because we
wanted<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.070> lightweight<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.080> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
wanted it to be lightweight and the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.520 
wanted it to be lightweight and the
intentions<00:01:04.769> were<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.869> wrap<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.170> entire<00:01:07.290> thing

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
intentions were to wrap the entire thing

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.460 
intentions were to wrap the entire thing
in<00:01:07.950> fiberglass<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.270> strength<00:01:09.689> would<00:01:10.229> come

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
in fiberglass so the strength would come

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.750 
in fiberglass so the strength would come
from<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> core<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:13.010> fiberglass<00:01:14.010> which

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
from the core and the fiberglass which

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.690 
from the core and the fiberglass which
was<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.750> make<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:17.100> concave

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
was then going to make up the concave

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.940 
was then going to make up the concave
and<00:01:18.470> wheel<00:01:19.470> well<00:01:19.770> recesses<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.450> could

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
and wheel well recesses so that we could

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.510 
and wheel well recesses so that we could
experiment<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.790> board<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.420> would<00:01:25.110> have

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
experiment with a board that would have

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.910 
experiment with a board that would have
22<00:01:26.520> degrees<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.330> deck<00:01:27.750> tip<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.590> other

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
22 degrees of deck tip from other

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.179 
22 degrees of deck tip from other
planets<00:01:29.310> kate<00:01:29.700> trucks<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.979> not

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
planets kate trucks but would not

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.969 
planets kate trucks but would not
interfere<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:33.630> your<00:01:33.810> feet<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.740> foot

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
interfere with your feet and your foot

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.490 
interfere with your feet and your foot
pattern<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.540> totally<00:01:36.869> ride<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
pattern so you can totally ride this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.359 
pattern so you can totally ride this
thing<00:01:38.479> like<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> regular<00:01:39.780> skateboard<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> have

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
thing like a regular skateboard and have

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.050 
thing like a regular skateboard and have
your<00:01:41.549> feet<00:01:41.820> over<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> axles<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.729> use<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
your feet over the axles and use the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.929 
your feet over the axles and use the
wheel<00:01:45.270> wells<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.930> gas<00:01:46.530> pedals<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.700> can

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
wheel wells as gas pedals so you can

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.300 
wheel wells as gas pedals so you can
find<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.390> sweet<00:01:48.780> spot<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.500> board<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
find that sweet spot on your board and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.370 
find that sweet spot on your board and
then<00:01:50.970> also<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.390> more<00:01:51.600> leverage<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
then also get more leverage just to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.260 
then also get more leverage just to
throw<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.890> thing<00:01:53.100> around<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.119> know

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
throw the thing around and then you know

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.510 
throw the thing around and then you know
still<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.750> freestyle<00:01:55.290> moves<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.369> know

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
still do freestyle moves and you know

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.899 
still do freestyle moves and you know
standees<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.140> lot<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:58.829> maneuvers<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
standees and a lot more maneuvers that

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.130 
standees and a lot more maneuvers that
you<00:01:59.969> normally<00:02:00.119> couldn't<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> skateboard

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you normally couldn't do on a skateboard

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
you normally couldn't do on a skateboard
because<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> has<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> kick<00:02:02.280> tail<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:03.210> has<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
because it has a kick tail it has the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.340 
because it has a kick tail it has the
deep<00:02:03.930> concave<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.549> got<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.939> super<00:02:06.479> rad<00:02:06.719> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
deep concave it's got the super rad you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.889 
deep concave it's got the super rad you
know<00:02:07.469> wheel<00:02:08.250> well<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.090> way<00:02:09.390> over

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
know wheel well so you can get way over

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.570 
know wheel well so you can get way over
it<00:02:09.989> have

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
it have

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.180 
it have
dec<00:02:11.000> tip<00:02:11.270> without<00:02:11.600> compromising<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:13.070> know

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
dec tip without compromising you know

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.820 
dec tip without compromising you know
wheel<00:02:13.910> bite<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:15.020> still<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.440> something

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
wheel bite but then still have something

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.640 
wheel bite but then still have something
that<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.010> can<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.550> know<00:02:16.670> do<00:02:17.030> see<00:02:17.210> sweet<00:02:17.650> you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
that you can you know do see sweet you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.880 
that you can you know do see sweet you
know<00:02:18.680> nose<00:02:19.430> manual<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.450> walk<00:02:21.440> around<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
know if he realized but you think I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.530 
know if he realized but you think I
could<00:02:55.100> just<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.610> know<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:56.000> piece<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.240> wood

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
could just you know it's a piece of wood

could just you know it's a piece of wood
there's<00:02:56.810> no<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.490> know<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.850> can<00:02:59.180> easily<00:02:59.780> do

there's no but you know I can easily do
all<00:03:00.440> sorts<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:00.860> moves<00:03:01.100> on<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.880> know<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> can

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
all sorts of moves on it you know I can

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.010 
all sorts of moves on it you know I can
walk<00:03:02.990> all<00:03:03.260> over<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.160> pick<00:03:04.370> up<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.670> board

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
walk all over I can pick up the board

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.170 
walk all over I can pick up the board
super<00:03:06.020> easy<00:03:06.200> just<00:03:06.440> move<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.010> around<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:08.060> know

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
super easy just move it around you know

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.570 
super easy just move it around you know
now<00:03:08.900> imagine<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.470> get<00:03:09.590> some<00:03:09.770> skate<00:03:10.100> trucks<00:03:10.400> on

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
now imagine you get some skate trucks on

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.190 
now imagine you get some skate trucks on
here<00:03:10.850> with<00:03:11.000> some<00:03:11.180> harder<00:03:11.480> durometer<00:03:11.900> wheels

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
here with some harder durometer wheels

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.750 
here with some harder durometer wheels
and<00:03:12.470> you're<00:03:12.560> ripping<00:03:12.770> down<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.160> hill<00:03:13.520> you

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
and you're ripping down the hill you

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.940 
and you're ripping down the hill you
know<00:03:13.790> I'm<00:03:14.540> able<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.110> bust<00:03:15.290> out<00:03:15.500> some<00:03:15.530> pretty

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
know I'm able to bust out some pretty

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.610 
know I'm able to bust out some pretty
sweet<00:03:16.100> stuff<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:17.080> take<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.380> skate

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
sweet stuff and take it to the skate

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.650 
sweet stuff and take it to the skate
park<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.070> go<00:03:19.160> show<00:03:19.430> off<00:03:19.459> in<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> bowl<00:03:20.120> you

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
park and go show off in the bowl you

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.060 
park and go show off in the bowl you
know<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:20.959> what<00:03:21.110> all<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.260> short<00:03:21.560> skaters<00:03:21.950> are

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
know it's what all the short skaters are

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.759 
know it's what all the short skaters are
doing<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.459> then<00:03:22.550> still<00:03:22.790> go<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:24.350> know<00:03:24.470> bust

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
doing and then still go you know bust

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.740 
doing and then still go you know bust
out<00:03:24.920> some<00:03:24.950> big<00:03:25.580> slides<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.269> steep<00:03:26.480> hills

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
out some big slides on the steep hills

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.449 
out some big slides on the steep hills
with<00:03:26.989> wearing<00:03:27.350> your<00:03:27.470> gloved<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:28.100> know<00:03:28.220> this

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
with wearing your gloved you know this

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.780 
with wearing your gloved you know this
this<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.510> me<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.320> radical<00:03:30.890> departure<00:03:30.920> for

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
this to me is a radical departure for

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.810 
this to me is a radical departure for
long<00:03:32.480> Morgan<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.500> know<00:03:33.650> you're<00:03:33.860> not<00:03:34.040> limited

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
long Morgan you know you're not limited

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.600 
long Morgan you know you're not limited
to<00:03:35.600> one<00:03:35.870> skateboard<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.860> just<00:03:37.100> goes<00:03:37.280> fast

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
to one skateboard that just goes fast

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.270 
to one skateboard that just goes fast
and<00:03:38.000> one<00:03:38.600> skateboard<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.320> Justin<00:03:39.830> shred<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
and one skateboard that Justin shred the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.199 
and one skateboard that Justin shred the
park<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:41.660> now<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.709> board<00:03:43.519> to

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
park you now have the board to

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.440 
park you now have the board to
accommodate<00:03:44.810> all<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.050> those<00:03:45.500> disciplines<00:03:46.130> and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
accommodate all of those disciplines and

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.710 
accommodate all of those disciplines and
you<00:03:47.450> know<00:03:48.130> obviously<00:03:49.130> it's<00:03:49.790> version<00:03:50.209> 1<00:03:50.420> point

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
you know obviously it's version 1 point

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.680 
you know obviously it's version 1 point
0<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:52.510> as<00:03:53.510> we<00:03:53.780> evolve<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:55.370> concept<00:03:56.000> it's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
0 but as we evolve this concept it's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.500 
0 but as we evolve this concept it's
only<00:03:56.930> going<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.200> get<00:03:57.320> more<00:03:58.180> radical<00:03:59.180> it's

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
only going to get more radical it's

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.300 
only going to get more radical it's
going<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.720> get<00:03:59.780> lighter<00:04:00.050> weight<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.769> Flex<00:04:01.160> is

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
going to get lighter weight the Flex is

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.610 
going to get lighter weight the Flex is
going<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.550> get<00:04:01.670> better<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:03.170> know<00:04:03.290> we're

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
going to get better and you know we're

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.050 
going to get better and you know we're
only<00:04:03.739> going<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:03.980> be<00:04:04.070> able<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.340> integrate<00:04:04.610> more

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
only going to be able to integrate more

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.979 
only going to be able to integrate more
features<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:05.989> I'm<00:04:06.950> excited<00:04:07.340> because<00:04:07.959> not<00:04:08.959> only

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
features so I'm excited because not only

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.280 
features so I'm excited because not only
does<00:04:09.709> this<00:04:10.030> eliminate<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.810> many<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.170> the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
does this eliminate so many of the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.080 
does this eliminate so many of the
issues<00:04:12.410> that<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.799> have<00:04:12.860> with<00:04:13.040> cardboard<00:04:13.549> design

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
issues that I have with cardboard design

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.770 
issues that I have with cardboard design
but<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.900> also<00:04:15.080> is<00:04:15.560> an<00:04:16.459> experiment<00:04:17.180> with<00:04:17.570> more

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
but it also is an experiment with more

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.319
