00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
put it against our wheel we're gonna

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.590 
put it against our wheel we're gonna
pinch<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:48.710> off<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:56.180> there<00:01:56.330> we<00:01:56.480> have<00:01:56.570> a

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
pinch it right off so there we have a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.190 
pinch it right off so there we have a
handle<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.530> what<00:01:58.400> we<00:01:58.490> do<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.080> set<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.170> down

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
handle and what we do is we set it down

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
handle and what we do is we set it down
to<00:02:00.530> dry<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:03.110> it's<00:02:03.260> very<00:02:03.440> difficult<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:04.010> put<00:02:04.190> a

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
to dry so it's very difficult to put a

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.720 
to dry so it's very difficult to put a
very<00:02:04.970> wet<00:02:05.210> handle<00:02:05.630> onto<00:02:05.870> a<00:02:05.900> pot<00:02:06.730> because

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
very wet handle onto a pot because

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.560 
very wet handle onto a pot because
you'll<00:02:07.970> deform<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.570> what<00:02:09.050> not<00:02:10.210> okay<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:11.270> what<00:02:11.540> I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
you'll deform it what not okay so what I
