all right so there you have it so this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.340 
all right so there you have it so this
runs<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:47.170> almost<00:02:48.170> stuck<00:02:48.920> Froyo<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:51.140> has<00:02:51.320> a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
runs on almost stuck Froyo it has a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.790 
runs on almost stuck Froyo it has a
little<00:02:51.560> bit<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.000> small<00:02:53.110> skin<00:02:54.110> layer<00:02:54.350> on<00:02:54.590> top

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
little bit of a small skin layer on top

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.360

different from the usual so when you go
to<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.400> unlock<00:03:01.730> screen<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.180> slow<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.840> just

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
to the unlock screen and slow you just

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.320 
to the unlock screen and slow you just
drag<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.350> down<00:03:03.550> but<00:03:04.550> it's<00:03:04.880> got<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> nice

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
drag this down but it's got a nice

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.000 
drag this down but it's got a nice
little<00:03:05.600> touch<00:03:05.870> when<00:03:06.080> you're<00:03:06.200> charging<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.770> so

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
little touch when you're charging it so

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.000 
little touch when you're charging it so
let's<00:03:07.190> connect<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.970> charger<00:03:08.510> up<00:03:08.710> like<00:03:09.710> here

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
let's connect this charger up like here

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.700 
let's connect this charger up like here
right<00:03:10.130> there<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.600> should<00:03:11.780> show<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.110> the

widgets<00:04:15.410> yet<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:15.920> idea<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.850> experiment<00:04:17.450> with

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
widgets yet the idea to experiment with

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.750 
widgets yet the idea to experiment with
it<00:04:17.989> with<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.739> interface<00:04:19.220> but<00:04:19.400> there<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.669> go

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
it with the interface but there you go

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.490 
it with the interface but there you go
it<00:04:19.880> changes<00:04:20.180> with<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.630> entry<00:04:20.870> interface<00:04:21.260> a

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
it changes with the entry interface a

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.240 
it changes with the entry interface a
little<00:04:21.650> bit

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
little bit

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.230 
little bit
pretty<00:04:24.250> much<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:25.300> lot<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:26.250> stock<00:04:27.250> applications

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
pretty much a lot of stock applications

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.909 
pretty much a lot of stock applications
like<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.600> camera<00:04:28.990> one<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:32.229> looks<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.740> looks

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
like the camera one it looks it looks

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.480 
like the camera one it looks it looks
like<00:04:33.069> the<00:04:33.220> Android<00:04:33.729> camera<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.539> but<00:04:35.490> it's

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
like the Android camera so but it's
