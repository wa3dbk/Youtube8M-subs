00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 sapphire taider welcome to the gazet of 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.319
 fennec belgium republic of korea 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.750
 Russia 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.889
 we know our opponents but I am 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.570
 reminded of the dangers that I was 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.109
 impatient we find all the interests of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.570
 tours know how to maintain we were going to fall 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.510
 it's pretty positive 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.920
 the affordable group group will not be 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 easy because at the cut of an entire 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:35.910
 team in the lead 36 good level and it's this 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.370
 who will be our strength there in brazil 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.090
 you think that comment on this case the crs 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.090
 to the affordable group 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.920
 hu is possible and he knows who is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.129
 yet the biggest opponent in the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.120
 group against belgium and russia 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.710
 to mention in belgium because 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 it was a very good team with 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.840
 a lot of quality days 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.030
 but that's really all for one 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.260
 spa tour is just what you need 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:16.229
 for him that we too a group of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:18.720
 quality that you think that plays the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.280
 belgium first it's a benefit the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.540
 bigger how filled as 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.920
 disadvantage that all matches 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.229
 are important to continue the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.150
 work she took me out 6-4 where it takes 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.560
 get out of the team to be able to 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
 take at times and just 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.470
 arms 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.870
 I think in writing the matches will be 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.060
 seconds and there would be four matches 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.550
 play and so that it can be said 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.620
 he is an opponent of Russia who has 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.690
 as coach capello I know 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:02:05.190
 because it's the team but there is a 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:08.520
 very good atmosphere comes into life and 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.290
 will defend his chances for the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.010
 Korea is an unknown 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.190
 underestimate 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.790
 that's what will cover and less known 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.310
 that others have no team we will have 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.170
 the matches thoroughly for all feasted 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.820
 before we are we are happy with a rich man 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.030
 so we want to win everything 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:31.170
 not that we have no equipped 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.840
 South American in the other group 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.130
 we have two European and Asian one 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.920
 little regret not to play a team 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.410
 South American may have seen the quality 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.750
 of our workforce we are in a team of 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.519
 balloon we like to play 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:57.860
 how do you see his opponents we're going 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:59.940
 say Asian Europeans and after he 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.650
 must know that his feet but that 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.450
 the important thing is any group because 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.310
 that we made enormous efforts to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.290
 others qualified as additional work 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.060
 and we have not finished begins as an art 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.650
 just how do you see this 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.690
 preparation for the world now we are 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:23.580
 at six months how do you see the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:24.090
 preparation have play time in 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.060
 our clubs 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.959
 be competitive and then go to 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.239
 world is a good preparation 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.030
 before to be physically ready because 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.209
 we know very well that between times there 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.489

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.380

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.950
 there is me and go to the second plane of

 its mass is the goal of everyone 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.250
 of course of course you do not believe in 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.510
 background because we are able to do 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.440
