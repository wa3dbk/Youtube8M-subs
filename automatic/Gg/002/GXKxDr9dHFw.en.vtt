00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello hello here is your michael again 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.049
 by bio cook we show today church 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.880
 white churches which are both weapon 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.970
 taste very nice as well as to change 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.970
 called 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.359
 people can afford us needs 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.000
 how clean churches i have one 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.099
 frozen goods graphic gives you anyway 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.349
 only very briefly in the year 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.730
 but in winter you are very much like me 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.449
 find the frozen goods beautiful like that 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.370
 crystal clear to know my opinion you have to 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.589
 Of course, knowledge goes on the glass 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.899
 cherries as we will have to 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.930
 the cinnamon stick aware of that 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.670
 not so together not in it is 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.890
 he is also great 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.469
 maybe in the summer you can get out too 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.469
 but at the same time as you magna 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.550
 then I said that the juice was perfect 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.460
 actually does not give one 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.420
 connector and church wine leaves 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.079
 Of course, good with red wine 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.219
 replace 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.379
 Of course you can have one for children 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:09.789
 is still purely a church nektar take 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.350
 of course just as easily cultivated sugar 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.659
 is my personal preference I think 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.280
 Just have him a little bit more character 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.069
 and to set it up a bit 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.020
 stronger equal alternative would be natural 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:23.409
 also possible okay we start and that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.310
 given 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.920
 from the kirschneck as most in it 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.939
 I need a little bit right away 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.149
 after that, most of it ends at the end 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.560
 Recognized to stir water also use 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.909
 is the Kirchweihen it comes to the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.110
 taste and not that of alcohol 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.850
 inside is cinnamon stick and vanilla 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.479
 Milled could if the rod 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.070
 enter and the cane sugar 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.289
 We'll let that go through first 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.670
 Cooking also has a reason for that 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.740
 was thanks to the cinnamon sticks 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.390
 that should give a nice taste 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.310
 have the same with the churches cook 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.350
 are the churches soft to we cook it 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.210
 now better so 23 minutes already 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.210
 times before Europe spreads nicely 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.599
 that's nice, now comes churches 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:16.560
 in and they have to go back now 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.560
 Boil once 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.810
 a teaspoon of starch from cornstarch 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.209
 just the stronger the kripo in borken 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:32.349
 is that we are now stirring with one 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:34.560
 and then bind ver so that the 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.000
 church 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.790
 first live in from one 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.790
 Eject after look if it gets 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.610
 the other half will give you two 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.710
 teaspoons the exact recipe of the infobox 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.600
 that in the link to my homepage 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.040
 Strache must burst open yet 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.590
 now they have tied up nicely to that 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.300
 the master is it will fit too 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.880
 always so wild I always a bit 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.440
 The churches should help in a different way 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.110
 sometimes a little more 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.390
 a little less than two teaspoons 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.740
 three teaspoons well and valleys area 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.790
 relatively large is okay that's all 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.080
 simple thing super delicious 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.480
 what did you like again and now 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.220
 runs that I am now at the weapons 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.970
 will appear in the next few days 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.370
 take a look 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.980
 we both make a vegan waffle 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.180
 also a weapon on a cash basis or with 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.430
 Schmand I think that's also very much 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.800
 delicious and I'm always happy about one 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.460
 icon will share until very soon 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.460
 here in the canal
