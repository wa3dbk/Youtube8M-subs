00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.820
 who I am 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.950
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.630
 review more than one character this time 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.580
 from shinji kagawa little by little we go 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.130
 finishing this equipment that I used to 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.960
 these two characters and like baseball the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.119
 Japanese that arrived at Manchester United 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.860
 coming from borussia dormund was from 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.970
 the first pearls that came out of 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.530
 dortmund that when I do not believe or believe 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.090
 that I was not even reus for 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.910
 things is an idea and well there you go the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.800
 physical attributes is very good in the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.020
 numbers but I really did not like 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.880
 in the field has very little force like 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.309
 you know there are things that have very 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.410
 low and good this is the example 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.030
 perfect how not to use a player 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.670
 bright ahead of one not 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.379
 bright for the explains massa and as 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.030
 You see merge our page of coins 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.699
 as always the most reliable the cheapest 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.879
 I leave a link in the description to the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.620
 page with a discount code and how 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.910
 he said is the perfect example for not 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.700
 use a mc or a bright player for 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.150
 in front of a non-bright one will use the syndic 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.740
 water ahead of bruijn is a crime 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.930
 totally and good then in the game 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.990
 you see it and it seems fast, even though it marks 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.670
 good goals with him as you are seeing 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.920
 It seems fast and so on but it's that I do not 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.380
 the truth appeared so quickly that 29 of 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.200
 force or 20 or 30 something whatever is 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.390
 note very much and good still seems to me 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
 a good game creator I think that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.080
 distributes the ball very well but for 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.170
 nothing is the player who shined in the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.119
 borussia dortmund and I do not think it deserves 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.830
 it's worth having it on the computer unless it's 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.140
 that you like this player very much to me 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.670
 I really like the truth is still like that 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.310
 good is a good player is a player 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.020
 Skillful has good shot has such but 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.350
 there are much better players in their 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.149
 position and I think that he is not a player 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.770
 first level right now at least 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.720
 in this ultimate team and it looks like 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.909
 than in the next one, not since 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.920
 is shining a lot in the manchester 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.630
 united is actually spent on money that 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.989
 they would not have to spend on people like 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.540
 kill and well then it does not have no 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.220
 good looks the future of kagawa in the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.260
 Manchester United and see what I like 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.080
 I love both united and kagawa 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.000
 but freezing and as they said in a 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.070
 hashtag on twitter because for 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.840
 I see it shining though you never know 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.820
 you never know but the truth is that 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.740
 I see and in the game, well, that's a 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.750
 good player but nothing else is not the 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.540
 better of that character will it happen to me 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.470
 history of this series there you have it 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.680
 chemistry a tad low by the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.720
 nationality and the rest so good but 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.400
 It is not the best you are going to find 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.470
 I said it, I hope you liked it 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.540
 see you in the next video other of 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.830
 it's crack we follow you with the series we're going 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 Let's see how it goes bye bye 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 if not carried bad
