00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.430 
needs to have a sound it really speaks
to<00:01:13.050> you<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:14.240> when<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
to you and you want when you go in the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.020 
to you and you want when you go in the
morning<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.800> play<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.190> instrument<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.760> open

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
morning to play the instrument you open

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
morning to play the instrument you open
the<00:01:18.090> case<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.350> want<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the case and you're like you want to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
the case and you're like you want to
play<00:01:19.800> it<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.970> connection

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
play it because you have that connection

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.990 
play it because you have that connection
to<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.920> hard<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> describe<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to it so it's it's hard to describe and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.870 
to it so it's it's hard to describe and
I<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:24.540> feel<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.900> hopefully<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.369> when<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
I I feel like hopefully I know it when I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.980 
I I feel like hopefully I know it when I
when<00:01:27.300> I<00:01:27.330> find<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> having<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.810> good

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
when I find it but just to having a good

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.840 
when I find it but just to having a good
instrument<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.619> enough<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.670> live

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
instrument is not enough because we live
