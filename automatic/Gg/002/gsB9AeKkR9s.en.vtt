00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
here I got a telescope eyed calico

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.870 
here I got a telescope eyed calico
goldfish<00:00:32.579> over<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.780> range<00:00:33.989> ooh

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
goldfish over here I got a range ooh

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:43.040 
goldfish over here I got a range ooh
okay<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:37.550> basically<00:00:39.260> tank<00:00:40.260> size<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.719> 20

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
okay so basically tank size this is a 20

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.299 
okay so basically tank size this is a 20
gallon<00:00:43.170> tank<00:00:44.930> two<00:00:45.930> goldfish<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> 20<00:00:47.160> on

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.650 
think it's too small um basically the
ideal<00:00:54.920> ideal<00:00:55.920> requirements<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.000> keeping<00:00:57.480> old

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

tails that a regular common goldfish get

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.840 
tails that a regular common goldfish get
to<00:01:56.569> be<00:01:56.750> about<00:01:57.319> twelve<00:01:57.799> feet<00:01:57.920> they're<00:01:58.610> twelve

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850

to be about twelve feet they're twelve
inches<00:01:59.149> long<00:01:59.409> about<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.469> foot<00:02:00.709> long<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:02.469> maybe

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
inches long about a foot long so maybe

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.709
