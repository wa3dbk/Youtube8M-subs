and this guy right here certainly fits

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.719 
and this guy right here certainly fits
that<00:05:58.240> we<00:05:59.229> don't<00:05:59.409> have<00:05:59.499> a<00:05:59.529> quarterback<00:05:59.919> who's

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
that we don't have a quarterback who's

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:08.879 
that we don't have a quarterback who's
their<00:06:00.909> quarterback<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:08.110> lineup<00:06:08.560> screen

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
their quarterback the lineup screen

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.950 
their quarterback the lineup screen
should<00:06:09.069> be<00:06:09.129> pretty<00:06:09.400> self-explanatory<00:06:09.969> if

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
should be pretty self-explanatory if

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.450 
should be pretty self-explanatory if
you'd<00:06:11.229> like<00:06:11.379> to<00:06:11.439> make<00:06:11.590> some<00:06:11.830> executive

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
you'd like to make some executive

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:24.360

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.969 

we<00:06:25.370> got<00:06:25.520> a<00:06:25.550> stud<00:06:25.879> offensive<00:06:26.509> line<00:06:26.770> pretty<00:06:27.770> good

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
we got a stud offensive line pretty good

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.629 
we got a stud offensive line pretty good
running<00:06:28.220> back<00:06:29.710> really<00:06:30.710> good<00:06:30.860> wide<00:06:31.069> receiver

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
one and a good tight end I think we're

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.760 
one and a good tight end I think we're
good<00:06:34.849> enough<00:06:35.120> I<00:06:38.259> think<00:06:39.259> our<00:06:39.379> teams<00:06:39.560> pretty

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
good enough I think our teams pretty

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.790 
good enough I think our teams pretty
good<00:06:40.039> we<00:06:40.729> got<00:06:40.849> a<00:06:40.879> pretty<00:06:41.060> strong<00:06:41.210> secondary<00:06:44.800> to

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800

good<00:06:46.009> safeties<00:06:46.550> to<00:06:46.789> good<00:06:46.970> cornerbacks<00:06:47.509> I

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
good safeties to good cornerbacks I

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.570 
good safeties to good cornerbacks I
think<00:06:47.960> we're<00:06:48.110> pretty<00:06:48.259> good<00:06:48.560> I<00:06:48.740> think<00:06:49.400> this

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
think we're pretty good I think this

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:58.059 
think we're pretty good I think this
team<00:06:49.759> going<00:06:49.970> to<00:06:50.090> be<00:06:50.180> good<00:06:50.389> I<00:06:56.770> think<00:06:57.770> my<00:06:57.860> team

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.069 
team going to be good I think my team

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.240 
team going to be good I think my team
before<00:06:58.250> was<00:06:58.639> better<00:06:58.909> I<00:06:59.060> uh
