00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.070
 hello friends of all readers this is the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.020
 review of the sony prs of 3 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 the new sonic ereader kindly 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.140
 he has given us to do his review 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.210
 and his assessment in general the first 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.539
 This reader's print is pretty 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.720
 positive has a fairly simple design 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.960
 but nice for the eye and also has 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.160
 a pretty good size since it goes into 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.580
 a hand and you can handle 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.629
 perfectly with just one hand and also 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.129
 the touch of the e-reader is pretty good 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:56.550
 although the e reader in the case is of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:59.309
 plastic that's a pretty plastic 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.730
 it has a pretty good feel to it 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.730
 hand 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.770
 the dream and prs t3 has a measured 16 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.150
 centimeters long by 10 9 wide and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.270
 It has a thickness of 13 13 centimeters 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:38.130
 weighs around 200 grams and has 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.650
 also a cover that we found 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.950
 allows and protects the e reader of 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.830
 unfortunate hits the screen of the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.900
 leaders of electronic ink has a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.970
 size of 6 inches and has a 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:58.280
 resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels apart 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.080
 of the touch screen has a keypad 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.810
 that in which we see the button towards 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.340
 forward and backward button 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.610
 start is the previous menu and more 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.880
 options or the equivalent to the button 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.350
 right to the right click of our 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.350
 computer with our mouse 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.550
 computer 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.870
 on the sides as you can see and on the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.890
 upper part 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.610
 the sony prs 3 has nothing in return 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.280
 the lower part we can find the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.000
 micro usb the output that communicates us the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.730
 rider with the computer the reset button 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.390
 and the power button off or on 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.390
 suspension 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.300
 and then if we remove by the part in the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.170
 back we remove 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.470
 the cover sleeve we can see that this leader 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.470
 bring 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.750
 the micro micro sd slot to expand the 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.720
 device memory the sony prs 3 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.660
 it has an internal memory of 2 gb but 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.730
 can be extended thanks to this to this 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.629
 micro sd slot 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.780
 then we also see something somewhat atypical in 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.569
 the e readers is having direct access 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.680
 to the battery of the reader to the battery 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.150
 own e-reader here as we see the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.799
 we got it 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.799
 in full view 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.520
 and it's something I already say is practical 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.560
 because it allows us to modify it when 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.450
 that when he gives us problems or when 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.430
 we want if we find one of greater 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.450
 capacity still on the sony's battery 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.330
 prs t3 we are not given an autonomy of a 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.790
 month and a half month depending on the use that 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.579
 let's give the rider 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:04.909
 on the other hand the sony prs 73 has a 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:08.000
 fast charge mode that in about 5 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.859
 approximately minutes allows us 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.829
 to be able to read an e-book where 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:16.039
 quietly and without having any 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:21.049
 autonomy problem besides the sony prs 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:24.350
 3 has in the nfc interface I think it 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:28.039
 called like that although I do not know now 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.120
 still in no any accessories or in 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.910
 no device that can allow 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.360
 use or that is compatible with this 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.360
 with this connection of sony prs t3 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:50.830
 so this is the physical part of 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.830
 leader of the new king of the sun 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680
 ah
