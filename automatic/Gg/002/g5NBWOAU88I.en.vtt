00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.500
 for this 20th test video dedicated to the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.410
 corsair m65 so that is the evolution of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.870
 the chord cm 60 he mouse of gamer so 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.040
 intended primarily for players and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.839
 to fps players 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 since you have under the thumb 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.939
 directly a big red button that is 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.439
 a button says ap the sniper buttons that 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.039
 actually allows when you hold it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.990
 depressed exchange and sensitivity 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 and when you release it the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.289
 sensitivity returns to normal so 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 this is a kind of small small switch 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.790
 which is rather practical when you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.700
 need to have a better one 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.040
 better sensitivity or more 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 accurate when you 're in the process of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.530
 aim for example a sniper or or 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.680
 when you want shot on the fly by 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 example so that's it according to according to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.219
 the tastes so that's what this 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.730
 mouse is made basically for 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.469
 the fps next you find the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 classic buttons so the two little ones 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.120
 buttons on top of this famous 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.369
 sniper button that are programmable via 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.729
 the driver that allow by default so 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.430
 to backtrack or roll 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 back before is a passage before in 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.600
 internet browsers for example 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 you also have on the top of buttons 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.049
 that allow you to increase or decrease 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 the sensitivity of the mouse you have 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.650
 three programmable levels via the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.590
 pilot again and then you have 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.979
 7 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.280
 this wheel that is grant and who 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.950
 is flexible that is pretty sweet and ya 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.179
 no problem of using 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.770
 even at the level of the central click 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.289
 really nice so no problem at this 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 level there on the back side of the 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.420
 mouse finally on the belly of the mouse 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.969
 you have 5 skates that are 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.729
 very good bill which therefore ensures a 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.159
 good glide and three housing has 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.979
 unscrewed with a flat screwdriver that 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.390
 allow to remove weights that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.009
 are inside the small balls 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.989
 the small circles of weight of the rings 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.000
 which allows you to adjust to your 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:02.649
 convenience the weight of this mouse is 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.539
 to balance the rigor since you 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.049
 have they are are placed at three 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.670
 different places 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.259
 so you can balance the wish 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.509
 as you hear it so that's 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.340
 rather nice from corsair and 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.110
 then to finish on two passages on 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.610
 the physical side of the mouse you have 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.040
 an aluminum frame that is at the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.750
 once robust and lightweight so it's very 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.280
 nice and then you have a nice diodes 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.170
 bright which is so powerful 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.390
 that in the night it's not much limit 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.040
 light up so it does not bother you in May 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.889
 but it's pretty funny and then these 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.109
 are fr seem against you do not 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:34.900
 can not change the color of the 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:38.079
 diode vial two pilots it's a 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.609
 small point to remember at the level of 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.980
 performance you have a sensor of 8 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.380
 1200 dpi so a little bit better than 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.819
 that of the n60 allows us to have a 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.329
 better sensitivity better 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.120
 precision well general precision of the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.169
 mouse whether you use it or not 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.510
 8200 spite since it's a sensor 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.230
 of a new generation part of 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.099
 superior performance 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.210
 so here at the global level it is 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.490
 a mouse that is earlier 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.010
 easy to handle a good 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.070
 slip that good performance 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.080
 the only big negative for me 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.300
 is that left clicks and clicks 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.250
 right right let's talk about are way too much 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.920
 sensitive 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.570
 I tended to click by mistake 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.150
 in fps when I was supposed to be 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.260
 stashed in deus ex for example so that's 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.090
 it's not practical you get used to 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.830
 but it's still pretty enough 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.000
 disturbing at first and you're going to have 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.740
 a little bit of trouble getting used to it so 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.680
 be careful he clicks are really 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.160
 sensitive to stiffness or 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.630
 a cseries or a repository where a 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.750
 rocket you have fiction really 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.980
 much more sensitive the rest there is 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.320
 not much to say it's a small 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.300
 braided cable that is very friendly and 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.700
 it is a balance by account of course 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.710
 right-handed like the majority of mice 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.360
 laments bigot progress in both 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.630
 expensive levels so 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.950
 so here's well here's well listen if you 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.780
 have questions you have my test 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.520
 written that is much more accurate otherwise 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.470
 you can always asked questions 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.140
 on in the comments of this video 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.910
 thank you for watching and lows 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.440
 it's listening to this video and then 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.440
 well soon for a new video test
