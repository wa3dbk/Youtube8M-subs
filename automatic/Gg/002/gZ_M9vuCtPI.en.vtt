on this with the singing on the album

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.739 
on this with the singing on the album
it's<00:00:14.920> just<00:00:15.160> that<00:00:15.250> it's<00:00:15.790> it's<00:00:16.359> literally<00:00:16.599> like

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:16.749 
it's just that it's it's literally like

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.630 
it's just that it's it's literally like
every<00:00:17.050> course<00:00:17.289> it<00:00:17.679> just<00:00:17.980> is<00:00:18.189> something

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
every course it just is something

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.950 
every course it just is something
totally<00:00:18.759> different<00:00:19.089> and<00:00:19.329> something<00:00:19.599> totally

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
totally different and something totally

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.200 
totally different and something totally
new<00:00:19.989> it's<00:00:20.859> almost<00:00:20.980> like<00:00:21.189> every<00:00:21.550> song<00:00:21.789> has<00:00:21.999> its

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
new it's almost like every song has its

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.700 
new it's almost like every song has its
own<00:00:22.359> thing<00:00:22.630> and<00:00:22.810> any<00:00:22.960> one<00:00:23.140> of<00:00:23.199> them<00:00:23.349> could<00:00:23.529> be<00:00:23.679> a

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
own thing and any one of them could be a

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.649 
own thing and any one of them could be a
single<00:00:24.099> I<00:00:24.279> guess<00:00:24.789> it's<00:00:24.970> not<00:00:25.119> very<00:00:25.329> scientific

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:25.659 
single I guess it's not very scientific

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.479 
single I guess it's not very scientific
and<00:00:26.230> it<00:00:26.380> doesn't<00:00:26.560> sound<00:00:26.769> very<00:00:26.980> cool<00:00:27.249> at<00:00:27.369> all

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
and it doesn't sound very cool at all

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.969 
and it doesn't sound very cool at all
but<00:00:27.849> generally<00:00:28.599> like<00:00:28.899> when<00:00:29.349> you<00:00:29.529> come<00:00:29.739> when

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:29.979 
but generally like when you come when

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.829 
but generally like when you come when
Steve<00:00:30.220> comes<00:00:30.489> to<00:00:30.579> me<00:00:30.699> with<00:00:30.849> a<00:00:30.880> vocal<00:00:31.300> idea<00:00:31.569> I

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
Steve comes to me with a vocal idea I

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.380 
Steve comes to me with a vocal idea I
just<00:00:32.559> played<00:00:33.250> around<00:00:33.399> in<00:00:33.609> my<00:00:33.699> head<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:34.120> like

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
just played around in my head and like

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.319 
just played around in my head and like
think<00:00:35.350> if<00:00:35.469> it<00:00:35.590> see<00:00:36.430> like<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.730> sticking<00:00:37.180> power

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
think if it see like the sticking power

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.209 
think if it see like the sticking power
of<00:00:37.660> it<00:00:37.780> if<00:00:37.989> that<00:00:38.140> makes<00:00:38.199> any<00:00:38.469> sense<00:00:38.620> like<00:00:39.039> is

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
of it if that makes any sense like is

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.099 
of it if that makes any sense like is
this<00:00:39.609> something<00:00:40.030> that<00:00:40.059> would<00:00:40.420> get<00:00:40.629> stuck<00:00:40.929> in

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
this something that would get stuck in

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.660 
this something that would get stuck in
my<00:00:41.140> head<00:00:41.469> beta<00:00:42.160> diet<00:00:42.850> was<00:00:43.660> what<00:00:44.109> if<00:00:44.289> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
my head beta diet was what if you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.779 
my head beta diet was what if you
