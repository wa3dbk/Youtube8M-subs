00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
just create this nice little oddly

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.529 
just create this nice little oddly
shaped<00:00:27.689> cube<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.439> rectangle<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:30.119> Center<00:00:30.359> into

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
shaped cube a rectangle just Center into

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.069 
shaped cube a rectangle just Center into
the<00:00:30.630> world<00:00:31.189> okay<00:00:32.270> then<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.719> want<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> add

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the world okay then you just want to add

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.160 
the world okay then you just want to add
an<00:00:34.380> unwrap<00:00:34.920> UVW<00:00:35.250> modifier<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> can

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
an unwrap UVW modifier to this so it can

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
an unwrap UVW modifier to this so it can
just<00:00:37.559> change<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> UVs

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
just change the UVs

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.139 
just change the UVs
so<00:00:40.250> that<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.430> would<00:00:41.550> paint<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> doesn't

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so that one would paint it it doesn't

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
so that one would paint it it doesn't
all<00:00:42.329> screw<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.200> view<00:00:43.860> show<00:00:44.399> them<00:00:44.520> up

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.970 
all screw up some just view show them up
get<00:00:44.850> rid<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:45.210> view<00:00:45.719> show<00:00:46.020> grid<00:00:46.200> now<00:00:46.920> we

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
get rid of them view show grid now we

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.790 
get rid of them view show grid now we
can<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.370> we're<00:00:47.489> doing<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:49.590> just

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
can see what we're doing so I'm just

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.310 
can see what we're doing so I'm just
going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.010> select<00:00:50.219> all<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:50.730> faces<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.420> so

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
going to select all these faces now so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.950 
going to select all these faces now so
now<00:00:52.949> selected<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.940> faces<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.660> cube

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
now selected all the faces of our cube

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.979 
now selected all the faces of our cube
so<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> should<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.980> six<00:00:56.190> paces<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:57.719> want<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so that should be six paces you want to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.040 
so that should be six paces you want to
flatten<00:00:58.430> these<00:00:59.430> faces<00:00:59.910> these<00:01:00.629> things<00:01:00.899> should

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
flatten these faces these things should

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.329 
flatten these faces these things should
be<00:01:01.140> okay<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.850> as<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:03.890> we've<00:01:04.890> done<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
be okay and as you can see we've done is

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.460 
be okay and as you can see we've done is
spread<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.820> our<00:01:06.229> six<00:01:07.229> spaces<00:01:07.740> across<00:01:09.470> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
spread out our six spaces across the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.880 
spread out our six spaces across the
area<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.460> pain<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.290> if<00:01:13.290> you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
area and that will be pain and if you

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.490 
area and that will be pain and if you
move<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.970> say<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.930> grab<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
move this out say if I was to grab this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.770 
move this out say if I was to grab this
and<00:01:16.770> screw<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.700> make<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> go

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
you'll notice is that you'll have a

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.110 
you'll notice is that you'll have a
layers<00:02:13.959> dialog<00:02:14.470> box<00:02:14.709> come<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.790> just

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
layers dialog box come up this is just

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.940 
layers dialog box come up this is just
like<00:02:16.269> in<00:02:16.450> Photoshop<00:02:16.599> pretty<00:02:17.230> much<00:02:17.379> maybe<00:02:17.769> you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
like in Photoshop pretty much maybe you

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.470 
like in Photoshop pretty much maybe you
can't<00:02:18.159> do<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.400> many<00:02:18.610> things<00:02:18.670> bent<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.239> you

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
can't do as many things bent but you

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.080 
can't do as many things bent but you
have<00:02:19.599> all<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.140> blending<00:02:20.440> modes<00:02:20.909> change<00:02:21.909> layer

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
have all the blending modes change layer

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.860 
have all the blending modes change layer
opacity<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:25.480> pretty<00:02:25.780> damn<00:02:25.930> good<00:02:26.340> useful

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
opacity and it's pretty damn good useful

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.520 
opacity and it's pretty damn good useful
so<00:02:28.870> at<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.799> minute<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:30.160> have<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.489> mask<00:02:30.700> enabled

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
so at the minute I have a mask enabled

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.559 
so at the minute I have a mask enabled
as<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:32.860> see<00:02:33.090> that's<00:02:34.090> because<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.450> was

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
as you can see that's because I was

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.030 
as you can see that's because I was
using<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.930> earlier<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.680> was<00:02:35.739> using<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
using it earlier and I was using the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.740 
using it earlier and I was using the
mask<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.489> salami<00:02:36.910> as<00:02:37.000> well<00:02:37.150> as<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.269> recent<00:02:37.540> Mac

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
mask and salami as well as a recent Mac

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.500
