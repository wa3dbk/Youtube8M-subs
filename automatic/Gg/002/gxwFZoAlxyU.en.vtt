00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.160
 we will deal with the most important aspects of this video 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.500
 private liability insurance private liability insurance had the floor 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 everyone probably belongs already consists of three words together 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.220
 Private 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.209
 liability and insurance 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.409
 I first have the judges 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.509
 what could become a liability now a us in Germany 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.869
 it so that I have a liability 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.869
 ยง 800 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.439
 23 GDP could not give you an idea 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.130
 7 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 and that is simplified now 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.880
 if you are someone else 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.990
 at the health 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.120
 or harming his property 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.179
 Yes, the prerequisite is 4 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.110
 a damage has occurred 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.070
 and this damage 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.089
 he also has to 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.570
 she lies down 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.570
 originated 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.880
 Tillich Thielsch 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
 Shaqiri a little later what it means 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.290
 In the end it is like that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.159
 have, too 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.159
 culpable must have arisen 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.640
 it means the one who caused the damage 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.790
 there must have been culpable 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.110
 especially as well 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.400
 if so 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.460
 then it's about damages 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.360
 and that's exactly what private liability insurance was for 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.700
 namely basically 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.540
 is this charm that originated here after 23 BGB 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.070
 Unlimited to replace the law thus provides no limit prescribed 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.520
 what he is now putting the insurance 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.890
 Vienna, for example, an object 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 broke down and that is what happens most often 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 At first the repair would be paid 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.900
 repair 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.390
 or if that is not possible 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.340
 and that is so often the case 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 but the present value of the item is replaced 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.020
 for the often to problems 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.080
 to free 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.090
 not 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.730
 the new phone that is damaged is replaced or the new notebook 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.349
 but only you replace it 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.899
 who grants them 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.779
 Dr at the time when the item was damaged also still exists 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:20.459
 was 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.349
 Jan often leads to trouble 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.980
 Apart from that, of course, will be compensation for pain under physical 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.069
 Damage also reaps the compensation claims resulting from it 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.870
 but sets 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.039
 important here 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.249
 take in May since then 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.729
 What is also important is that all this must take place in the private sphere 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.869
 to have 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.009
 no 1 can not exist for this 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.889
 between the participants 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.889
 and that is one 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.289
 the contract is not there for that 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.289
 and contracts are often closed without you noticing 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.049
 This can happen to me, for example. I borrow something from the corpse 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.279
 she is suffering a contract 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.539
 the rent that knows you might be his death 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.819
 But where it is again regularly trouble is 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.819
 at the danger 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.259
 For example, the danger of helping someone move 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.580
 can cause the private liability insurance in such a way 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.600
 Case not entrance 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.870
 that is annoying just for those 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.900
 who just wanted to help and then maybe they are in a situation 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.000
 Set a damage caused by it no idea the TV 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.800
 for example, it has fallen below 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 then you have to carry yourself 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:46.439
 we come to 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.920
 OM a two important points which also has a private news role 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.249
 play 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.840
 around and the hand 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.800
 pretty much the most frequently mentioned point of late in the last one 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.800
 Time that is sooner 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.129
 with the children 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.129
 and this is exactly where the difficulty lies 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:09.759
 the children 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.759
 who are under seven years old 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.179
 are not according to our law which is fetch 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:19.939
 if they do not see fit to take action 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:21.779
 then that means too 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.240
 that they are not even liable under ยง 8 23 BGB 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:27.169
 and that means too 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.240
 that the private liability insurance may also cover the 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.090
 Children do not insist 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.930
 yes, that can lead to curious situations 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.600
 the percent, for example, a child aged three years with his tricycle 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.039
 some scratches, for example, in a parked s-class in the 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:43.990
 neighborhood 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.120
 decorated the car 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.669
 what is possible 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.039
 but it is actually so similar for him too 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.860
 brilliant china shop was a child aged two or three or under 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.620
 makes something break seven years 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.580
 that our social community does not really want this 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.120
 Child he plays arrested and the presses are only then liable for 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.920
 a 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.080
 culpable commission 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.699
 but the parents did not do anything to me this moment 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.000
 but you have to understand it so that the parents already have strength year 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.999
 can act if they have violated their duty to supervise 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.089
 Well of course, parents say then quickly name only that have 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:25.470
 I hurt you and it's really like that too 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.570
 to assume a culpable violation of the duty of supervision here 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.720
 so gave Dr Federal Court said and has for it you can have a small child 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.410
 It can take more than half an hour to lose sight of what usually happens 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.180
 yes actually not fit so important here are children under 7 years 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.699
 not capable of delinquency 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.449
 these are often immensely higher now, so many of their beloved children 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.960
 may be included but be aware of the sting 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.639
 that's a problem 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.139
 Another problem that may arise in private liability is that 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.639
 eg also briefly mentioned 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.750
 an example 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.460
 Bahr 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.919
 Shield is like 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.139
 substantially 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.159
 maybe health 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.159
 AR Hatz no liability insurance 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.139
 d has a liability insurance 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.860
 you have an element now 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.639
 that I call failure coverage in their own personal liability insurance covers them 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.360
 Example of liability insurance of the BN 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.969
 would the liability insurance of the BBI for the damage occur 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.849
 "If Allah can not afford 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.569
 Jan that even roughly summarized copy one should pay attention to it 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.480
 There is also one more two points to notice 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.069
 that should be 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:47.199
 for example, percent 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.279
 with property damage 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:50.110
 also the 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.069
 are in modern policies 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.039
 to insure with 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.039
 So leased things should be insured 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:01.749
 especially if you have the big one 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.229
 Apartment buildings living 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.650
 It may also be percent that may be needed 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
 Key damage 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.139
 key 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:21.309
 should be insured with the locks must be replaced 

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:23.379
 It can be quite expensive stuff 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:24.860
 now these are 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.270
 from my point of view the most important things in the 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.599
 private liability insurance must be observed 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:31.409
 around 

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.849
 Here it is also quite necessary first of all a price comparison to 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.330
 Just look at what percentage costs such a contract now 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.510
 Now I sing Binder Camus to be cheaper 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.919
 around 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.449
 here these points in particular the last ones bring one already 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:46.210
 quite wide
