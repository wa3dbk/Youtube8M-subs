correctly<00:02:21.070> aligned<00:02:21.250> I'm<00:02:21.700> not<00:02:21.880> sure<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
correctly aligned I'm not sure the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.630 
correctly aligned I'm not sure the
overall<00:02:22.900> animation<00:02:23.650> may<00:02:23.770> not<00:02:23.950> be<00:02:24.100> great<00:02:24.310> but

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
overall animation may not be great but

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.230 
overall animation may not be great but
the<00:02:25.300> colors<00:02:25.660> are<00:02:26.380> uplifting<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.430> I'll<00:02:27.880> say<00:02:28.120> the
