00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
with what i was saying there will think

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.940 
with what i was saying there will think
about<00:05:13.970> it<00:05:14.120> but<00:05:14.449> in<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.840> end<00:05:14.930> played<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.830> wrap

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.890 

the<00:05:19.550> great<00:05:19.760> thing<00:05:19.790> about<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.360> combination

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
between wine ups and injectors is that

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.160 
between wine ups and injectors is that
your<00:05:25.340> opponent<00:05:25.610> can't<00:05:26.270> win<00:05:26.480> whether<00:05:26.960> they

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
your opponent can't win whether they

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.960 
your opponent can't win whether they
hold<00:05:27.980> their<00:05:28.190> hand<00:05:28.370> they're<00:05:28.580> going<00:05:28.700> to<00:05:28.790> lose<00:05:28.940> it
