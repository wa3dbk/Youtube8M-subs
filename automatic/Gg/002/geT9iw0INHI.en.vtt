00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
okay folks so that right there is a free

thing<00:00:08.809> that<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.320> finally<00:00:10.860> got<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.370> work<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.740> it

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
thing that I finally got to work and it

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.120 
thing that I finally got to work and it
was<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.460> lot<00:00:14.639> harder<00:00:15.000> than<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.809> thought

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
was a lot harder than I thought

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.120 
was a lot harder than I thought
I<00:00:17.750> used<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.960> design<00:00:19.560> by<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> guy<00:00:20.970> named<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.480> blade

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130

if<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.219> put<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.570> magnet<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> then

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
if you put a magnet on that and then

coil<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> wire<00:00:41.399> around<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.540> would

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
coil a wire around it now you would

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200 
coil a wire around it now you would
generate<00:00:43.110> electricity<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.879> ran<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
generate electricity or if you ran it

you<00:01:33.420> notice<00:01:33.659> mine<00:01:33.900> doesn't<00:01:34.140> make<00:01:34.409> any<00:01:34.590> noise

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you notice mine doesn't make any noise

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.700 
you notice mine doesn't make any noise
because<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.670> put<00:01:36.210> enough<00:01:36.420> clearance<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
because I put enough clearance on this

much<00:02:03.990> better<00:02:04.340> design<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.210> wanted<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> stay

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
much better design but I wanted to stay

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.669 
much better design but I wanted to stay

with this very simple design as the FIR
one<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.459> like<00:02:11.299> I<00:02:11.450> say<00:02:11.659> it's<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.170> took<00:02:12.439> a<00:02:12.469> while

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
one and like I say it's it took a while

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.009 
one and like I say it's it took a while
to<00:02:12.769> get<00:02:13.159> this<00:02:13.340> right<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.969> have<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.299> have<00:02:14.329> the

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
to get this right you have to have the

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.959 
to get this right you have to have the
correct<00:02:15.379> amount<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.859> weight<00:02:16.129> up<00:02:16.400> here<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.909> I

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:16.969 
correct amount of weight up here and I

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.699 
correct amount of weight up here and I
used<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.450> C<00:02:17.689> cell<00:02:17.959> battery

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
used a C cell battery

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.750 
used a C cell battery
he<00:02:19.370> used<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.909> varying<00:02:20.390> weights<00:02:21.230> up<00:02:21.560> here<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.370> he

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
he used a varying weights up here and he

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.640 
he used a varying weights up here and he
got<00:02:22.879> much<00:02:23.150> better<00:02:23.359> response<00:02:23.959> he<00:02:24.200> also<00:02:24.349> had<00:02:24.620> a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
got much better response he also had a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.610 
got much better response he also had a
longer<00:02:25.099> much<00:02:26.090> longer<00:02:26.120> engine<00:02:27.049> with<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> longer

longer much longer engine with a longer
displacer<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.700> he<00:02:30.310> he<00:02:31.310> has<00:02:31.459> done<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.730> number<00:02:32.060> of

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
displacer and he he has done a number of

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.670 
displacer and he he has done a number of
things<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.750> here<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.049> make<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.409> more

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
things in here to make this more

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.420 
things in here to make this more
efficient

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
efficient

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.550 
efficient
he's<00:02:34.939> also<00:02:35.120> connected<00:02:35.689> this<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.019> flywheel

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
he's also connected this to a flywheel

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.910 
he's also connected this to a flywheel
mechanism<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.400> make<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.609> wheel<00:02:37.939> go<00:02:38.209> around<00:02:38.569> but

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
mechanism to make a wheel go around but

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.530 
mechanism to make a wheel go around but
this<00:02:39.920> was<00:02:40.159> what<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.430> wanted<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.939> do<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.389> get

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
this was what I wanted to do is get

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.429 
this was what I wanted to do is get
something<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.200> run<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:43.370> was<00:02:44.030> very<00:02:44.419> simple<00:02:44.989> in

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
something to run that was very simple in

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.800 
something to run that was very simple in
your<00:02:45.620> kitchen<00:02:45.919> and<00:02:46.489> I'd<00:02:47.090> like<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.359> say<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:47.750> is

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
your kitchen and I'd like to say this is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.140 
your kitchen and I'd like to say this is
a<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.319> is<00:02:48.590> what<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.769> came<00:02:49.040> up<00:02:49.250> with<00:02:49.280> here<00:02:49.790> and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
a this is what I came up with here and

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.479 
a this is what I came up with here and
this<00:02:50.870> battery<00:02:51.379> was<00:02:52.069> attached<00:02:52.639> with<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:54.489> magnet

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
this battery was attached with a magnet

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.339 
this battery was attached with a magnet
to<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.879> top<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.389> dysplasia<00:02:56.840> notice<00:02:57.200> how

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
to the top of that dysplasia notice how

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.190 
to the top of that dysplasia notice how
it's<00:02:57.530> concave<00:02:58.129> now<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.389> a<00:02:59.419> sealed<00:02:59.870> unit

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
it's concave now this is a sealed unit

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.679 
it's concave now this is a sealed unit
this<00:03:01.040> thing<00:03:01.370> here<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:01.939> this<00:03:02.359> is<00:03:02.480> what<00:03:02.659> I

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
this thing here and this is what I

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.979 
this thing here and this is what I
wanted<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.349> wanted<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.799> sealed<00:03:04.219> system<00:03:04.689> that<00:03:05.689> was

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
wanted I wanted a sealed system that was

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.679 
wanted I wanted a sealed system that was
hermetically<00:03:06.680> sealed<00:03:07.159> now<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:08.209> one<00:03:08.659> that's

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
hermetically sealed now the one that's

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.959 
hermetically sealed now the one that's
used<00:03:09.109> in<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.439> Coleman<00:03:09.859> refrigerator<00:03:10.489> they

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:10.969 
used in the Coleman refrigerator they

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.240 
used in the Coleman refrigerator they
use<00:03:11.150> helium<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.709> they<00:03:12.799> pressurize

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
use helium and that they pressurize

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.969 
use helium and that they pressurize
helium<00:03:13.879> for<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.150> refrigerant<00:03:14.780> but<00:03:15.409> the<00:03:15.590> idea

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:15.979 
helium for the refrigerant but the idea

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:21.119 
helium for the refrigerant but the idea
was<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.519> this<00:03:16.790> was<00:03:17.150> if<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:19.329> vibrated<00:03:20.329> this

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
was on this was if you vibrated this

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.729 
was on this was if you vibrated this
just<00:03:22.129> right<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:23.510> would<00:03:23.780> get<00:03:23.930> cold<00:03:24.349> down<00:03:24.680> here

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
just right this would get cold down here

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.089 
just right this would get cold down here
at<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.129> bottom<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.729> that's<00:03:26.269> how<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:27.099> Coleman

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
at the bottom and that's how the Coleman

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.899 
at the bottom and that's how the Coleman
Stirling<00:03:28.639> engines<00:03:29.439> twin<00:03:30.439> bird<00:03:30.769> from<00:03:31.430> Japan

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
Stirling engines twin bird from Japan

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.059 
Stirling engines twin bird from Japan
Stirling<00:03:32.479> engine<00:03:32.810> works<00:03:33.079> as<00:03:33.319> they<00:03:33.470> vibrate

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
Stirling engine works as they vibrate

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.860 
Stirling engine works as they vibrate
this<00:03:34.400> at<00:03:34.729> a<00:03:34.760> high<00:03:35.000> frequency

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
this at a high frequency

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.670 
this at a high frequency
and<00:03:35.959> then<00:03:36.859> that<00:03:37.220> sets<00:03:37.699> up<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.629> dynamic<00:03:39.470> in

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
and then that sets up this dynamic in

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.640 
and then that sets up this dynamic in
the<00:03:39.829> Stirling<00:03:40.310> engine<00:03:40.629> backwards<00:03:41.629> and<00:03:41.959> it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
the Stirling engine backwards and it

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.559 
the Stirling engine backwards and it
cools<00:03:42.919> this<00:03:43.430> part<00:03:43.729> of<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:44.000> Stirling<00:03:44.419> engine

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
cools this part of the Stirling engine

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.689 
cools this part of the Stirling engine
and<00:03:45.169> this<00:03:45.739> is<00:03:45.919> what<00:03:46.099> really<00:03:46.370> really

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
and this is what really really

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.699 
and this is what really really
interested<00:03:47.359> me<00:03:47.389> about<00:03:47.509> the<00:03:47.900> Stirling<00:03:48.290> engines

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
interested me about the Stirling engines

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.399 
interested me about the Stirling engines
is<00:03:48.919> they're<00:03:49.220> very<00:03:49.250> very<00:03:49.780> efficient<00:03:50.780> they<00:03:51.379> are

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
is they're very very efficient they are

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.379 
is they're very very efficient they are
not<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:52.069> same<00:03:53.889> cycle<00:03:54.889> that<00:03:55.669> a<00:03:55.729> refrigerant

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
not the same cycle that a refrigerant

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.550 
not the same cycle that a refrigerant
uses<00:03:57.430> this<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.639> a<00:03:58.669> different<00:03:59.299> type<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.569> system

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
uses this is a different type of system

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.890 
uses this is a different type of system
than<00:04:01.430> what's<00:04:01.639> normally<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.209> refrigerator

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
than what's normally in a refrigerator

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.349 
than what's normally in a refrigerator
so<00:04:03.139> that's<00:04:04.099> where<00:04:04.370> I'm<00:04:04.459> at<00:04:04.609> right<00:04:04.669> now<00:04:04.909> and

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
so that's where I'm at right now and

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.449 
so that's where I'm at right now and
like<00:04:05.509> I<00:04:05.629> say<00:04:05.840> right<00:04:06.109> here<00:04:06.470> this<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:06.889> a<00:04:06.919> piece<00:04:07.250> of

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
like I say right here this is a piece of

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.939 
like I say right here this is a piece of
wet<00:04:07.609> paper<00:04:07.849> towel<00:04:08.239> there's<00:04:09.199> a<00:04:09.290> joint<00:04:09.739> between

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
wet paper towel there's a joint between

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.649 
wet paper towel there's a joint between
the<00:04:10.189> two<00:04:10.340> cams<00:04:10.879> you<00:04:11.150> know<00:04:11.299> they're<00:04:11.540> two

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
the two cams you know they're two

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.960 
the two cams you know they're two
different<00:04:11.810> colors<00:04:12.349> once<00:04:13.220> inside<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.819> other

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
different colors once inside the other

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.180 
different colors once inside the other
very<00:04:14.269> similar<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.720> my<00:04:14.870> little<00:04:15.109> alcohol<00:04:15.769> stoves

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
very similar to my little alcohol stoves

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.149 
very similar to my little alcohol stoves
they're<00:04:16.970> taped<00:04:17.299> together<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.930> make<00:04:18.349> it<00:04:18.529> sealed

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.159 
they're taped together to make it sealed

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.570 
they're taped together to make it sealed
and<00:04:19.489> then<00:04:19.909> when<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.870> gets<00:04:21.079> hot<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:22.250> gets

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and then when this gets hot this gets

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.320 
and then when this gets hot this gets
into<00:04:23.000> a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
into a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.610 
into a
vibration<00:04:24.099> and<00:04:25.099> that<00:04:25.669> can<00:04:25.819> be<00:04:26.620> transmitted

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
vibration and that can be transmitted

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.890 
vibration and that can be transmitted
into<00:04:27.979> a<00:04:28.159> bell<00:04:28.610> crank<00:04:28.879> system<00:04:29.060> for<00:04:29.479> a<00:04:29.509> wheel<00:04:29.720> if

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
into a bell crank system for a wheel if

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.020 
into a bell crank system for a wheel if
you<00:04:30.020> want<00:04:30.259> to<00:04:30.470> or<00:04:30.949> you<00:04:30.979> can<00:04:31.490> run<00:04:31.669> it<00:04:31.789> backwards

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
you want to or you can run it backwards

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.059 
you want to or you can run it backwards
like<00:04:32.599> I<00:04:32.659> saying<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.169> can<00:04:33.319> cool<00:04:33.560> down<00:04:33.590> the

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
like I saying you can cool down the

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.760 
like I saying you can cool down the
bottom<00:04:34.370> part<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:34.699> this<00:04:34.879> so<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:36.199> is<00:04:36.409> something

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
bottom part of this so this is something

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.939 
bottom part of this so this is something
that<00:04:36.949> I<00:04:36.979> wanted<00:04:37.699> to<00:04:38.060> get<00:04:38.870> as<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.080> first<00:04:39.379> step<00:04:39.620> and

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
that I wanted to get as a first step and

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.439 
that I wanted to get as a first step and
go<00:04:40.909> from<00:04:41.120> there<00:04:41.389> but<00:04:42.129> this<00:04:43.129> was<00:04:43.340> hard<00:04:43.580> this

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
go from there but this was hard this

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.589 
go from there but this was hard this
took<00:04:44.659> three<00:04:44.689> or<00:04:45.139> four<00:04:45.379> days<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:46.449> get<00:04:47.449> this

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
took three or four days to get this

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.330 
took three or four days to get this
sorted<00:04:47.960> out<00:04:48.110> this<00:04:48.439> was<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.740> most<00:04:48.889> critical

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
sorted out this was the most critical

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.379 
sorted out this was the most critical
thing<00:04:49.520> here<00:04:49.759> is<00:04:49.819> you<00:04:49.909> have<00:04:49.939> to<00:04:50.150> have<00:04:50.180> the

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
thing here is you have to have the

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.809 
thing here is you have to have the
lightweight<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:51.650> tension<00:04:52.039> on<00:04:52.159> the<00:04:52.189> diaphragm

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
lightweight the tension on the diaphragm

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.730 
lightweight the tension on the diaphragm
has<00:04:52.849> to<00:04:53.240> be<00:04:53.360> light<00:04:53.569> the<00:04:53.810> pressure<00:04:54.080> inside<00:04:54.560> the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
has to be light the pressure inside the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.730 
has to be light the pressure inside the
vessel<00:04:54.770> has<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.460> be<00:04:55.580> right<00:04:56.139> this<00:04:57.139> distance

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
vessel has to be right this distance

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.360 
vessel has to be right this distance
here<00:04:58.159> has<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.610> be<00:04:58.639> correct<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.860> not<00:05:00.860> an<00:05:01.129> easy

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
here has to be correct so not an easy

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.059 
here has to be correct so not an easy
project<00:05:02.229> but<00:05:03.229> it's<00:05:03.349> something<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:03.770> wanted

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
project but it's something that I wanted

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.159 
project but it's something that I wanted
to<00:05:04.159> do<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:04.610> I<00:05:05.150> think<00:05:05.210> this<00:05:05.569> gentleman<00:05:05.810> right

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
to do and I think this gentleman right

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.860 
to do and I think this gentleman right
