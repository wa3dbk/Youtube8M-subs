00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
that I saw at one of my local shops and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.490 
that I saw at one of my local shops and
the<00:03:10.490> suede<00:03:10.790> was<00:03:11.120> just<00:03:11.360> terrible<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.080> felt<00:03:12.320> like

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
the suede was just terrible it felt like

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.600 
the suede was just terrible it felt like
my<00:03:13.280> cam<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:13.760> pretty<00:03:14.000> much<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.360> was<00:03:14.450> super<00:03:14.780> rough

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
my cam is pretty much it was super rough

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.280 
my cam is pretty much it was super rough
super<00:03:16.610> gr<00:03:16.970> quality<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.959> think<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.260> really

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
super gr quality so I think it really

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.840 
super gr quality so I think it really
just<00:03:18.560> depends<00:03:18.890> on<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.130> pair<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:19.610> get

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.500 
just depends on the pair that you get
but<00:03:20.420> don't<00:03:20.930> really<00:03:21.140> expect<00:03:21.410> anything<00:03:21.709> special

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
but don't really expect anything special
