Kangaskhan he's got a fake out coming
somewhere<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
somewhere here I don't really want to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.800 
somewhere here I don't really want to
take<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.909> Thunderbolt<00:01:39.360> though<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.689> I'm

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
take that Thunderbolt though so I'm

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
take that Thunderbolt though so I'm
gonna<00:01:39.930> switch<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.560> Gyarados<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.430> for

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
gonna switch out on Gyarados and go for

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.230 
gonna switch out on Gyarados and go for
will-o'-wisp<00:01:42.770> he's<00:01:43.770> probably<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.759> thought<00:01:45.149> he

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
will-o'-wisp he's probably I thought he

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.429 
will-o'-wisp he's probably I thought he
was<00:01:45.329> probably<00:01:45.420> gonna<00:01:45.689> figure<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:45.930> Rotom<00:01:46.320> but

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
was probably gonna figure out Rotom but

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.569 
was probably gonna figure out Rotom but
I<00:01:46.500> figured<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.860> could<00:01:46.890> take<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
I figured I could take it with you the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.160 
I figured I could take it with you the
minus<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.060> anyway<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> new

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
minus one anyway and I can get a new

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.149 
minus one anyway and I can get a new
switch<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.770> get<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.040> better

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
switch in so I can get in better

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.460 
switch in so I can get in better
positioning<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.659> goes<00:01:51.689> Gyarados<00:01:52.229> there's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
positioning so out goes Gyarados there's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.990 
positioning so out goes Gyarados there's
Conkeldurr<00:01:52.829> assault<00:01:53.189> best<00:01:53.399> mind<00:01:53.640> juice<00:01:53.880> so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
Conkeldurr assault best mind juice so

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.999 
Conkeldurr assault best mind juice so
it's<00:01:54.119> gonna<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.450> should<00:01:54.720> eat<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.170> special

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it's gonna it should eat up special

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:56.870 
it's gonna it should eat up special
attacks<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.460> champ

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
attacks like a champ

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.120 
attacks like a champ
that's<00:01:57.450> HP<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.110> he<00:01:58.409> definitely<00:01:58.619> thought<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.950> was

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that's HP is he definitely thought I was

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.550 
that's HP is he definitely thought I was
switching<00:01:59.310> into<00:01:59.549> Garchomp<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.350> fights

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
switching into Garchomp so the fights

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.510 
switching into Garchomp so the fights
which<00:02:01.710> didn't<00:02:01.890> guard<00:02:02.009> shot<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.340> would<00:02:02.430> have

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
which didn't guard shot that would have

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.010 
which didn't guard shot that would have
been<00:02:02.610> bad<00:02:02.729> obviously<00:02:03.119> thought<00:02:03.540> Thunderbolt

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
been bad obviously thought Thunderbolt

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.520 
been bad obviously thought Thunderbolt
was<00:02:04.110> coming

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
was coming

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
was coming
so<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.009> was<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.219> predicted<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.149> little

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
so that was he predicted there little

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.389 
so that was he predicted there little
over<00:02:06.600> prediction<00:02:06.990> thankfully<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
over prediction thankfully and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.010 
over prediction thankfully and
calculator<00:02:08.819> takes<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.149> pretty<00:02:09.479> well<00:02:09.599> now

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
calculator takes that pretty well now

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.029 
calculator takes that pretty well now
I'm<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> pretty<00:02:10.379> good<00:02:10.440> position<00:02:10.590> he's<00:02:10.920> at

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
I'm in a pretty good position he's at

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.430 
I'm in a pretty good position he's at
minus<00:02:11.250> 1<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:12.390> want<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.629> think

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
minus 1 I don't want I think

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.840 
minus 1 I don't want I think
punching<00:02:13.680> kangas<00:02:13.890> comes<00:02:14.070> too<00:02:14.220> obvious<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:14.640> I'm

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
punching kangas comes too obvious so I'm

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.280 
punching kangas comes too obvious so I'm
gonna<00:02:15.000> go<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.330> will-o-wisp<00:02:15.690> on<00:02:15.870> kangaskhan

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
gonna go for a will-o-wisp on kangaskhan

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.960 
gonna go for a will-o-wisp on kangaskhan
okay<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.530> switches<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> something<00:02:17.280> else<00:02:17.430> he

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
okay see switches to something else he

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.040 
okay see switches to something else he
goes<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> double<00:02:18.570> edge<00:02:18.660> which<00:02:18.810> would<00:02:18.960> have

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
goes for a double edge which would have

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.840 
goes for a double edge which would have
gotten<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.320> KO<00:02:19.470> -<00:02:20.010> my<00:02:20.130> citrus<00:02:20.490> Barry

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
gotten the KO - my citrus Barry

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.670 
gotten the KO - my citrus Barry
so<00:02:21.300> even<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.750> minus<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> thing<00:02:22.590> is

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
so even a minus one that thing is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.070 
so even a minus one that thing is
monstrous<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.460> he<00:02:23.820> overheats<00:02:24.510> which<00:02:24.870> would

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
monstrous and he overheats which would

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.450 
monstrous and he overheats which would
have<00:02:25.170> killed<00:02:25.410> if<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.590> didn't<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> salt<00:02:26.220> vest

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
have killed if I didn't have a salt vest

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.070 
have killed if I didn't have a salt vest
I'm<00:02:26.580> sure<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.910> caught<00:02:27.060> him<00:02:27.180> off<00:02:27.330> guard<00:02:27.360> I'm

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
I'm sure that caught him off guard I'm

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.420 
I'm sure that caught him off guard I'm
sure<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.410> thought<00:02:28.530> you'd<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> double<00:02:28.980> KO<00:02:29.130> there

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
goes into Rotom that's pretty good

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.030 
goes into Rotom that's pretty good
damage<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.780> now<00:02:33.990> with<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.230> Miss<00:02:34.440> I'm<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.830> oh

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
god he didn't double ko my team I really

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
god he didn't double ko my team I really
don't<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.380> much<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.620> an<00:02:37.740> option<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.220> to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
don't have much of an option but to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.370 
don't have much of an option but to
double<00:02:38.490> switch<00:02:38.850> here<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.270> hopefully<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.960> don't

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
double switch here and hopefully I don't

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.310 
double switch here and hopefully I don't
switch<00:02:40.770> into<00:02:41.130> something<00:02:41.550> super<00:02:41.850> effective<00:02:42.320> so

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
switch into something super effective so

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.720 
switch into something super effective so
I<00:02:43.350> think<00:02:43.500> he's<00:02:43.770> gonna<00:02:43.890> try<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> pound

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
I think he's gonna try to pound

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.380 
I think he's gonna try to pound
Rotom<00:02:45.120> heat<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:47.010> try<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> finish<00:02:48.120> off

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
Rotom heat and then try to finish off

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.060

heat wave with Gyarados I'm gonna take

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.670 
heat wave with Gyarados I'm gonna take
me<00:02:54.060> over<00:02:54.150> heat<00:02:54.360> with<00:02:54.480> Gyarados<00:02:54.840> which<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.530> what

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680

which<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.860> good<00:02:59.070> still<00:02:59.850> does<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> monstrous

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
which is good still does a monstrous

amount of damage and this will do

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.690 
amount of damage and this will do
absolutely<00:03:02.610> zero<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.420> Gyarados<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.710> this<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.580> a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
absolutely zero to Gyarados so this is a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.890 
absolutely zero to Gyarados so this is a
very<00:03:05.910> interesting<00:03:06.060> positioning<00:03:06.630> for<00:03:06.780> me

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
really enjoyed this I was on the edge of

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.839 
really enjoyed this I was on the edge of
my<00:05:45.930> seat<00:05:46.110> especially<00:05:46.949> when<00:05:47.099> we<00:05:47.219> Louis<00:05:47.520> missed

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
my seat especially when we Louis missed

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.029 
my seat especially when we Louis missed
but<00:05:48.509> other<00:05:48.719> than<00:05:48.840> that<00:05:48.930> like<00:05:49.050> that<00:05:49.380> I<00:05:49.440> go<00:05:49.560> /<00:05:49.830> if

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
but other than that like that I go / if

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:50.930 
but other than that like that I go / if
I<00:05:50.099> didn't<00:05:50.250> have<00:05:50.340> rode<00:05:50.460> him<00:05:50.580> he<00:05:50.669> could<00:05:50.849> have

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
I didn't have rode him he could have

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.459 
I didn't have rode him he could have
taken<00:05:51.030> off<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.300> rest<00:05:51.419> of<00:05:51.539> this<00:05:51.599> team<00:05:51.840> so<00:05:52.169> it's

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
taken off the rest of this team so it's

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.699 
taken off the rest of this team so it's
a<00:05:52.560> real<00:05:52.710> scary<00:05:53.009> real<00:05:53.400> scary
