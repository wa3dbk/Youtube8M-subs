your clothes all over your sheets
everywhere<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.340> that's<00:04:12.730> true<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:13.300> will

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
everywhere and that's true that will

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.540 
everywhere and that's true that will
happen<00:04:13.870> what<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.230> usually<00:04:14.440> do<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.310> take<00:04:15.490> a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
happen what I usually do is I take a

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.150 
happen what I usually do is I take a
shower<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.180> put<00:04:16.359> it<00:04:16.480> on<00:04:16.570> right<00:04:17.109> after<00:04:17.500> so

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
shower and I put it on right after so

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.110 
shower and I put it on right after so
that<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.880> can<00:04:19.390> let<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.140> color<00:04:20.440> gradually<00:04:21.120> get

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
that I can let the color gradually get

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.970 
that I can let the color gradually get
darker<00:04:22.570> because<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:23.080> needs<00:04:23.260> time<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.620> believe

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
darker because it needs time I believe

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.010 
darker because it needs time I believe
it<00:04:24.070> takes<00:04:24.250> like<00:04:24.430> six<00:04:24.700> hours<00:04:25.090> so<00:04:25.240> what<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.390> do<00:04:25.510> is

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
it takes like six hours so what I do is

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.100 
it takes like six hours so what I do is
I<00:04:26.770> let<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.070> color<00:04:27.280> gradually<00:04:28.000> get<00:04:28.450> darker<00:04:28.870> and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
I let the color gradually get darker and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.980 
I let the color gradually get darker and
I<00:04:29.500> can<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:30.730> rinse<00:04:30.970> off<00:04:31.240> before<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.660> go<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.900> bed

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
I can just rinse off before I go to bed

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.510 
I can just rinse off before I go to bed
so<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.650> doesn't<00:04:32.950> get<00:04:33.010> all<00:04:33.070> over<00:04:33.280> my

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
so that it doesn't get all over my

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.700 
so that it doesn't get all over my
sheets<00:04:33.760> or<00:04:33.970> my<00:04:34.060> clothes<00:04:34.360> but<00:04:34.930> actually<00:04:35.410> this
