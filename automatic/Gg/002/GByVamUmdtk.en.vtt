 Today, the organization of Australian researchers was informed, despite 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.029
 that the planet of diamond is only 60 thousand kilometers in diameter 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.169
 about a fifth of the size of the earth has a very characteristic 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.129
 particular its high density slightly higher than that of Jupiter the planet of 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.350
 diamond also called carbon form together when pressing a star 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.610
 neutron that regularly emits pulses of electromagnetic radiation 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.780
 a binary system about 4 thousand light-years from the earth in the constellation of 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.210
 the snake separated by about 600 thousand kilometers the little planet orbits 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.579
 in two hours and ten minutes the pulsar or a neutron star baptized as 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.840
 psr j1719-1438 according to the team of scientists of Australia 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.540
 germany italy united kingdom and united states the planet now become 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.170
 a white dwarf seems to be the only residue of what was a star 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.070
 huge and whose most part of its mass was diverted towards the orbit of this pulsar 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.450
 Pulsars are neutron stars that rotate at high speed and have 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.110
 20 kilometers in diameter these neutron stars emit pulses of 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.480
 radio waves that are picked up by the telescopes explained that if I 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.360
 and even though the distance between 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.470
 of both celestial bodies is short the planet has not been destroyed by the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.440
 pulsation oscillations due to its size despite the rarity this 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.680
 planet corroborates what we know about how these binary systems 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.280
 evolve said one of the leaders of the investigation mateu dances the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.280
 University of Technology is your report of the city of Melburne 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.520
 The Australian scientist also explained that the high density of 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.630
 small planet gave clues to their origin and consider that much of the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.490
 star can be similar to that of a diamond besides the planet seems to be 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.280
 Composed mainly of carbon and oxygen and has bright elements 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.790
 as hydrogen and helium noted that there is responsible for the department of 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.330
 astronomy and space science of csiro the discovery of this planet was given 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.780
 after the team of Australian scientists warned first 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.639
 the pulsar with the help of the csiro radio telescope located near 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.819
 to the town of parks about 357 kilometers away 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.430
 west of Sydney researchers later followed this discovery 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.739
 with telescopes 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.719
 the United States but the United States later noticed that the pulses of 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.799
 pulsar were systematically altered by what could be the strength of 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.409
 gravity of a small planet that together with this one formed a system 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.599
 binary
