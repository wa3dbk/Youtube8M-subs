a<00:04:02.700> lot<00:04:02.820> more<00:04:03.030> bitter<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:04.550> was<00:04:05.550> drinking<00:04:05.760> Schlitz

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
a lot more bitter I was drinking Schlitz

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.660 
a lot more bitter I was drinking Schlitz
yesterday<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.990> noticed<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:07.710> seems<00:04:08.460> to

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
yesterday and I noticed it's seems to

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.780 
yesterday and I noticed it's seems to
have<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> bitterness<00:04:09.420> that's<00:04:09.870> not<00:04:10.140> quite<00:04:10.380> as

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
have a bitterness that's not quite as

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.750 
have a bitterness that's not quite as
much<00:04:11.790> as<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.090> but<00:04:13.070> not<00:04:14.070> necessarily<00:04:14.640> that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
much as this but not necessarily that

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.440 
much as this but not necessarily that
different<00:04:15.180> from<00:04:15.360> this<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.270> heard

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
different from this so and I heard

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.120 
different from this so and I heard
people<00:04:18.480> complain<00:04:19.050> about<00:04:19.080> Schlitz<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:20.010> it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
people complain about Schlitz that it

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.010 
people complain about Schlitz that it
was<00:04:20.280> bad<00:04:20.489> they<00:04:20.760> didn't<00:04:20.940> like<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.120> but<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.989> think

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
was bad they didn't like it but I think

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.600 
was bad they didn't like it but I think
it<00:04:22.380> might<00:04:22.530> be<00:04:22.560> because<00:04:22.830> they<00:04:23.040> used<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.370> drink

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
it might be because they used to drink

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.180 
it might be because they used to drink
in<00:04:23.760> light<00:04:23.940> beers<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.680> chouette<00:04:25.680> says<00:04:25.920> more

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
in light beers and chouette says more

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.400 
in light beers and chouette says more
that<00:04:26.340> full-bodied<00:04:26.940> flavor<00:04:26.970> with<00:04:27.450> that<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:31.290> me

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
that full-bodied flavor with that to me

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.110 
that full-bodied flavor with that to me
it's<00:04:31.560> more<00:04:31.920> than<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.160> kiss<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.580> hops<00:04:32.850> but

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
it's more than a kiss of the hops but

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.040 
it's more than a kiss of the hops but
that<00:04:33.300> hoppiness

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
that hoppiness

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.700 
that hoppiness
and<00:04:34.290> this<00:04:34.920> has<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.400> too<00:04:35.640> so<00:04:36.590> but<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.680> really

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
and this has that too so but I really

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.780 
and this has that too so but I really
like<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.130> because<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.490> has<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.730> good<00:04:39.000> beer

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
like it because this has a good beer

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.580 
like it because this has a good beer
flavor<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.940> good<00:04:42.180> lager<00:04:42.540> flavor<00:04:42.990> which<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.350> love

flavor a good lager flavor which I love

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.000 
flavor a good lager flavor which I love
so<00:04:44.240> some<00:04:45.240> people<00:04:45.570> criticize<00:04:45.990> Heineken<00:04:48.980> but<00:04:49.980> I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
so some people criticize Heineken but I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.270 
so some people criticize Heineken but I
don't<00:04:50.280> criticize<00:04:50.820> it<00:04:51.120> up<00:04:54.410> in<00:04:55.410> fact<00:04:55.620> I<00:04:55.800> enjoy<00:04:56.100> it

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
don't criticize it up in fact I enjoy it

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.810 
don't criticize it up in fact I enjoy it
I<00:04:56.340> don't<00:04:56.520> see<00:04:56.730> what<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:56.970> criticism<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.950> about

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.760 

it's<00:05:02.820> not<00:05:03.060> an<00:05:03.360> IPA<00:05:04.640> it's<00:05:05.640> not<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:06.770> Russian

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
it's not an IPA it's not a Russian

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.310 
it's not an IPA it's not a Russian
Imperial<00:05:08.190> Stout<00:05:08.750> it's<00:05:09.750> what<00:05:09.960> it's<00:05:10.110> supposed

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
Imperial Stout it's what it's supposed

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.820 
Imperial Stout it's what it's supposed
to<00:05:10.410> be<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.590> European<00:05:10.830> pale<00:05:11.430> lager<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.600> it

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
to be a European pale lager and it

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.950 
to be a European pale lager and it
certainly<00:05:13.830> holds<00:05:14.610> its<00:05:14.880> own<00:05:15.000> in<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.240> category

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
certainly holds its own in that category

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.050 
certainly holds its own in that category
and<00:05:16.350> I<00:05:16.410> think<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.830> holds<00:05:17.070> his<00:05:17.160> own<00:05:17.310> for<00:05:17.850> beer

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
and I think it holds his own for beer

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.990 
and I think it holds his own for beer
overall<00:05:18.450> so

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.400 

lately<00:05:26.000> look<00:05:26.510> at<00:05:26.630> all<00:05:26.690> those<00:05:26.780> bubbles<00:05:26.990> going
