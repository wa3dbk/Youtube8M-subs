this<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.149> my<00:00:03.709> hydrodynamic<00:00:04.709> model<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:05.520> a

00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:05.669 
this is my hydrodynamic model of a

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.629 
this is my hydrodynamic model of a
distillation<00:00:06.060> tower<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:07.049> have<00:00:07.709> to<00:00:07.859> say<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.400> is

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
distillation tower I have to say this is

distillation tower I have to say this is
the<00:00:08.849> coolest<00:00:09.360> Christmas<00:00:09.809> present<00:00:10.290> I've<00:00:10.410> ever

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
the coolest Christmas present I've ever

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.720 
the coolest Christmas present I've ever
gotten<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.429> my<00:00:11.670> entire<00:00:11.700> life<00:00:16.070> you've<00:00:17.070> got<00:00:17.370> a

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
gotten in my entire life you've got a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.120 
gotten in my entire life you've got a
tank<00:00:18.390> full<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.720> water<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> submersible

tank full of water with a submersible

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.970 
tank full of water with a submersible
pump<00:00:22.310> there<00:00:23.310> goes<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.730> feed<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.420> tower

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
pump there goes the feed to the tower

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.640 
pump there goes the feed to the tower
the<00:00:25.980> tower<00:00:26.190> is<00:00:26.640> water<00:00:27.150> packed<00:00:30.290> and<00:00:31.290> the<00:00:31.410> flow

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the tower is water packed and the flow

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.810 
the tower is water packed and the flow
from<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> tower<00:00:33.980> goes<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.280> into<00:00:35.699> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
from the tower goes out into the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.069 
from the tower goes out into the
condenser<00:00:37.940> see<00:00:38.940> my<00:00:39.089> condenser<00:00:39.570> half<00:00:39.749> full<00:00:40.050> of

condenser see my condenser half full of
water<00:00:41.480> it<00:00:42.480> comes<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:42.929> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.140> condenser<00:00:43.679> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
water it comes out of the condenser and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.689 
water it comes out of the condenser and
splits<00:00:44.659> it<00:00:45.659> goes<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.199> two<00:00:46.379> streams<00:00:49.699> one

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
splits it goes into two streams one

splits it goes into two streams one
stream<00:00:51.530> goes<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.010> cool<00:00:53.309> little

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
stream goes into this cool little

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.259 
stream goes into this cool little
gravity-fed<00:00:55.589> funnel<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.399> bucket<00:00:56.879> dumps

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
when the bucket gets full it dumps into

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.149 
when the bucket gets full it dumps into
a<00:00:59.640> little<00:01:00.089> tank<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.780> overflows<00:01:01.350> back<00:01:01.829> into

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
a little tank that overflows back into

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.890 

the<00:01:18.860> stream<00:01:19.159> goes<00:01:19.460> through<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.909> roto<00:01:20.270> turbine

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
the stream goes through a roto turbine

the stream goes through a roto turbine
flow<00:01:21.380> meter<00:01:21.770> which<00:01:21.890> is<00:01:22.040> really<00:01:22.430> just<00:01:22.670> there<00:01:22.939> to

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
flow meter which is really just there to

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:32.590 
flow meter which is really just there to
look<00:01:23.509> cool<00:01:28.270> into<00:01:29.270> another<00:01:29.570> tank<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:32.240> drops

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
look cool into another tank that drops

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.359 
look cool into another tank that drops
down<00:01:32.899> into<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.409> siphon<00:01:35.590> way<00:01:36.590> this<00:01:36.799> works<00:01:37.100> is

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
down into a siphon way this works is

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.690 
down into a siphon way this works is
when<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.670> siphon<00:01:38.060> tank<00:01:38.270> gets<00:01:38.570> full<00:01:39.670> choose<00:01:40.670> a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
when the siphon tank gets full choose a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.109 
when the siphon tank gets full choose a
rather<00:01:40.909> little<00:01:41.240> slow<00:01:41.509> pipe<00:01:41.840> process<00:01:43.119> water

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
rather little slow pipe process water

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.980 
rather little slow pipe process water
level<00:01:44.509> gets<00:01:44.689> up<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.110> top<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.619> siphon

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
level gets up to the top of the siphon

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:59.580 
level gets up to the top of the siphon
it<00:01:47.990> overflows<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:50.330> water<00:01:50.509> drains<00:01:50.810> out

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:09.669 

now<00:02:00.590> on<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:01.009> other<00:02:01.190> side

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.960 

at<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.340> midpoint<00:02:10.519> of<00:02:10.879> the<00:02:10.940> tower<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:12.909> go<00:02:13.909> to

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
at the midpoint of the tower a go to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.699 
at the midpoint of the tower a go to
line<00:02:14.299> that's<00:02:14.629> going<00:02:14.959> into<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.290> bottom<00:02:15.620> of

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
line that's going into the bottom of

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.520 
line that's going into the bottom of
this<00:02:15.920> weird-looking<00:02:16.489> little<00:02:16.700> dome<00:02:16.909> tank<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
this weird-looking little dome tank and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.320 
this weird-looking little dome tank and
coming<00:02:18.769> out<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.099> dome<00:02:19.310> tank<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.849> goes<00:02:20.030> into

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
coming out of the dome tank it goes into

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.199 
coming out of the dome tank it goes into
a<00:02:20.540> tank<00:02:21.170> here<00:02:21.319> on<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.590> bottom<00:02:21.769> it<00:02:22.580> has<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.730> spray

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
a tank here on the bottom it has a spray

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.680 
a tank here on the bottom it has a spray
nozzle<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:25.459> has<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> float<00:02:26.090> valve<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.599> the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
nozzle it has a float valve on the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.300 
nozzle it has a float valve on the
bottom<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.170> way<00:02:27.260> it's<00:02:27.470> supposed<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.099> work

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
bottom and the way it's supposed to work

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.490 
bottom and the way it's supposed to work
is<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.700> when<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.390> raises<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.989> float<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
is that when it raises the float the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.080 
is that when it raises the float the
flow<00:02:30.680> comes<00:02:31.010> out<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> bottom<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.879> float

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
flow comes out the bottom but the float

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.670 
flow comes out the bottom but the float
valve<00:02:32.329> isn't<00:02:32.569> working<00:02:32.959> very<00:02:33.140> well<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.590> we

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
valve isn't working very well and we

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.430 
valve isn't working very well and we
haven't<00:02:33.890> quite<00:02:34.099> figured<00:02:34.370> out<00:02:34.640> why<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:35.030> is

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
haven't quite figured out why that is

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.500 
haven't quite figured out why that is
but<00:02:36.440> all<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.769> all<00:02:36.950> this<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.459> very<00:02:37.579> very<00:02:38.209> cool

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
but all in all this is a very very cool

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.910 
but all in all this is a very very cool
little<00:02:38.780> thing<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.379> have<00:02:41.140> an<00:02:42.140> ample<00:02:42.530> supply<00:02:42.560> of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
little thing you have an ample supply of
