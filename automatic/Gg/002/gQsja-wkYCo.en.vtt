00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
 the goal was what this week enters the world at the rear by the 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.070
 inspectors strootman and van bommel 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.240
 Koek Sneijder and from behind the deep striker Jan Huntelaar slammed it in 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.860
 form is schalke 0 4 and would like to score a lot but that goes for more 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.610
 players against with extremely weak san marino and all 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.739
 now it's the first time 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.140
 how robin van persie 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.179
 as specified by mark van bommel 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.259
 it happened chronicle of an announced one 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.579
 monster score 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:32.960
 and surely 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.410
 the opening phase of the Netherlands 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.980
 give hope in that regard 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 Wesley Sneijder a beautiful swipe 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.479
 after just over fifteen minutes full of 3 0 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.989
 at the cross from dirk excellent header for a johnny heitinga 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.860
 gamer.nl bone humiliated 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.999
 team barely touches the ball 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.999
 it is of course not for nothing that the number 203 of the world ranking 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.239
 traveled along with the goal numbers 0 for a 33 against to Eindhoven but it is not 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.350
 close to a goal 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.180
 from numerous captain andy themselves 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.600
 not even that far apart 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.980
 still in the first half the chances of robin van persie 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.800
 Assisted by Wesley Sneijder 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.290
 but this time 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.040
 no ball 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.610
 in the second half, the netherlands continues to be hungry 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 van persie robben huntelaar and there is cold 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 beautifully played out 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.250
 And then there is no stopping it for San Marino 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.140
 pace boosted by the Netherlands that would like to win with double digits 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.210
 that still means it 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.730
 scored twice 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.399
 the ninth victory 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.600
 on Finland and Norway 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.870
 but never with 10 0 or more huntelaar 5 0 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.130
 I do understand that and he is upset 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 this 6 0 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.849
 he no longer puts a brake on two minutes later 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.049
 here attack of the Netherlands with sneijder at the primary school t 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.990
 huntelaar one more time was an option 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.319
 Van Persie 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.049
 the 7 0 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.480
 now the san marino goal figures are the qualifying pool 0 for 40 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.479
 against and that in 0 40 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.379
 it doesn't stop there 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.589
 8 0 on the road 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.899
 for huntelaar 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:38.479
 the double digits are forthcoming that feel said that the players are also feeling on 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.199
 the field 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.199
 Grab your straw man 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.689
 van persie with 9 0 are fourth of the evening and then there are more than ten 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.669
 minutes to play 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.059
 the team also wants to come but who will make it 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.049
 the first time together wesley sneijder die 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.049
 click here 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.779
 3 0 so it is a special evening and also a historical evening 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.699
 because with such big numbers, the Netherlands have never won but also one 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.699
 debut album looks to share in the joy when needed 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.379
 certain end on the way 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.949
 you can hear eleven mulders in one of the other results in the group of 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.969
 the netherlands was also favorable for orange on hungary profit from sweden with 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.889
 two inter-finland moldavia becomes chambers of the netherlands now six points 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.849
 ahead of the number two in sweden 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.589
 the world cup in poland and ukraine is now also close to the group winners 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.299
 of course anyway and the Netherlands was allowed to fall to second place and there is a chance 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.149
 life-size that orange is the best number two and is not allowed to go to the World Cup 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.709
 play football for the numbers 2 play off hurts
