thanks<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.649> instruction<00:01:47.649> book<00:01:47.860> hey

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
thanks to the instruction book hey

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.100 
thanks to the instruction book hey
remember<00:01:48.490> these<00:01:48.759> okay<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.690> book<00:01:49.869> says

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
is this brilliant physicist and he works

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.320 
is this brilliant physicist and he works
in<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.619> lab<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:53.890> has<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.280> ginormous<00:01:54.880> particle

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
in a lab that has a ginormous particle

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.810 
in a lab that has a ginormous particle
accelerator<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.229> know<00:01:56.320> like<00:01:56.560> Higgs<00:01:56.830> boson<00:01:57.399> si

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
accelerator you know like Higgs boson si

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.270 
accelerator you know like Higgs boson si
ER<00:01:58.119> n<00:01:58.330> this<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:58.990> high<00:01:59.080> level<00:01:59.110> stuff<00:01:59.619> so<00:02:00.130> he's

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
ER n this is high level stuff so he's

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.859 
ER n this is high level stuff so he's
trying<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.610> recreate<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.149> Big<00:02:01.270> Bang<00:02:01.509> in<00:02:01.780> his

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
trying to recreate the Big Bang in his

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.300 
trying to recreate the Big Bang in his
latest<00:02:02.170> experiment<00:02:02.770> but<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.979> bolt<00:02:03.220> of

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
latest experiment but a bolt of

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.890 
latest experiment but a bolt of
lightning<00:02:03.490> hits<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.240> lab<00:02:04.479> at<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.810> moment

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
lightning hits the lab at the moment

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.960 
lightning hits the lab at the moment
articles<00:02:05.590> collide<00:02:05.950> creating<00:02:06.310> some<00:02:06.670> kind<00:02:06.850> of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
articles collide creating some kind of

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.430 
articles collide creating some kind of
crazy-ass<00:02:07.479> rift<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.410> space-time

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
crazy-ass rift in the space-time

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.919 
crazy-ass rift in the space-time
continuum<00:02:08.979> signing<00:02:09.940> him<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.179> an<00:02:10.299> alien<00:02:10.690> planet

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
continuum signing him to an alien planet

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.330 
continuum signing him to an alien planet
I<00:02:11.290> like<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.799> instruction<00:02:12.220> book

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
I like that the instruction book

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.830 
I like that the instruction book
actually<00:02:12.610> has<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> spoiler<00:02:13.239> alert<00:02:13.390> here<00:02:13.750> in

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
actually has a spoiler alert here in

actually has a spoiler alert here in
case<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.200> stuck<00:02:14.530> at<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.680> beginning<00:02:15.010> but

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
case you get stuck at the beginning but

case you get stuck at the beginning but
yeah<00:02:15.670> that's<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.150> story<00:02:16.450> which<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.900> pretty

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
yeah that's the story which is pretty

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.170 
yeah that's the story which is pretty
original<00:02:17.350> as<00:02:17.739> far<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.010> 16-bit<00:02:18.579> titles<00:02:18.940> go<00:02:19.120> you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
original as far as 16-bit titles go you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210 
original as far as 16-bit titles go you
got<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> hand<00:02:19.720> at<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.320> hey<00:02:20.620> not<00:02:20.829> only<00:02:20.890> are

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
got a hand at that and hey not only are

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.890 
got a hand at that and hey not only are
the<00:02:21.370> passwords<00:02:21.850> short<00:02:22.150> they<00:02:22.329> even<00:02:22.540> have<00:02:22.660> less

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
the passwords short they even have less

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.390 
the passwords short they even have less
letters<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.440> choose<00:02:23.650> from<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.070> gotta<00:02:24.220> love

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
letters to choose from you gotta love

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.660 
letters to choose from you gotta love
that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.460 
that
now<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.630> downside<00:02:26.079> of<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.290> game

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
now we get to the downside of the game

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.530 
now we get to the downside of the game
which<00:02:26.829> is<00:02:26.860> how<00:02:27.160> difficult<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.360> mean

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
which is how difficult it is and I mean

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.539 
which is how difficult it is and I mean
it<00:02:28.690> when<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.840> say<00:02:29.079> it<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.260> got<00:02:29.500> IP<00:02:29.650> exact<00:02:30.340> with

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
it when I say it you got IP exact with

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.520 
it when I say it you got IP exact with
everything<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.239> pretty<00:02:31.480> damn<00:02:31.690> frustrating

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
everything is pretty damn frustrating

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.960 
everything is pretty damn frustrating
there's<00:02:32.709> also<00:02:32.980> loading<00:02:33.430> time<00:02:33.640> which<00:02:33.850> is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
there's also loading time which is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.130 
there's also loading time which is
always<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.239> bummer<00:02:34.510> playing<00:02:34.870> through<00:02:35.079> a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
always a bummer playing through a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.990 
always a bummer playing through a
cartridge<00:02:35.500> game<00:02:35.829> but<00:02:36.280> yeah<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.579> controls

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
cartridge game but yeah the controls

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.880 
cartridge game but yeah the controls
Wolff<00:02:37.630> oh<00:02:37.989> goodness

Wolff oh goodness
this<00:02:39.130> game<00:02:39.310> originally<00:02:39.790> came<00:02:39.940> out<00:02:40.150> for<00:02:40.299> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
this game originally came out for the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.810 
this game originally came out for the
Amiga<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:40.930> 1991<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.860> was<00:02:42.040> ported<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.459> both<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
Amiga in 1991 and was ported to both the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.400 
Amiga in 1991 and was ported to both the
Super<00:02:43.060> Nintendo<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.600> Sega<00:02:43.810> Genesis<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.110 
Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis the
next<00:02:44.650> year<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.250> only<00:02:45.430> difference<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.910> games

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
next year the only difference the games

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.090 
next year the only difference the games
have<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.720> opening<00:02:47.110> scene<00:02:47.440> other<00:02:47.860> than

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
have is in the opening scene other than

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.199 
have is in the opening scene other than
that<00:02:48.250> they're<00:02:48.400> pretty<00:02:48.519> much<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.790> same<00:02:48.970> game

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
that they're pretty much the same game

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.759 
that they're pretty much the same game
so<00:02:49.750> there's<00:02:49.930> not<00:02:49.989> much<00:02:50.079> advantage<00:02:50.470> playing

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
so there's not much advantage playing

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.770 
so there's not much advantage playing
one<00:02:51.040> over<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.489> other<00:02:51.519> anyway<00:02:52.329> it's<00:02:52.480> hard<00:02:52.540> to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
one over the other anyway it's hard to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.390 
one over the other anyway it's hard to
say<00:02:52.959> whether<00:02:53.170> or<00:02:53.290> not<00:02:53.440> out<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:53.829> this<00:02:54.010> world<00:02:54.250> is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
say whether or not out of this world is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.600 
say whether or not out of this world is
worth<00:02:54.579> playing<00:02:54.790> today<00:02:55.239> it's

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
worth playing today it's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.970 
worth playing today it's
definitely<00:02:56.030> worth<00:02:56.210> looking<00:02:56.840> at<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.830> be

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
definitely worth looking at but just be

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.410 
definitely worth looking at but just be
prepared<00:02:58.400> because<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.820> controls<00:02:59.210> are<00:02:59.390> very

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
prepared because the controls are very

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.990 
prepared because the controls are very
stiff<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.230> very<00:03:00.320> exact<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:01.250> will<00:03:01.430> die<00:03:01.760> a

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
stiff and very exact and you will die a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
stiff and very exact and you will die a
lot<00:03:02.210> so<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:02.900> wouldn't<00:03:03.170> blame<00:03:03.350> anybody<00:03:03.620> for

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
lot so I wouldn't blame anybody for

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.770 
lot so I wouldn't blame anybody for
quitting<00:03:04.250> but<00:03:04.790> if<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.000> game<00:03:05.270> piques<00:03:05.690> your

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
quitting but if this game piques your
