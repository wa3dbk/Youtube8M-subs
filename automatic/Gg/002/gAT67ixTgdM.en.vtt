how the first goal went in with the
offside<00:00:11.490> really<00:00:12.000> disappointing<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
offside really disappointing for the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.940 
offside really disappointing for the
lads<00:00:12.840> because<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.200> started<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> game<00:00:13.740> so

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.700 
lads because you started the game so
well<00:00:14.160> yeah<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.120> was<00:00:15.269> disappointing<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:16.200> just

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
well yeah that was disappointing I just

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.320 
well yeah that was disappointing I just
saw<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> Peter<00:00:17.160> today<00:00:17.369> actually<00:00:17.849> though<00:00:18.000> with

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
saw the Peter today actually though with

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.589 
saw the Peter today actually though with
the<00:00:18.450> offside<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.169> on<00:00:20.419> yeah<00:00:21.419> I<00:00:21.450> think

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
the offside and so on yeah I think

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:28.639 
the offside and so on yeah I think
there's<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.290> a<00:00:22.770> top<00:00:23.220> team<00:00:23.460> luck<00:00:25.040> and<00:00:27.649> us

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
there's just a top team luck and us

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.580 
there's just a top team luck and us
being<00:00:28.919> a<00:00:29.009> bit<00:00:29.189> unlucky<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:30.149> well<00:00:30.390> actually<00:00:31.290> we

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
being a bit unlucky as well actually we

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
being a bit unlucky as well actually we
started<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:33.059> were<00:00:33.120> very

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
started really well we were very

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.770 
started really well we were very
satisfied<00:00:34.050> with<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.739> beginning<00:00:35.660> in<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
satisfied with the beginning in the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.100 
satisfied with the beginning in the
second<00:00:37.050> goal<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.470> just<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:38.210> present<00:00:39.210> more<00:00:40.050> or

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
second goal was just a present more or

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.360 
second goal was just a present more or
less<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.920> gift<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.650> it's<00:00:43.650> difficult<00:00:44.130> I<00:00:44.340> think

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
less a gift and it's difficult I think

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.850 
less a gift and it's difficult I think
the<00:00:44.730> bomb<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.120> played<00:00:45.330> a<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.600> good<00:00:45.690> game

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
the bomb was played a really good game

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
the bomb was played a really good game
but<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.280> well<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> last<00:00:48.660> thing<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
but we as well it's the last thing you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.150 
but we as well it's the last thing you
need<00:00:49.079> when<00:00:49.110> you're<00:00:49.410> at<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.560> bottom<00:00:49.710> isn't<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
need when you're at the bottom isn't it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.560 
need when you're at the bottom isn't it
something<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.490> that<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.850> go<00:00:51.000> against<00:00:51.390> yeah

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
something like that to go against yeah

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.010 
something like that to go against yeah
yeah<00:00:51.960> clearly<00:00:52.380> I<00:00:53.090> think<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.210> fought<00:00:54.450> well<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
yeah clearly I think we fought well and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.090 
yeah clearly I think we fought well and
still<00:00:55.530> kept<00:00:56.040> going<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.850> tried<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:58.100> created

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
still kept going and tried and I created

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.310 
still kept going and tried and I created
chances<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.150> clearly<00:01:00.690> was<00:01:00.870> difficult

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
chances but the clearly was difficult

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.920 
chances but the clearly was difficult
after<00:01:01.410> two<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.430> three<00:01:02.460> no<00:01:02.760> suppose<00:01:03.660> there's<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
after two or three no suppose there's a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.840 
after two or three no suppose there's a
group<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.320> players<00:01:04.409> having<00:01:04.829> a<00:01:04.890> game<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.549> soon
