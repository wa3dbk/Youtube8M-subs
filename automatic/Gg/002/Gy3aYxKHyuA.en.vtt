and i had to stop so that i could do
this<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.870> last<00:02:25.410> step<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:25.920> i'm<00:02:26.490> going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> lay

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
this that last step so i'm going to lay

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.550 
this that last step so i'm going to lay
the<00:02:28.320> tape<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.890> binding<00:02:29.490> across<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.880> edge<00:02:33.560> i'm

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the tape the binding across the edge i'm

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.920 
the tape the binding across the edge i'm
going<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:36.080> make<00:02:37.080> sure<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:38.570> do<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.660> see<00:02:39.810> where

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
going to make sure that do you see where

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.490 
going to make sure that do you see where
this<00:02:40.110> little<00:02:41.030> wells<00:02:42.030> Brown<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:42.780> brown<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:43.320> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
this little wells Brown on brown here I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.100 
this little wells Brown on brown here I
in<00:02:43.709> that's<00:02:44.610> where<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.820> started<00:02:44.930> stitching<00:02:45.930> when

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
in that's where I started stitching when

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.780 
in that's where I started stitching when
I<00:02:46.140> was<00:02:46.350> about<00:02:46.440> half<00:02:46.800> an<00:02:46.950> inch<00:02:47.040> below<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.519> fold

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
I was about half an inch below that fold

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.770 
I was about half an inch below that fold
ok<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.570> I'm<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.870> lay<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.420> pink

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
ok so I'm going to lay this to that pink

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.820 
ok so I'm going to lay this to that pink
mark<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:54.019> that's<00:02:55.019> why<00:02:55.260> I'm<00:02:55.350> going<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.769> cut<00:02:57.830> my

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
mark and that's why I'm going to cut my

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.390 
mark and that's why I'm going to cut my
binding

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.550 

this<00:03:05.400> binding<00:03:05.940> gets<00:03:06.150> tucked<00:03:06.510> inside<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.380> this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
this binding gets tucked inside of this

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.580 
this binding gets tucked inside of this
binding<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:10.140> going<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.350> match<00:03:10.560> up

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
binding and it's going to match up

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.970 
binding and it's going to match up
perfectly<00:03:10.890> because<00:03:11.430> i<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:11.760> trimmed<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.980> so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
perfectly because i just trimmed it so

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.620 
perfectly because i just trimmed it so
that's<00:03:14.190> where<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.520> little<00:03:14.670> tunnel<00:03:15.060> comes<00:03:15.270> in

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630
