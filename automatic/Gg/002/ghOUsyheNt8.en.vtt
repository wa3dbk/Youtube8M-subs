00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
of getting use out of him so that's just

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.869 
of getting use out of him so that's just

short film but I'm going to show you and
the<00:03:46.290> rest<00:03:46.409> of<00:03:46.500> his<00:03:46.620> quests<00:03:47.010> he<00:03:47.099> can<00:03:47.220> make<00:03:47.370> short

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
the rest of his quests he can make short

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.789 
the rest of his quests he can make short
film<00:03:47.879> he<00:03:48.150> can<00:03:48.329> rule<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.229> underground<00:03:49.620> kingdom

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
film he can rule the underground kingdom

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.490 
film he can rule the underground kingdom
of<00:03:50.099> more<00:03:50.280> people<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:51.199> initially<00:03:52.199> actually<00:03:52.319> he

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
of more people and initially actually he

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.080 
of more people and initially actually he
didn't<00:03:52.769> have<00:03:52.889> a<00:03:52.919> name<00:03:53.099> used<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.519> this<00:03:53.639> old<00:03:53.879> coin

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
didn't have a name used as this old coin

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.369 
didn't have a name used as this old coin
that<00:03:54.389> he<00:03:54.449> saw<00:03:54.599> that<00:03:54.720> he<00:03:54.810> looked<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.139> mole

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
that he saw that he looked like a mole

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.800 
that he saw that he looked like a mole
so<00:03:55.500> they<00:03:55.620> named<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.919> moment<00:03:56.280> he<00:03:56.970> can<00:03:57.120> deliver

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
so they named a moment he can deliver

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.629 
so they named a moment he can deliver
books<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.319> inmate<00:03:58.680> subset<00:03:59.099> goes<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.430> prison

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
books the inmate subset goes to prison

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.670 
books the inmate subset goes to prison
provide<00:04:00.180> security<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.900> think<00:04:00.989> he<00:04:01.440> does<00:04:01.650> that

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
provide security I think he does that

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.250 
provide security I think he does that
from<00:04:01.979> I<00:04:02.190> read<00:04:02.459> at<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.940> crusties<00:04:03.900> and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
from I read at the crusties and

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.420 
from I read at the crusties and
obviously<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.650> idea<00:04:04.859> of<00:04:04.919> him<00:04:05.040> providing

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
obviously the idea of him providing

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.890 
obviously the idea of him providing
security<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:05.940> his<00:04:06.090> physical<00:04:06.419> state<00:04:06.750> he's

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
security in his physical state he's

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.369 
security in his physical state he's
