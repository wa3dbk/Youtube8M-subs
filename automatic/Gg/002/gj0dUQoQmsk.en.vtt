00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
for a red piece and the easiest way to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.990 
for a red piece and the easiest way to
do<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> look<00:00:41.370> around<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.700> this

middle<00:00:42.450> section<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.469> trying<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> find<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
middle section here I'm trying to find a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.200 
middle section here I'm trying to find a
rip<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.399> there's<00:00:44.610> another<00:00:44.760> red<00:00:44.940> piece<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
rip it and there's another red piece of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600 
rip it and there's another red piece of
there<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.219> whatever<00:00:47.460> you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there so what we can do is whatever you

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.790 
there so what we can do is whatever you
said<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> last<00:00:48.120> part<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> red<00:00:49.620> piece

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
said in the last part with the red piece

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.470 
said in the last part with the red piece
facing<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> red<00:00:51.180> centerpiece

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
facing you and with the red centerpiece

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.830 
facing you and with the red centerpiece
on<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> top<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.710> rotate<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
on the top you just rotate it up so that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.529 
on the top you just rotate it up so that
those<00:00:55.710> red<00:00:55.949> pieces<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.370> together<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
those red pieces it together and now you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.709 
those red pieces it together and now you
can<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> white<00:01:00.030> pier<00:01:00.329> actually

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
can see that the the white pier actually

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.000 
can see that the the white pier actually
I<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.989> happened<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:01.829> place

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
I just happened to be in the right place

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
I just happened to be in the right place
that<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.489> lucky<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that was just lucky you can see that the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.130 
that was just lucky you can see that the
white<00:01:04.799> piece<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:06.630> needs<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> white

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
white piece there now needs a white

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
white piece there now needs a white
centerpiece<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.369> achieve<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.880> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
centerpiece and you can achieve that I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
centerpiece and you can achieve that I
just<00:01:09.689> rotating<00:01:10.229> those<00:01:10.590> bottom<00:01:10.920> two<00:01:11.070> layers

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
just rotating those bottom two layers

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.719 
just rotating those bottom two layers
until<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.939> whites<00:01:12.180> connect<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.380> okay<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.610> we

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
until the whites connect up okay but we

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.260 
until the whites connect up okay but we
shouldn't<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.360> marry<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> fact<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
shouldn't get to marry to the fact that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
shouldn't get to marry to the fact that
those<00:01:18.270> white<00:01:18.509> pieces<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> center<00:01:19.409> need<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
those white pieces in the center need to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
those white pieces in the center need to
stay<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> right<00:01:20.670> place<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.630> can

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
stay in the right place because we can

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.359 
stay in the right place because we can
always<00:01:21.840> shipped<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:22.320> later<00:01:22.530> once<00:01:23.159> we've<00:01:23.340> got

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
always shipped out later once we've got

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.370 
always shipped out later once we've got
the<00:01:23.549> cross<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> top<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.900> got<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the cross on the top and all got the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
the cross on the top and all got the
side<00:01:25.619> pieces<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.310> places<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:27.240> we

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
side pieces in the right places then we

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.789 
side pieces in the right places then we
can<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.479> correct<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.350> middle<00:01:28.619> pieces

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
can just correct the the middle pieces

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.609 
can just correct the the middle pieces
little<00:01:29.159> bit<00:01:29.250> later<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.549> okay<00:01:30.500> what<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
little bit later on okay what is

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
little bit later on okay what is
important<00:01:32.100> though<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.400> relative<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
important though is relative to that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
important though is relative to that
white<00:01:33.900> piece<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.320> we've<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.530> put<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.979> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
white piece that we've now put in is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.510 
white piece that we've now put in is
what<00:01:35.810> color<00:01:36.810> should<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.259> over<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.460> right

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
what color should be over on your right

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.940 
what color should be over on your right
which<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.600> green<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.710> car<00:01:40.920> should

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
which is the green and what car should

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.289 
which is the green and what car should
be<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> left<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.150> yellow

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
be over on the left which is the yellow

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.830 
be over on the left which is the yellow
okay<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.860> left<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.850> yellow<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.119> right<00:01:45.689> was

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
okay so left was yellow and right was

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.520 
okay so left was yellow and right was
clean<00:01:46.049> okay<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> look<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.530> another

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
clean okay so then we look for another

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.160 
clean okay so then we look for another
and<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:50.280> again<00:01:50.939> tends<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.899> best<00:01:52.049> way

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and what again tends to be the best way

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200 
and what again tends to be the best way
to<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.770> keep<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.729> red<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to do it is just to keep that red on the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.600 
to do it is just to keep that red on the
top<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> rotate<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> bottom<00:01:56.070> two<00:01:56.250> round

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
top and rotate the bottom two round

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.499 
top and rotate the bottom two round
until<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.299> find<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.869> red<00:01:58.079> piece<00:01:58.880> again<00:01:59.880> there's

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
until you find a red piece again there's

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.639 
until you find a red piece again there's
a<00:02:00.570> red<00:02:00.719> piece<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.280> facing<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.369> towards<00:02:02.670> you

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
a red piece there facing up towards you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
a red piece there facing up towards you
and<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.670> happens<00:02:05.969> that's<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> yellow

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
and if it happens that's the yellow

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.380 
and if it happens that's the yellow
piece<00:02:06.990> which<00:02:07.259> needs<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
piece which needs to be on the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.060 
piece which needs to be on the
left<00:02:10.390> actually<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.560> what<00:02:11.710> we<00:02:11.800> will<00:02:11.890> end<00:02:12.010> up

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
left actually so what we will end up

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.440 
left actually so what we will end up
doing<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.400> just<00:02:12.460> rotate<00:02:12.940> out<00:02:13.060> all<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.360> way

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
doing is just rotate out all the way

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.240 
doing is just rotate out all the way
around<00:02:16.950> then<00:02:17.950> put<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.220> up<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.700> top<00:02:18.880> okay<00:02:20.250> so

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
around then put it up on the top okay so

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.670 
around then put it up on the top okay so
now<00:02:21.370> you've<00:02:21.490> got<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> white<00:02:22.380> with<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:25.680> with

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
now you've got the white with the with

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.060 
now you've got the white with the with
the<00:02:26.709> yellow<00:02:27.040> piece<00:02:27.280> over<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.120> right<00:02:28.300> okay

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
the yellow piece over to the right okay

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.810 
the yellow piece over to the right okay
okay<00:02:31.320> that's<00:02:32.320> quite<00:02:32.500> complicated<00:02:32.980> maneuver

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
okay that's quite complicated maneuver

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.280 
okay that's quite complicated maneuver
to<00:02:33.910> do<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.330> probably<00:02:34.570> recommend<00:02:34.930> at<00:02:35.170> this

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
to do so I probably recommend at this

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.100 
to do so I probably recommend at this
point<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.680> pause<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.459> video<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.390> go<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:37.959> try

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
point you pause the video and go and try

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.630 
point you pause the video and go and try
and<00:02:38.200> work<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.470> out<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.740> yourself<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.280> play

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and work on out for yourself and play

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.460 
and work on out for yourself and play
around<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> lot<00:02:40.330> but<00:02:40.900> essentially<00:02:41.380> all

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
around with a lot but essentially all

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.449 
around with a lot but essentially all
you're<00:02:41.620> trying<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.830> do<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.130> you're<00:02:42.220> trying<00:02:42.310> to

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
get a a red colored piece facing you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.140 
get a a red colored piece facing you
there<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.110> go<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:48.340> then<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:48.580> work<00:02:48.820> out

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
which part of the top of the cube that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.680 
which part of the top of the cube that
red<00:02:52.570> piece<00:02:52.750> needs<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.140> go<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:53.410> front<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.830> okay

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
sort of the blue part needs to be over

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.330 
sort of the blue part needs to be over
this<00:03:10.510> bit<00:03:10.780> mover<00:03:11.110> over<00:03:11.320> here<00:03:11.620> red<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:11.980> blue

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
this bit mover over here red and blue

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.940 
this bit mover over here red and blue
needs<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:12.730> over<00:03:12.850> here<00:03:13.030> okay<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.739> need

needs to be over here okay so you need

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.979 
needs to be over here okay so you need
to<00:03:15.040> move<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.400> around<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.840> bit

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
to move it around so that that's the bit

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.960 
to move it around so that that's the bit
you<00:03:17.080> want<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.320> replace<00:03:17.590> with<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.890> red<00:03:18.850> and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
you want to replace with the red and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.090 
you want to replace with the red and
blue<00:03:19.150> part<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:20.049> there<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.530> red<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:20.920> bleep

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
blue part and there is the red and bleep

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.009 
blue part and there is the red and bleep
over<00:03:21.459> there<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.299> can<00:03:22.420> just<00:03:22.450> move<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.900> up

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
over there so you can just move it up

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.960 
over there so you can just move it up
and<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.920> split<00:03:24.190> into<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.489> space<00:03:24.700> there

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
and in to split into the space there

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.270 
and in to split into the space there
okay<00:03:25.470> now<00:03:26.470> we're<00:03:26.560> going<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.709> got<00:03:26.860> one<00:03:27.040> piece

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
okay now we're going to got one piece

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.890 
okay now we're going to got one piece
left<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.670> we<00:03:27.730> need<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.910> put<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:28.120> place<00:03:28.360> that's

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
left that we need to put in place that's

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.259 
left that we need to put in place that's
this<00:03:28.989> one<00:03:29.140> here<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:30.370> by<00:03:30.519> post<00:03:30.730> elimination

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
this one here and by post elimination

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.030 
this one here and by post elimination
because<00:03:31.390> we've<00:03:31.630> got<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.870> blue<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.769> yellow

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
because we've got the blue the yellow

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.229 
because we've got the blue the yellow
and<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.250> white<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.760> because<00:03:33.910> there's<00:03:34.150> only

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
and the white and because there's only

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.500 
and the white and because there's only
one<00:03:34.510> red<00:03:35.019> side<00:03:35.680> piece<00:03:35.950> left<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:37.269> therefore

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
one red side piece left it therefore

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.160 
one red side piece left it therefore
must<00:03:37.840> go<00:03:38.019> into<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.320> slot<00:03:38.650> there<00:03:40.170> now

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
must go into that slot there now

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
must go into that slot there now
interestingly<00:03:41.350> it's<00:03:41.829> actually<00:03:42.070> on<00:03:42.130> the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
interestingly it's actually on the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.650 
interestingly it's actually on the
bottom<00:03:42.519> here<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.880> there<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.209> red<00:03:43.450> piece

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
bottom here and there is the red piece

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.240 
bottom here and there is the red piece
so<00:03:44.320> what<00:03:44.410> I'm<00:03:44.500> going<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.650> try<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:44.829> do<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.100> get

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
so what I'm going to try and do is get

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.310 
so what I'm going to try and do is get
that<00:03:45.430> red<00:03:45.670> piece<00:03:45.880> there<00:03:46.209> which<00:03:47.019> as<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.290> can

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
that red piece there which as you can

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.550 
that red piece there which as you can
see<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.890> on<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.940> left<00:03:49.810> from<00:03:50.049> your<00:03:50.170> point<00:03:50.380> of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
see is on the left from your point of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.390 
see is on the left from your point of
view<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.489> need<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.730> move<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.060> from<00:03:52.360> there

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
view and I need to move it from there

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.380 
view and I need to move it from there
around<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.680> underneath<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:58.090> space

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
around so that it's underneath the space

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.539 
around so that it's underneath the space
that<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.720> needs<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.959> move<00:03:59.079> into<00:03:59.290> so<00:04:00.250> there<00:04:00.459> it

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
that it needs to move into so there it

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.370 
that it needs to move into so there it
is<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:01.239> it's<00:04:01.420> got<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.840> move<00:04:01.930> up<00:04:02.079> into<00:04:02.230> that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
is and it's got to move up into that

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.470 
is and it's got to move up into that
space<00:04:02.650> there<00:04:02.860> okay<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.700> as<00:04:03.820> we<00:04:03.940> did<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.209> part

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
space there okay and as we did in part

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.000 
space there okay and as we did in part
two<00:04:04.750> we<00:04:04.780> can<00:04:05.320> actually<00:04:05.410> do<00:04:05.590> that<00:04:05.709> very<00:04:05.920> easily

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
two we can actually do that very easily

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.340 
two we can actually do that very easily
here<00:04:06.430> by<00:04:06.579> just<00:04:06.760> doing<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:07.170> hundred<00:04:08.170> eighty

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
here by just doing a hundred eighty

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.850 
here by just doing a hundred eighty
degrees<00:04:08.489> rotation<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:10.269> we've<00:04:10.390> now<00:04:10.570> got<00:04:10.870> that

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
degrees rotation and we've now got that

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.680 
degrees rotation and we've now got that
cross<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.640> top<00:04:12.670> okay<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:15.570> there<00:04:16.570> we<00:04:16.660> are

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
cross on the top okay and there we are

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.449 
cross on the top okay and there we are
I've<00:04:17.500> actually<00:04:17.650> got<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:17.919> center<00:04:18.130> piece<00:04:18.220> but

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
I've actually got the center piece but

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.830 
I've actually got the center piece but
if<00:04:18.520> you<00:04:18.609> wanted<00:04:18.849> if<00:04:19.120> you<00:04:19.209> needed<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.479> rotate

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
if you wanted if you needed to rotate

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.759 
if you wanted if you needed to rotate
the<00:04:19.930> ten<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.140> be<00:04:20.229> just<00:04:20.650> do<00:04:20.770> that

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
the ten to be just do that

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.290 
the ten to be just do that
dofus<00:04:21.979> entities<00:04:22.370> around<00:04:22.550> until<00:04:23.000> they<00:04:23.060> lined

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
dofus entities around until they lined

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.800 
dofus entities around until they lined
up<00:04:23.449> and<00:04:23.569> then<00:04:23.690> you've<00:04:23.780> got<00:04:23.900> green<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.949> red

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
up and then you've got green and red

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.860 
up and then you've got green and red
white<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.110> red<00:04:27.400> yellow<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.520> red<00:04:28.819> and<00:04:29.060> blue

white and red yellow and red and blue
and<00:04:29.990> red<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.199> case<00:04:30.379> we<00:04:30.530> now<00:04:30.620> got<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.860> cross<00:04:31.129> on

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
and red the case we now got the cross on

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.980 
and red the case we now got the cross on
the<00:04:31.520> top<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:32.330> you've<00:04:32.449> got<00:04:32.509> all<00:04:32.629> the<00:04:32.750> colors

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
the top and you've got all the colors

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.559 
the top and you've got all the colors
around<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:33.289> side<00:04:33.500> in<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.340> right<00:04:34.580> places<00:04:34.849> okay

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
around the side in the right places okay

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.950 
around the side in the right places okay
that's<00:04:36.379> three<00:04:36.949> be<00:04:37.250> at<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.699> point<00:04:37.960> remember

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
that's three be at that point remember

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.950 
that's three be at that point remember
there<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:40.060> variation<00:04:41.060> on<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.419> point<00:04:41.780> and

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
there is a variation on that point and

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.529 
there is a variation on that point and
that's<00:04:42.139> when<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:43.430> red<00:04:43.610> piece<00:04:43.819> there<00:04:44.090> remember

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
that's when the red piece there remember

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.330 
that's when the red piece there remember
well<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.810> was<00:04:44.930> would<00:04:45.349> like<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.919> was<00:04:46.099> when<00:04:46.280> it

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
well it was would like it was when it

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.550 
well it was would like it was when it
was<00:04:47.919> underneath<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:50.000> correct<00:04:50.300> side<00:04:50.539> but<00:04:51.500> the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
was underneath the correct side but the

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.960 
was underneath the correct side but the
red<00:04:51.710> piece<00:04:51.919> is<00:04:52.069> facing<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.460> like<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:52.699> and

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
red piece is facing you like this and

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.589 
red piece is facing you like this and
the<00:04:53.030> way<00:04:53.120> we<00:04:53.240> did<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.539> in<00:04:53.810> part<00:04:54.259> 3a<00:04:55.330> was<00:04:56.330> to

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
the way we did that in part 3a was to

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.249 
the way we did that in part 3a was to
rotate<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.319> quarter<00:04:57.889> of<00:04:58.240> rotation<00:04:59.240> move<00:05:00.050> that

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
rotate it quarter of rotation move that

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.779 
rotate it quarter of rotation move that
red<00:05:00.409> piece<00:05:00.590> around<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.099> that's<00:05:01.280> on<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.580> side

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
red piece around so that's on the side

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.770 
red piece around so that's on the side
facing<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.509> and<00:05:03.849> then<00:05:04.849> move<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.150> up<00:05:05.270> oops<00:05:05.599> and

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
facing you and then move it up oops and

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.890 
facing you and then move it up oops and
then<00:05:05.840> move<00:05:06.319> it<00:05:06.409> up<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.740> top<00:05:06.909> okay<00:05:07.909> that's

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
then move it up to the top okay that's

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.800 
then move it up to the top okay that's
how<00:05:09.020> we<00:05:09.050> did<00:05:09.259> that<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:11.060> depending<00:05:11.599> on<00:05:11.690> which

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
how we did that and depending on which

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.719 
how we did that and depending on which
side<00:05:12.020> needs<00:05:12.289> to<00:05:12.440> go<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:13.099> can<00:05:13.250> rotate<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.669> a

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
side needs to go to you can rotate it a

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:14.980 
side needs to go to you can rotate it a
different<00:05:13.969> way<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.479> go<00:05:14.719> the<00:05:14.810> other<00:05:14.870> way

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
different way and go the other way

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.170 
different way and go the other way
around<00:05:15.080> so<00:05:15.409> that's<00:05:15.590> a<00:05:15.740> variation<00:05:16.639> of<00:05:16.759> that<00:05:16.819> one

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
around so that's a variation of that one
