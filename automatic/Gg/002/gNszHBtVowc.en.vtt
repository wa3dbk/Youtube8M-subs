00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.629 
and measure over four inches to begin my
pleat<00:02:15.510> which<00:02:16.139> puts<00:02:16.439> me<00:02:16.590> at<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.889> pocket<00:02:17.189> right

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639 
pleat which puts me at this pocket right

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.479 
pleat which puts me at this pocket right
here<00:02:17.670> now<00:02:18.510> each<00:02:18.749> pocket<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.439> highlighted<00:02:20.189> with

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
here now each pocket is highlighted with

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.149 
here now each pocket is highlighted with
the<00:02:20.849> yellow<00:02:21.209> stitching<00:02:22.019> going<00:02:22.200> across<00:02:22.769> here

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
the yellow stitching going across here

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.099 
the yellow stitching going across here
so<00:02:23.189> it's<00:02:23.519> easy<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.909> pick<00:02:24.389> out<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:24.780> one's<00:02:25.019> a

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
so it's easy to pick out which one's a

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.610 
so it's easy to pick out which one's a
pocket<00:02:25.499> and<00:02:25.709> which<00:02:25.889> ones<00:02:26.129> not<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.469> then<00:02:28.469> you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
pocket and which ones not and then you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.360 
pocket and which ones not and then you
would<00:02:28.799> typically<00:02:29.189> use<00:02:29.930> every<00:02:30.930> other<00:02:31.370> pocket

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
would typically use every other pocket

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.369 
would typically use every other pocket
so<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> insert<00:02:33.359> my<00:02:33.510> first<00:02:33.780> problem<00:02:34.049> into<00:02:34.349> the

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
so I insert my first problem into the

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.399 
so I insert my first problem into the
first<00:02:34.739> pocket<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:36.120> next<00:02:36.599> yellow<00:02:37.139> line

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
first pocket here the next yellow line

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.140 
first pocket here the next yellow line
is<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.650> next<00:02:37.980> pocket<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:38.609> going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.879> skip

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
is the next pocket I'm going to skip

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.929 
is the next pocket I'm going to skip
that<00:02:39.389> and<00:02:39.769> insert<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.919> next<00:02:41.189> problem<00:02:41.459> into

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
that and insert the next problem into

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.819 
that and insert the next problem into
this<00:02:42.150> pocket<00:02:42.450> way<00:02:42.810> over<00:02:43.049> here<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:45.709> then<00:02:46.709> I'm

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
this pocket way over here and then I'm

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.890 
this pocket way over here and then I'm
going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.810> see<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.500> line<00:02:49.939> pocket<00:02:50.939> skip<00:02:51.659> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
going to see this line pocket skip and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.869 
going to see this line pocket skip and
go<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.109> this<00:02:52.349> one<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.889> start<00:02:53.189> the<00:02:53.280> third<00:02:53.549> prong

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
go to this one and start the third prong

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.179 
go to this one and start the third prong
in<00:02:54.209> there<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:56.060> then<00:02:57.260> skip<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> pocket<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:58.980> move

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
in there and then skip a pocket and move

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.550 
in there and then skip a pocket and move
on<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.609> next<00:02:59.909> one<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.389> insert<00:03:00.719> that<00:03:00.750> prong

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
on to the next one and insert that prong

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.289 
on to the next one and insert that prong
there<00:03:02.069> now<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.340> know<00:03:02.430> my<00:03:02.549> hands<00:03:02.790> block<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
there now I know my hands block in the

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.649 
there now I know my hands block in the
view<00:03:03.569> but<00:03:04.349> I<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.579> problem<00:03:05.909> in<00:03:06.150> every<00:03:06.510> other

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.659 
view but I have a problem in every other
pocket<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.469> then<00:03:07.919> I'm<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.010> going<00:03:08.219> to<00:03:08.310> gently

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
pocket and then I'm just going to gently

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.649 
pocket and then I'm just going to gently
slide<00:03:09.629> this<00:03:10.109> up<00:03:10.819> so<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:12.000> problems<00:03:12.480> are

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:16.009 
inserted all the way into these pockets

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:25.909 
inserted all the way into these pockets
and<00:03:17.009> what<00:03:17.819> results<00:03:19.459> we<00:03:20.459> are<00:03:20.579> all<00:03:20.729> done<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:24.919> a

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
I've done a four-inch Basie and you can

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.770 
I've done a four-inch Basie and you can
modify<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.829> based<00:03:38.129> on<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:38.819> need<00:03:39.120> to

get to the finish width that you desire

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.119 
get to the finish width that you desire
I've<00:03:42.239> also<00:03:43.049> went<00:03:43.199> ahead<00:03:43.259> and<00:03:43.530> measured<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:44.099> a

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
I've also went ahead and measured in a

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.119 
I've also went ahead and measured in a
few<00:03:44.459> inches<00:03:44.639> for<00:03:45.150> my<00:03:45.329> overlap<00:03:46.229> or<00:03:46.470> return<00:03:46.859> so

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
few inches for my overlap or return so

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.809 
few inches for my overlap or return so
you'll<00:03:47.250> need<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.459> take<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:47.759> into

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
you'll need to take that into

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.030 
you'll need to take that into
consideration<00:03:48.180> as<00:03:48.870> well<00:03:49.680> when<00:03:49.949> you're

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
consideration as well when you're

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.610 
consideration as well when you're
creating<00:03:50.220> your<00:03:50.370> pleats<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.870> that's<00:03:52.049> very<00:03:52.349> easy

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
creating your pleats so that's very easy

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.319

to<00:03:52.829> create<00:03:53.129> your<00:03:53.220> triple<00:03:53.579> pinch<00:03:53.790> pleats<00:03:54.120> with

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
to create your triple pinch pleats with

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.930 
to create your triple pinch pleats with
these<00:03:54.419> four<00:03:54.659> prong
