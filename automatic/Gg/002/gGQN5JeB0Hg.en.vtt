00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.360

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.360
 I chose is to play what would you say 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.090
 two thousand years later 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.090

 do not look at God today, well here they lived 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.140
 almost almost intimidation the 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.379
 intimidation was born 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.830
 that is that being the strategy to do 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.830
 the fools 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.730
 no no no no way if you had done 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.850
 and start with the little dorado or the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.119
 ring that area 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.840

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.840
 use mana 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.100
 stop giving hits 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.480
 look at the face of the world that gave him a 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.480
 knock 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.520
 or will be doing something with your tongue 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.730
 remember that the intention is what 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.730
 there is god every day 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.569
 but but it does not appear in my school to say 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.319
 that not to separate will do something 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.030
 like shit if I'm a set-up I'm the one 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.810

 and vice versa anyway we lost 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.800
 the game if a little bit sad for him 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.020
 what he touches so he gives himself p no I do not think 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.759
 that between the goal is this year nor the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.210
 that follows neither the one who comes nor the one who 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.069
 comes in the one that comes but well I hope 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.169
 you liked it I know I can give it 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.580
 making or writing is appreciated ago 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.020
 a lot that I did not upload to this video style 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.130
 in fact he had only done once or twice 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.620
 with a cali blix trans and well if I see 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.409
 true confirms that they receive it well and 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.699
 I'll edit again and I'll be like that 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.139
 Well then we'll see you in the next 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:34.710
 video and that's it and as it says 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:37.830
 you choose me game so if they want 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:41.639
 some random pique and I know we 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.740
 called and the usual not badly failed of 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.599
 so they put it to me there and 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.939
 possibly do it so well then 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.939
