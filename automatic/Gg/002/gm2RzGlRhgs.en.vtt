what is up guys it's us and today we're
gonna<00:00:07.000> be<00:00:07.240> building<00:00:07.450> a<00:00:07.950> star<00:00:08.950> from<00:00:09.430> the<00:00:09.540> just

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
gonna be building a star from the just

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.109 
gonna be building a star from the just
Mario<00:00:11.139> I<00:00:11.350> don't<00:00:11.769> I<00:00:12.070> think<00:00:12.580> this<00:00:12.699> isn't<00:00:12.850> like

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:13.119 
Mario I don't I think this isn't like

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.609 
Mario I don't I think this isn't like
most<00:00:13.299> Mario's<00:00:13.719> but<00:00:13.869> I<00:00:13.900> think<00:00:14.109> it's<00:00:14.260> just<00:00:14.379> a

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:14.619 
most Mario's but I think it's just a

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.300 
most Mario's but I think it's just a
first<00:00:15.309> star<00:00:15.639> I<00:00:15.969> guess<00:00:16.660> just<00:00:17.619> a<00:00:17.710> regular<00:00:18.100> old

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
first star I guess just a regular old

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:26.239 
first star I guess just a regular old
star<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.260> I<00:00:20.470> just<00:00:20.740> built<00:00:20.949> that<00:00:21.189> like<00:00:21.970> just<00:00:22.449> now

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:26.249

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
I don't really can't really explain how

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
I don't really can't really explain how
to<00:00:38.410> build<00:00:39.570> um<00:00:40.570> besides<00:00:41.350> counting<00:00:42.039> out<00:00:42.160> and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
to build um besides counting out and

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.420 
to build um besides counting out and
counting<00:00:42.699> out<00:00:42.789> will<00:00:42.940> take<00:00:43.090> a<00:00:43.120> lot<00:00:43.329> longer<00:00:43.510> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
counting out will take a lot longer and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.360 
counting out will take a lot longer and
that'll<00:00:45.430> be<00:00:45.640> more<00:00:46.210> render<00:00:46.539> time<00:00:46.719> I'm<00:00:46.840> like

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that'll be more render time I'm like

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.040 
that'll be more render time I'm like
computer's<00:00:48.370> not<00:00:48.519> really<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:48.850> great<00:00:49.629> on<00:00:49.929> the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
computer's not really that great on the

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.439 
computer's not really that great on the
render<00:00:50.289> for<00:00:50.710> a<00:00:50.739> long<00:00:50.949> period<00:00:51.370> of<00:00:51.429> time<00:00:51.640> it's

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
render for a long period of time it's

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:59.880 
render for a long period of time it's
just<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.969> um<00:00:57.969> just<00:00:58.780> just<00:00:58.870> follow<00:00:59.379> along

just so um just just follow along
that's<00:01:00.070> how<00:01:00.309> I'm<00:01:00.879> building<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:03.039> is<00:01:03.219> actually

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
that's how I'm building this is actually

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.050 
that's how I'm building this is actually
a<00:01:03.699> fairly<00:01:04.089> easy<00:01:05.460> star<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.730> build<00:01:07.230> so<00:01:08.230> oh<00:01:09.060> been

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
a fairly easy star to build so oh been

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.090 
a fairly easy star to build so oh been
days<00:01:10.299> since<00:01:10.329> you<00:01:10.750> guys<00:01:10.869> always<00:01:11.110> don't<00:01:11.439> since

that time
Micra<00:01:14.439> oh<00:01:14.619> well<00:01:17.670> timed<00:01:18.670> oh<00:01:19.060> it's<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.810> think<00:01:20.049> it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
Micra oh well timed oh it's I think it's

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.550 
Micra oh well timed oh it's I think it's
0<00:01:20.560> times<00:01:20.829> at<00:01:21.009> 0<00:01:21.280> um<00:01:22.119> well<00:01:22.509> uh<00:01:22.540> I<00:01:23.049> guess<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.500> don't

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
0 times at 0 um well uh I guess I don't

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.590 
0 times at 0 um well uh I guess I don't
know<00:01:23.680> how<00:01:23.799> to<00:01:23.890> use<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.250> anymore<00:01:24.520> so<00:01:24.670> that's

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
know how to use that anymore so that's

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.960 
know how to use that anymore so that's
guess<00:01:26.110> great<00:01:26.409> always<00:01:27.040> it's<00:01:27.369> always<00:01:27.610> great<00:01:27.790> so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
guess great always it's always great so

guess great always it's always great so
one<00:01:28.329> two<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:29.380> go<00:01:29.439> well<00:01:30.250> basically<00:01:30.880> we<00:01:31.360> could

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
one two and go well basically we could

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.539 
one two and go well basically we could
just<00:01:31.750> build<00:01:31.869> one<00:01:32.200> side<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.219> then

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
just build one side of this and then

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.630 
just build one side of this and then
just<00:01:33.579> mirror<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.520> other<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:39.460> it's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
just mirror it on the other now it's

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.050 
just mirror it on the other now it's
time<00:01:39.939> set<00:01:40.180> day<00:01:40.390> oh<00:01:41.369> yeah<00:01:42.369> there<00:01:42.579> we<00:01:42.610> go<00:01:42.670> time

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
along I guess so I might recap it so

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.819 
along I guess so I might recap it so
you're<00:01:52.750> gonna<00:01:52.810> do<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:54.869> devil<00:01:55.869> stairways<00:01:56.469> I

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
you're gonna do the devil stairways I

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.429 
you're gonna do the devil stairways I
guess<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.399> could<00:01:57.549> call<00:01:57.700> these<00:01:57.939> now<00:01:58.439> you're

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
guess I could call these now you're

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.370 
guess I could call these now you're
gonna<00:01:59.530> do<00:01:59.770> it<00:01:59.950> 1<00:02:00.130> 2<00:02:00.490> 3<00:02:00.640> 4<00:02:00.909> times<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.659> this<00:02:02.049> is<00:02:02.229> the

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
gonna do it 1 2 3 4 times so this is the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.660 
gonna do it 1 2 3 4 times so this is the
3rd<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.659> 4th<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:05.649> on<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.920> 4th<00:02:06.159> it's<00:02:06.430> just

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
3rd and 4th and on the 4th it's just

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.630 
3rd and 4th and on the 4th it's just
gonna<00:02:06.820> be<00:02:07.140> you're<00:02:08.140> gonna<00:02:08.259> go<00:02:08.470> in<00:02:08.680> 4<00:02:09.100> times<00:02:09.280> I

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
gonna be you're gonna go in 4 times I

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.529 
gonna be you're gonna go in 4 times I
think<00:02:09.850> once

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
think once

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:19.819 
think once
for<00:02:11.519> no<00:02:12.519> you're<00:02:12.730> gonna<00:02:12.819> go<00:02:12.969> in<00:02:13.090> 5<00:02:13.329> so<00:02:13.810> 1<00:02:14.530> 2<00:02:14.790> 3<00:02:16.409> 4<00:02:17.409> 5

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
for no you're gonna go in 5 so 1 2 3 4 5

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.259 
for no you're gonna go in 5 so 1 2 3 4 5
and<00:02:20.829> then<00:02:21.129> on<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.549> sixth<00:02:21.849> one<00:02:22.000> you're<00:02:22.180> gonna

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
and then on the sixth one you're gonna

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:30.149 
and then on the sixth one you're gonna
want<00:02:22.719> to<00:02:22.780> go<00:02:22.840> up<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.540> then<00:02:25.989> go<00:02:26.019> over<00:02:26.590> 1<00:02:26.859> up<00:02:27.370> 2<00:02:29.159> up

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
want to go up and then go over 1 up 2 up

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.190 
want to go up and then go over 1 up 2 up
2<00:02:30.549> over<00:02:31.180> 1<00:02:31.569> up<00:02:32.200> 2<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.400> then<00:02:33.780> that's<00:02:34.780> basically

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
2 over 1 up 2 and then that's basically

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
all it really is is the star so that

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:45.360 
all it really is is the star so that
will<00:03:34.359> go<00:03:34.479> out<00:03:34.510> 1<00:03:35.199> 2<00:03:36.209> 3<00:03:37.209> 4<00:03:37.479> 5<00:03:37.949> 1<00:03:38.949> 2<00:03:38.979> 3<00:03:39.780> 1<00:03:40.780> 2<00:03:41.049> 3<00:03:41.260> 4<00:03:42.250> 5
