00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
disorientating at first since there's

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.900

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
character with the left analog the

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
analog and then there's control with

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.650 
analog and then there's control with
your<00:00:48.290> aim<00:00:48.560> with<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.190> actual<00:00:49.550> gyro<00:00:49.940> sensor<00:00:50.450> in

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
your aim with the actual gyro sensor in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.720 
your aim with the actual gyro sensor in
the<00:00:50.690> gamepad<00:00:51.320> which<00:00:51.560> that<00:00:51.920> might<00:00:52.100> turn<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.430> lot

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
the gamepad which that might turn a lot

the gamepad which that might turn a lot
of<00:00:52.880> people<00:00:53.120> off<00:00:53.270> but<00:00:53.810> honestly<00:00:54.440> once<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.370> just

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
of people off but honestly once you just

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.580 
of people off but honestly once you just
get<00:00:55.760> used<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:56.600> becomes<00:00:57.170> really

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
get used to it it becomes really

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.350 
get used to it it becomes really
intuitive<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.370> there's<00:00:58.790> really<00:00:59.030> only<00:00:59.150> two

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
intuitive and there's really only two

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.390 
intuitive and there's really only two
buns<00:00:59.720> you<00:00:59.870> absolutely<00:01:00.680> need<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:00.950> use

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
buns you absolutely need to use

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.070 
buns you absolutely need to use
everything<00:01:01.970> else<00:01:02.300> feels<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.720> little<00:01:02.900> bit

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
everything else feels a little bit

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.200 
everything else feels a little bit
optional<00:01:03.560> like<00:01:03.860> there<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.250> jump<00:01:04.699> button<00:01:04.909> but

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
optional like there is a jump button but

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.060 
optional like there is a jump button but
I<00:01:05.239> never<00:01:05.509> really<00:01:05.780> jumped<00:01:06.259> that<00:01:06.409> much<00:01:06.710> though

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
I never really jumped that much though

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.100

actually<00:01:34.100> these<00:01:34.520> squid<00:01:35.120> people<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.990> you

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
actually these squid people and you

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.930 
actually these squid people and you
shoot<00:01:36.590> each<00:01:36.710> other<00:01:36.860> with<00:01:36.979> pink<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.550> try<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
shoot each other with pink and try to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.640 
shoot each other with pink and try to
cover<00:01:38.150> as<00:01:38.270> much<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.810> battlefield<00:01:39.350> as<00:01:39.530> you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
cover as much as the battlefield as you

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.620 
cover as much as the battlefield as you
can<00:01:39.950> with<00:01:40.190> your<00:01:40.310> own<00:01:40.460> color<00:01:40.790> it's<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.300> very

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
can with your own color it's a very

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.990 
can with your own color it's a very
simple<00:01:42.140> concept<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:42.890> far<00:01:43.130> as<00:01:43.220> how<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.400> shooters

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
simple concept as far as how I shooters

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.630 
simple concept as far as how I shooters
mechanics<00:01:44.840> goes<00:01:45.080> but<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:45.680> really<00:01:45.979> fun<00:01:46.370> I

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
mechanics goes but it's really fun I

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.370 
mechanics goes but it's really fun I
tried<00:01:47.030> out<00:01:47.060> every<00:01:47.390> single<00:01:47.570> weapon<00:01:47.930> they<00:01:48.200> had

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
tried out every single weapon they had

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.560 
tried out every single weapon they had
available<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.890> see<00:01:49.250> what<00:01:49.760> they<00:01:49.940> were<00:01:50.000> like<00:01:50.299> I

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
available to see what they were like I

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.730 
available to see what they were like I
didn't<00:01:50.930> really<00:01:51.049> see<00:01:51.320> much<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.710> difference

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
didn't really see much of a difference

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.170 
didn't really see much of a difference
between<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.430> splatter<00:01:52.700> shot<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.120> the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
is a charge shot which is like a sniper

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.609 
is a charge shot which is like a sniper
rifle<00:02:01.100> which<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:01.970> your<00:02:02.119> aim<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.299> good<00:02:02.690> then<00:02:03.200> you

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
rifle which if your aim is good then you

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.289 
rifle which if your aim is good then you
could<00:02:03.799> be<00:02:03.920> really<00:02:04.070> good<00:02:04.190> with<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.610> but<00:02:04.820> I'm<00:02:05.060> not

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
could be really good with it but I'm not

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.940 
could be really good with it but I'm not
very<00:02:05.600> good<00:02:05.750> at<00:02:05.900> my<00:02:05.990> aim<00:02:06.229> which<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.740> why<00:02:06.920> I

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
very good at my aim which is why I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.309 
very good at my aim which is why I
mostly<00:02:07.490> went<00:02:07.820> with<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.149> ink<00:02:08.360> roller<00:02:08.539> which<00:02:09.170> is

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
mostly went with the ink roller which is

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.619 
mostly went with the ink roller which is
this<00:02:09.560> giant<00:02:09.950> paint<00:02:10.519> roller<00:02:10.849> that<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.299> just

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
this giant paint roller that you just

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.140 
this giant paint roller that you just
like<00:02:12.049> splat<00:02:12.769> on<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.040> ground<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.549> then<00:02:13.700> cover

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
like splat on the ground and then cover

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.179 
like splat on the ground and then cover
as<00:02:14.329> much<00:02:14.480> as<00:02:14.629> you<00:02:14.719> can<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.409> can<00:02:15.560> actually<00:02:15.709> hide

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
as much as you can you can actually hide

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.070 
as much as you can you can actually hide
and<00:02:16.549> hit

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
and hit

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.290 
and hit
with<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.860> seemed<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.340> be<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.490> popular<00:02:18.850> choice

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
with it it seemed to be a popular choice

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.090 
with it it seemed to be a popular choice
for<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.630> lot<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.960> people<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.440> guess<00:02:20.710> because<00:02:20.980> it

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
for a lot of people I guess because it

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.310 
for a lot of people I guess because it
was<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.580> easy<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.120> use<00:02:22.150> some<00:02:23.080> people

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
was just really easy to use some people

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.200 
was just really easy to use some people
said<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.590> was<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.710> bit<00:02:23.920> overpowered<00:02:24.490> but<00:02:24.820> then

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
said it was a bit overpowered but then

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.820 
said it was a bit overpowered but then
again<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:25.660> you're<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.170> rolling<00:02:26.620> and

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
again if you're just rolling and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.790 
again if you're just rolling and
somebody<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.310> sniping<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.000> then<00:02:28.540> you're<00:02:29.170> gone

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
somebody is sniping you then you're gone

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.560 
somebody is sniping you then you're gone
so<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.460> do<00:02:30.670> need<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:31.000> aware<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.450> your

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
so you do need to be aware of your

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.570 
so you do need to be aware of your
surroundings<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.470> have<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.160> no<00:02:33.280> good

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
surroundings and have you no good

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.950 
surroundings and have you no good
teammates<00:02:33.970> though<00:02:34.210> this<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.510> was<00:02:34.660> was

sure if you have a team of friends you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.110 
sure if you have a team of friends you
might<00:02:38.560> be<00:02:38.710> able<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.980> strategize<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.640> bit<00:02:39.940> more

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
might be able to strategize a bit more

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.060 
might be able to strategize a bit more
as<00:02:40.540> far<00:02:40.840> as<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.020> online<00:02:41.380> itself<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.920> didn't

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
as far as the online itself it didn't

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.100 
as far as the online itself it didn't
really<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.460> much<00:02:42.490> lag<00:02:43.000> at<00:02:43.180> all<00:02:43.300> for<00:02:43.630> me<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
really have much lag at all for me the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.200 
really have much lag at all for me the
only<00:02:44.350> trouble<00:02:44.560> i<00:02:44.770> had<00:02:45.040> was<00:02:45.250> getting<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.910> when

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
only trouble i had was getting in when

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.910 
only trouble i had was getting in when
it<00:02:46.300> first<00:02:46.540> started<00:02:46.990> which<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.530> guess<00:02:47.560> that's

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
it first started which I guess that's

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.410 
it first started which I guess that's
understandable<00:02:48.070> with<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> first<00:02:49.180> couple

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
understandable with the first couple

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.330 
understandable with the first couple
minutes<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.200> once<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.590> got<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.980> i<00:02:51.130> didn't

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
minutes but once I got in i didn't

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.710 
minutes but once I got in i didn't
really<00:02:51.430> have<00:02:51.640> much<00:02:51.670> trouble<00:02:52.060> except<00:02:52.480> for<00:02:52.630> my

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
really have much trouble except for my

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.390 
really have much trouble except for my
second<00:02:53.230> match<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.920> was<00:02:54.070> really<00:02:54.190> just

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
second match and that was really just

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.770 
second match and that was really just
waiting<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.820> get<00:02:54.910> people<00:02:55.240> in<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.420> room<00:02:55.600> to

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
waiting to get people in the room to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.810 
waiting to get people in the room to
play<00:02:55.930> with<00:02:55.959> me<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.620> far<00:02:56.890> I'm<00:02:57.100> really<00:02:57.370> liking
