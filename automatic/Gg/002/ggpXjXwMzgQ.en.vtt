hi<00:00:01.230> there<00:00:01.410> my<00:00:01.650> name<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.829> John<00:00:02.100> Carlson<00:00:02.520> and

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hi there my name is John Carlson and

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.420 
hi there my name is John Carlson and
today<00:00:03.419> I'm<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.689> demonstrate<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.430> new

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
today I'm going to demonstrate a new

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.789 
today I'm going to demonstrate a new
ratchet<00:00:05.940> strap<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.450> admitted<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.080> is

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
ratchet strap that I admitted that is

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.749 
ratchet strap that I admitted that is
currently<00:00:08.420> Pat<00:00:09.420> pending<00:00:10.400> what's<00:00:11.400> unique

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
currently Pat pending what's unique

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.570 
currently Pat pending what's unique
about<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.290> ratchet<00:00:13.740> mechanism<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
about this is the ratchet mechanism is

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.050 
about this is the ratchet mechanism is
totally<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> side<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.850> not<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
totally on the side and not in the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.609 
totally on the side and not in the
middle<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> rationale<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.380> does

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
middle of the rationale what this does

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.429 
middle of the rationale what this does
is<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.010> frees<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> lot<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.820> space<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.510> self

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
is it frees up a lot of space to self

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.519 
is it frees up a lot of space to self
store<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.820> reel<00:00:24.199> there's<00:00:25.199> other

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
store this on the reel there's other

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
store this on the reel there's other
self<00:00:25.859> storing<00:00:26.220> ratchets<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> market<00:00:27.330> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
self storing ratchets on the market and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.779 
self storing ratchets on the market and
they're<00:00:28.170> primarily<00:00:28.650> drawbacks<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.670> can

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
they're primarily drawbacks are they can

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.319 
they're primarily drawbacks are they can
only<00:00:29.939> hold<00:00:30.240> six<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.050> feet<00:00:31.730> on<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.149> reel

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
only hold six or so feet on the reel

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.610 
only hold six or so feet on the reel
because<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.890> ratcheting<00:00:35.370> mechanism

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
because of the the ratcheting mechanism

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
because of the the ratcheting mechanism
I've<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> full<00:00:38.219> 15<00:00:38.730> foot<00:00:39.000> ratchet<00:00:39.450> strap

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
ratchet strap is self guiding so it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.090 
ratchet strap is self guiding so it
doesn't<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:09.000> any<00:01:09.180> real<00:01:09.510> skill<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.890> this
