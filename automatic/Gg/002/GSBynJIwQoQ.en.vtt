hello<00:00:34.190> now<00:00:34.850> that<00:00:35.120> we've<00:00:35.270> explored<00:00:35.650> basic

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
hello now that we've explored basic

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.740 
hello now that we've explored basic
camera<00:00:37.220> settings<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:37.940> some<00:00:38.240> simple

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
camera settings and some simple

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.080 
camera settings and some simple
techniques<00:00:39.260> let's<00:00:39.860> now<00:00:40.160> take<00:00:40.220> a<00:00:40.490> look<00:00:40.790> at

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
techniques let's now take a look at

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
techniques let's now take a look at
picture<00:00:41.690> composition<00:00:42.380> one<00:00:43.100> of<00:00:43.310> the<00:00:43.460> most

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
picture composition one of the most

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.750 
picture composition one of the most
important<00:00:45.110> principle<00:00:45.650> in<00:00:45.830> photography<00:00:46.610> is

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
important principle in photography is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.240 
important principle in photography is
the<00:00:47.030> rule<00:00:47.240> of<00:00:47.270> thirds<00:00:47.630> the<00:00:48.410> rules<00:00:48.740> of<00:00:48.980> this

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
the rule of thirds the rules of this

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.940 
the rule of thirds the rules of this
tells<00:00:49.910> us<00:00:50.090> where<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.480> place<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.230> subject<00:00:51.530> and

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
tells us where to place the subject and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.210 
tells us where to place the subject and
how<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.520> compose<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.420> picture<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:55.100> is

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
how to compose the picture so that it is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.150 
how to compose the picture so that it is
more<00:00:55.640> balanced<00:00:56.320> interesting<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.500> pleasing

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
more balanced interesting and pleasing

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.540 
more balanced interesting and pleasing
to<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.400> eye<00:00:58.430> here's<00:00:59.360> how<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.720> works<00:01:00.040> imagine<00:01:01.040> a

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
to the eye here's how it works imagine a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.090 
to the eye here's how it works imagine a
picture<00:01:01.880> that's<00:01:02.270> divided<00:01:02.960> into<00:01:03.410> thirds<00:01:03.739> both

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
picture that's divided into thirds both

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.940 
picture that's divided into thirds both
horizontally<00:01:04.660> and<00:01:05.660> vertically<00:01:06.650> like<00:01:07.520> this

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
horizontally and vertically like this

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.609 
horizontally and vertically like this
now<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.670> rule<00:01:11.000> says<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.660> object<00:01:12.110> our

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
now the rule says that the object our

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.609 
now the rule says that the object our
points<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.280> interest<00:01:13.910> should<00:01:14.450> be<00:01:14.600> arranged<00:01:15.080> at

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
points of interest should be arranged at

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.760 
points of interest should be arranged at
the<00:01:15.890> intersections<00:01:16.670> or<00:01:17.320> along<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.560> grid

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
the intersections or along the grid

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.180 
the intersections or along the grid
lines<00:01:19.040> for<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.580> best<00:01:19.880> effect<00:01:20.979> this<00:01:21.979> is

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
lines for the best effect this is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.030 
lines for the best effect this is
because<00:01:22.610> studies<00:01:23.270> say<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:23.800> people's<00:01:24.800> eyes

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
because studies say that people's eyes

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.910 
because studies say that people's eyes
usually<00:01:25.700> go<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.240> one<00:01:26.690> of<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.259> intersection

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
usually go to one of the intersection

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.620 
usually go to one of the intersection
points<00:01:28.310> natch

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
points natch

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.320 
points natch
if<00:01:29.720> your<00:01:30.170> photo<00:01:30.439> has<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.770> subject<00:01:31.159> of<00:01:31.640> interest

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
if your photo has a subject of interest

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.590 
if your photo has a subject of interest
that<00:01:33.200> according<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.250> rule<00:01:34.520> after<00:01:34.820> it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
that according to the rule after it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.609 
that according to the rule after it
should<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:35.960> placed<00:01:36.350> along<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.280> gridlines

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
should be placed along the gridlines

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.210 
should be placed along the gridlines
probably<00:01:39.619> around<00:01:40.070> where<00:01:40.460> they<00:01:40.640> intersect<00:01:41.030> and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
probably around where they intersect and

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.310 
probably around where they intersect and
if<00:01:43.220> your<00:01:43.490> photo<00:01:43.729> has<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.119> scene<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.960> is

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
if your photo has a scene that is

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.810 
if your photo has a scene that is
divided<00:01:46.040> by<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.729> horizon<00:01:47.720> or<00:01:48.500> line<00:01:48.830> or<00:01:49.190> break

divided by a horizon or line or break

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.300 
divided by a horizon or line or break
then<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.659> device<00:01:51.170> should<00:01:51.619> be<00:01:51.770> placed<00:01:52.070> along

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
then the device should be placed along

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.139 
then the device should be placed along
one<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.360> grid<00:01:53.600> lines<00:01:54.369> see<00:01:55.369> what<00:01:55.580> I<00:01:55.610> mean

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
one of the grid lines see what I mean

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.810 
one of the grid lines see what I mean
so<00:01:56.810> whenever<00:01:57.710> you're<00:01:58.100> about<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.580> take<00:01:58.789> a

so whenever you're about to take a

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.139 
so whenever you're about to take a
picture<00:01:59.210> ask<00:01:59.960> yourself<00:02:00.590> first<00:02:00.830> what<00:02:01.759> are<00:02:02.000> the

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
picture ask yourself first what are the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.710 
picture ask yourself first what are the
points<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.720> interest<00:02:03.350> then<00:02:04.250> apply<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.240> rule

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
points of interest then apply the rule

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.290 
points of interest then apply the rule
of<00:02:05.960> thirds<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.830> those<00:02:07.069> point<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.819> interest

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
of thirds to those point of interest

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.910 
of thirds to those point of interest
such<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.319> simple<00:02:09.979> rule<00:02:10.250> yet<00:02:10.850> it<00:02:11.120> will<00:02:11.269> have<00:02:11.540> an

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
such a simple rule yet it will have an

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.490 
such a simple rule yet it will have an
incredible<00:02:12.920> impact<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.640> your<00:02:13.940> photos<00:02:14.500> but

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
incredible impact on your photos but

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.370 
incredible impact on your photos but
remember<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.459> rule<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.750> guide<00:02:17.989> and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
remember the rule is just a guide and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.070 
remember the rule is just a guide and
like<00:02:18.860> any<00:02:19.100> other<00:02:19.610> rules<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.540> sometimes

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
like any other rules it's sometimes

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.449 
like any other rules it's sometimes
meant<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:21.739> broken

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
meant to be broken

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.450 
meant to be broken
give<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.360> shot<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.840> see<00:02:23.900> for<00:02:24.620> yourself

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
give it a shot and see for yourself

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.490 
give it a shot and see for yourself
ah
