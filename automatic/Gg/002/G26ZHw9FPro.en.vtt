it<00:03:51.020> would<00:03:51.170> come<00:03:51.380> up<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.739> about<00:03:52.010> forty<00:03:52.489> seven

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820

its<00:05:04.080> capacitance<00:05:04.910> so<00:05:05.910> we<00:05:06.120> tuned<00:05:06.420> to

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
its capacitance so we tuned to
