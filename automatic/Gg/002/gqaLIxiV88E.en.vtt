days<00:04:46.080> or<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:47.280> gradients<00:04:48.030> are<00:04:48.180> zinc<00:04:48.750> oxide

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
days or so the gradients are zinc oxide

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.790 
days or so the gradients are zinc oxide
silicon<00:04:49.950> dioxide<00:04:50.220> meth<00:04:51.060> it'll<00:04:51.810> sound<00:04:52.620> like

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
silicon dioxide meth it'll sound like

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.540 
silicon dioxide meth it'll sound like
