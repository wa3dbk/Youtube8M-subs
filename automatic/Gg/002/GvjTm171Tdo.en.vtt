00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.689
 with the support of online tattoo shop 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.689
 tattoo equipment now 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.350
 hello everyone my name has caught 20 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.010
 years under and loud doing all 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.740
 recently a month has passed because 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 always wanted for a long time 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.710
 I wonder I did another half 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.949
 years ago 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 but I do not take into account because it was 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:44.850
 somehow unknowingly incomprehensible we just 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.100
 sat in the cabin and in the middle of the night me 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.390
 suddenly wanted from to for some reason stupidly on 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.729
 forged painted. this is a sketch of a cook 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.309
 and they gave me a wheelbarrow nothing explained 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.550
 I understood very much that I would do what was going on 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.180
 and start panicking and death with a scythe on 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.650
 leg colossus then doing it quite recently 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.980
 also did not understand what was happening at all 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.980
 what am i doing after this we started me 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.060
 to teach only tradition 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.970
 but this one is always interesting to me 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 whine and do bottom only black 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.560
 tattoos will do too 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.380
 black 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.729
 rox and because i think that on the body 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.939
 she looks more impressive she is 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.820
 more durable 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.630
 inspires me to work everything all that 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.479
 happening around me these are people emotions and 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.700
 experiencing some operations that 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:50.720
 animals live movie music all that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.159
 I work like the rest of the wheelbarrows in 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.280
 accident and domestic rtr pigments 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:03.819
 Of course the speaker but I want to try 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.439
 the lens for newbies the same way i want 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.459
 advise a lot to draw 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.299
 draw around the clock 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.430
 draw more than prick what 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.799
 competition is wildly great masters though 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.010
 ass chew and everyone does about 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.190
 There are always identical jobs to choose from 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.370
 that's so do not be afraid 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.370
 experiment 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.680
 draw do something your look for your 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:39.310
 style and then success will come to you 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.230
 less smoke and smoke less 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.230
 come to my sessions 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.470
 the main thing to do qualitatively is not important 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.910
 what are you doing you can search your 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.530
 style is developing something 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.099
 individual either do something 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.099
 traditions
