00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello friends with you, radoslav alexey and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.180
 today we will talk as you could 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.470
 guess about the wonderful game boom beach 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.470
 whip fuck 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.599
 here so spontaneously came home from work 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.430
 with a workout and recorded a video about the grenadiers 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.330
 about one of the part of the update which 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.740
 It turned out today, December 9 to 14 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.640
 sorry about everything update i today 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.890
 I will not have time to record a video and transfer it 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.019
 weekend event for me to be 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.870
 more time to shoot and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.940
 directly on the processing and you to 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.890
 there was more time to watch and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 proper evaluation of this video therefore 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.329
 let's not talk too much 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 words and see what this unit 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.230
 grenadier and what it is eaten with and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.860
 in order to meet him 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.469
 closer we move into my gunsmith 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.210
 By the way, this unit opens with 16 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.070
 June, then a weapon that is, if you 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.489
 the level of the weapon is not compressed unfortunately you 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.120
 until you can play here if you 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.090
 16 level please, welcome 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.470
 play and have fun 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.909
 I will tell you a little about this unity 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.560
 later when along with you him 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.939
 test now let's see 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.600
 some general characteristics 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.820
 this is above all 450 units of health this 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.909
 eight thousand gold coins worth it 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.189
 learning is six places space 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.310
 which he occupies 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.770
 your boats he learns 15 minutes one 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.470
 unit moves unfortunately very 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.650
 slowly but at the same time his attack range 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.450
 very happy just disastrous 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.729
 long distance is actually what 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.720
 here it is written very far of course so 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.780
 it is impossible to say in Russian 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.399
 developers who can ban them and here 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.060
 range really pleases and damage in 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.490
 second 100 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.310
 that is pretty good pretty 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.470
 great here is the cost of improving it on 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.659
 second level is 4 million 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.340
 gold coins that we actually for it 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.939
 offered for that we are invited 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.110
 plus 27 units to lives plus 1000 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.460
 gold coins to 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.050
 cost and plus 8 units to damage in 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.220
 give me a sec 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.020
 Actually, I would show you a little 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.170
 more information but unfortunately for now 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.520
 that I couldn't play on foreign wikis 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.250
 find information on this unit 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.920
 full because not all of it yet 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.450
 pumped to the end even tops 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.980
 usually on the wiki appears information about 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.100
 units sometime gradually 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.330
 pumps something and administrators 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.820
 little by little they have information and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.830
 generally speaking the actual name of this 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.590
 unit then I would call him a rocket launcher 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.260
 because well firstly literal 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.640
 translation from English of the name 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.400
 This unit will be exactly a rocket launcher 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.530
 or a grenade thrower because he 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.810
 tosses the grenade to throw them away 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.390
 away from yourself 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.130
 Well, actually it would be in my 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.380
 look more successful name but not 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.590
 less grenadier by 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.570
 laconic shorter here and now as I do 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.310
 said earlier let's test this 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.620
 unit actually see how he 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.920
 attacks and for starters I'll show you 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.739
 actually what I will attack 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.090
 I will attack the following composition 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.360
 troops apologize these are three boats with 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.110
 mountains of five pieces this is one boat with 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.570
 beetles 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.110
 8 pieces and actually three boats with 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.480
 grenadiers in stock they will have 9 pieces 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.489
 three pieces on each boat and so here 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.640
 I actually found less strong 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.110
 adversary on our map and now we 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.870
 try to attack him 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.830
 our army which includes the new unit 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.600
 grenadier and parallel i will try 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.640
 release any comments that 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.610
 may be useful to you and maybe 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.070
 and no but not the essence and so by the way 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.019
 new chip here it is with the selection 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.100
 areas of attack she is simply superb and 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.100
 because earlier when 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.440
 you attack here and you start throwing 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.299
 somewhere fire which attracts 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.480
 players he could neither get out because 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.950
 you clicked no to active zone 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.830
 But now there will be no such mistakes. 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.599
 thanks to this innovation very much 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.010
 cool cool really me 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.320
 liked put like if you too 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.709
 liked it nevertheless let's 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.540
 come to attack and attack rocket first 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.330
 launcher and that stand on this base 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.260
 here we actually carried 2 volleys 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.039
 rocket launcher and 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.880
 and let's take out the far boom canon 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.470
 which will be the most dangerous for my 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.699
 units because it is far away 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.850
 you get to him a lot you can lose here 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:48.449
 now actually landed ahead 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.139
 giants for giants sound and immediately boats 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.060
 with grenadiers that's worth noting that 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.680
 I liked the grenadier before 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.199
 altogether this range is very 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.010
 the steep range is just prohibitive and 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:05.039
 another trick is that this is the first unit 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.930
 completely uid which deals damage immediately to 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.720
 several zones that is, it does not attack 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.240
 some specific purpose he throws 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.910
 just on the ball your grenades and at the same time 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.990
 takes out mines if his grenade fall into 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.450
 Mines that is activated from a very 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.520
 cool before that very little i saw units 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:27.240
 which they actually do in general 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.580
 they were not what kind of nonsense I say that you 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.860
 See how this miracle attacks a man 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.789
 just generally very cool bring me 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.300
 energy points for one-two only so here 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.860
 while I almost do not bear any losses 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.500
 well that's actually very cool very 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.340
 cool surely this unit deserves 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.409
 attention and respect I think that soon he 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.689
 will become 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.239
 one of the most popular units in this 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.999
 the game but again I can only make mistakes 

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:58.949
 my opinion actually you now saw 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:03.389
 just attacking the base 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:06.269
 level forty here you are now 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.099
 let's see its results well on resources not 

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:12.300
 look I attacked now we are on resources 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:15.479
 and based on the strength of the base, so I lost one 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.419
 of the giants I lost three zooks but 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.080
 By this I climbed the resource well, actually about 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.389
 victories 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.159
 also worth noting that I attacked with 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.099
 comment and that's basically been 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:27.419
 concentrated on them they are on the very 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.039
 fighting attacked with a computer on a common can 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.949
 many come up with different excuses why 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.409
 I lost one of the giants 11 city but 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.589
 not the bottom line 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:40.050
 my first impression of this is unity 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:43.009
 after the test, the unit is a cool strong unit and 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.749
 definitely deserves the attention of the players 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.999
 that's unlike in June but the clash of 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:50.819
 clans which was added quite a long time ago 

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:53.279
 hound this unit is obviously something 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.959
 stands out from all players from all 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.050
 units that boom currently has 

00:06:54.959 --> 00:07:00.689
 beach even by the way if you 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.490
 noticed no movement I think 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:04.979
 that soon the animation 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.349
 moving all units will fix that 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.329
 and let down and to more realistic 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.879
 movement probably will be more correct 

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:13.679
 say so friends if you like 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.759
