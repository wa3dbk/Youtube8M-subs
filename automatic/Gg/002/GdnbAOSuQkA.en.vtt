00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the game today which we have been in

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.990 
the game today which we have been in
other<00:00:54.300> games<00:00:54.890> even<00:00:55.890> even<00:00:56.399> when<00:00:56.550> were<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.850> no

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
other games even even when were one no

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.270 
other games even even when were one no
didn't<00:00:57.449> feel<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> we're<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:59.100> didn't

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
didn't feel that we're really we didn't

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.549 
didn't feel that we're really we didn't
really<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.550> into<00:00:59.609> rhythm<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> whole<00:01:01.320> game

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
really get into rhythm in the whole game

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
really get into rhythm in the whole game
and<00:01:03.470> obviously<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.790> should<00:01:05.970> off<00:01:06.090> we

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and obviously you know we should off we

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.460 
and obviously you know we should off we
should<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.540> done<00:01:06.659> better<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> goal<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
should have done better but the goal the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.539 
should have done better but the goal the
goal<00:01:07.500> keeper<00:01:07.740> she<00:01:07.950> received<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:10.549> what's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
goal keeper she received it and what's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.370 
goal keeper she received it and what's
talked<00:01:11.760> deservedly<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.689> back<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.140> because

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
talked deservedly get back in it because

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.810 
talked deservedly get back in it because
it<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.770> under<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> lot<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> pressure<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.640> maybe

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
it was under a lot of pressure and maybe

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
it was under a lot of pressure and maybe
a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.180> fortunate<00:01:15.960> maybe<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> they

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
a little bit fortunate maybe that they

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.130 
a little bit fortunate maybe that they
didn't<00:01:16.680> score<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> second<00:01:17.689> but<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
didn't score a second but I think that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.330 
didn't score a second but I think that
we<00:01:19.229> either<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.470> chance<00:01:19.740> rate<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> end

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
we either be chance rate at the end

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
we either be chance rate at the end
maybe<00:01:20.520> -<00:01:20.729> Nick<00:01:21.000> -<00:01:21.210> Steven<00:01:21.750> Pino<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:25.140> not

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
maybe - Nick - Steven Pino so I'm not

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.899 
maybe - Nick - Steven Pino so I'm not
disappointed<00:01:25.590> by<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> point<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.580> I'm<00:01:26.729> not

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
disappointed by the point but I'm not

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.050 
disappointed by the point but I'm not
over<00:01:27.119> ecstatic<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.720> her<00:01:27.810> either

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
over ecstatic with her either

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
over ecstatic with her either
yeah<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.360> right<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:30.900> yeah<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.009> good

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
yeah that's right that's yeah a good

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.940 
yeah that's right that's yeah a good
record<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.000> thought<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.750> thought<00:01:34.530> maybe<00:01:34.799> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
record and I thought I thought maybe it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.200 
record and I thought I thought maybe it
was<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.369> oh<00:01:35.400> dude<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.790> got<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> goal

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
was going to be oh dude we got the goal

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
was going to be oh dude we got the goal
and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:37.860> he<00:01:37.979> gives<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.189> chance<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and then when I was he gives a chance to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.340 
and then when I was he gives a chance to
make<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.060> thought<00:01:39.329> well<00:01:39.630> maybe<00:01:39.659> maybe

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
make it to I thought well maybe maybe

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.050 
make it to I thought well maybe maybe
this<00:01:40.590> may<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:41.040> LD<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.820> wasn't<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> be

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.389 

yeah<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.090> would<00:01:47.600> probably<00:01:47.630> see<00:01:48.079> it<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.829> my<00:01:49.130> mind

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
yeah I would probably see it in my mind

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.649 
yeah I would probably see it in my mind
it<00:01:49.579> may<00:01:49.670> have<00:01:49.820> been<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.000> purist<00:01:50.329> will<00:01:50.450> point

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
it may have been a purist will point

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.780 
it may have been a purist will point
this<00:01:50.750> year<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:52.100> tells<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.460> story<00:01:52.490> that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
this year but it tells the story that

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.160 
this year but it tells the story that
I'm<00:01:52.970> disappointed<00:01:53.479> that<00:01:53.509> I'm<00:01:53.630> common<00:01:53.840> extort

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
I'm disappointed that I'm common extort

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.289 
I'm disappointed that I'm common extort
and<00:01:54.289> run<00:01:54.470> one<00:01:54.619> each<00:01:54.770> but<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.610> think<00:01:56.000> you've<00:01:56.119> told

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
and run one each but I think you've told

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.670 
and run one each but I think you've told
the<00:01:56.420> whole<00:01:56.570> we<00:01:56.689> played<00:01:56.960> football<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.619> the
