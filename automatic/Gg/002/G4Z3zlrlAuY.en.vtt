isolate<00:03:32.220> cual<00:03:32.760> well<00:03:32.910> if<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.270> do<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.630> this

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
isolate cual well if I just do this this

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.180 
isolate cual well if I just do this this
is<00:03:34.470> at<00:03:34.590> full<00:03:34.770> volume<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:35.580> I'd<00:03:35.730> be<00:03:35.820> quiet<00:03:37.190> so

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.800 
is at full volume and if I'd be quiet so
you<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.640> hardly<00:03:38.820> hear<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:39.450> if<00:03:39.570> you're<00:03:39.720> on

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
you can hardly hear it so if you're on

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.330 
you can hardly hear it so if you're on
the<00:03:39.840> bus<00:03:40.080> or<00:03:40.290> something<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:41.070> wouldn't<00:03:41.250> be

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the bus or something you wouldn't be

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.040 
the bus or something you wouldn't be
listening<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.180> loud<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> doubt<00:03:42.840> it

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
listening it to it this loud I doubt it

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.600 
listening it to it this loud I doubt it
so<00:03:43.320> they're<00:03:44.250> more<00:03:44.400> than<00:03:44.430> loud<00:03:44.700> enough<00:03:46.610> all
