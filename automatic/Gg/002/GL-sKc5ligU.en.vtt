do<00:01:08.149> and<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.509> smaller<00:01:09.130> chassis<00:01:10.130> do<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:11.210> have<00:01:11.329> an

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
do and the smaller chassis do we have an

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.539 
do and the smaller chassis do we have an
example<00:01:11.719> of<00:01:11.899> one<00:01:12.079> here<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.860> silverstone<00:01:13.399> s

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
example of one here the silverstone s

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.480 
example of one here the silverstone s
go7<00:01:14.030> which<00:01:14.509> supports<00:01:15.290> this<00:01:15.590> particular<00:01:15.890> ITX

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
go7 which supports this particular ITX

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.060 
go7 which supports this particular ITX
so<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.789> keeps<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:17.680> everything<00:01:18.680> much<00:01:18.829> more

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
so it keeps it everything much more

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.100 
so it keeps it everything much more
compact<00:01:19.579> let's<00:01:20.570> take<00:01:20.719> a<00:01:20.750> look<00:01:20.930> at<00:01:20.990> what's
