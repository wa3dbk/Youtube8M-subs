00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.350 
to be working on a 1999 dodge ram pickup
truck<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.670> there<00:00:14.670> could<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> coolant<00:00:15.299> leak

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
truck and there could be a coolant leak

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.849 
truck and there could be a coolant leak
so<00:00:15.839> we're<00:00:15.960> gonna<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> check<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
so we're gonna have to check out the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.010 
so we're gonna have to check out the
cooling<00:00:17.100> system<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.789> pressurize<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.930> see

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
cooling system and pressurize it and see

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.439 
cooling system and pressurize it and see
if<00:00:19.109> there's<00:00:19.230> any<00:00:19.380> leaks<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.359> we're<00:00:21.359> also

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
if there's any leaks and we're also

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.560 
if there's any leaks and we're also
going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> change<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.470> thermos<00:00:22.740> diana<00:00:23.570> so

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
going to change the thermos diana so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:57.709 
going to change the thermos diana so
stay<00:00:24.810> tuned<00:00:25.369> bit<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.460> ice

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 

ok<00:00:58.719> here<00:00:58.930> we<00:00:58.960> are<00:00:59.079> we<00:00:59.320> pressurize<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.039> system

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
ok here we are we pressurize the system

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.249 
ok here we are we pressurize the system
and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.890> gauge<00:01:03.159> is<00:01:03.190> slowly<00:01:03.780> decreasing<00:01:04.780> from

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
and the gauge is slowly decreasing from

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.050 
and the gauge is slowly decreasing from
the<00:01:05.409> pressure<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:09.040> found<00:01:09.250> our<00:01:09.520> leak<00:01:09.729> and

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
the pressure and we found our leak and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.930 
the pressure and we found our leak and
it's<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:12.040> there<00:01:12.899> see<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.049> water<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:15.159> the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
it's right there see the water and the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.320 
it's right there see the water and the
bowls<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:18.159> now<00:01:18.310> we're<00:01:18.460> gonna<00:01:18.580> have<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.759> get<00:01:19.210> the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
bowls so now we're gonna have to get the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.149 
bowls so now we're gonna have to get the
right<00:01:19.600> place<00:01:25.020> ok<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.200> we're<00:01:26.890> going<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.070> take

to<00:02:16.360> take<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.660> fan<00:02:16.870> shroud<00:02:17.050> off<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:20.230> to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
to take the fan shroud off have to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.140 
to take the fan shroud off have to
disconnect<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.860> engine<00:02:21.370> coolant<00:02:21.670> water<00:02:21.820> flow
