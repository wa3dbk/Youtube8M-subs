00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello my name is ingolf seriously me 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.799
 I want to show you how to do it today 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.799
 a salmon for the animals 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.980
 I also need fresh salmon 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.500
 a sharp knife to a betting steel 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.169
 sharpen feed or alternatively 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.550
 blackboard knife and a trench say 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.000
 Best in shed the salmon 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.259
 feeding in running water 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.609
 should not they have something like this at home? 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.189
 does it also the back of a blackboard 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:31.330
 diameter where the tail to the head in 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.129
 important to the dandruff at the knife 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.430
 salmon fillet is that it is a solid 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.600
 sharp blade has so now it can with 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.430
 fillets go off 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.229
 first step in filleting is 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.970
 Just place it in the cut 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.830
 behind the construction fins head 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.510
 if they are up to their heads and 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.019
 completely severed the abdominal wall 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.000
 to have 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.739
 turn the knife with even 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.379
 small movements in the middle 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.809
 arrived nice long cuts up 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.239
 back along the middle along 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.070
 take the fillet from the fish 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.269
 philips today turn around in the fish and 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.269
 do the same again 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.380
 what remains after many animals 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.240
 is still the medium equipment at it 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.369
 there is usually still a lot of meat 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.710
 what to do with a spoon from the head 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.909
 to harm the tail can be suitable 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.299
 was always excellent 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.829
 fish rolls as patties so that in 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.450
 There are no limits to fantasy 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.009
 then the bell speeches 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.320
 just remove the trenches 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.960
 grope you hate the finger then 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.539
 cutting in the front of the knife 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.130
 tail towards the belly at the same time 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.740
 down with long evenly 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.740
 fillets fillet and the trenches from 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.539
 take meat with a knife back 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.530
 the trenches against the something 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.090
 align 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.340
 grab the grevener and pull out 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.080
 doing the same with the other hand 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 the meat does not fix it 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.720
 harm comes the fixed credits sitting 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.520
 the fresher the fish we come 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.679
 for the time being the last step to solve this 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.500
 the skin of filet to easy with 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.239
 a knife in 540 degrees angle behind 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 cut at the tail with the 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.630
 Fix the other tail of the tail 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.910
 and with long steady steps 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.930
 working towards the head 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.549
 Here we have our salmon fillet 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.010
 the salmon fillet is divided as follows 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.350
 once the complain piece the tail 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.150
 piece the premium piece the so-called 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.819
 cloyne or even many simply move 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.280
 called or just the belly fillet piece 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.010
 also called china 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.390
 I wish a lot of fun while copying 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.620
 Of course, the same does not work 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.480
 just try again 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.480
 sometime it almost goes by itself
