two<00:00:01.290> of<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.500> most<00:00:01.620> common<00:00:02.040> mesh<00:00:02.250> modeling

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
two of the most common mesh modeling

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.670 
two of the most common mesh modeling
tools<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:03.210> any<00:00:03.570> package<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.350> course<00:00:04.529> the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
tools in any package is of course the

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.309 
tools in any package is of course the
extrude<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.460> inset<00:00:05.910> tools<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.420> blender<00:00:07.109> these

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
extrude and inset tools in blender these

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.770 
extrude and inset tools in blender these
are<00:00:07.440> both<00:00:07.589> quite<00:00:07.890> easy<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.160> use<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:09.179> extrude

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
are both quite easy to use the extrude

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.690 
are both quite easy to use the extrude
tool<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.260> available<00:00:10.860> either<00:00:11.010> from<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.460> hotkey

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
tool is available either from a hotkey

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.629 
tool is available either from a hotkey
or<00:00:12.120> from<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.290> tool<00:00:13.559> bar<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:13.830> via<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
or from the tool bar here via the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.700 
or from the tool bar here via the
extrude<00:00:15.059> region<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.660> extrude<00:00:16.139> individual

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
extrude region and extrude individual

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.590 
extrude region and extrude individual
and<00:00:16.920> I'll<00:00:17.490> go<00:00:17.640> over<00:00:17.699> both<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.000> these<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.359> just<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and I'll go over both of these in just a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
and I'll go over both of these in just a
moment<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.350> first<00:00:19.619> let's<00:00:19.949> just<00:00:19.980> make<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.369> very

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
moment but first let's just make a very

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.550 
moment but first let's just make a very
basic<00:00:20.820> selection<00:00:21.270> while<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.900> face<00:00:22.170> select

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
basic selection while in face select

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.279 
basic selection while in face select
mode<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.460> take<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.060> look<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.810> I'm<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
mode to take a look so I'm just going to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.099 
mode to take a look so I'm just going to
select<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.650> top<00:00:25.920> face<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.490> let's<00:00:27.390> then<00:00:27.660> hit

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
select this top face and let's then hit

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.320 
select this top face and let's then hit
extrude<00:00:28.769> regen<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.340> you'll<00:00:29.910> see<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.150> has

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
extrude regen and you'll see it has

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.540 
extrude regen and you'll see it has
extruded<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> current<00:00:31.170> selection<00:00:31.560> along<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
extruded the current selection along the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.370 
extruded the current selection along the
normal<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.239> allows<00:00:33.360> us<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.079> move

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
normal so it allows us to then just move

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.010 
normal so it allows us to then just move
it<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.800> down<00:00:34.860> automatically<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.809> then<00:00:36.809> as

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it up and down automatically and then as

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.930 
it up and down automatically and then as
soon<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.410> want<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.920> position<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.579> wherever<00:00:38.760> I

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
soon as I want to position it wherever I

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090 
soon as I want to position it wherever I
want<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.629> left-click<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.559> we're

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
want I can just left-click and we're

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.510 
want I can just left-click and we're
good<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> go

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
good to go

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.299 
good to go
now<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.510> couple<00:00:42.719> things<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.140> note<00:00:43.469> first<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.190> all

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
now a couple things to note first of all

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.150 
now a couple things to note first of all
if<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.670> undo<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.930> extrude<00:00:46.350> again<00:00:46.559> if

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
if I undo that and then extrude again if

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.940 
if I undo that and then extrude again if
I<00:00:47.730> decide<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
I decide that I don't want to do that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.549 
I decide that I don't want to do that
extrusion<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.180> right-click<00:00:51.960> one

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
extrusion and I now just right-click one

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.229 
extrusion and I now just right-click one
thing<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> note<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.670> has<00:00:53.910> not

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
thing the note is that this has not

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
thing the note is that this has not
actually<00:00:54.930> cancelled<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.440> complete

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
actually cancelled the complete

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.240 
actually cancelled the complete
extrusion<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.090> reason<00:00:57.510> being<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.960> that

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
extrusion the reason being is that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
extrusion the reason being is that
extrude<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.550> actually<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> macro<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.719> blender

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
extrude is actually a macro in blender

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.110 
extrude is actually a macro in blender
what's<00:01:01.440> actually<00:01:01.590> doing<00:01:01.949> two<00:01:02.129> things<00:01:02.160> first

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
what's actually doing two things first

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.600 
what's actually doing two things first
its<00:01:03.390> extruding<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.070> activating

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
its extruding and then it's activating

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
its extruding and then it's activating
transform<00:01:06.150> along<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> normal<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
transform along the normal so when I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.960 
transform along the normal so when I
cancel<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.280> extrusion<00:01:08.729> by<00:01:08.850> either

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
cancel that extrusion by either

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
cancel that extrusion by either
right-clicking<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.720> pressing<00:01:10.020> escape<00:01:10.229> I'm

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
right-clicking or pressing escape I'm

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890 
right-clicking or pressing escape I'm
actually<00:01:11.159> only<00:01:11.460> cancelling<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> ladder<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
actually only cancelling the ladder of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
actually only cancelling the ladder of
the<00:01:12.930> macro<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.369> transform<00:01:15.150> along

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the macro which is the transform along

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.380 
the macro which is the transform along
the<00:01:15.540> normal<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.130> both<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.909> blessing

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the normal now this is both a blessing

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
the normal now this is both a blessing
and<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.750> curse<00:01:18.780> sometimes<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.890> nice<00:01:19.979> because

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and a curse sometimes it's nice because

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.920 
and a curse sometimes it's nice because
you<00:01:20.490> want<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> leave<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.119> right<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you want to leave it right there and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.359 
you want to leave it right there and
then<00:01:22.140> manipulate<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.830> further<00:01:23.040> after<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
then manipulate it further after the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.219 
then manipulate it further after the
fact<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.119> other<00:01:24.270> times<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
fact but other times you just want to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
fact but other times you just want to
remove<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.799> entirely<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.090> aware<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
remove it entirely so just be aware that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
remove it entirely so just be aware that
if<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> case<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.130> sure<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
if that is the case just be sure that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
if that is the case just be sure that
you<00:01:29.640> undo<00:01:30.030> twice<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.689> order<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.380> remove<00:01:31.680> any

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you undo twice in order to remove any

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.510 
you undo twice in order to remove any
interior<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.850> zero<00:01:33.390> area<00:01:34.380> faces<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.250> may<00:01:35.400> have

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
interior or zero area faces you may have

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.210 
interior or zero area faces you may have
created<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.140> extrude<00:01:37.560> region

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
created but so that's the extrude region

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300 
created but so that's the extrude region
tool<00:01:38.450> extrude<00:01:39.450> individual<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.350> quite<00:01:40.979> similar

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
tool extrude individual is quite similar

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
tool extrude individual is quite similar
where<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.450> say<00:01:42.720> select<00:01:43.079> these<00:01:43.500> two<00:01:43.770> faces

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
where if we say select these two faces

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
where if we say select these two faces
if<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.909> are<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> choose<00:01:45.270> extrude<00:01:45.780> region

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
if we are to choose extrude region

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.749 
if we are to choose extrude region
you'll<00:01:46.619> notice<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> extrudes

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you'll notice that it extrudes

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
you'll notice that it extrudes
both<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.299> those<00:01:48.420> faces<00:01:48.840> join<00:01:49.350> together<00:01:49.770> just

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
both of those faces join together just

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450 
both of those faces join together just
as<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.729> might<00:01:50.909> expect<00:01:51.170> however<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:53.100> press

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
as we might expect however if I press

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
as we might expect however if I press
extrude<00:01:54.060> individual<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.290> will<00:01:55.409> actually

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
extrude individual it will actually

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.649 
extrude individual it will actually
extrude<00:01:56.219> each<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.909> these<00:01:57.030> faces<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
extrude each one of these faces as a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.749 
extrude each one of these faces as a
separate<00:01:58.350> extrusion<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.040> allow<00:01:59.520> me<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
separate extrusion and allow me to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
separate extrusion and allow me to
transform<00:02:00.329> each<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.079> them<00:02:01.290> along<00:02:01.979> their

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
transform each of them along their

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.340 
transform each of them along their
normals<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.810> handy<00:02:04.020> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
normals so this can be very handy you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.469 
normals so this can be very handy you
also<00:02:04.979> notice<00:02:05.219> as<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.700> most<00:02:05.969> tools<00:02:06.329> in

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
also notice as with most tools in

the operator panel that allows me to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.880 
the operator panel that allows me to
just<00:02:14.220> further<00:02:14.819> things<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:16.080> adjust<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
just further things so I can adjust the

down here one other way that you can
also<00:03:26.400> extrude<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.209> if<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.810> make<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.989> selection

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
also extrude is if you make a selection

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.280 
also extrude is if you make a selection

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
and you control left click you can then

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.400 
and you control left click you can then
just<00:03:31.560> extrude<00:03:32.160> along<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.390> path<00:03:33.690> quite

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
just extrude along that path quite

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.740 
just extrude along that path quite
easily<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.070> quickly<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.000> another<00:03:36.329> method<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
easily and quickly so another method to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.380 
easily and quickly so another method to
quickly<00:03:37.290> extrude<00:03:37.980> your<00:03:38.910> current<00:03:39.180> selection

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
quickly extrude your current selection

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.949 
quickly extrude your current selection
so<00:03:40.230> let's<00:03:40.410> now<00:03:40.620> look<00:03:40.680> at<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.549> inset<00:03:42.239> tool<00:03:42.420> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
so let's now look at the inset tool the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.949 
so let's now look at the inset tool the
inset<00:03:43.350> tool<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.799> fairly<00:03:44.790> similar<00:03:45.090> if<00:03:45.329> we<00:03:45.750> just

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
inset tool is fairly similar if we just

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.780 
inset tool is fairly similar if we just
say<00:03:46.109> select<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.950> section<00:03:47.340> here<00:03:47.549> I'll<00:03:47.730> just

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
say select this section here I'll just

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.940 
say select this section here I'll just
elect<00:03:48.060> all<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.269> vertices<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.470> now<00:03:49.680> hit

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
elect all the vertices and I now hit

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.330 
elect all the vertices and I now hit
ctrl<00:03:50.670> F<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.810> will<00:03:51.870> bring<00:03:52.230> up<00:03:52.380> my<00:03:52.650> faces<00:03:52.920> menu

viewport that allow us to adjust the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
viewport that allow us to adjust the
behavior<00:04:38.880> of<00:04:39.000> this<00:04:39.150> form<00:04:39.420> you<00:04:39.510> can<00:04:39.630> see<00:04:39.720> the

cancel is escape or right click there's

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.610 
cancel is escape or right click there's
the<00:04:45.030> current<00:04:45.390> thickness<00:04:45.870> setting<00:04:46.170> so<00:04:46.470> you'll

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
the current thickness setting so you'll

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.050 
the current thickness setting so you'll
see<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.920> as<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.280> adjust<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.670> thickness<00:04:48.030> that

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
see that as I adjust the thickness that

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.020 
see that as I adjust the thickness that
changes<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:49.260> depth<00:04:49.620> setting<00:04:50.220> which<00:04:50.850> allows

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
changes the depth setting which allows

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.180 
changes the depth setting which allows
me<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.600> actually<00:04:51.960> let's<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:52.740> say<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.890> want<00:04:53.130> to

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
me to actually let's just say I want to

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.500 
me to actually let's just say I want to
scroll<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.490> in<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:53.790> then<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:53.910> want<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.240> also

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
scroll this in but then I want to also

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.030 
scroll this in but then I want to also
offset<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:55.230> depth<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.560> little<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.830> can<00:04:55.950> then

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
offset the depth a little I can then

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.700 
offset the depth a little I can then
hold<00:04:56.190> down<00:04:56.400> control<00:04:56.990> temporarily<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.350> it

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
hold down control temporarily and it

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.770 
hold down control temporarily and it
will<00:04:58.830> allow<00:04:59.010> me<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.220> adjust<00:04:59.490> the<00:05:00.000> depth<00:05:00.300> any

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
will allow me to adjust the depth any

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.970 
will allow me to adjust the depth any
way<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.050> I<00:05:01.080> want<00:05:01.169> soon<00:05:01.680> as<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:01.830> release

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
way that I want soon as I release

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.280 
way that I want soon as I release
control<00:05:02.640> it<00:05:03.090> will<00:05:03.240> go<00:05:03.360> back<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.080> actual

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
control it will go back to the actual

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.090 
control it will go back to the actual
inset<00:05:04.800> or<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.580> can<00:05:06.120> also<00:05:06.150> press<00:05:06.750> o<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.950> will

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
inset or I can also press o and it will

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.820 
inset or I can also press o and it will
adjust<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.730> create<00:05:09.210> an<00:05:09.360> offset<00:05:09.720> now<00:05:10.530> when<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:10.740> do

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
adjust to create an offset now when I do

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.710 
adjust to create an offset now when I do
an<00:05:11.010> offset<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.550> know<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.790> depth<00:05:12.000> may<00:05:12.300> kind<00:05:12.630> of

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
an offset you know the depth may kind of

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.740 
an offset you know the depth may kind of
make<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.890> little<00:05:14.040> interesting<00:05:14.510> but<00:05:15.510> if<00:05:15.630> you

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
make it a little interesting but if you

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.480 
make it a little interesting but if you
can't<00:05:15.990> get<00:05:16.230> your<00:05:16.350> depth<00:05:16.590> back<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:16.950> zero<00:05:17.190> that's

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
can't get your depth back to zero that's

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.890 
can't get your depth back to zero that's
okay<00:05:17.760> because<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.180> can<00:05:18.210> simply<00:05:18.660> just

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
okay because you can simply just

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.440 
okay because you can simply just
left-click<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.650> confirm<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.640> then<00:05:21.180> you<00:05:21.330> can

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
left-click and confirm and then you can

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.120 
left-click and confirm and then you can
adjust<00:05:21.570> anything<00:05:22.230> you<00:05:22.500> want<00:05:22.680> from<00:05:22.950> the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
adjust anything you want from the

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.800 
adjust anything you want from the
operator<00:05:23.490> panel<00:05:23.820> here<00:05:24.060> so<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.360> could<00:05:24.570> go<00:05:24.660> ahead

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
operator panel here so I could go ahead

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.260 
operator panel here so I could go ahead
and<00:05:24.930> set<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.200> depth<00:05:25.440> back<00:05:26.070> to<00:05:26.250> zero<00:05:26.550> I<00:05:26.850> could

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
and set the depth back to zero I could

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.530 
and set the depth back to zero I could
say<00:05:27.419> set<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.930> thickness<00:05:28.140> to<00:05:28.470> an<00:05:28.560> even<00:05:28.830> one<00:05:29.130> and

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
say set the thickness to an even one and

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.659 
say set the thickness to an even one and
maybe<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:30.660> want<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.320> instead<00:05:32.130> I<00:05:32.190> want<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.490> offset

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
maybe I want to instead I want to offset

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.940 
maybe I want to instead I want to offset
it<00:05:33.030> relative<00:05:33.600> to<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:34.080> current<00:05:34.350> selection<00:05:34.440> or

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
it relative to the current selection or

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.909 
it relative to the current selection or
I<00:05:35.010> want<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.030> offset<00:05:36.390> to<00:05:36.479> be<00:05:36.570> even<00:05:37.050> so<00:05:37.530> here<00:05:37.770> you

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
I want the offset to be even so here you

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.210 
I want the offset to be even so here you
can<00:05:38.010> see<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.340> these<00:05:38.520> edges<00:05:39.120> obviously<00:05:39.479> are

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
can see that these edges obviously are

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.310 
can see that these edges obviously are
exactly<00:05:41.220> parallel<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.150> their<00:05:42.600> adjacent<00:05:42.990> edges

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
exactly parallel to their adjacent edges

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.550 
exactly parallel to their adjacent edges
or<00:05:43.710> there's<00:05:44.610> not<00:05:44.790> even<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.390> I<00:05:46.140> can<00:05:46.320> choose<00:05:46.500> a

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
or there's not even and I can choose a

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.950 
or there's not even and I can choose a
boundary<00:05:47.100> selection<00:05:47.610> or<00:05:47.760> not<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.360> in<00:05:48.840> this

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
boundary selection or not and in this

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.300 
boundary selection or not and in this
case<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.350> won't<00:05:49.470> see<00:05:49.740> this<00:05:49.860> but<00:05:50.040> I'll<00:05:50.130> demo

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
case you won't see this but I'll demo

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.340 
case you won't see this but I'll demo
this<00:05:50.460> in<00:05:50.640> just<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:50.940> moment<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:51.479> then<00:05:52.050> we<00:05:52.200> also

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
this in just a moment and then we also

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.770 
this in just a moment and then we also
have<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.830> ability<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.370> toggle<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:54.180> outset<00:05:54.600> on

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
have the ability to toggle the outset on

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.260 
have the ability to toggle the outset on
or<00:05:55.290> off<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:55.860> whether<00:05:56.580> I<00:05:56.640> want<00:05:56.820> to<00:05:56.850> select<00:05:57.120> the

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
or off and whether I want to select the

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.780 
or off and whether I want to select the
outer<00:05:57.450> or<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.620> inner<00:05:58.800> so<00:05:59.070> this<00:05:59.220> is<00:05:59.340> just<00:05:59.430> handy

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
outer or the inner so this is just handy

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.390 
outer or the inner so this is just handy
as<00:05:59.910> a<00:05:59.940> selection<00:06:00.510> method<00:06:00.930> so<00:06:01.620> that's<00:06:02.010> all<00:06:02.220> fine

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
as a selection method so that's all fine

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.460 
as a selection method so that's all fine
and<00:06:02.460> dandy<00:06:02.610> but<00:06:02.970> now<00:06:03.120> let's<00:06:03.419> take<00:06:03.660> a<00:06:03.720> look<00:06:03.900> undo

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
and dandy but now let's take a look undo

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.030 
and dandy but now let's take a look undo
that<00:06:04.620> actually<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.250> let's<00:06:06.180> now<00:06:06.450> remove<00:06:07.040> say

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
that actually and let's now remove say

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.670 
that actually and let's now remove say
these<00:06:08.490> faces<00:06:09.000> so<00:06:09.510> if<00:06:09.630> I<00:06:09.750> select<00:06:10.140> these<00:06:10.260> faces

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
these faces so if I select these faces

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.080 
these faces so if I select these faces
and<00:06:10.710> hit<00:06:10.950> X<00:06:11.220> you'll<00:06:11.520> notice<00:06:11.760> that<00:06:11.850> I<00:06:11.910> have<00:06:12.060> a

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
and hit X you'll notice that I have a

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.240 
and hit X you'll notice that I have a
few<00:06:12.419> more<00:06:12.600> options<00:06:12.750> than<00:06:13.620> I<00:06:13.680> did<00:06:13.950> when<00:06:14.130> an

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
few more options than I did when an

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.380 
few more options than I did when an
object<00:06:14.640> mode<00:06:14.790> because<00:06:15.030> I<00:06:15.060> now<00:06:15.210> have<00:06:15.240> the

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
object mode because I now have the

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.870 
object mode because I now have the
ability<00:06:15.690> to<00:06:15.720> delete<00:06:16.140> vertices<00:06:16.650> edges<00:06:16.890> faces

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
ability to delete vertices edges faces

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.409 
ability to delete vertices edges faces
only<00:06:18.600> edges<00:06:19.080> and<00:06:19.200> faces<00:06:19.350> only<00:06:19.830> faces<00:06:20.640> dissolve

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
only edges and faces only faces dissolve

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.780 
only edges and faces only faces dissolve
edge<00:06:21.690> collapse<00:06:22.200> or<00:06:22.410> edge<00:06:22.590> loop<00:06:22.919> these<00:06:23.640> are

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
edge collapse or edge loop these are

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.730 
edge collapse or edge loop these are
fairly<00:06:24.000> self-explanatory<00:06:24.360> but<00:06:25.320> in<00:06:25.470> this<00:06:25.560> case

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
fairly self-explanatory but in this case

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.800 
fairly self-explanatory but in this case
if<00:06:25.979> I<00:06:26.130> just<00:06:26.400> say<00:06:26.580> select<00:06:26.640> faces<00:06:27.180> it's<00:06:27.540> only

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
if I just say select faces it's only

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.780 
if I just say select faces it's only
going<00:06:28.140> to<00:06:28.260> remove<00:06:28.440> those<00:06:28.650> faces<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.160> this<00:06:29.580> way

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
going to remove those faces and this way

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.640 
going to remove those faces and this way
these<00:06:30.090> vertices<00:06:30.570> around<00:06:30.720> the<00:06:30.930> edge<00:06:31.080> have<00:06:31.500> been

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
these vertices around the edge have been

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.010 
these vertices around the edge have been
left<00:06:31.830> intact<00:06:32.040> and<00:06:32.550> this<00:06:33.120> is<00:06:33.300> what<00:06:33.510> the<00:06:33.660> inset

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
left intact and this is what the inset

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.630 
left intact and this is what the inset
tool<00:06:34.229> means<00:06:34.500> when<00:06:34.680> it<00:06:34.740> refers<00:06:35.010> to<00:06:35.039> boundaries

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
tool means when it refers to boundaries

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.550 
tool means when it refers to boundaries
so<00:06:36.090> if<00:06:36.180> I<00:06:36.270> select<00:06:36.539> I'll<00:06:37.020> just<00:06:37.140> go<00:06:37.260> into<00:06:37.349> face

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
so if I select I'll just go into face

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.290 
so if I select I'll just go into face
mode<00:06:37.740> for<00:06:37.919> this<00:06:38.010> by<00:06:38.340> hitting<00:06:38.520> ctrl<00:06:38.880> tab<00:06:39.060> and

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
mode for this by hitting ctrl tab and

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.620 
mode for this by hitting ctrl tab and
choosing<00:06:39.570> face

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
choosing face

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.480 
choosing face
so<00:06:40.720> let's<00:06:40.900> just<00:06:41.110> select<00:06:41.290> this<00:06:41.830> face<00:06:42.070> right

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
so let's just select this face right

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.690 
so let's just select this face right
here<00:06:42.850> and<00:06:43.030> then<00:06:43.750> used<00:06:44.170> I<00:06:44.410> for<00:06:45.100> the<00:06:45.190> inset<00:06:45.580> so

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
here and then used I for the inset so

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.460 
here and then used I for the inset so
we'll<00:06:45.820> hit<00:06:45.880> I<00:06:46.120> to<00:06:46.480> bring<00:06:46.600> up<00:06:46.720> our<00:06:46.810> inset<00:06:47.230> and

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
we'll hit I to bring up our inset and

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.070 
we'll hit I to bring up our inset and
right<00:06:48.160> now<00:06:48.340> it's<00:06:48.640> sick<00:06:48.970> remember<00:06:49.600> the<00:06:49.870> last

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
right now it's sick remember the last

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.020 
right now it's sick remember the last
settings<00:06:50.560> that<00:06:50.710> I<00:06:50.770> use<00:06:50.830> so<00:06:51.490> right<00:06:51.670> now<00:06:51.820> it's

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
settings that I use so right now it's

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.450 
settings that I use so right now it's
set<00:06:52.240> to<00:06:52.450> an<00:06:52.780> offset<00:06:52.990> well<00:06:53.830> I<00:06:54.040> don't<00:06:54.280> really

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
set to an offset well I don't really

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.280 
set to an offset well I don't really
want<00:06:54.700> to<00:06:54.760> do<00:06:55.000> an<00:06:55.240> offset<00:06:55.480> so<00:06:55.990> I'm<00:06:56.080> going<00:06:56.230> to

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290

press o to go back to my inset and now I

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.660 
press o to go back to my inset and now I
can<00:06:59.470> go<00:06:59.560> ahead<00:06:59.590> and<00:06:59.770> just<00:06:59.860> set<00:07:00.070> this<00:07:00.190> in<00:07:00.370> any

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670 
can go ahead and just set this in any

way that I want and right now it's

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.750 
way that I want and right now it's
acting<00:07:02.260> exactly<00:07:02.740> like<00:07:03.100> we<00:07:03.250> would<00:07:03.370> expect<00:07:03.610> it

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
acting exactly like we would expect it

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.810 
acting exactly like we would expect it
to<00:07:03.880> but<00:07:04.480> if<00:07:04.600> I<00:07:04.690> left<00:07:04.930> click<00:07:05.140> now<00:07:05.410> and<00:07:05.820> disable

to but if I left click now and disable

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.340 
to but if I left click now and disable
the<00:07:06.910> boundary<00:07:07.420> option<00:07:07.750> you'll<00:07:07.960> notice<00:07:08.230> it's

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
the boundary option you'll notice it's

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.920 
the boundary option you'll notice it's
removed<00:07:08.800> this<00:07:09.190> face<00:07:09.400> here<00:07:09.760> and<00:07:09.910> is<00:07:10.330> now<00:07:10.510> no

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
removed this face here and is now no

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.380 
removed this face here and is now no
longer<00:07:11.380> taking<00:07:11.830> that<00:07:11.950> boundary<00:07:12.430> into<00:07:13.000> account

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
longer taking that boundary into account

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.900 
longer taking that boundary into account
for<00:07:14.050> the<00:07:14.110> actual<00:07:14.440> inset<00:07:14.890> so<00:07:15.280> this<00:07:15.430> allows<00:07:15.730> you

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:15.910 
for the actual inset so this allows you

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.120 
for the actual inset so this allows you
to<00:07:15.940> get<00:07:16.120> good<00:07:16.480> clean<00:07:17.080> in<00:07:17.350> sets<00:07:17.650> you<00:07:18.040> know

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
to get good clean in sets you know

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.010 
to get good clean in sets you know
around<00:07:18.400> the<00:07:18.670> center<00:07:19.000> point<00:07:19.270> of<00:07:19.420> a<00:07:19.510> model<00:07:19.840> or

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.020 
around the center point of a model or

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.160 
around the center point of a model or
anything<00:07:20.290> like<00:07:20.560> that<00:07:20.590> so<00:07:21.490> that<00:07:21.880> is<00:07:22.180> the<00:07:22.510> inset

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.170 
anything like that so that is the inset

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.210 
anything like that so that is the inset
