00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
you got I'm just going to put one egg in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
you got I'm just going to put one egg in
there<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.039> enough<00:00:53.309> water

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
there and you know this is enough water

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.540 
there and you know this is enough water
to<00:00:53.940> cover<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> egg<00:00:54.480> completely<00:00:55.170> switch<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> on

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.860 

now<00:00:59.550> I'm<00:00:59.670> actually<00:00:59.789> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> bring<00:01:00.300> mine<00:01:00.539> up

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
now I'm actually going to bring mine up

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
now I'm actually going to bring mine up
to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> boil<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.010> put<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> fairly<00:01:03.090> high

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to the boil so put it on a fairly high

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.420 
to the boil so put it on a fairly high
temperature<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:04.080> style<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.220> bring

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
temperature the style with just to bring

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.940 
temperature the style with just to bring
it<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> boil<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.240> quickly<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.840> possible

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
it to the boil as quickly as possible

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
it to the boil as quickly as possible
once<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.159> come<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.670> boil<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.330> need<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
once you come to the boil you need to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.340 
once you come to the boil you need to
turn<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.080> down

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
turn it down

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.070 
turn it down
so<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.189> egg<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> only<00:01:11.640> simmering<00:01:12.360> away<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so the egg is only simmering away in the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.830 
so the egg is only simmering away in the
water<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.950> let's<00:01:14.130> bring<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> boil<00:01:14.970> now

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
water so let's bring out to the boil now

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.140 
water so let's bring out to the boil now
when<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.320> coming<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> boil

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
when it's just coming up to the boil

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.380 
when it's just coming up to the boil
first<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.509> turn<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.759> let<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.790> sort<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
first of all turn it down let it sort of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.060 
first of all turn it down let it sort of
be<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.689> simmer<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> rush<00:01:22.830> over

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
be on a simmer I'm going to rush over

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.760 
be on a simmer I'm going to rush over
set<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:23.850> timer<00:01:24.060> three<00:01:24.960> minutes

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.500 

so<00:01:32.310> I've<00:01:32.400> sent<00:01:32.640> me<00:01:32.729> time<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:33.180> three<00:01:33.479> minutes

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
so I've sent me time of three minutes

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.380 
so I've sent me time of three minutes
and<00:01:34.229> let<00:01:34.409> me<00:01:34.560> sort<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.890> gently<00:01:35.610> sort<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.090> simmer

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and let me sort of gently sort of simmer

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270 
and let me sort of gently sort of simmer
away<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:36.869> three<00:01:37.799> minutes

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
away for three minutes

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.270 
away for three minutes
now<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.850> meantime<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.930> your<00:01:40.170> toes<00:01:40.380> put

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
now in the meantime get on your toes put

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.070 
now in the meantime get on your toes put
some<00:01:41.460> butter<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.060> slice<00:01:42.510> it<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.869> so

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
some butter on it and slice it out so

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.660 
some butter on it and slice it out so
you've<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.290> 80<00:01:43.470> soldiers<00:01:43.830> now<00:01:44.400> when<00:01:44.550> you

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you've got 80 soldiers now when you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.450 
you've got 80 soldiers now when you
still<00:01:44.940> run<00:01:45.150> away<00:01:45.390> make<00:01:46.110> sure<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> egg<00:01:46.830> is<00:01:47.130> not

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
still run away make sure the egg is not

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
still run away make sure the egg is not
bouncing<00:01:48.090> around<00:01:48.150> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> bottom<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> pen
