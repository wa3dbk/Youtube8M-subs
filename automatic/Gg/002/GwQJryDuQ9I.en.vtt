while everyone used the charge plate

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.920 
while everyone used the charge plate
differently<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.790> focus<00:02:30.270> more<00:02:30.390> heavily<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
differently I focus more heavily on the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.780 
differently I focus more heavily on the
sword<00:02:31.110> shield<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.620> regularly<00:02:32.190> transform<00:02:32.670> for

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
sword shield and regularly transform for

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.250 
sword shield and regularly transform for
the<00:02:32.850> super<00:02:33.150> med<00:02:33.570> switchback

so as you can see the first one will

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.970 
so as you can see the first one will
rarely<00:02:36.510> be<00:02:36.660> used<00:02:36.960> unless<00:02:37.200> you're<00:02:37.620> already<00:02:37.650> in

during active combat the timing to pull
this<00:03:56.070> off<00:03:56.190> can<00:03:56.459> be<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> little<00:03:56.850> unforgiving

sometimes so effectively this is how it

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.750 
sometimes so effectively this is how it
goes

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.160

the second you can put the buttons for
the<00:04:01.290> ultra<00:04:01.590> animation<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.130> then<00:04:02.370> pull<00:04:02.550> back<00:04:02.730> and

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
the ultra animation I then pull back and

the ultra animation I then pull back and
hit<00:04:03.270> X<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.170> usual<00:04:04.500> combo<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.920> might<00:04:05.100> be

if you go over to the second page go

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.640 
if you go over to the second page go
down<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.150> orientation<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.870> select<00:04:34.230> type<00:04:34.410> two

this makes the input relative to your

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.870 
this makes the input relative to your
character<00:04:36.930> at<00:04:37.080> all<00:04:37.290> times<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:38.100> back<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.490> always

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
character at all times so back is always

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.030

back<00:04:39.090> personally<00:04:39.930> I<00:04:39.960> don't<00:04:40.140> use<00:04:40.350> this<00:04:40.620> because

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
back personally I don't use this because

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.560 
back personally I don't use this because
I'm<00:04:41.190> used<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.580> other<00:04:41.700> way<00:04:41.850> but<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.450> is

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
I'm used to the other way but it is

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.510 
I'm used to the other way but it is
there<00:04:42.750> if<00:04:42.870> you<00:04:42.900> want<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.950> being<00:04:44.130> said<00:04:44.340> if

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
there if you want it that being said if

there if you want it that being said if
you<00:04:44.550> are<00:04:44.760> using<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.060> default<00:04:45.180> method<00:04:45.480> just

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
you are using the default method just

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.810 
you are using the default method just
keep<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:46.290> mind<00:04:46.410> at<00:04:46.680> all<00:04:46.710> times<00:04:47.040> if<00:04:47.580> you

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
keep that in mind at all times if you

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.100 
keep that in mind at all times if you
shift<00:04:48.000> your<00:04:48.120> camera<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.750> mess<00:04:48.900> up<00:04:48.990> the

shift your camera and you mess up the

shift your camera and you mess up the
input<00:04:49.380> you'll<00:04:49.680> obviously<00:04:49.830> end<00:04:50.220> up<00:04:50.310> doing<00:04:50.460> an

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
input you'll obviously end up doing an

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.370 
input you'll obviously end up doing an
old<00:04:50.640> truck<00:04:50.850> when<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.180> don't<00:04:51.360> want<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.690> either

is the easiest one to get right the

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.350 
is the easiest one to get right the
timing<00:05:40.830> is<00:05:40.920> very<00:05:40.950> forgiving<00:05:41.550> and<00:05:41.700> it's<00:05:42.180> much

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
timing is very forgiving and it's much

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.420 
timing is very forgiving and it's much
easier<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.720> predict<00:05:43.080> take<00:05:43.830> this<00:05:43.980> t-rex<00:05:44.130> for

I<00:05:49.230> blocked<00:05:49.650> if<00:05:50.010> your<00:05:50.550> shield<00:05:50.820> is<00:05:50.910> charged

you'll<00:05:51.540> receive<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:51.840> boost<00:05:52.020> bonus<00:05:52.380> but<00:05:52.890> this

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
you'll receive a boost bonus but this

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.330 
you'll receive a boost bonus but this
does<00:05:53.220> work<00:05:53.430> both<00:05:53.730> with<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.240> without<00:05:54.480> charge

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
about it but to be honest the timing is

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.120 
about it but to be honest the timing is
so<00:06:15.750> tight<00:06:15.960> that<00:06:15.990> more<00:06:16.290> often<00:06:16.470> than<00:06:16.590> not<00:06:16.620> you

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
so tight that more often than not you

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.590

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.890 
like to use t-rex
simply<00:06:41.550> because<00:06:41.730> when<00:06:42.389> he's<00:06:42.510> not<00:06:42.660> in<00:06:42.750> rage

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
simply because when he's not in rage

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.870 
simply because when he's not in rage
mode<00:06:43.110> he<00:06:43.350> actually<00:06:43.680> charges<00:06:44.040> quite<00:06:44.220> slowly<00:06:44.460> so

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
mode he actually charges quite slowly so

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.310 
mode he actually charges quite slowly so
he's<00:06:45.000> relatively<00:06:45.300> easy<00:06:45.570> to<00:06:45.720> read<00:06:45.900> and<00:06:46.139> he

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
he's relatively easy to read and he

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.590 
he's relatively easy to read and he
