 I was not already how to do them that way 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.379

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:41.380
 of butter a cup of oatmeal 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.540

 one or two tablespoons of beef broth or 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.840
 chicken three cups of wheat flour 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.090
 whole and a spoonful of sugar let's go 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.230
 to put oats 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.829
 the butter 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.810
 or margarine and boiling water and what 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.810
 let's leave for 10 minutes 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 then in another container we are going to put 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.680
 the flour 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.680
 all the mix we did before 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.040
 the egg 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.510
 the milk 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.770
 the tablespoon of beef the tablespoon of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770
 sugar 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.650
 and the three cups of wheat flour 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.300
 integral we will start to beat and 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.520
 as I do not roll asking, we're going to 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.700
 put the other given integral tribe 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 until there is one more consistency or 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.439
 less then as the mass 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.039
 as for the tortillas that you do not know 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.039
 stick in the hand 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.400
 to make the figures you can put a 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.650
 little more than whole food so that 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.650
 do not stick the dough 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.970
 you can make shapes occupy cut out of 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.619
 cookies or a bone for example for 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.040
 do this bone what I did was 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.040
 mold a piece of dough like a stick 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.890
 and then shape it like a bow 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.980
 squeezed in the middle and fat for the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.810
 sides once you have more or less 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.750
 your bone with a spoon will help you 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.060
 to make a line in the middle of each 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 side so that it has more 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.420
 appearance of a bone will put the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.420
 cookies on a tray 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.110
