00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.350
 now all guys welcome back then today 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.830
 we are practically with the second 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.470
 episode of the clash of plants challenge 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.260
 or the attack recommended by us 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.349
 let's say the first fucking episode has 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.309
 did more than 1000 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 views and almost 60 70 I like and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.920
 I was obviously satisfied 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.110
 so now second attack then 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.629
 second episode is recommended by you 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.370
 obviously and I'll tell you right away what 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.739
 I already show base of the attack field 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.350
 just splits movie for us guys 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.360
 we will look for a map of a map a 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.850
 village with the town hall outside like it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.719
 I keep myself so that everyone has to do 50 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.050
 percent and trophies near 10 chelsea 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 I do not go down to ten jean where I am 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.930
 1610 then from the boys then 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.560
 meanwhile we look for the game but let's go 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.140
 to fuck the shield and while I wanted 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 say that I put the page in place 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.950
 facebook so I like it there 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.049
 because there were all the news and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.990
 especially the member of the month will come 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.400
 displayed while I go on 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.259
 hoping to find a village right away 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.340
 outside this there is a comfort of resources 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.360
 but we are and I don't do it because this 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 I used the gems we could if this is 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.860
 good if not suck cut the video 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.540
 boys so we get caught as soon as I find it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.540
 the village I know the boys 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.020
 we found it pretty village 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.409
 of shit so I would say splits wall fir 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.360
 we have 110 splits wall to 5 to throw away 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.360
 so I would say to attack from this 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.600
 part making a nice strip 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.510
 of the series so after his bob or oa 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.210
 bombazza with all the walls smashes like this 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.119
 to be if we want a little casino they do 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.940
 where the fuck but not really really 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.760
 fucking go beautiful destroying every 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.410
 what am I kid 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.620
 look at how they go en masse 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.620
 destroying bobo bom bom bom bom bom 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.860
 perfect we say that there is also who 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.230
 dirty wall have devastated a large 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.030
 part of map and now using 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.110
 barcellini kindly donated by the tram 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.850
 without using real we throw away the prisons 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.270
 so as to make at least 50 percent o 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.820
 made zero percent with good spaces 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.130
 the archers seem to stare but it goes 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.200
 well the same the town hall was 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.530
 destroyed the archers as a ban are at 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.510
 4 then they die very easily a 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.519
 apparently then there is a beautiful tower 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.290
 of the archer at 9 here is fine let's say 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.610
 for the archers, I died 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.600
 perhaps at 6 we always get a hundred 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.690
 chico per percent boys very well 5 per 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.400
 hundred we finish the battle have 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:24.570
 made 4,795 of oil and 1546 of silver 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.299
 band notes I would say used trophies 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.880
 but we have 11 thousand bonuses here 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.830
 let's go back to the village guys let's say 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.570
 that this episode is over me 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.090
 I recommend leaving others below 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.430
 I will make challenges maybe not with the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.140
 troops because I haven't done them yet 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.830
 unfortunately, only to quarrel at the first fano 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.290
 so crap so nothing of that 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.630
 other challenges with any troop of the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.930
 pec barracks because I did it 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.820
 give yourself a thought I remember to leave a 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.620
 nice I like to switch from 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.150
