they're<00:01:36.710> called<00:01:36.920> hash<00:01:37.159> marks<00:01:38.530> right<00:01:39.530> there's

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
they're called hash marks right there's

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.190 
they're called hash marks right there's
another<00:01:40.039> hash<00:01:40.280> mark<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:40.909> when<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.750> see<00:01:41.990> one

mark we don't know which direction the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.449 
mark we don't know which direction the
trail<00:01:52.399> will<00:01:52.610> go<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:53.750> we<00:01:53.899> have<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.200> search<00:01:54.470> all

trail will go so we have to search all

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.690 
trail will go so we have to search all
these<00:01:55.939> different<00:01:56.360> paths<00:01:56.959> until<00:01:57.950> we<00:01:58.069> find<00:01:58.399> an
