00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:11.440
 Today I want to hold a webinar on 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.669
 surround light so who is not with me 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.119
 familiar i 'm doing visualization 2001 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.720
 of the year 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.250
 here it is my favorite thing here today 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 I want to tell you about 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:30.640
 volumetric light but it applies of course 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.649
 to artistic lighting but in 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.190
 reality happens there but you can see where 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:39.460
 then here's the light but in general of course 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.219
 volumetric light refers art 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.969
 lighting because he is on himself very 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.850
 lot 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:50.920
 as if taking the attention and the design itself 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.219
 accents on the design as if on himself 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.340
 here for this reason means 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.059
 Iâ€™m generally inspired on the Internet 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.940
 there are different moments yes by volume 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.619
 light 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.390
 here we look thoughts fly rays 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:14.200
 makes its way through the trees there up 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.490
 through these here arches are beautiful here plus 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.700
 dark architecture background yes this one 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.390
 The effect is very expressive in this case. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.939
 he crosses the vertical architecture so 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.560
 here across this case it is very 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.210
 expressive here too abandoned 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.990
 building 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.990
 also very beautiful 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.509
 First of all, here is the volumetric light. 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.569
 beautiful and when exactly these rays 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.539
 he goes this beam and such here 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.250
 dissipate 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.170
 the effect is enhanced when that's it 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:59.270
 here is such a very interesting too 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:03.590
 ray among such a cave before making its way 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.470
 the beam is such that it is already 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:13.690
 visualization so here here too 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.370
 volumetric light means it comes from the window 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:24.200
 through the blinds and the leg so here to us 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:25.099
 draws such a silhouette here he 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.450
 also more 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:33.019
 caused a very nuance ni so 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:38.410
 this image start here is voluminous 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:42.099
 the light was already on the backgrounds of so mean 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.349
 picture itself she was already there with such 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:49.370
 with such rays I put it in there later 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:52.040
 drove to rush hour tevu direction 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.739
 Here and as a whole it turned out as if 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.500
 there is such a sunny day with such 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:02.450
 handles so but this is my first job 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.359
 generally by volumetric light it was somewhere 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.630
 in the ninth year 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.919
 Here is such a volumetric light 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.510
 now of course I did was more 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:18.169
 expressive here but there too 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.519
 there were a lot of reviews there therefore 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:26.139
 exactly in combination here on dark this 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.139
 volumetric light it is a little bit like that
