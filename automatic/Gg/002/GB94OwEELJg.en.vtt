today<00:00:06.720> we<00:00:07.410> are<00:00:07.440> driving<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:08.460> BRZ<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.120> almost

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
today we are driving the BRZ I almost

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.150 
today we are driving the BRZ I almost
call<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> GT<00:00:10.019> 86<00:00:10.139> because<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.920> was<00:00:11.010> what<00:00:11.130> I

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
call it a GT 86 because that was what I

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
call it a GT 86 because that was what I
thought<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.519> was<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.660> trailer<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.349> can

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
thought it was in the trailer I can

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.829 
thought it was in the trailer I can
never<00:00:14.190> tell<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.580> difference<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.630> is

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
never tell the difference but this is

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.000 
never tell the difference but this is
very<00:00:16.020> clearly<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.859> BRZ<00:00:17.789> can<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.750> tell<00:00:18.990> how<00:00:19.170> well

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
very clearly a BRZ can you tell how well

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.500 
very clearly a BRZ can you tell how well
number<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.670> look<00:00:20.820> at<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> frickin<00:00:21.300> batch

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
number one you look at the frickin batch

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.300 
number one you look at the frickin batch
whoa<00:00:22.670> what<00:00:23.670> are<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.850> doing<00:00:25.010> No

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
whoa what are you doing No

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.910 
whoa what are you doing No
so<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.730> massively<00:00:27.420> similar<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.740> one

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
so it's not massively similar to the one

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800 
so it's not massively similar to the one
in<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> trailer<00:00:29.369> because<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.029> mean<00:00:30.300> look<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
in the trailer because I mean look at it

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.319 
in the trailer because I mean look at it
the<00:00:31.320> only<00:00:31.470> similarity<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> type

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the only similarity really is the type

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.200 
the only similarity really is the type
of<00:00:33.360> calories<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.829> kit<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.880> it's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
of calories the kit it's got on it it's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.440 
of calories the kit it's got on it it's
not<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> stickers<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.940> fact<00:00:39.180> that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
not it's the stickers and the fact that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.860 
not it's the stickers and the fact that
it<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.020> orange<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:41.129> basically<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.510> close

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it is orange that's basically as close

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.180 
it is orange that's basically as close
as<00:00:43.050> will<00:00:43.230> make<00:00:43.379> bit<00:00:43.620> we're<00:00:43.860> gonna<00:00:44.010> get
