00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.389
 hello welcome to my best game 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.309
 and let's get us squarely in the 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.139
 quest dungeon analysis and we're going to 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.230
 start like it could not be otherwise 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.050
 for the characters we are going to see how they are 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.180
 the character tokens how different 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.670
 characteristics and numbering have and 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.380
 also the skills of the same 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.420
 we will use as an example to the letter 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.980
 from google glory south any of the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.829
 six characters that come in the game 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.539
 They are similar to well start 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.430
 his name and a small illustration 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.600
 where we can see the character that 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.449
 corresponds of course with the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.719
 miniature we have a section here below 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.219
 in cursive that has a text of 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.469
 setting that gets a little 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.539
 situations the story of the character in 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.280
 the glorious google case tells us with 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.109
 the glory of getting my name here 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.850
 is was revered by all the 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.920
 eternity each of the six 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.299
 characters have some phrase to 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.710
 put in context has no greater 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.950
 utility in the game 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.720
 anyway, if you are like me 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.640
 like this kind of games that have 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.320
 part of adventure appreciate is this guy 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.840
 of details 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.390
 next to the name of the glorious we have the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.590
 wound counter specifically has 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.630
 16 16 and the 16 life is a value 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.300
 quite high although it is not the most 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.400
 high of the six characters of the game to 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.500
 As each character goes, 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.390
 investigating the dungeon of the lord 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.280
 dragon canada and is facing off with 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.800
 dangers and with enemies can suffer 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.200
 Wounds is very difficult in this game 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.509
 recover from wounds but there is no 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.300
 have to worry about it too much because 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.930
 the game is so fast that it is difficult 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.149
 that we have zero the life counter 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.390
 yes we can die it is very easy to die 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.820
 but maybe not so much to lose 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.300
 counters of life but as by traps 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 that kill us suddenly as we 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.080
 these series of events go through the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.759
 players can point out the wounds that 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.070
 have suffered each of his characters 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.810
 with these heart tokens that are 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.800
 similar to those of any game 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.960
 the worlds of land 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.660
 also if we accumulate many 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.180
 the game also gives us a 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.340
 series of chips with value 5 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.590
 in this case I insist that hugo has a 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.950
 life of 16 could store up to 16 of 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.930
 these chips curiously unlike 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.879
 of other land kingdom games in 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.400
 question we do not have the classic chips 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.989
 with a yellow drop representing the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.240
 Fatigue of the characters here is not 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.220
 has is not taken into account 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.410
 besides this number in the part of 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.300
 below we have one or several depends on the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.920
 character extra skills that have 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.840
 the specials that the characters have 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.000
 during the game inside the dungeon 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200
 the specific case of a codex you 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.660
 opponent can not make hits 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.150
 mortal during combat only you 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.010
 you can make them the fight we'll see 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.630
 carefully in the future video but 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.170
 there is a special attack called 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.330
 precisely those deadly blows and the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.010
 hugo's ability indicates that he can not 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.560
 receive them can not suffer those blows 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.170
 mortals can only perform them is a 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.730
 pretty interesting skill 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.590
 It is important that players have 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.650
 present the skills of their 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.400
 characters is good pretty simple 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.170
 forget about them and that they can 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.310
 help or they could help us in some 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.319
 determined moment and that the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.060
 let's keep in mind so no no os 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.930
 forget about the skill or abilities 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.780
 of our character when you play 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.790
 last of four numbers that indicate 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.829
 four skills other values ​​of 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.870
 different skill the first one in color 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.450
 red and with the drawing of a fist indicates 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.520
 the strength of the character or the glorious 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.050
 has a force of 7 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.480
 the second the green color and with 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.660
 in the figure of making the pine is the 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.420
 agility hugo has little agility a 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.400
 value of 4 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.890
 the third one in blue color and with a shield 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.349
 indicates the armor or defense hugo 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.590
 has a value 9 armor as you see 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.239
 it's pretty well equipped and the last one in 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.130
 yellow color and with a star is the 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.220
 lucky value 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.680
 hugo has very little luck 3 nothing else 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.319
 well what are these numbers for? 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.840
 during the game in many rooms 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.730
 from the dungeon we will be asked to 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.380
 circumvent various dangers that we make 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.750
 an activated skill 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.240
 and will mention a specific attribute 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.730
 for example a force roll a 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.180
 roll of agility a defense roll 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.400
 or a roll of luck to perform 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.530
 these attribute rolls you have to catch 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.090
 two dice in the game come four 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.520
 we take two and throw it any 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.450
 result of dice that is equal or 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.760
 lower than the number of the figure 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.630
 Concrete skill is considered to be 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.420
 has passed that test in case of 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.240
 obtain a result greater than our 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.980
 number the test has failed by 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.800
 example let's do a test of 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.920
 force I have to roll the dice and 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.190
 get a 7 or less to overcome that 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.190
 test 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.069
 in this case the test would be overcome 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.599
 but the lower the attribute the more 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.489
 difficult to overcome is not the same 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.759
 roll two dice and get nine or less 

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:22.160
 that get three or less this is a lot 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.340
 harder than this 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.500
 a roll like this 9 would allow me 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.030
 overcome the defense roll but I do not 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.850
 would allow to overcome any of the others 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.780
 if I had obtained a little more value 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.580
 low for example this 4 here would surpass 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.350
 any of the skills except the 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.520
 of luck as you see it is important that 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.530
 these numbers are high 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.629
 there is a problem that is this small 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.460
 mark here that here is a 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.050
 little covered by the coat of hugo that 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.849
 corresponds to the drawing that appears in 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.960
 certain chips they have in the 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.689
 game and they are called chips 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.939
 determination 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.799
 How useful are these chips? 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.679
 chips will allow us to overcome runs of 

00:05:57.799 --> 00:06:02.589
 attributes that are repetitive let's say 

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:04.639
 in each attempt more easily 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:06.980
 imagine that I have to overcome a 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.590
 luck shot 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.170
 my attribute says 3 that means that 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.120
 I have to roll the dice and get 123 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.760
 were 1 it is impossible what are the 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.240
 data to get a 2 or a 3 in the 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.310
 shooting is quite difficult as I supposed 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.950
 I was not going to get it, I got it 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.390
 a 10 is not passed the throw when 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.130
 this happens during the game 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.900
 my character suffers the consequences of 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.390
 have failed that many times is that the 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.540
 turn it just seems like little thing but 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.010
 it's quite serious and you get one of these 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.380
 determination tokens that can be 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.910
 place here 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.310
 in my next turn if I have to 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.650
 again overcome the roll in this case 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.600
 would be 3 and 1 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.000
 the determination 4 now the result 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.800
 it has to be four or less I have returned to 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.010
 fail with what I would get back 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.870
 another determination sheet and would go back to 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:00.970
 suffer the consequences in my next 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:03.700
 try 3 and 25 in this case I have overcome 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.380
 the print set that if I did not have 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.910
 determination would have failed her like 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.090
 obtained in four and need with three 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.950
 but with two determination tokens 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.960
 born a value of 5 and passed that test 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.020
 the test is passed and I 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.940
 I discard the determination tokens 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.500
 do not miss the next video where 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.770
 we will see a little more in detail 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.030
 letters 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.030
 thanks for your time
