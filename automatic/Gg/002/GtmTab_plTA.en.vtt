00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
all right here we have assembler tree

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.249 
all right here we have assembler tree
stand<00:00:02.250> on<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.550> tree<00:00:02.790> this<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> model<00:00:04.230> that

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
this thick and climb version as well but

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.830

let<00:00:17.130> me<00:00:17.250> show<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.520> how<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> start<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:18.810> to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
let me show you how to start and how to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.740 
let me show you how to start and how to
go<00:00:19.050> with<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.039> come<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> woods<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.539> just

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
go with it so I come in the woods I just

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.359 
go with it so I come in the woods I just
have<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.020> around<00:00:22.320> my<00:00:22.500> waist<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.010> this

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
have this around my waist because this

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.800 
have this around my waist because this
clings<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.300> because<00:00:24.330> it's

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
clings right to it because it's

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.380 
clings right to it because it's
spring-loaded<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.740> put<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> around<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.150> tree

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
spring-loaded I put it around the tree

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.330 
spring-loaded I put it around the tree
and<00:00:27.420> such<00:00:27.920> you<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.279> holds<00:00:29.519> itself<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:31.340> read

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and such you see it holds itself on read

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.150 
and such you see it holds itself on read
this<00:00:32.520> through<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:34.320> hook<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> your<00:00:34.950> harness

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
this through and hook it to your harness

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
this through and hook it to your harness
raise<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.460> high<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:38.910> open<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> up

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
raise it as high as you can open it up

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.569 
raise it as high as you can open it up
so<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> don't<00:00:40.559> touch<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> bark<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
so you don't touch the bark and this is

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.279 
so you don't touch the bark and this is
a<00:00:41.610> noisy<00:00:42.120> cherry<00:00:42.390> tree<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.340> go<00:00:44.340> over<00:00:44.550> not

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
a noisy cherry tree and go over not

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.619 
a noisy cherry tree and go over not
we're<00:00:46.289> limbs<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.680> broken<00:00:47.070> off<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.940> put<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.420> up

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
we're limbs are broken off and put it up

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.510 
we're limbs are broken off and put it up
there<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.649> climb<00:00:49.860> four<00:00:50.250> feet

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
there so you not you can climb four feet

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
there so you not you can climb four feet
to<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.820> point<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.890> let<00:00:53.129> me

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
to this point and go so with that let me

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
to this point and go so with that let me
show<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.480> how<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
show you a little bit about this how it

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:10.270 
show you a little bit about this how it
works<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:56.309> be<00:00:57.120> back<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.539> sec

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.889 

as<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.819> I<00:01:11.850> moved<00:01:12.179> about<00:01:12.479> oh<00:01:14.750> four<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
as you can see I moved about oh four to

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.230 
as you can see I moved about oh four to
six<00:01:16.109> feet<00:01:16.319> there<00:01:16.670> now<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.090> raise<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
six feet there now I'm going to raise it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.199 
six feet there now I'm going to raise it
again<00:01:18.659> open<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.709> so<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.399> got<00:01:20.609> clearance

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.209 
again open it up so you got clearance

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:32.380 
again open it up so you got clearance
raise<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:22.579> let's<00:01:23.579> go

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.090 

and<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.750> continue<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> process<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.010> way

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and you continue the process all the way

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.000 
and you continue the process all the way
up<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.720> least<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.140> part<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.560> his<00:01:37.680> quiet

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
up and at least this part of his quiet

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.440 
up and at least this part of his quiet
although<00:01:38.370> I'm<00:01:38.550> not<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.120> cherry<00:01:39.390> tree

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
although I'm not on this cherry tree

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810 
although I'm not on this cherry tree
that<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.870> chose<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.280> wanted<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.580> show

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that I chose but I just wanted to show

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.700 
that I chose but I just wanted to show
you<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.150> effectiveness<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.020> being<00:01:43.260> quiet<00:01:43.530> as

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you the effectiveness of being quiet as

00:01:43.710 --> 00:02:10.260 
you the effectiveness of being quiet as
well

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.610 

and<00:02:11.270> as<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.600> can<00:02:11.720> see<00:02:11.959> if<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.380> would<00:02:12.500> have

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
and as you can see if you would have

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
and as you can see if you would have
slipped<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:14.630> will<00:02:14.840> tighten<00:02:15.050> up<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.800> hold

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
slipped this will tighten up and hold

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.760 
slipped this will tighten up and hold
you<00:02:17.590> that's<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:18.740> simpler<00:02:19.130> than<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:20.770> so

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
you that's it's simpler than that so

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:39.910 
you that's it's simpler than that so
when<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:28.450> do<00:02:29.450> get<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.810> bottom<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:39.530> you're

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
when you do get to the bottom and you're

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.250 
when you do get to the bottom and you're
good<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.220> go
