that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.229 
that
I<00:00:31.590> choose<00:00:32.180> great<00:00:33.180> clay<00:00:33.620> water<00:00:34.620> base<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:36.120> is

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
I choose great clay water base that is

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.119 
I choose great clay water base that is
several<00:00:36.710> place<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:38.120> this<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> red<00:00:39.480> clay

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
several place here this the red clay

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.450 
several place here this the red clay
this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.690> great<00:00:42.690> clay<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.460> water-based

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
this is the great clay all water-based

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.150 
this is the great clay all water-based
and<00:00:44.840> this<00:00:45.840> applies<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> scene<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:46.860> an<00:00:47.010> oil

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and this applies the scene that's an oil

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220 
and this applies the scene that's an oil
base<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.270> copy<00:00:48.690> that's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.020> very

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
base and this is copy that's a very

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.139 
base and this is copy that's a very
interesting<00:00:49.379> material<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.579> expensive

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
interesting material but expensive

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.450 
interesting material but expensive
that's<00:00:51.570> why<00:00:51.750> when<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.860> these<00:00:53.129> kind<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that's why when we do all these kind of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
that's why when we do all these kind of
things<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> big<00:00:54.300> volume<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:55.230> better

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
things with the big volume it's better

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.279 
things with the big volume it's better
to<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.760> great<00:00:57.120> clay<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> later<00:00:57.780> we

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to do it with great clay and later we

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.099 
to do it with great clay and later we
will<00:00:58.320> process<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.820> order<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.239> reinforce<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
will process in order to reinforce that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
will process in order to reinforce that
this<00:01:01.440> figure<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:03.149> are<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> make

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this figure that we are going to make

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.550 
this figure that we are going to make
this<00:01:04.260> figurine<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this figurine is going to to be like a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
this figurine is going to to be like a
self<00:01:08.010> drying<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.729> self<00:01:09.270> hardening

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
self drying and self hardening

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
self drying and self hardening
it's<00:01:10.500> not<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.580> very<00:01:11.790> strong

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it's not going to be very very strong

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.440 
it's not going to be very very strong
but<00:01:12.540> later<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.530> finish<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.580> some<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
but later we will finish in some kind of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.980 
but later we will finish in some kind of
finish<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:17.600> will<00:01:18.600> last<00:01:18.840> quite<00:01:19.650> long<00:01:20.060> anyway

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
finish that will last quite long anyway

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
finish that will last quite long anyway
that's<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> tools<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.729> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that's the tools that we are going to

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.190 
that's the tools that we are going to
use<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.900> rotating<00:01:25.560> play<00:01:26.180> that's<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
use that's rotating play that's from the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.370 
use that's rotating play that's from the
pin<00:01:28.549> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.670> very<00:01:29.820> important<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.930> wire

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
pin this is very important that's wire

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
pin this is very important that's wire
to<00:01:31.950> cut<00:01:32.659> Queen<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.049> knead<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.650> clay<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.240> few

will see how I'm going to use it is in
order<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> cut<00:01:52.920> even<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.090> slabs<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.630> clay<00:01:54.810> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
order to cut even the slabs of clay that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.280 
order to cut even the slabs of clay that
we<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.509> after<00:01:58.130> after<00:01:59.130> that
