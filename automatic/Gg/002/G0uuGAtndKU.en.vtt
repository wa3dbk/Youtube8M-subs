00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello with everyone and in that place I'm going 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.750
 to teach how to clean the shoes 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.910
 dial 10 and 16 since these shoes 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.009
 they are special materials that require 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.690
 very careful and that if you can not 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.930
 try to wear and good we comment 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.380
 first the bottom of the sole is 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.380
 a little 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.900
 and we begin to grow 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.900
 how it sounds 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.990
 then we mix some shampoo shampoo 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 with a little water 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.410
 and more we mix it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.800
 we already spent a bit of that mixture in the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.050
 shoe required to remove all 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 these spots 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 you win with the powder while we're 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.880
 principal 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.470
 etc 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.470
 let's start this 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.899
 4 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.110
 and once clean 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.729
 I am delighted 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.170
 how 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.110
 tomÃ¡s 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.299
 but it's a bit of fire residue but 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.299
 that if you take it away 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.670
 now once explored 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.670
 with a small cloth 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.200
 with a small cloth 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.830
 we went on the sole 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.830
 we are 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.670
 we clean 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.380
 there 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.380
 with a little foam 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.890
 we do 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:09.030
 once rinsed 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.030
 and we passed the deal again 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.040
 and then so it should be 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.290
 staying looking 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.239
 x 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.430
 look at how the cell is after 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.430
 pass the shampoo 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.350
 it's because we use shampoo because the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.350
 shampoo is a 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.150
 but much softer because if we 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.969
 we apply detergent at the time of being 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.780
 washing the people can rub with the 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:46.000
 suede or leather you can dye it and 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.860
 make him get older and look 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.610
 more zero 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.160
 and now in the part of here there is a lot 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.810
 people that when it gets dirty first thing 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.640
 what they do is use detergent and it's the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:04.570
 most common mistake that exists already because the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.300
 detergent many chagas and 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.040
 detergent deteriorates what 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.190
 distinguishes and makes our shoes 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.820
 be older and not do so 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.400
 also here we apply a little samur 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.250
 we have our napkin brush and a 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.489
 little bit of shampoo and we started doing 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.489
 with 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.430
 but without a side yes no 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.460
 but that we are going to spend doing a 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.460
 taste 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:51.360
 already past the brush 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.190
 and for having given you some water with 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.390
 the small cloth with a dry cloth 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.390
 you start to pass it 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.530
 good and look good this is the result 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.930
 after a wash to our 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.300
 Sneakers says here you can see the brand 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.070
 and as you can see it is being super 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.580
 white as new 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.030
 and good also the part of here was 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.030
 very good 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.009
 and well this is the tutorial I hope that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.860
 you liked it 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.710
 and good because I did this good tutorial 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.059
 since many people when they buy 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.770
 slippers do not know how to clean them and what 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:41.369
 first they come to clean them with 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:46.110
 detergent until elegiac in the part and 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:49.409
 that affects him so the this is the thing 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.180
 to clean is a little bit of shampoo a 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.319
 I brush a little water and a 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.119
 little nothing more so you spend it and already 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:00.330
 if by your bird you knew how it was done 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:03.240
 this anyway I hope you have 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:07.620
 served and good if I do not expect that too 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:12.259
 you serve and you like it and was good thank you 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.259
 a hug, take care
