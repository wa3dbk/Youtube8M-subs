00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
monitor got an outboard speaker line

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.760 
monitor got an outboard speaker line
that's<00:00:19.359> designated<00:00:19.870> your<00:00:20.020> headphones<00:00:20.500> you

talkback a talkback B and the oscillator

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.050 
talkback a talkback B and the oscillator
so<00:00:35.140> really<00:00:35.800> these<00:00:35.920> two<00:00:35.980> buttons<00:00:36.340> here<00:00:36.489> just

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
so really these two buttons here just

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.220 
so really these two buttons here just
kind<00:00:37.239> of<00:00:37.300> toggle<00:00:37.600> right<00:00:37.660> through<00:00:37.870> those<00:00:38.020> pages

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
kind of toggle right through those pages

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.250 
kind of toggle right through those pages
there<00:00:38.650> so<00:00:39.270> you're<00:00:40.270> on<00:00:40.360> your<00:00:40.390> monitor<00:00:40.900> you'll

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
see you have a couple of functions you

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.790 
see you have a couple of functions you
can<00:00:43.210> basically<00:00:43.480> pick<00:00:43.840> what<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.320> want<00:00:44.590> them<00:00:44.770> to

can basically pick what you want them to
do<00:00:45.010> exclusive<00:00:45.730> solo<00:00:46.120> file<00:00:46.420> select<00:00:46.870> mean<00:00:47.079> when

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
do exclusive solo file select mean when

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.930 
do exclusive solo file select mean when
you<00:00:47.290> change<00:00:47.560> a<00:00:47.680> channel<00:00:47.860> it<00:00:48.100> goes<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:48.730> as

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
you change a channel it goes to that as

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.290 
you change a channel it goes to that as
a<00:00:48.970> solo<00:00:49.450> once<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.780> have<00:00:49.899> solo<00:00:50.140> selected<00:00:50.559> just

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
a solo once you have solo selected just

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.760 
a solo once you have solo selected just
different<00:00:52.300> things<00:00:52.570> that<00:00:53.140> I'm<00:00:53.440> not<00:00:53.559> going<00:00:53.649> to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
different things that I'm not going to

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.020 
different things that I'm not going to
get<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:53.980> each<00:00:54.160> one<00:00:54.489> just<00:00:54.700> read<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:54.940> little

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
get to each one just read a little

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.459 
get to each one just read a little
manual<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:55.750> they're<00:00:56.020> actually<00:00:56.200> pretty

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
manual and they're actually pretty

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.200 
manual and they're actually pretty
self-explanatory

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
self-explanatory

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.510 
self-explanatory
they<00:00:58.450> got<00:00:58.660> your<00:00:58.809> delay<00:00:59.079> I'm<00:00:59.950> not<00:01:00.250> really<00:01:00.340> gonna

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
they got your delay I'm not really gonna

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.889 
they got your delay I'm not really gonna
mess<00:01:00.640> around<00:01:00.670> without<00:01:01.180> too<00:01:01.360> much<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:01.690> think

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
mess around without too much I think

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.720 
mess around without too much I think
we're<00:01:02.020> fine<00:01:02.200> with<00:01:02.410> this<00:01:02.530> application<00:01:03.010> your

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
we're fine with this application your

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.730 
we're fine with this application your
dim<00:01:04.030> that's<00:01:04.390> basically<00:01:04.689> on<00:01:04.899> this<00:01:05.140> right<00:01:05.379> here

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
dim that's basically on this right here

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.739 
dim that's basically on this right here
you<00:01:06.369> press<00:01:06.579> damn<00:01:06.820> it<00:01:06.939> knocks<00:01:07.149> down<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:07.390> volume

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:07.749 
you press damn it knocks down the volume

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:09.510 
you press damn it knocks down the volume
levels<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:08.409> you<00:01:08.439> can<00:01:08.590> actually<00:01:08.859> set<00:01:09.219> how<00:01:09.399> much

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
levels so you can actually set how much

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.800 
levels so you can actually set how much
you<00:01:09.670> want<00:01:09.819> to<00:01:09.880> take<00:01:10.030> off<00:01:10.209> with<00:01:10.359> that<00:01:10.389> I

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
you want to take off with that I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.349 
you want to take off with that I
probably<00:01:11.799> the<00:01:11.979> best<00:01:12.189> application<00:01:12.789> use<00:01:13.030> if<00:01:13.240> you

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:13.359 
probably the best application use if you

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.789 
probably the best application use if you
have<00:01:13.509> like<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.749> full<00:01:14.020> band<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:14.530> you've<00:01:14.619> got

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
have like a full band and you've got

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.739 
have like a full band and you've got
like<00:01:14.950> maybe<00:01:15.130> a<00:01:15.280> speaker<00:01:15.789> you<00:01:16.389> know<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.569> could

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749 
like maybe a speaker you know you could

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:18.800 
like maybe a speaker you know you could
have<00:01:16.899> your<00:01:17.079> dim<00:01:17.319> on<00:01:17.530> during<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.009> full<00:01:18.249> band

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
have your dim on during the full band

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.300 
have your dim on during the full band
and<00:01:19.810> when<00:01:20.319> that's<00:01:20.499> going<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.039> this<00:01:21.189> isn't

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
and when that's going so this isn't

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.319 
and when that's going so this isn't
pushing<00:01:21.670> too<00:01:21.759> much<00:01:21.850> down<00:01:22.029> through<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
pushing too much down through the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.149 
pushing too much down through the
headphones<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.020> then<00:01:23.139> when<00:01:23.409> every<00:01:24.039> year

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
headphones and then when every year

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.739 
headphones and then when every year
speaker<00:01:24.549> speaking<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.060> maybe<00:01:25.179> like<00:01:25.329> a<00:01:25.359> pastor

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749 
speaker speaking and maybe like a pastor

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:27.029 
speaker speaking and maybe like a pastor
in<00:01:25.840> this<00:01:25.959> case<00:01:26.139> you<00:01:26.319> can<00:01:26.439> pull<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.619> off<00:01:26.740> and

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
in this case you can pull that off and

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.230 
in this case you can pull that off and
levels<00:01:27.369> about<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.609> same<00:01:27.789> doesn't<00:01:28.090> blow<00:01:28.179> you

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
levels about the same doesn't blow you

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.569 
levels about the same doesn't blow you
out<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.439> also<00:01:29.619> have<00:01:29.859> your<00:01:30.039> source<00:01:30.279> trim

out and you also have your source trim

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.190 
out and you also have your source trim
you<00:01:30.729> can<00:01:30.850> go<00:01:30.939> left<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.270> right<00:01:31.329> and<00:01:31.659> you<00:01:32.079> can

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
you can go left and right and you can

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
both field so if I needed to have my

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.509 
both field so if I needed to have my
sound<00:03:51.500> guy<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.680> wanted<00:03:51.949> to<00:03:52.040> talk<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
singers and the band guys both sides

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.170 
singers and the band guys both sides
they<00:03:55.220> just<00:03:55.430> hit<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.609> both<00:03:55.730> at<00:03:55.879> the<00:03:55.940> same<00:03:56.150> time

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
they just hit it both at the same time

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.449 
they just hit it both at the same time
so<00:03:56.629> you<00:03:56.930> can<00:03:57.079> compile<00:03:57.799> them<00:03:57.980> together<00:03:58.129> which

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
so you can compile them together which

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.520 
so you can compile them together which
is<00:03:58.579> kind<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.849> cool<00:03:59.030> little<00:03:59.120> trick<00:03:59.299> there<00:03:59.540> so

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
is kind of cool little trick there so

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.390 
is kind of cool little trick there so
that's<00:04:00.680> makes<00:04:00.859> it<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.040> whole<00:04:01.190> right-hand

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
that's makes it that whole right-hand

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.949 
that's makes it that whole right-hand
side<00:04:01.699> top<00:04:01.940> right-hand<00:04:02.150> side<00:04:02.419> the<00:04:02.510> board<00:04:02.720> we're

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
side top right-hand side the board we're

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.449 
side top right-hand side the board we're
about<00:04:03.139> getting<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.590> final<00:04:04.040> under<00:04:04.220> stuff

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
about getting to the final under stuff

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.849 
about getting to the final under stuff
here<00:04:04.699> with<00:04:04.849> this<00:04:05.000> board<00:04:05.269> as<00:04:05.480> far<00:04:05.660> as<00:04:05.780> just<00:04:06.680> kind
