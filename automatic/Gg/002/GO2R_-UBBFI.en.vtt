00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
different cooperative games that we've

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230 
different cooperative games that we've
actually<00:01:43.470> enjoyed<00:01:43.740> playing<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.000> even

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
actually enjoyed playing you know even

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.429 
actually enjoyed playing you know even
though<00:01:45.299> their<00:01:45.450> role<00:01:45.720> thawne's<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.380> know

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
though their role thawne's like you know

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.440 
though their role thawne's like you know
legends<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.130> or<00:01:47.280> being<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> main<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
legends of and or being the main one and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.719 
legends of and or being the main one and
I<00:01:48.509> thought<00:01:48.630> well<00:01:48.810> maybe<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:50.070> honestly<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I thought well maybe but honestly it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.410 
I thought well maybe but honestly it
didn't<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.000> come<00:01:51.119> together<00:01:51.270> because

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
didn't really come together because

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
didn't really come together because
first<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.840> foremost<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.259> think<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.649> game<00:01:52.920> was

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
first and foremost I think this game was

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.399 
first and foremost I think this game was
designed<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.299> played<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> competitive

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
designed to be played as a competitive

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.420 
designed to be played as a competitive
game<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.659> okay<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.439> cooperative<00:01:58.950> game<00:01:59.189> but

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
game it's okay as a cooperative game but

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.550 
game it's okay as a cooperative game but
it's<00:01:59.549> very<00:01:59.909> very<00:02:00.210> clear<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.960> least<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.320> me<00:02:01.439> or

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
it's very very clear at least to me or

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.600 
it's very very clear at least to me or
it<00:02:01.649> seems<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.310> me<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:04.490> element<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it seems to me that the the element of

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.190 
it seems to me that the the element of
the<00:02:05.880> additional<00:02:06.180> cooperative<00:02:06.659> stuff<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.990> kind

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the additional cooperative stuff is kind

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.779 
the additional cooperative stuff is kind
of<00:02:07.259> an<00:02:07.380> afterthought<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.670> just

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
of an afterthought because what you just

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.150 
of an afterthought because what you just
saw<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.360> run-through<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.259> humans<00:02:10.709> they

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
saw in this run-through the humans they

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.830 
saw in this run-through the humans they
just<00:02:11.310> got<00:02:11.430> completely<00:02:11.580> decimated<00:02:12.510> by<00:02:12.690> me

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
just got completely decimated by me

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.430 
just got completely decimated by me
there<00:02:12.989> is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
there is

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.810 
there is
nothing<00:02:13.740> they<00:02:13.860> could<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.190> stop<00:02:14.520> me<00:02:14.550> just

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
nothing they could do to stop me just

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.310 
nothing they could do to stop me just
because<00:02:14.910> they<00:02:15.120> kept<00:02:15.300> rolling<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.870> poorly<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
because they kept rolling so poorly and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.080 
because they kept rolling so poorly and
I<00:02:16.380> steamrolled<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> know<00:02:17.790> Jen<00:02:18.000> I

I steamrolled them but you know Jen I

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.700 
I steamrolled them but you know Jen I

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
we've played before and we couldn't roll

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.470 
we've played before and we couldn't roll

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to save our lives and the humans even in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.790 
to save our lives and the humans even in
a<00:02:21.540> weaker<00:02:21.840> level<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.050> mean<00:02:22.140> heck<00:02:22.320> we<00:02:22.470> had<00:02:22.590> one

a weaker level I mean heck we had one

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.120 
a weaker level I mean heck we had one
point<00:02:23.100> where<00:02:23.550> there<00:02:23.700> were<00:02:23.790> like<00:02:23.970> four<00:02:24.740> guys<00:02:25.740> in

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
we just found it really kind of fell

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.009 
we just found it really kind of fell
flat<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:56.190> was<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:56.850> kind<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.180> an<00:03:57.300> exercise<00:03:57.720> and

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
flat it was just kind of an exercise and

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.600 
flat it was just kind of an exercise and
well<00:03:58.200> let's<00:03:58.380> just<00:03:58.410> see<00:03:58.590> what<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.800> dice<00:03:58.980> end<00:03:59.310> up

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
well let's just see what the dice end up

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.460 
well let's just see what the dice end up
doing<00:03:59.970> for<00:04:00.180> us<00:04:00.269> today<00:04:00.450> because<00:04:01.080> there<00:04:01.410> were

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
doing for us today because there were

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.590 
doing for us today because there were
very<00:04:01.709> few<00:04:01.860> interesting<00:04:02.790> decisions<00:04:03.209> now

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
very few interesting decisions now

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.780 
very few interesting decisions now
that's<00:04:03.810> as<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.989> cooperative<00:04:04.530> game<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:05.040> think<00:04:05.700> is

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
that's as a cooperative game I think is

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.090 
that's as a cooperative game I think is
a<00:04:05.820> competitive<00:04:06.630> game<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.470> game<00:04:07.680> would<00:04:07.860> open

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
a competitive game this game would open

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.259 
a competitive game this game would open
up<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.280> lot<00:04:08.400> more<00:04:08.580> now<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.700> have<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:08.970> admit<00:04:09.060> I've

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
up a lot more now I have to admit I've

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.360 
up a lot more now I have to admit I've
not<00:04:09.480> played<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.140> competitive<00:04:10.620> game<00:04:10.800> but

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
not played it as a competitive game but

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.100 
not played it as a competitive game but
it's<00:04:11.519> obvious<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.300> me<00:04:12.330> that<00:04:12.480> it's<00:04:12.989> designed

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
it's obvious to me that it's designed

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.140 
it's obvious to me that it's designed
because<00:04:13.380> in<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.860> competitive<00:04:14.190> game<00:04:14.519> if<00:04:14.730> there's

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
because in a competitive game if there's

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.789 
because in a competitive game if there's
one<00:04:15.390> person<00:04:15.570> who's<00:04:15.870> getting<00:04:16.080> screwed<00:04:16.200> by<00:04:16.530> dice

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.800 
one person who's getting screwed by dice
and<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.190> can't<00:04:17.459> do<00:04:17.730> anything<00:04:18.150> over<00:04:18.540> in<00:04:18.630> their

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and just can't do anything over in their

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.539 
and just can't do anything over in their
little<00:04:19.049> neck<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.410> woods<00:04:19.440> well<00:04:20.280> then

I would bet because one player could
just<00:04:58.470> run<00:04:58.620> away<00:04:58.830> with<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.070> there's<00:04:59.250> nothing

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
just run away with it there's nothing

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.650 
just run away with it there's nothing
the<00:04:59.550> other<00:04:59.610> player<00:04:59.850> could<00:05:00.030> do<00:05:00.150> but<00:05:00.540> when

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
the other player could do but when

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.400 
the other player could do but when
you're<00:05:00.750> playing<00:05:00.930> with<00:05:01.020> three<00:05:01.170> or<00:05:01.260> four

know band together and pull him back

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.090 
know band together and pull him back
down<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.170> it's<00:05:07.290> gonna<00:05:07.380> be<00:05:07.530> very<00:05:07.740> very<00:05:07.980> tricky

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
down and it's gonna be very very tricky

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.710 
down and it's gonna be very very tricky
and<00:05:08.370> there's<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.550> lot<00:05:08.850> more<00:05:08.880> interesting

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
and there's a lot more interesting

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.360 
and there's a lot more interesting
give-and-take<00:05:10.410> out<00:05:10.770> with<00:05:11.010> you<00:05:11.130> have<00:05:11.250> this

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
give-and-take out with you have this

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.430 
give-and-take out with you have this
multi<00:05:11.700> direction<00:05:12.060> tug-of-war<00:05:12.480> so<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:12.990> would

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
multi direction tug-of-war so I would

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.550 
multi direction tug-of-war so I would
think<00:05:13.580> played<00:05:14.580> as<00:05:14.970> a<00:05:15.360> three<00:05:15.960> or<00:05:16.050> four<00:05:16.290> player

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
think played as a three or four player

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.940 
think played as a three or four player

of<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:08.910> form<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.290> if<00:06:10.800> you<00:06:10.890> don't<00:06:11.160> well<00:06:11.670> like

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
of the form and if you don't well like

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.090 
of the form and if you don't well like
Jen<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.360> don't<00:06:12.960> go<00:06:13.170> in<00:06:13.350> expecting<00:06:13.470> that<00:06:13.950> the

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
Jen and I don't go in expecting that the

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.620 
Jen and I don't go in expecting that the
co-op<00:06:14.430> game<00:06:14.670> might<00:06:14.910> save<00:06:15.180> it<00:06:15.300> for<00:06:15.450> you<00:06:15.510> because

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
co-op game might save it for you because

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.380 
co-op game might save it for you because
in<00:06:15.810> our<00:06:15.900> experience<00:06:16.020> it's<00:06:16.590> okay<00:06:17.040> but<00:06:17.760> it's<00:06:17.910> way

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
in our experience it's okay but it's way

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.320 
in our experience it's okay but it's way
unbalanced<00:06:19.260> it's<00:06:19.380> very<00:06:19.710> swingy<00:06:20.190> and<00:06:20.490> getting

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
unbalanced it's very swingy and getting

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.660 
unbalanced it's very swingy and getting
a<00:06:21.420> win<00:06:21.600> is<00:06:21.750> not<00:06:21.780> very<00:06:22.200> satisfying<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.130> getting

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
a win is not very satisfying and getting

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.590 
a win is not very satisfying and getting
a<00:06:23.760> loss<00:06:23.940> feels<00:06:24.480> just<00:06:25.050> very<00:06:26.390> well<00:06:27.390> there's

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
a loss feels just very well there's

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.720 
a loss feels just very well there's
nothing<00:06:27.870> we<00:06:27.900> could<00:06:28.050> do<00:06:28.230> we<00:06:29.070> did<00:06:29.310> nothing<00:06:29.610> but

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
nothing we could do we did nothing but

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.250 
nothing we could do we did nothing but
ones<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.150> entire<00:06:30.450> time<00:06:30.720> we<00:06:30.870> couldn't<00:06:31.110> draw<00:06:31.230> a
