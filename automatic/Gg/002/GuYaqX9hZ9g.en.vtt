this isn't my last one I've just open
this<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> watch<00:00:19.199> me<00:00:19.350> open

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
this up so you can have to watch me open

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.320 
this up so you can have to watch me open
it<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.740> camera<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.210> looks

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it on camera and this is what it looks

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.700 
it on camera and this is what it looks
like<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> chocolate-covered<00:00:22.410> one

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
like this is the chocolate-covered one

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.259 
like this is the chocolate-covered one
so<00:00:23.340> obviously<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.820> put<00:00:23.939> your<00:00:24.060> chocolate

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
so obviously you put your chocolate

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.429 
so obviously you put your chocolate
layer<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> outside<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:28.260> quite

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
layer on the outside and then it's quite

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.470 
layer on the outside and then it's quite
crumbly<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.189> mint<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> inside<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
crumbly the mint on the inside but it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.099 
crumbly the mint on the inside but it
just<00:00:30.660> looks<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:30.869> that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
just looks like that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.500 
just looks like that
and<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.349> kind<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:32.420> it's<00:00:33.420> not

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
and it's kind of like it's not

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.610 
and it's kind of like it's not
completely<00:00:33.899> white<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
completely white it's kind of like a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.410 
completely white it's kind of like a
crystal<00:00:35.550> II<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.969> see-through<00:00:36.570> white

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
crystal II kind of see-through white

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
crystal II kind of see-through white
mixture<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.170> know<00:00:40.290> sugar<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> oils<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
mixture of you know sugar and oils and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
mixture of you know sugar and oils and
stuff<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> minty<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.350> can

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
stuff and that's the minty bit you can

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
stuff and that's the minty bit you can
see<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.219> layer<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.520> chocolate<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
see that the layer of chocolate on the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.869 
see that the layer of chocolate on the
outside<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:46.010> too<00:00:47.010> thick<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.670> it's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
outside is not too thick at all it's

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
outside is not too thick at all it's
mostly<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.210> minty<00:00:49.140> stuff<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> middle

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
just on the recommendation of one of my

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.429 
just on the recommendation of one of my
commenters<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
commenters so you know you can get a

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.750 
commenters so you know you can get a
fair<00:01:07.439> amount<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.340> very

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
fair amount of this and it is very

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
fair amount of this and it is very
sugary<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.170> mixture<00:01:10.650> there<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
sugary because that mixture there that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.070 
sugary because that mixture there that
is<00:01:11.220> basically<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.750> glue<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is basically just glue I think the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
is basically just glue I think the
glucose<00:01:13.500> syrup<00:01:13.740> sugar<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> peppermint<00:01:15.150> oil

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
glucose syrup sugar and peppermint oil

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
glucose syrup sugar and peppermint oil
and<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:16.020> cook<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.009> mix

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and they cook it and they you know mix

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.870 
and they cook it and they you know mix
up<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.110> heat<00:01:19.110> treat<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> just

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
up and heat treat it and it just

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
up and heat treat it and it just
performs<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.630> very<00:01:21.780> crumbly<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.070> was

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
performs like it's very crumbly if I was

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
performs like it's very crumbly if I was
taking<00:01:23.400> bite<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:25.110> would<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.470> know

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
taking bite of this it would you know

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.190 
taking bite of this it would you know
it's<00:01:25.770> very<00:01:25.920> crumbly<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.460> sauce<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> crumbs

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
it's very crumbly my sauce of crumbs

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.510 
it's very crumbly my sauce of crumbs
it's<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> chalky<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.430> of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it's kind of like a chalky kind of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's kind of like a chalky kind of
texture<00:01:31.070> but<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:33.030> it's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
texture but it's it's not you know it's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.609 
texture but it's it's not you know it's
not<00:01:33.240> imposing<00:01:33.450> these<00:01:33.900> are<00:01:34.110> these<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.320> quite

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
not imposing these are these are quite

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.830 
not imposing these are these are quite
nice<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.420> say<00:01:36.600> don't

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
nice to to have but like I say don't

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
nice to to have but like I say don't
have<00:01:37.079> them<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> treat<00:01:38.640> run<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> house

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
have them just as a treat run the house

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.780 
have them just as a treat run the house
because<00:01:39.360> they're<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.409> very<00:01:40.710> sugary<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.670> not

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
because they're very very sugary and not

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
because they're very very sugary and not
only<00:01:41.880> would<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> good<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.780> but

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
