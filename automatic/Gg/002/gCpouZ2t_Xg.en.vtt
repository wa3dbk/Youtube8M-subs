HBO<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.900> HBO<00:02:07.290> realizes<00:02:08.130> what<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> special

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
HBO I think HBO realizes what a special

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.690 
HBO I think HBO realizes what a special
talent<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.259> normal<00:02:10.619> Jacob<00:02:11.069> knees

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
talent they have in normal Jacob knees

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.800 
talent they have in normal Jacob knees
feel<00:02:11.880> probably<00:02:12.150> should<00:02:12.300> have<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.480> do<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.690> same

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
feel probably should have to do the same
