00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
week with Witcher 3 video I said that I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.000 
week with Witcher 3 video I said that I
thought<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.689> was<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:28.080> two-thirds<00:00:28.590> ROI<00:00:28.740> for

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
thought I was about two-thirds ROI for

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160 
thought I was about two-thirds ROI for
the<00:00:29.070> plot<00:00:29.220> which<00:00:29.490> nope<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.050> only

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the plot which nope I was really only

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.260 
the plot which nope I was really only
about<00:00:31.560> halfway<00:00:31.890> through<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.790> even<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.030> little

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
about halfway through and even a little

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
about halfway through and even a little
less<00:00:33.450> than<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.840> which<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.500> absolutely

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
less than that which is absolutely

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.340 
less than that which is absolutely
fantastic<00:00:35.610> because<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.600> even<00:00:36.870> larger

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
fantastic because it's just even larger

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.540 
fantastic because it's just even larger
than<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.590> originally<00:00:37.649> thought

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
than I originally thought

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.069 
than I originally thought

Nataly<00:01:29.729> though<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> game's<00:01:30.150> plot<00:01:30.210> does<00:01:30.659> have

Nataly though the game's plot does have
one<00:01:31.079> major<00:01:31.380> weakness<00:01:31.680> which<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.909> ending

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
one major weakness which is the ending

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
one major weakness which is the ending
which<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.659> left<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:33.990> feeling<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.500> bit

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
which just left me feeling a bit

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.170 
which just left me feeling a bit
disappointed<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:35.880> three<00:01:36.060> different

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
disappointed there are three different

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
disappointed there are three different
ones<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> wall<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.470> wasn't

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
ones in the wall the one I got wasn't

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
ones in the wall the one I got wasn't
bad<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.430> was<00:01:38.490> very<00:01:38.939> brief<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.509> quiet

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
bad it was very brief and quiet

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.780 
bad it was very brief and quiet
considering<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.070> build<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> rest<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
considering all the build up the rest of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
considering all the build up the rest of
the<00:01:41.880> game<00:01:42.030> created<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.869> wasn't<00:01:42.990> a

the game created for it it wasn't a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
the game created for it it wasn't a
particularly<00:01:43.649> bad<00:01:43.979> ending<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.640> wasn't<00:01:45.119> as

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
particularly bad ending just wasn't as

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.539 
particularly bad ending just wasn't as
good<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:45.990> hoping<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.159> postgame

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
good as I was hoping for the postgame

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.429 
good as I was hoping for the postgame
clayey<00:01:47.759> flog<00:01:48.060> scenes<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.570> help<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.960> give<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
clayey flog scenes do help to give it a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
clayey flog scenes do help to give it a
bit<00:01:49.619> more<00:01:49.649> satisfying<00:01:50.340> finish<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.299> game

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
bit more satisfying finish but the game

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.580 
bit more satisfying finish but the game
just<00:01:51.630> feels<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.020> missing<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.380> major

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
just feels like it's missing a major

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.950 
just feels like it's missing a major
climactic<00:01:53.310> moment<00:01:53.700> near<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> end<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.869> is

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
climactic moment near the end so this is

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.420 
climactic moment near the end so this is
basically<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.649> weakness<00:01:55.829> add-on<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
basically one more weakness add-on to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
basically one more weakness add-on to
the<00:01:56.520> very<00:01:57.119> small<00:01:57.270> pile<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.110> mentioned

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the very small pile that I mentioned

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.840 
the very small pile that I mentioned
back<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.009> week<00:01:59.159> with<00:01:59.310> The<00:01:59.399> Witcher<00:01:59.520> video

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
back in the week with The Witcher video

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.609 
back in the week with The Witcher video
and<00:02:00.119> honestly<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.259> together<00:02:01.409> still

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
and honestly all of them together still

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.770 
and honestly all of them together still
do<00:02:01.979> very<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.820> detract<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.299> all<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
do very little to detract from all the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.510 
do very little to detract from all the
things<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.200> game<00:02:04.409> does<00:02:04.680> right<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.369> said

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
things this game does right like I said

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.340 
things this game does right like I said
before<00:02:05.670> sometimes<00:02:06.270> wrote<00:02:06.659> responds<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
before sometimes wrote responds and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.930 
before sometimes wrote responds and
really<00:02:07.649> dumb<00:02:07.799> places<00:02:08.190> sometimes<00:02:08.369> which<00:02:08.700> makes

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
really dumb places sometimes which makes

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.699 
really dumb places sometimes which makes
it<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.300> annoying<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.319> your<00:02:10.410> horse

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
it really annoying to get to your horse

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.470 
it really annoying to get to your horse
I<00:02:10.920> wish<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> game<00:02:11.580> gave<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> little<00:02:12.360> more

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
I wish the game gave you a little more

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.400 
I wish the game gave you a little more
freedom<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:12.870> what<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.170> could

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
freedom with what you could

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.870 
freedom with what you could
put<00:02:13.500> into<00:02:13.740> your<00:02:13.830> quick<00:02:14.100> item<00:02:14.340> slots<00:02:14.610> because

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
put into your quick item slots because

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.940 
put into your quick item slots because
you're<00:02:15.510> limited<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> only<00:02:15.960> using<00:02:16.440> bombs<00:02:16.620> or

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
you're limited to only using bombs or

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.740 
you're limited to only using bombs or
pocket<00:02:17.340> items<00:02:17.640> which<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.090> me<00:02:18.210> would<00:02:18.360> make<00:02:18.540> a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
pocket items which to me would make a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.390 
pocket items which to me would make a
lot<00:02:19.050> more<00:02:19.170> sense<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.680> do<00:02:19.800> things<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.100> say

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
lot more sense if you do things like say

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.730 
lot more sense if you do things like say
put<00:02:20.880> additional<00:02:21.060> potions<00:02:21.690> or<00:02:21.870> three<00:02:22.530> bumps

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
put additional potions or three bumps

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.650 
put additional potions or three bumps
you<00:02:22.980> out<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.220> multiple<00:02:23.370> ones<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:23.970> no<00:02:24.240> bombs<00:02:24.480> if

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
you out of multiple ones or no bombs if

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.000 
you out of multiple ones or no bombs if
you<00:02:24.720> want<00:02:24.840> make<00:02:24.930> room<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.290> other<00:02:25.440> items<00:02:25.770> it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
you want make room for other items it

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.470 
you want make room for other items it
just<00:02:26.220> seems<00:02:26.400> silly<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:27.150> give<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
just seems silly to give you the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.790 
just seems silly to give you the
restrictions<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> game<00:02:28.230> currently<00:02:28.500> has

restrictions the game currently has

restrictions the game currently has
speaking<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.730> which<00:02:29.910> by<00:02:30.120> far<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.450> game's

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
speaking of which by far the game's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.570 
speaking of which by far the game's
silliest<00:02:31.110> downside<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.040> falling<00:02:32.430> damage

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
silliest downside is the falling damage

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.310 
silliest downside is the falling damage
which<00:02:32.910> is<00:02:33.060> absolutely<00:02:33.540> ridiculous<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.200> can

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
which is absolutely ridiculous you can

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.810 
which is absolutely ridiculous you can
fall<00:02:34.590> off<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.890> something<00:02:35.100> that's<00:02:35.340> maybe<00:02:35.520> ten

fall off of something that's maybe ten

fall off of something that's maybe ten
feet<00:02:35.970> high<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.300> take<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.570> little<00:02:36.840> damage<00:02:37.140> but

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
feet high and take a little damage but
