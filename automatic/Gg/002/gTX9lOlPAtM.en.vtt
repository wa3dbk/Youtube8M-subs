well<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:07.020> weather<00:00:07.259> in<00:00:07.529> tezi<00:00:07.919> at<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.040> moment

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
well the weather in tezi at the moment

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.980 
well the weather in tezi at the moment
is<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> little<00:00:08.790> bit<00:00:08.880> stereotypical<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:09.929> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
is a little bit stereotypical it's a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.049 
is a little bit stereotypical it's a
little<00:00:10.200> bit<00:00:10.290> dead<00:00:10.559> but<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.309> are<00:00:11.490> staying<00:00:11.820> high

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
little bit dead but we are staying high

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.150 
little bit dead but we are staying high
and<00:00:12.420> dry<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> thought<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.740> might<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.009> good

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
and dry so I thought it might be a good

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.609 
and dry so I thought it might be a good
time<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.519> show<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.790> around<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.630> cub<00:00:15.900> Brumby

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
time to show you around the cub Brumby

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
time to show you around the cub Brumby

in on this adventure
well<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.119> cub<00:00:21.330> bromby<00:00:21.689> has<00:00:21.869> been<00:00:22.050> around<00:00:22.289> for

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
well the cub bromby has been around for

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.880 
well the cub bromby has been around for
a<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.650> while<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.369> cub<00:00:24.350> typically<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a little while but cub typically with a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.710 
a little while but cub typically with a
company<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.640> been<00:00:26.820> around<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.240> 40<00:00:27.510> years

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
company that's been around for 40 years

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.060 
company that's been around for 40 years
they<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:27.960> things<00:00:28.320> sort<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> more<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:28.980> an

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
they do things sort of more in an

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.939 
they do things sort of more in an
evolutionary<00:00:29.429> way<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.750> new<00:00:31.019> model<00:00:31.380> does

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
evolutionary way but this new model does

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.860 
evolutionary way but this new model does
tend<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.489> quite<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.000> bunch<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.719> new

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
tend to have quite a bunch of new

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.260 
tend to have quite a bunch of new
features<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.739> I'd<00:00:35.010> love<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> show<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.969> up

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
features that I'd love to show you so up

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.930 
features that I'd love to show you so up
front<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> brand<00:00:37.890> new<00:00:38.070> storage<00:00:38.430> box<00:00:38.820> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
front is a brand new storage box and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.970 
front is a brand new storage box and
it's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.210> better<00:00:39.420> design<00:00:39.870> than<00:00:39.899> before<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> think

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it's a better design than before I think

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's a better design than before I think
because<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.489> lot<00:00:41.700> larger<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.809> got

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
because it is a lot larger and it's got

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
because it is a lot larger and it's got
these<00:00:43.140> beautiful<00:00:43.500> deep<00:00:44.040> drawers<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:45.390> are

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
these beautiful deep drawers that are

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.350 
these beautiful deep drawers that are
locked<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.410> place<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.460> stay<00:00:47.850> nice<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
locked in place so they stay nice and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.260 
locked in place so they stay nice and
tight<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.399> store<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.000> hell<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
tight but they really do store a hell of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.319 
tight but they really do store a hell of
a<00:00:51.390> lot<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.350> couple<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.949> side

plenty more storage as well so you've
got<00:01:05.100> another<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:05.880> now<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.049> design<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
got another one there now the design of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
got another one there now the design of
the<00:01:08.070> cub<00:01:08.280> camper<00:01:08.700> trail<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the cub camper trail is there what you

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.050 
the cub camper trail is there what you
what<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> call<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> hard<00:01:10.950> floor<00:01:11.310> campus<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
what you call a hard floor campus so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.109 
what you call a hard floor campus so
that<00:01:12.780> means<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.070> sleeping<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that means that you are sleeping up and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
that means that you are sleeping up and
off<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.330> ground<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> lid<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> camper

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
off the ground so the lid of the camper

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.730 
off the ground so the lid of the camper
flips<00:01:17.670> over<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.450> become<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.200> floor<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
flips over to become the floor of the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
flips over to become the floor of the
campus<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.340> no<00:01:20.759> matter<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> weather's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
campus so no matter what the weather's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
campus so no matter what the weather's
doing<00:01:21.570> outside<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.759> whole

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
doing outside you can have a whole

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.490 
doing outside you can have a whole
virtually<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> river<00:01:25.020> running<00:01:25.200> underneath

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
virtually a river running underneath

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.230 
virtually a river running underneath
your<00:01:25.799> camper<00:01:26.130> trailer<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.759> won't<00:01:27.000> get

really<00:01:29.640> noticed<00:01:30.210> particularly<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.930> these<00:01:31.200> wet

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
really noticed particularly in these wet

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.100 
really noticed particularly in these wet
conditions<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.790> canvas<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.720> dine

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
