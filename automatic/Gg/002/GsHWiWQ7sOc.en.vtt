00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
that is the chip that in my experience

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.569 
that is the chip that in my experience
is<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.289> one<00:00:24.589> that<00:00:24.679> overheats<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:25.310> gives<00:00:25.460> you

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
is the one that overheats and gives you

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.769 
is the one that overheats and gives you
the<00:00:25.699> yellow<00:00:25.880> light<00:00:26.119> of<00:00:26.150> death

the yellow light of death
this<00:00:27.499> chip<00:00:28.039> when<00:00:28.249> it<00:00:28.369> overheats<00:00:28.909> it<00:00:29.239> gets<00:00:29.390> so

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:29.569 
this chip when it overheats it gets so

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.520 
this chip when it overheats it gets so
hot<00:00:29.869> that<00:00:30.489> the<00:00:31.489> expansion<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.329> this<00:00:32.899> this

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
hot that the expansion the this this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.380

the machine won't turn on at all and you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.919 
the machine won't turn on at all and you
have<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.379> yellow<00:01:00.530> light<00:01:00.769> of<00:01:00.890> death<00:01:01.070> issue<00:01:01.339> so

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
have the yellow light of death issue so

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.140 
have the yellow light of death issue so
what<00:01:02.929> we<00:01:03.050> want<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.350> do<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.589> clean<00:01:03.890> these

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
what we want to do is clean these

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.680

years we open these machines and we're
replacing<00:02:42.569> hard<00:02:43.169> drives<00:02:43.439> and<00:02:43.769> power<00:02:44.010> supplies

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
replacing hard drives and power supplies

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.420 
replacing hard drives and power supplies
and<00:02:44.370> whatnot<00:02:44.849> but<00:02:45.719> whenever<00:02:46.079> we<00:02:46.260> do<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:47.280> get

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and whatnot but whenever we do we get

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.550 
and whatnot but whenever we do we get
down<00:02:47.609> here<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.000> processors<00:02:48.689> and<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:49.319> it's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
down here to the processors and if it's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.920 
down here to the processors and if it's
two<00:02:49.739> years<00:02:49.980> or<00:02:50.219> more<00:02:50.459> they<00:02:50.939> are<00:02:51.120> bone-dry

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
two years or more they are bone-dry

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.189 
two years or more they are bone-dry
they're<00:02:52.409> just<00:02:52.680> akin<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.699> overheat<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.209> it's

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
they're just akin to overheat on it's

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.929 
they're just akin to overheat on it's
better<00:02:55.439> to<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:55.709> proactive<00:02:55.949> take<00:02:56.609> a<00:02:56.639> little<00:02:56.849> bit

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
better to be proactive take a little bit

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.750 
better to be proactive take a little bit
of<00:02:57.030> time<00:02:57.530> I'm<00:02:58.530> doing<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.799> lot<00:02:58.919> of<00:02:58.980> talking<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
of time I'm doing a lot of talking and

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.189 
of time I'm doing a lot of talking and
yakking<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:00.359> but<00:03:00.510> when<00:03:00.629> you're<00:03:00.750> not<00:03:00.900> talking

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:01.199 
yakking here but when you're not talking

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.629 
yakking here but when you're not talking
you<00:03:01.560> can<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.799> through<00:03:02.010> these<00:03:02.159> things<00:03:02.219> and

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
you can get through these things and

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.939 
you can get through these things and
really<00:03:03.419> less<00:03:03.599> than<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.900> half<00:03:04.079> hour<00:03:04.319> clean<00:03:04.799> it

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:04.949 
really less than a half hour clean it

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.830 
really less than a half hour clean it
out<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.250> be<00:03:05.340> done<00:03:05.489> with<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.030> those<00:03:06.599> two

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
out and be done with it so those two

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.140 
out and be done with it so those two
chips<00:03:07.139> are<00:03:07.379> these<00:03:07.739> two<00:03:07.919> two<00:03:08.159> processors<00:03:08.849> are

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
chips are these two two processors are

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.360 
chips are these two two processors are
nice<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:09.840> clean<00:03:10.019> ready<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.409> go<00:03:10.560> let's<00:03:11.069> set<00:03:11.250> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
nice and clean ready to go let's set the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:21.809 
nice and clean ready to go let's set the
board<00:03:11.609> aside<00:03:11.909> for<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.269> second<00:03:12.659> and

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.050 

we're<00:03:22.480> heading<00:03:22.780> clean<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:24.400> fan<00:03:24.640> in<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:24.909> heat

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
we're heading clean the fan in the heat

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.640 
we're heading clean the fan in the heat
sink<00:03:25.360> first<00:03:25.750> we'll<00:03:25.959> just<00:03:26.140> talk<00:03:26.319> about<00:03:26.620> a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
sink first we'll just talk about a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.209 
sink first we'll just talk about a
little<00:03:26.859> bit<00:03:27.120> now<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.180> PlayStation<00:03:28.810> 3<00:03:29.019> fan<00:03:29.829> and

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.219 
little bit now the PlayStation 3 fan and

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.940 
little bit now the PlayStation 3 fan and
heatsink<00:03:30.549> assembly<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:32.500> really<00:03:32.739> quite<00:03:32.920> a

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
heatsink assembly it's really quite a

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.440 
heatsink assembly it's really quite a
monster<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.489> mean<00:03:33.640> they<00:03:33.730> didn't<00:03:34.000> spare<00:03:34.420> any

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
monster I mean they didn't spare any

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.720 
monster I mean they didn't spare any
expense<00:03:34.659> or<00:03:35.290> any<00:03:35.439> space<00:03:35.859> here<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.459> certainly

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
expense or any space here it certainly

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.869 
expense or any space here it certainly
takes<00:03:36.909> up<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.209> lot<00:03:37.359> of<00:03:37.390> volume<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.829> if<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.730> look

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
takes up a lot of volume and if you look

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.759 
takes up a lot of volume and if you look
at<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.090> size<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.540> fan<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:41.230> mean<00:03:41.680> it's

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
at the size of the fan I mean it's

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.619 
at the size of the fan I mean it's
almost<00:03:41.920> as<00:03:42.159> big<00:03:42.609> as<00:03:42.760> your<00:03:42.879> outstretched<00:03:43.239> pot

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
almost as big as your outstretched pot

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.259 
almost as big as your outstretched pot
at<00:03:43.750> least<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.989> child's<00:03:44.379> pond<00:03:44.760> it's<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.909> heck<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.120> a

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
at least a child's pond it's a heck of a

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.349 
at least a child's pond it's a heck of a
fan<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.900> moves<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.470> lot<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.799> air<00:03:48.189> and<00:03:49.000> what<00:03:49.209> it's

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
fan it moves a lot of air and what it's

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.379 
fan it moves a lot of air and what it's
doing<00:03:49.720> is<00:03:49.900> when<00:03:50.200> it's<00:03:50.319> inside<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.799> machine

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
doing is when it's inside the machine

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.360 
doing is when it's inside the machine
it's<00:03:52.389> pulling<00:03:53.139> air<00:03:53.349> in<00:03:53.560> from<00:03:53.889> the<00:03:53.920> right<00:03:54.159> side

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
it's pulling air in from the right side

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.759 
it's pulling air in from the right side
of<00:03:54.430> your<00:03:54.609> PlayStation<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.930> blowing<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.650> out

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
of your PlayStation and blowing it out

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.509 
of your PlayStation and blowing it out
the<00:03:57.670> back<00:03:57.909> and<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:59.560> moves<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.889> lot<00:04:00.010> of<00:04:00.159> volume<00:04:00.459> a

intercooler fans the external fans that

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.240 
intercooler fans the external fans that
you<00:04:04.209> can<00:04:04.359> plug<00:04:04.540> on<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.049> I'm<00:04:05.290> all<00:04:05.470> for<00:04:05.769> that

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
you can plug on and I'm all for that

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.069 
you can plug on and I'm all for that
it<00:04:06.639> just<00:04:06.819> increases<00:04:07.120> air<00:04:07.540> flow<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:07.930> that's

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
it just increases air flow and that's

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.589 
it just increases air flow and that's
great<00:04:08.349> but<00:04:09.220> just<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.669> your<00:04:09.849> car<00:04:10.090> radiator

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
great but just like your car radiator

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.330 
great but just like your car radiator
you<00:04:10.989> know<00:04:11.109> you<00:04:11.169> can<00:04:11.409> have<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.560> great<00:04:11.829> radiator

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
you know you can have a great radiator

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.860

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.480 
underside of the CPU one to the GPU now
let's<00:04:53.680> just<00:04:53.830> quickly<00:04:54.070> clean<00:04:54.520> off<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:57.130> residue

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
let's just quickly clean off the residue

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.800 
let's just quickly clean off the residue
axis<00:04:57.880> blow<00:04:58.599> off<00:04:58.750> some<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.169> dust<00:04:59.349> ropes

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.610 

around<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:04.750> sink<00:05:05.750> blocks<00:05:06.050> here

around the sink blocks here

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.980 
around the sink blocks here
now<00:05:07.220> we'll<00:05:07.370> clean<00:05:07.700> these<00:05:08.320> blocks<00:05:09.320> you<00:05:10.990> know

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
now we'll clean these blocks you know

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.070 
now we'll clean these blocks you know
this<00:05:12.139> isn't<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:14.060> know<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.300> is<00:05:14.450> an<00:05:14.570> asset

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
this isn't you know this is an asset

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.740 
this isn't you know this is an asset
it's<00:05:15.230> not<00:05:15.350> a<00:05:15.380> clean<00:05:15.710> room<00:05:15.980> at<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.220> hospital<00:05:16.750> but

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
it's not a clean room at a hospital but

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.300 
it's not a clean room at a hospital but
we<00:05:17.960> do<00:05:18.110> want<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.500> get<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.770> as<00:05:18.889> clean<00:05:19.160> as

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
we do want to get it as clean as

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.400 
we do want to get it as clean as
possible<00:05:21.460> then<00:05:22.460> reason<00:05:22.940> because<00:05:23.660> what<00:05:24.290> we're

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
possible then reason because what we're

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.680 
possible then reason because what we're
trying<00:05:24.530> to<00:05:24.800> do<00:05:24.950> is<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.430> make<00:05:27.850> 100%<00:05:28.850> contact

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
trying to do is to make 100% contact

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.710 
trying to do is to make 100% contact

this heatsink we're going to kind of

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.320 
this heatsink we're going to kind of
clean<00:05:59.600> it<00:05:59.690> with<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.810> dry<00:06:00.080> paper<00:06:00.440> towel<00:06:01.090> as<00:06:02.090> nice

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
clean it with a dry paper towel as nice

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.040 
clean it with a dry paper towel as nice
as<00:06:02.510> we<00:06:02.630> can<00:06:03.790> do<00:06:04.790> the<00:06:04.940> chips<00:06:05.210> one<00:06:05.450> last<00:06:05.720> time

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
as we can do the chips one last time

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:16.480 
as we can do the chips one last time
with<00:06:06.260> a<00:06:06.320> dry<00:06:06.620> clean<00:06:07.810> paper<00:06:08.810> towel<00:06:15.340> yeah<00:06:16.340> at

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
with a dry clean paper towel yeah at

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.310 
with a dry clean paper towel yeah at
4:00<00:06:16.760> we<00:06:16.940> pieces<00:06:17.600> are<00:06:17.720> just<00:06:17.810> mention<00:06:18.200> real

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
4:00 we pieces are just mention real

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.659 
4:00 we pieces are just mention real
quickly<00:06:18.530> what's<00:06:18.860> going<00:06:19.220> on<00:06:19.400> here<00:06:19.760> is<00:06:21.460> the<00:06:22.460> fan

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
quickly what's going on here is the fan

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.159 
quickly what's going on here is the fan
obviously<00:06:23.240> is<00:06:23.330> pulling<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:23.750> heat<00:06:23.900> away<00:06:24.020> from

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
obviously is pulling the heat away from

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.680 
obviously is pulling the heat away from
the<00:06:24.500> radiator<00:06:24.919> just<00:06:25.220> like<00:06:25.310> your<00:06:25.430> car<00:06:25.690> now

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
the radiator just like your car now

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.500 
the radiator just like your car now
we've<00:06:27.080> got<00:06:27.200> the<00:06:27.320> thermal<00:06:27.620> paste<00:06:28.210> spread<00:06:29.210> on

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
we've got the thermal paste spread on

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.810 
we've got the thermal paste spread on
the<00:06:30.260> blocks<00:06:30.530> here<00:06:30.860> and<00:06:30.890> b2y<00:06:31.520> we're<00:06:31.729> actually

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
the blocks here and b2y we're actually

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.790 
the blocks here and b2y we're actually
going<00:06:32.030> to<00:06:32.120> put<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.419> the<00:06:33.110> throw'em<00:06:33.680> face

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
going to put the the throw'em face

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.529 
going to put the the throw'em face
directly<00:06:34.070> on<00:06:34.370> the<00:06:34.490> processors<00:06:35.120> but<00:06:35.270> when<00:06:35.450> you

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
directly on the processors but when you

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.390 
directly on the processors but when you
put<00:06:36.020> them<00:06:36.140> together<00:06:36.260> there's<00:06:36.860> much<00:06:37.100> like<00:06:37.280> an

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
put them together there's much like an

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.219 
put them together there's much like an
Oreo<00:06:37.640> cookie<00:06:37.700> you've<00:06:38.479> got<00:06:38.660> the<00:06:38.840> you've<00:06:39.110> got

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
Oreo cookie you've got the you've got

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.380 
Oreo cookie you've got the you've got
the<00:06:39.440> one<00:06:39.860> side<00:06:40.130> of<00:06:40.280> the<00:06:40.370> cookies<00:06:40.789> Chiz<00:06:41.150> the

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
processor the other side of the cookie

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.219 
processor the other side of the cookie
is<00:06:43.729> the<00:06:43.970> block<00:06:44.210> and<00:06:44.419> in<00:06:44.510> between<00:06:44.600> there<00:06:45.050> is

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
is the block and in between there is

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.540 
is the block and in between there is
this<00:06:45.350> very<00:06:45.860> thin<00:06:46.130> layer<00:06:46.370> of<00:06:46.610> thermal<00:06:47.060> paste

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
this very thin layer of thermal paste

paste<00:06:54.140> into<00:06:54.590> the<00:06:54.680> block<00:06:54.919> here<00:06:55.310> then<00:06:56.030> it's

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
paste into the block here then it's

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.390 
paste into the block here then it's
carried<00:06:56.780> away<00:06:56.990> by<00:06:57.200> these<00:06:57.260> little<00:06:57.800> veins<00:06:57.979> these

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
these tubes you've actually got a

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.510 
these tubes you've actually got a

tubes and what it does is to acts like a

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.920 
tubes and what it does is to acts like a
miniature<00:07:14.990> air<00:07:15.289> conditioner

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
miniature air conditioner

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.280 
miniature air conditioner
and<00:07:16.050> so<00:07:16.620> the<00:07:16.949> alcohol<00:07:17.840> comes<00:07:18.840> in<00:07:18.990> here<00:07:19.110> just

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
and so the alcohol comes in here just

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.900 
and so the alcohol comes in here just
just<00:07:19.500> like<00:07:19.650> the<00:07:19.830> the<00:07:20.100> Kulin<00:07:20.430> and<00:07:20.550> you're<00:07:20.699> in

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910 
just like the the Kulin and you're in

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.760 
just like the the Kulin and you're in
your<00:07:21.030> car<00:07:21.180> air<00:07:21.389> conditioner<00:07:21.960> there's

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
your car air conditioner there's

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.840 
your car air conditioner there's
essentially<00:07:23.520> when<00:07:23.970> the<00:07:24.120> when<00:07:24.870> the<00:07:24.900> coolant

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
essentially when the when the coolant

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.640 
essentially when the when the coolant
contacts<00:07:26.850> the<00:07:27.090> heat<00:07:27.300> it<00:07:27.539> evaporates<00:07:28.440> and

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
contacts the heat it evaporates and

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.340 
contacts the heat it evaporates and
absorbs<00:07:29.220> heat<00:07:29.460> and<00:07:29.729> then<00:07:30.389> it's<00:07:30.720> wycked

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350 
absorbs heat and then it's wycked

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.860 
absorbs heat and then it's wycked
back<00:07:31.860> out<00:07:32.190> to<00:07:32.430> the<00:07:32.550> outer<00:07:32.699> regions<00:07:33.539> here

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870 
back out to the outer regions here

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.260 
back out to the outer regions here
through<00:07:34.470> capillary<00:07:34.979> action<00:07:35.250> and<00:07:35.639> then<00:07:36.180> the

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.270 
through capillary action and then the

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.210 
through capillary action and then the
fan<00:07:36.509> blowing<00:07:36.930> the<00:07:37.110> heat<00:07:37.259> away<00:07:37.410> causes<00:07:38.039> the

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 
fan blowing the heat away causes the

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.879 
fan blowing the heat away causes the
alcohol<00:07:38.669> I<00:07:39.479> say<00:07:40.050> alcohol<00:07:40.229> I<00:07:40.440> believe<00:07:40.710> that's

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:40.889 
alcohol I say alcohol I believe that's

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:43.249 
alcohol I say alcohol I believe that's
what's<00:07:41.039> inside<00:07:41.220> these<00:07:41.639> tubes<00:07:41.970> to<00:07:42.870> condense

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 
what's inside these tubes to condense

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.249 
what's inside these tubes to condense
again<00:07:43.650> so<00:07:44.430> then<00:07:44.639> the<00:07:44.729> condensate<00:07:45.360> comes<00:07:46.050> back

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 
again so then the condensate comes back

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:48.890 
again so then the condensate comes back
in<00:07:46.560> it<00:07:46.949> gets<00:07:47.130> evaporated<00:07:47.449> drawn<00:07:48.449> back<00:07:48.660> out

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 
in it gets evaporated drawn back out

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.500 
in it gets evaporated drawn back out
condenses<00:07:49.830> but<00:07:50.100> just<00:07:50.550> again<00:07:50.970> like<00:07:51.120> your<00:07:51.270> car

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.510 
condenses but just again like your car

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.909 
condenses but just again like your car
or<00:07:51.720> home<00:07:51.870> air<00:07:52.080> conditioner<00:07:52.560> is<00:07:52.620> the<00:07:52.710> same

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 
or home air conditioner is the same

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:54.860 
or home air conditioner is the same
process<00:07:53.370> just<00:07:53.400> just<00:07:53.850> in<00:07:53.970> miniature<00:07:54.419> so<00:07:54.600> it's

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:54.870 
process just just in miniature so it's

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.890 
process just just in miniature so it's
really<00:07:55.080> a<00:07:55.169> good<00:07:55.970> good<00:07:56.970> system<00:07:57.330> they<00:07:57.419> have<00:07:57.600> here

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 
really a good good system they have here

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.870 
really a good good system they have here
but<00:07:58.320> again<00:07:58.500> we<00:07:58.620> have<00:07:58.800> to<00:07:58.949> make<00:07:59.100> sure<00:07:59.250> that<00:07:59.520> that

00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 
but again we have to make sure that that

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.939 
but again we have to make sure that that
the<00:08:00.150> heatsink<00:08:00.630> paste<00:08:00.870> is<00:08:01.110> fresh<00:08:01.380> over<00:08:01.680> and

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:01.949 
the heatsink paste is fresh over and

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.170 
the heatsink paste is fresh over and
over<00:08:02.100> again<00:08:02.190> I'm<00:08:02.400> going<00:08:02.520> to<00:08:02.580> keep<00:08:02.699> saying<00:08:02.910> this

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180 
over again I'm going to keep saying this

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.390 
over again I'm going to keep saying this
that's<00:08:03.810> the<00:08:03.990> main<00:08:04.260> key<00:08:04.560> -<00:08:04.620> so<00:08:04.979> we've<00:08:05.130> spent<00:08:05.250> a

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 
that's the main key - so we've spent a

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.240 
that's the main key - so we've spent a
lot<00:08:05.430> of<00:08:05.580> time<00:08:05.789> getting<00:08:05.940> the<00:08:06.240> Machine<00:08:06.900> apart

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.250 
lot of time getting the Machine apart

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.850 
lot of time getting the Machine apart
but<00:08:08.330> here's<00:08:09.330> the<00:08:09.479> exciting<00:08:09.780> part<00:08:10.169> let's<00:08:10.620> grab

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 
but here's the exciting part let's grab

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.699 
but here's the exciting part let's grab
our<00:08:11.010> heatsink<00:08:11.460> paste
