00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.429
 good afternoon friends this is studio jambox 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.070
 and today we will talk on the smartphone 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.580
 the alcoa company you are an alcatel vantach w.ju. 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.080
 This is a 4 inch windows phone 7 smartphone 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.560
 represented by the company quite recently and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.810
 oddly enough they chose to save 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.029
 right time view windows support 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.890
 phone 7 is over everything now releases 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.710
 smartphones on windows phone 8 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.849
 but at least for 5-6 thousand rubles, I 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.219
 I think this smartphone 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.450
 open strong choice that's why he 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.090
 built on base 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.090
 1st grain of water seems to have a percentage 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.579
 qualcomm processor has 512 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.530
 megabyte operative and 4 gigabytes 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.690
 internal memory but 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.160
 this is enough for smoothly and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.010
 fast interface work 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 battery capacity 1 1.500 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 milliamp-hours 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.770
 what is and for this destructive android 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.260
 figure then for windows phone 7 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.210
 this figure is quite objective now 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 smartphone updated to a person is then 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.070
 windows phone 7.8 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.720
 already it has an interface more like a 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.970
 modern windows 8 interface you 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.970
 You can see one more thing about the interface. 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.360
 immediately caught my eye and strongly 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.280
 liked this standard pictures 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:32.380
 which were uploaded to the smartphone they 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:35.440
 go under the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and so 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.460
 further here and when in working condition 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.850
 are playing 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.820
 it looks very nice and interesting 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.080
 as with any kind of smartphone 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.220
 Minimal customization can be changed 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.210
 maximum color 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.460
 desktop and and the size of the icons but it 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.470
 However 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.479
 the apparatus is just an extended large he 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.340
 will suit your mom 's grandmother or man 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.070
 which goes from the usual apparatus to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.119
 sensory simply because push-button 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.970
 The device now costs 1000 rubles and the risk 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.920
 Lenin was once the price of the Russian market 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.260
 it will have to be delivered in black and 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 orange light have soft- coated 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.129
 but nevertheless everything is in my hands now 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.280
 do not know emulators sell devices 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.819
 it is in the sense of no but white gloss now in 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.900
 trend 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.319
 look at galaxy ace 3 and iphone 5 not 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.940
 especially looking again let's do 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.530
 summarize have you need a smartphone 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.870
 extended communication centers with 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.030
 internet browsing millions app 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.459
 so on this smartphone is clearly not for you 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.099
 but if you need a quality replacement 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.250
 your outdated button machine you 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.750
 don't want to bother with 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.879
 diverse modern features and 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.049
 regret that your smartphone lives 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:00.140
 less than one day then i think that 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.629
 Alcatel one touch view cost 5-6 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.260
 thousand rubles is a justifiable choice 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.609
 seriously this machine we have on the studio 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.359
 looked a very large number 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:14.239
 people and three of them collect buy it 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.810
 it was a studio jet box the whole thing in boxing 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.810
 until
