00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.940 
then I'll move on to popping this
product<00:02:08.179> which<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.630> mower<00:02:08.959> green<00:02:09.530> bottom

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
product which is the mower green bottom

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.559 
product which is the mower green bottom
on<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:12.200> below<00:02:12.680> my<00:02:12.830> nose<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.400> on<00:02:14.150> my<00:02:14.300> chin

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
on to the below my nose and on my chin

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.479 
on to the below my nose and on my chin
because<00:02:14.720> those<00:02:15.050> areas<00:02:15.440> feel<00:02:15.620> quite<00:02:15.860> rough<00:02:16.160> at

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
because those areas feel quite rough at

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.640 
because those areas feel quite rough at
the<00:02:16.550> moment<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.750> think<00:02:18.050> they<00:02:18.260> need<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> little

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the moment so I think they need a little

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.710 
the moment so I think they need a little
bit<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.860> extra<00:02:18.950> attention<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.569> will

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
bit of extra attention and that will

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.380 
bit of extra attention and that will
definitely<00:02:21.050> do<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.560> for<00:02:21.950> me<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.400> then<00:02:23.239> what
