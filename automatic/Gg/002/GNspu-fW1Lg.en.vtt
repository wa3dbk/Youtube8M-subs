as<00:00:53.850> consoles<00:00:54.510> several<00:00:54.899> years<00:00:55.140> ago<00:00:55.730> when<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
as consoles several years ago when it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.520 
as consoles several years ago when it
comes<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.390> device<00:00:57.660> walk<00:00:58.170> us<00:00:58.350> through

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
comes to this device walk us through

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.750 
comes to this device walk us through
what<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.859> experience<00:00:59.340> will<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.640> how<00:00:59.730> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
what the experience will be and how you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.529 
what the experience will be and how you
guys<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.300> combining<00:01:00.660> both<00:01:00.960> AR<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.800> VR<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:03.149> we

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
guys are combining both AR and VR so we

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
guys are combining both AR and VR so we
envisioned<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> device<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.530> did<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.040> include

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
envisioned a device that did not include

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.890 
envisioned a device that did not include
your<00:01:05.670> field<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> view<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.270> your<00:01:06.299> expression

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
your field of view in your expression

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
your field of view in your expression
one<00:01:07.439> which<00:01:07.680> allows<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> see<00:01:08.850> around<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
one which allows you to see around you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330 
one which allows you to see around you
as<00:01:09.540> well<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> content<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.070> screen

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
as well as see the content of the screen

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.980 
as well as see the content of the screen
itself<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> demonstrate<00:01:12.570> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
itself so I'm going to demonstrate this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
itself so I'm going to demonstrate this
by<00:01:13.049> putting<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.490> envision<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.970> more

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
by putting it on but we envision it more

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.390 
by putting it on but we envision it more
like<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> hat<00:01:15.720> something<00:01:16.619> which<00:01:16.799> sat<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
like a hat something which sat up and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.980 
like a hat something which sat up and
away<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:18.000> field<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.360> view<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.570> left

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
away from your field of view that left

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.770 
away from your field of view that left
your<00:01:19.140> eyes<00:01:19.320> visible<00:01:19.939> we<00:01:20.939> also<00:01:21.090> realized<00:01:21.600> with

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
your eyes visible we also realized with

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.359 
your eyes visible we also realized with
a<00:01:21.810> set<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.170> optics<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.770> addressed<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.159> lot

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
a set of optics that we addressed a lot

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
a set of optics that we addressed a lot
of<00:01:23.520> problems<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.119> sort<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> solve<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.840> at

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
of problems and sort of solve them at

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.320 
of problems and sort of solve them at
the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.470> we're<00:01:26.430> using<00:01:26.700> very<00:01:27.090> simple

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the same time we're using very simple

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.120 
the same time we're using very simple
reflectors<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.650> both<00:01:28.829> half

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.679 
silvered as well as Phil silver and
these<00:01:31.530> provide<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.220> fairly<00:01:32.880> compelling<00:01:33.299> field

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
these provide a fairly compelling field

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
these provide a fairly compelling field

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
controller and how that will play into

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.330 
controller and how that will play into
these<00:01:42.689> video<00:01:43.200> game<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.710> other<00:01:43.920> virtual

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
these video game and other virtual

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.940 
these video game and other virtual
experiences<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:46.110> design<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> controller

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
experiences so we design a controller

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
experiences so we design a controller
that<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.909> particularly<00:01:48.479> suited<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
that was particularly suited for a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.780 
that was particularly suited for a
head-mounted<00:01:49.259> display<00:01:49.770> something<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:50.340> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
head-mounted display something which you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
head-mounted display something which you
have<00:01:50.970> most<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.420> time<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.899> front<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
have most of the time in front of you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
have most of the time in front of you
and<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.560> want<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> familiarity<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.579> hardware

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and you want the familiarity of hardware

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
and you want the familiarity of hardware

let's start talk a little about some of
the<00:02:12.459> demos<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:12.909> guys<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.269> here<00:02:13.420> GDC<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.140> now

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
the demos you guys have here GDC and now

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.460 
the demos you guys have here GDC and now
they're<00:02:14.379> utilizing<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.950> technology<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.200> we

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
they're utilizing this technology so we

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.140 
they're utilizing this technology so we
have<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> couple<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.129> demos<00:02:18.340> here<00:02:18.670> one<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:19.030> them

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
have a couple of demos here one of them

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.990 
have a couple of demos here one of them
