00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
collection sharing exhibition because

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.480 
collection sharing exhibition because
works<00:01:31.210> will<00:01:31.479> come<00:01:31.750> out<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.110> here<00:01:32.350> from<00:01:32.680> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
works will come out of here from the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.520 
works will come out of here from the
fine<00:01:33.880> arts<00:01:34.119> museums<00:01:34.570> gift<00:01:34.930> that<00:01:35.170> we<00:01:35.290> had

fine arts museums gift that we had

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.830 
fine arts museums gift that we had
they'll<00:01:36.430> come<00:01:36.640> out<00:01:36.759> of<00:01:36.880> here<00:01:37.030> from<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.420> the

they'll come out of here from the the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.679 
they'll come out of here from the the
Anderson<00:01:38.290> collection<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:40.180> think<00:01:40.479> that's

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
Anderson collection and I think that's

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.590 
Anderson collection and I think that's
that's<00:01:41.320> substantially<00:01:42.250> yet<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.729> we<00:01:43.060> feel<00:01:43.360> we

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
that's substantially yet and we feel we

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.649 
that's substantially yet and we feel we
can<00:01:43.810> use<00:01:44.170> these<00:01:44.680> two<00:01:45.040> advantage<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.479> that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
can use these two advantage so so that

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.639 
can use these two advantage so so that
institutions<00:01:47.560> can<00:01:47.979> utilize<00:01:48.850> these<00:01:49.210> works<00:01:49.649> for

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
institutions can utilize these works for

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.469 
institutions can utilize these works for
the<00:01:50.890> enhancement<00:01:51.009> of<00:01:51.670> their<00:01:51.850> exhibition

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
the enhancement of their exhibition

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.260 
the enhancement of their exhibition
programs<00:01:52.990> not<00:01:53.860> only<00:01:54.040> that<00:01:54.130> but<00:01:54.310> it's<00:01:54.880> becoming

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
programs not only that but it's becoming

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.510 
programs not only that but it's becoming
more<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.750> more<00:01:55.930> expensive<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.829> put<00:01:57.310> on

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
more and more expensive to put on

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.420 
more and more expensive to put on
exhibitions<00:01:58.210> for<00:01:59.049> instance<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.439> little<00:01:59.710> Museum

Diebenkorn studio he was struggling with

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.050 
Diebenkorn studio he was struggling with
he<00:03:59.870> had<00:04:00.049> any<00:04:00.260> number<00:04:00.769> of<00:04:00.799> these<00:04:01.250> paintings<00:04:01.639> on

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.539 
and and I think it was kind of a
struggle<00:04:11.359> he'd<00:04:11.780> paint<00:04:12.109> a<00:04:12.200> little<00:04:12.319> bit<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.859> rub

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.140 
it out and he paint a little bit more
and<00:04:15.680> then<00:04:15.769> he'd<00:04:15.980> go<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.370> next<00:04:16.639> one<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:16.940> so

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
and then he'd go to the next one and so

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.990 
and then he'd go to the next one and so
forth<00:04:17.510> but<00:04:18.320> he<00:04:18.500> was<00:04:18.650> steadfast<00:04:18.919> in<00:04:19.489> terms<00:04:19.789> of

artist's<00:05:28.600> work<00:05:28.810> is<00:05:29.140> the<00:05:29.590> idea<00:05:29.890> of<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.130> head

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
artist's work is the idea of the head

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.930 
artist's work is the idea of the head
which<00:05:31.090> is<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.390> idea<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.820> execution<00:05:33.820> is

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
which is the idea and the execution is

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.150 
which is the idea and the execution is
in<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.240> hands<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.350> think<00:05:35.590> that<00:05:35.770> it<00:05:35.890> does

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
in the hands and I think that it does

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.970 
in the hands and I think that it does
show<00:05:36.490> up<00:05:36.730> if<00:05:36.970> you<00:05:37.120> really<00:05:37.600> investigate<00:05:38.290> the

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
show up if you really investigate the

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.730 
show up if you really investigate the

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
to know via and she's Latvian I think it

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.970 
to know via and she's Latvian I think it
is<00:05:44.980> and<00:05:45.220> she's<00:05:46.120> really<00:05:46.450> a<00:05:46.480> great<00:05:46.780> gal<00:05:47.110> with

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
of the Princeton Sam was very much

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.850 
of the Princeton Sam was very much
involved<00:06:32.890> with<00:06:33.250> with<00:06:33.670> what<00:06:33.880> I<00:06:33.910> call<00:06:34.380> the<00:06:35.380> resin

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860

resins and I think that I'd like to
think<00:06:42.100> of<00:06:42.280> at<00:06:42.640> least<00:06:42.850> in<00:06:43.060> my<00:06:43.210> own<00:06:43.360> mind<00:06:43.570> that

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.630 
think of at least in my own mind that
the<00:06:44.500> use<00:06:44.740> of<00:06:44.770> resins<00:06:45.520> was<00:06:46.450> really<00:06:46.900> begun<00:06:47.290> in

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 
the use of resins was really begun in
