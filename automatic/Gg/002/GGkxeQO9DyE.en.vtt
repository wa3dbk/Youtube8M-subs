00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:10.110
 lecture topic 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.610
 nervous tissue types of neurons nervous 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.510
 the tissue consists of neurons 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.869
 a different role and analyze the types of neurons 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.279
 seen Irakli and in the next lecture on 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.310
 iran and takes up ten percent 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.140
 nervous tissue of the world go to 91 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.680
 morphological classification of neurons 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.790
 the number of shoots second 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.700
 functional 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.950
 by the nature of the function performed by 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 position in the reflex arc third 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.739
 biochemical 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.460
 like a neurotransmitter which 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.230
 synthesized in scree orion 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.230
 or sony tank 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.940
 morphological classification by 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.090
 number of shoots 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.719
 distinguish unipolar that is one 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.920
 scion 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.659
 body one process only as transient 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.560
 stage of transformation nair he them 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.970
 there is this kind of neuron b 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.580
 bipolar one axon one dendrite in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.729
 mainly in the senses only such 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.740
 and ron and pseudo or false non-polar 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:33.829
 the neuron from the body moves one process 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.829
 smarter which is divisible by 2 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.730
 axon and smoke guide 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.590
 such myron are spinal 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:48.310
 ganglia and how letters a multi polar game 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.130
 which neurons are most 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.550
 many dendrites moving away from the body and one 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.070
 axon 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.720
 unipolar neuron during development here 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.840
 us layers and here is the stage under the letter b 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.040
 when we have one process appear 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.760
 here we already see a lot of shoots 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.970
 Army run retina wand and 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:23.050
 cones and still called subpolar 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:27.320
 Nairobi polar cell dendrite and axon 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.410
 pseudo unipolar spinal role 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.510
 ganglia here it is a body one process 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.160
 which is divided into two dendrite 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.160
 and aksu 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:48.620
 we looked at the bodies of these neurons we see 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.620
 here is the golgi complex in the cytoplasm 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.599
 ulta polar neuron in this case 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.700
 it's pyramid on and rolls large bark 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.890
 hemispheres 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.540
 not very similar to this picture because 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:07.170
 that because in the cerebral cortex 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.879
 up to 60 kinds of different multi polar 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.819
 pyramidal neurons 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:17.630
 star spindle baskets 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:20.610
 and other 2 functional classification 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.290
 by location on eron free clip top 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.069
 on arc sensitive intercalated 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.049
 motor and sensitive and 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.250
 afferent perceives information then 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.379
 have their dendrite go to the periphery well 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.670
 for example with an example about the index 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.730
 finger and 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:47.930
 and carries information to the body and then and 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.700
 goxon is already 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.209
 posterior horns of the spinal cord where 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.299
 switches to intercalated neuron 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:01.019
 intercalated neuron it is 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:04.040
 mediator or associative on and ron 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.530
 transmit impulse from one neuron over 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.459
 their other neurons nervous system 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.019
 most 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:15.049
 and efferent motor neurons they 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:20.769
 provide action in this case 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:22.240
 This measure we are talking about that axon 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.009
 axon 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.669
 motor neuron goes to the muscular 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.389
 fiber 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:32.780
 and we straightened our hand if we touched 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:36.169
 hot biochemical classification 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.900
 neurons first understand what is 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.800
 mediator mediator is the transmitter then 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.610
 substance transmitter nervous excitement 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.729
 central and peripheral nervous 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.479
 the system there are different types 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:54.729
 mediators that's the Allen here 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:59.620
 for example his model is a model of this 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:02.620
 mediator norepinephrine serotonin 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.620
 dopamine 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:12.010
 these substances are produced by scrub Orion 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.940
 and then delivered to the periphery of Oksana 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.050
 oksana 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.870
 and depending on the type of neurotransmitter 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.540
 distinguish cholinergic ie least 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.270
 mediator acetylcholine allergic 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.230
 neurons such as motor neurons 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.550
 front horns of the spinal cord 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:35.430
 innervating skeletal muscle fibers 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.600
 what we just said finger 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.840
 parasympathetic to iran and wandering 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.350
 nerve interfering heart 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.660
 smooth muscle cells of the gastric gland 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.870
 adrenergic neurons ator time 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.790
 them norepinephrine for example post ganglia 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.820
 she rn in iron sympathetic 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.610
 autonomic nervous system will be like 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.470
 take place later innervating the heart and 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.930
 vascular smooth muscle cells and 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.020
 internal organs 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.660
 also distinguished in serotonergic 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.000
 neurons mediator serotonin dopamine 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.990
 energetic neurons pediatrician dopamine 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.460
 i have three 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.220
 gamma-aminobutyric acid picts 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.300
 tragic neurons stop the foam station 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.630
 fallen endorphins and others we will 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:31.470
 still speak she or mediators when 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.470
 we will parse with you the structure of synapses 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.850
 thank you for your attention
