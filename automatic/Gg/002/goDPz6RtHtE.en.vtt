00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.230
 yes, we basically have it that way 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.890
 I think the first half hour again 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.900
 shown that we are optimistic 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.220
 You can have that in the square 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.000
 we played the first ones 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.730
 possibilities 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 and I'm not just talking about that 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.970
 spatially header chance but it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.850
 were also in the approach things where easy 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.739
 the last one does not fit exactly enough 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 not shared exactly enough 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.860
 accordingly greedy too 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.989
 completed and is not with us 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.989
 nonstop goal chances we catch 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.770
 But with the first situation for 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.390
 the opponent 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.250
 after ortega until then actually 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.650
 unemployed was the 0 1 and that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.280
 is like a door opener I'm 1000 times 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.050
 known for that 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 straight back to work very well 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.170
 already other teams have 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.269
 there the decoration aborted 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.610
 which are estimated to be much higher 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.739
 I did not think we were in the second 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.920
 half-time grottenschlecht but we were 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.200
 then have to rest with the things that are 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.770
 then offer to end play it 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.440
 were there still possibilities and the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 then we will not get through 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.460
 because the pass is not accurate enough because 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.899
 we too late then locate the winamp and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.950
 then you can not do such a game anymore 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.210
 We believe you have succeeded in 2000 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.909
 The cool started too 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.920
 better chances can or have to 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.630
 maybe even lead then 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.280
 the game is different and happens like that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.930
 a real bad luck 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.299
 list actually complete and natural 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.490
 that was already bitter after the 1 0 against 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.289
 the next day worked up three days 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 play video about it back then 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.719
 checked and from the time we have 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.890
 Well, we are focused on technical 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.929
 we can always tactically 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.450
 certain things try to bring in 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.649
 many things always automate 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.070
 to repeat 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.719
 also in the game forms like that and then too 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.420
 time and again this is this mixture 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.090
 bring in that one just football 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.060
 with fun that not only everyone here 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.440
 running around with strained faces 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.319
 but that you also have one 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.849
 certain looseness retains ours 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.680
 team will be on sunday 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.630
 handball against the FC Energie Cottbus 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.489
 in a special jersey on the occasion of the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.920
 city ​​anniversary we play red 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.980
 white in the city colors arminia 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.569
 bielefeld accompanies that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.970
 city ​​anniversary of the city of bielefeld and 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.560
 for me this project has at least 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.660
 three special features 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.060
 the first one is of course that arminia 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.980
 picks up on this anniversary and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.440
 The city would like to congratulate and get in 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.780
 the city colors presented the second 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.450
 Special feature is the alpine as main and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.750
 shirt sponsor entirely on his third 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.690
 Presence waived and on Sunday 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.239
 the jersey is not presented 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.849
 is not named as a sponsor on Sunday 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.459
 this was accompanied by the third 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.959
 special feature that alpecin then worth 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.200
 put on it that the special 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.640
 jerseys are designed by the fans 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.600
 is called by the protagonists of 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.430
 choreography 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.900
 they said if there was one 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.850
 then the jersey gives me the club 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.139
 to layout and then we do not take 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.690
 Official logo of the city Bielefeld 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.630
 but the fans should be in relation to the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.209
 topography the hand mirror fc st 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.370
 pauli gave this jersey a shape and style 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.200
 that for me and many others of course 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.459
 a great project and I'm happy 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.530
 very special on sunday 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.769
 something else industrial country just fine 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.590
 as it is and also the appearance so 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.420
 is a good thing 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.040
 I think computational game 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.769
 pointing the way and just when we 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.889
 against teams that plays behind you 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.230
 they are not that many anymore 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.030
 just had to win but that is 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.099
 actually a team with the whole 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.819
 other goals started in this 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.510
 season has then come to a spin 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.610
 Now they have a bit of that 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.190
 Conversely done and we have to 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.080
 of course now want to make sure that 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.489
 they do not get any closer you get 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.420
 the games we have the players 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.459
 all seen 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.880
 whether the game in cologne, where they have a second 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.709
 a lot of pressure at the top 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.410
 climb team made at all 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.180
 have against karlsruhe against an opponent 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.860
 He just does not keep moving forward 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.840
 played something different again 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.150
 then by a standard one 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.100
 eleven meters won but ultimately 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.020
 it was another game and it was again 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.350
 There are always situations in the game 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.090
 which you have to react to and I hope 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.270
 that yes, the first situation painter 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.240
 our side does not play the tv 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.400
 have a huge role at home 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.080
 she in the frank has already proved how 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.440
 many times I have pushed us and a 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.669
 very nice situation again 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.370
 maybe a little extra energy 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.750
 have released and we hope so 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.800
 just that we appear closed 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.599
 on sunday together with the fans 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.160
