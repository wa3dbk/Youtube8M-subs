they've gone a long time between
transmission<00:00:09.090> flushes<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.750> it's<00:00:10.170> really

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
transmission flushes and it's really

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.799 
transmission flushes and it's really
really<00:00:10.769> dirty<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.969> best<00:00:12.179> thing<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.690> to

really dirty the best thing to do is to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.140 
really dirty the best thing to do is to
clean<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.230> cooler<00:00:13.590> out<00:00:13.740> first<00:00:14.130> prior<00:00:14.820> to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
clean that cooler out first prior to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.470 
clean that cooler out first prior to
doing<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.809> service<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.640> reason<00:00:18.029> being<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
doing a service the reason being is a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.120 
doing a service the reason being is a
lot<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.840> times<00:00:19.050> when<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> service<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
lot of times when you do a service and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.010 
lot of times when you do a service and
you<00:00:20.160> put<00:00:20.369> chemicals<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.970> there<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.720> will<00:00:21.869> go

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
you put chemicals in there it will go

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.779 
you put chemicals in there it will go
through<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> cooler<00:00:22.740> push<00:00:23.369> some<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> those

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
through the cooler push some of those

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.640 
through the cooler push some of those
contaminants<00:00:24.480> down<00:00:24.660> into<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> transmission

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
contaminants down into the transmission

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.920 
contaminants down into the transmission
system<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.279> obviously<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.330> car<00:00:27.539> will<00:00:27.779> be

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
system and obviously the car will be

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.179 
system and obviously the car will be
running<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.439> they're<00:00:28.560> doing<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.160> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
running when they're doing that so you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.800 
running when they're doing that so you
don't<00:00:29.400> want<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.670> those<00:00:30.000> contaminants<00:00:30.570> down

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
don't want that those contaminants down

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.479 
don't want that those contaminants down
in<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> transmission<00:00:31.619> system<00:00:31.859> especially

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
in the transmission system especially

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.670 
in the transmission system especially

ATF<00:00:37.170> flow<00:00:37.500> gets<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> contamination<00:00:39.300> out

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
ATF flow gets all that contamination out

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.090 
ATF flow gets all that contamination out
of<00:00:39.570> there<00:00:39.780> helps<00:00:40.440> prevent<00:00:40.829> transmission

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
of there helps prevent transmission

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.000 
of there helps prevent transmission
failure<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.440> good<00:00:43.620> service

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
failure and so it's just a good service

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.470 
failure and so it's just a good service

screen and you try to force water

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
screen and you try to force water
through<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.869> bug<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.110> get<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> bug<00:01:49.770> out<00:01:49.979> of

through that bug and get the bug out of
the<00:01:50.159> screen<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.640> can't<00:01:50.880> really<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the screen you can't really do it that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.230 
the screen you can't really do it that
way<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.590> force<00:01:52.890> water<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.030> side

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
way but if you force water on this side

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
way but if you force water on this side
of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> screen<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.500> bug<00:01:55.710> bug<00:01:56.159> comes<00:01:56.430> right

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
of the screen the bug bug comes right

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.249 
of the screen the bug bug comes right
off<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.360> sort<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.810> we're<00:01:57.960> doing

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
off so that's sort of what we're doing

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.319 
off so that's sort of what we're doing
with<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.920> type<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.340> product<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.880> again

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
with this type of product and again

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.520 
with this type of product and again
we'll<00:02:00.659> show<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.869> here<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.409> minute

with<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> demonstration<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.610> how<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.880> works

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
with the demonstration on how it works

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.780 
with the demonstration on how it works
easy<00:02:03.719> process<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:05.100> good<00:02:05.280> thing<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.610> use

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
easy process and a good thing to use

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.650 
easy process and a good thing to use
prior<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.920> regular<00:02:07.920> transmission

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
prior to a regular transmission

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.310 
prior to a regular transmission
exchange<00:02:09.640> basically<00:02:10.640> you've<00:02:10.790> got<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.320> locate

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
exchange basically you've got to locate

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.410 
exchange basically you've got to locate
both<00:02:12.590> transmission<00:02:13.430> cooler<00:02:13.760> lines<00:02:13.790> and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.250 

I've<00:02:48.380> got<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.800> attached<00:02:49.450> disconnect<00:02:50.450> bottom

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
I've got that attached disconnect bottom

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.100 
I've got that attached disconnect bottom
line

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:07.660 

ready<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:57.890> administer<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.520> product

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.760 

so<00:03:08.240> basically<00:03:08.630> all<00:03:08.750> I'm<00:03:08.990> doing<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.290> fleshing

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
so basically all I'm doing is fleshing

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.830 
so basically all I'm doing is fleshing
out<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.040> entire<00:03:10.340> cooler<00:03:10.790> as<00:03:11.270> you<00:03:11.480> can<00:03:11.600> see<00:03:11.720> it

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
out the entire cooler as you can see it

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.940 
out the entire cooler as you can see it
comes<00:03:12.050> out<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.350> spurts

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
comes out in spurts

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.660 
comes out in spurts
it<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.370> pressurized<00:03:14.530> anywhere<00:03:15.530> metals<00:03:15.920> any

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
it is pressurized anywhere metals any

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.180 
it is pressurized anywhere metals any
contaminants<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.570> are<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.990> system<00:03:18.200> will

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
contaminants that are in the system will

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.610 
contaminants that are in the system will
be<00:03:19.310> flushed<00:03:20.090> out<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.000> back<00:03:23.300> flush<00:03:23.630> so

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
be flushed out this is a back flush so

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.890 
be flushed out this is a back flush so
it's<00:03:24.800> going<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:24.980> come<00:03:25.190> out<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:26.450> way<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:26.720> went

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
it's going to come out the way it went

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.350 
it's going to come out the way it went
in<00:03:29.050> that's<00:03:30.050> basically<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:31.670> demo<00:03:31.970> there's<00:03:32.210> not

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
in that's basically the demo there's not

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.810 
in that's basically the demo there's not
much<00:03:32.570> -<00:03:32.780> it's<00:03:32.930> very<00:03:33.110> easy<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.560> do<00:03:33.709> once<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.700> get

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
much - it's very easy to do once you get

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.810 
much - it's very easy to do once you get
this<00:03:35.030> completed<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:36.500> would<00:03:36.820> probably

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
this completed you would probably

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.699 
this completed you would probably
connect<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.510> bottom<00:03:38.840> line<00:03:39.050> back<00:03:39.380> together

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
connect the bottom line back together

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.640 
connect the bottom line back together
and<00:03:40.190> then<00:03:40.580> do<00:03:40.760> your<00:03:40.880> transmission<00:03:41.540> flush<00:03:41.990> by

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
and then do your transmission flush by

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.440 
and then do your transmission flush by
hooking<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.220> top<00:03:43.430> cooler<00:03:43.790> line<00:03:43.940> hooking

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
hooking to the top cooler line hooking

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.060 
hooking to the top cooler line hooking
your<00:03:44.630> machine<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.140> top<00:03:45.320> kut'r<00:03:45.680> line<00:03:45.830> and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
your machine to the top kut'r line and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.020 
your machine to the top kut'r line and
do<00:03:46.610> your<00:03:46.760> normal<00:03:46.910> ATF<00:03:47.720> flush
