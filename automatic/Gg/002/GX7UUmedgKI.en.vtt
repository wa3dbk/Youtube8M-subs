00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
leather throughout if we look at this

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.630 
leather throughout if we look at this
compared<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> something<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.220> laguna

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
compared to something like the laguna

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.580

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
built into it this is going to give you
more<00:00:45.390> leather<00:00:45.600> coverage<00:00:46.080> which<00:00:46.470> equates<00:00:46.830> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
more leather coverage which equates to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
more leather coverage which equates to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
more protection we look at it's got a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
more protection we look at it's got a
nice<00:00:48.960> style<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.440> cds<00:00:49.800> an<00:00:50.040> italian<00:00:50.520> boot

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
manufacturer they make nice boots

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.680 
manufacturer they make nice boots
they're<00:00:52.770> rd<00:00:53.070> width<00:00:53.310> or<00:00:53.520> average<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.390> arch

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
they're rd width or average the arch

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.960 
they're rd width or average the arch
support<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.320> medium<00:00:55.830> but<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> removable<00:00:56.670> if

support is medium but it is removable if

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.310 
support is medium but it is removable if
we<00:00:57.240> start<00:00:57.450> to<00:00:57.540> spin<00:00:57.720> it<00:00:57.810> to<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:57.990> back<00:00:58.140> you're

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
we start to spin it to the back you're

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.300 
we start to spin it to the back you're
going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.470> see<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:58.800> reflectivity

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
going to see there's reflectivity

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.490 
going to see there's reflectivity
calling<00:01:00.240> these<00:01:00.330> internally<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.990> space<00:01:01.230> dots

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
calling these internally the space dots

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.140 
calling these internally the space dots
but<00:01:01.920> again<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.310> kind<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.610> cool<00:01:02.790> feature<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
but again it's kind of a cool feature to

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.990 
but again it's kind of a cool feature to
where<00:01:03.450> there<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.199> punctuation<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.610> top<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
where there are punctuation over top of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.149 
where there are punctuation over top of
a<00:01:06.090> layer<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.570> reflectivity<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:07.979> like

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
a layer of reflectivity so it's not like

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.270 
a layer of reflectivity so it's not like
having<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.460> big<00:01:08.670> reflective<00:01:09.570> straight<00:01:09.840> panel

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
having a big reflective straight panel

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
having a big reflective straight panel
notice<00:01:11.280> articulation<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.509> elasticity

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
notice articulation and some elasticity

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530 
notice articulation and some elasticity
here<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> Achilles<00:01:14.430> area<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.180> then

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
here in the Achilles area and then

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
it's kind of this the inside that we

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.980 
it's kind of this the inside that we
always<00:01:44.400> see<00:01:44.729> from<00:01:44.909> gore-tex<00:01:45.330> which<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
always see from gore-tex which is

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.630 
always see from gore-tex which is
wicking<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.560> comfortable<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.430> suck

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
wicking and comfortable and it will suck

sweat<00:01:47.940> away<00:01:48.150> from<00:01:48.330> your<00:01:48.540> skin<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.670> my

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
sweat away from your skin so in my

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
sweat away from your skin so in my
opinion<00:01:51.000> again<00:01:51.750> you're<00:01:51.900> looking<00:01:51.990> at<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.380> mid

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
opinion again you're looking at that mid

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.950 
opinion again you're looking at that mid
$300<00:01:53.250> range<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.760> think<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.450> nice<00:01:54.690> upgrade

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
$300 range I think it's a nice upgrade

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200 
$300 range I think it's a nice upgrade
and<00:01:55.530> what<00:01:55.860> CDs<00:01:56.190> been<00:01:56.369> doing<00:01:56.610> forthe<00:01:56.820> gore-tex

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
and what CDs been doing forthe gore-tex

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.359 
and what CDs been doing forthe gore-tex
boots<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.900> think<00:01:58.260> that<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.770> my<00:01:58.979> opinion

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
boots but I think that in my opinion

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.530 
boots but I think that in my opinion
there's<00:01:59.520> some<00:01:59.640> other<00:01:59.790> boots<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.299> range

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
there's some other boots in this range

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.450 
there's some other boots in this range
like<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> CD<00:02:01.140> armored<00:02:01.500> gore-tex<00:02:01.890> around<00:02:02.310> that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
like the CD armored gore-tex around that

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.880 
like the CD armored gore-tex around that
same<00:02:02.640> $350<00:02:03.540> mark<00:02:03.840> which<00:02:04.170> provide<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> little

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
same $350 mark which provide a little

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.200 
same $350 mark which provide a little
bit<00:02:05.010> more<00:02:05.190> protection<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.880> there<00:02:06.000> are<00:02:06.060> other

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
bit more protection so there are other

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.089 
bit more protection so there are other
boots<00:02:06.659> within<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.290> range<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
boots within this range but if this is

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.320 
boots within this range but if this is
the<00:02:08.129> style<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.179> have

the style that you just have to have

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
the style that you just have to have

this is a good boot and it's going to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.190 
this is a good boot and it's going to
perform<00:02:11.519> very<00:02:12.060> well<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> gore-tex
