00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.460
 Hi there, we eat this TV cocktail 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.769
 director more precisely I am not used to it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.809
 say my name is not vasily and for 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.130
 frame does not help either and grub hi by 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.970
 sweep slim requests 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.590
 First of all, I'm at the bar for some reason. 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.380
 secondly we are cooking today whiskey owl 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.269
 whiskey sower is famous and classic 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.920
 cocktail he is known primarily for those 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.140
 that he invented the so-called 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.000
 a professor named jerry tom was author 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 reference book with the bartender who wrote this 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.280
 book at the end of the 19th century and this cocktail 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.770
 very simple cooking it is enough 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 strong but pleasant beginning we mix everything 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.250
 our ingredients story unfortunately 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.539
 short so I do not have much time 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.620
 he seems to be in a roks glass 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.789
 Rocks as we know him more we take hanging 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.980
 no glass and start mixing start 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.260
 the most important thing is bourbon 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.879
 bourbon, you can even take any 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 and not necessarily what bourbon 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 anything 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320
 blended whiskey that is not one 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.479
 malts like james but onion all 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.409
 bourbon get jigger and poured 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.270
 poltinnichek 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.009
 and send a glass 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.829
 as a bartender never in the same place much 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:26.439
 still dripping dripping 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:28.659
 drive and added hotel drunk im earl 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.819
 called somehow drunk in the mountains further 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.500
 add 15 milliliters of sugar 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.270
 syrup 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.170
 Lemon juice is already measured here. 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.100
 about half a lemon 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.289
 half a lemon and most importantly and points and 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.880
 testicle we need protein from this face 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.740
 and not all protein, despite the fact that 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.500
 he needs so little of that squirrel 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.569
 Dash of egg protein have I let myself 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.520
 comments not dash a splash 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.860
 dash is usually used for 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.110
 some sort of tabasco to need 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.390
 really a couple of drops splash it as if 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.909
 also a couple of drops but here is the egg case 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.700
 it is exactly the splash will they d d c d 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.700
 very little splash a little more than dash 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.289
 but too little protein splash 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.760
 as we are told behind the scenes 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.190
 invisible you and I know how to give protein from 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.400
 yolk so I will do it right away 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.870
 cup all-all literally 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.060
 slightly everything else is sent 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.980
 hungry children and in fact all 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.459
 mix us up now we take the second 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.000
 shaker part pour there 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:34.180
 ice traditionally need to fall asleep 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.930
 three quarters of shaker ice pour over 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.739
 all the contents of our glass is different 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.739
 part of mixing 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.030
 yes so now in short we beat it and 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.220
 here it is and now we take a strainer and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.950
 rebuild everything here is a glass and ice 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.520
 on unnecessary yes it seems to me supplies we 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.370
 poured a glass should throw fishing there 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.940
 without banks to hand, I did not silence all the army 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.370
 so do the cherry put here add 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.140
 a piece of ice that's muffler on the classics should be 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.330
 it was ok yes to shower ice there 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:24.080
 inside and whiskey sour is ready and now 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.610
 Of course, according to our tradition today 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.610
 cocktail tastes Basil 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.960
 Well, ok, Vasily what a widow inappropriately 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.330
 your work is more like well with 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.520
 egg white is not everywhere 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.880
 bother that is rarely in what 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.980
 bars 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.230
 principle can be found from the cocktail yet 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.120
 clothes where u do with protein and quite 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.630
 lazy bartenders who love whiskey 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.140
 sower 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.950
 doing just pouring in there pours in there 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.970
 means 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.930
 some jamison squeeze either 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.459
 and pour a spoonful of sugar and little by little 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.900
 stirred sipped maybe a little 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:11.320
 add splash so say gazirovochka 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.850
 also, in principle, nothing happens but you 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.989

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.989
