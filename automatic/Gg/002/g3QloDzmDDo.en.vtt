throughout the beginning of the match
something<00:00:34.300> I<00:00:34.359> didn't<00:00:34.690> show<00:00:34.839> in<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.050> demo<00:00:35.199> was

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
something I didn't show in the demo was

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.669 
something I didn't show in the demo was
the<00:00:35.890> nice<00:00:36.640> presentation<00:00:37.510> as<00:00:37.659> you<00:00:37.690> can<00:00:37.839> see<00:00:37.989> the

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
the nice presentation as you can see the

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:41.399 
the nice presentation as you can see the
reporters<00:00:39.460> more<00:00:40.179> than<00:00:40.329> stadium<00:00:40.719> is<00:00:40.839> identical

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409 
reporters more than stadium is identical

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.579 
reporters more than stadium is identical
as<00:00:41.559> I<00:00:41.710> live<00:00:41.859> in<00:00:41.979> Miami<00:00:42.249> so<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.550> would<00:00:42.729> know<00:00:43.589> see

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
as I live in Miami so I would know see

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.639 
as I live in Miami so I would know see
it<00:00:44.679> shows<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:44.949> players<00:00:45.929> shows<00:00:46.929> the<00:00:47.109> records

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
it shows the players shows the records

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.319 
it shows the players shows the records
you<00:00:48.100> see<00:00:48.280> there<00:00:48.460> there's<00:00:48.729> a<00:00:48.819> today's

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
you see there there's a today's

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.119 
you see there there's a today's
commentators<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:52.510> these<00:00:53.350> are<00:00:53.559> real<00:00:53.769> stats

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
commentators so see these are real stats

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.809 
commentators so see these are real stats
11<00:00:54.760> 6<00:00:55.059> for<00:00:55.299> Josh<00:00:55.510> Johnson<00:00:55.839> win-loss<00:00:56.789> ER<00:00:57.789> a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
11 6 for Josh Johnson win-loss ER a

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.479 
11 6 for Josh Johnson win-loss ER a
strikeouts<00:00:58.569> all<00:00:58.869> of<00:00:59.019> those<00:00:59.139> are<00:00:59.489> real

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
strikeouts all of those are real

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.189 
strikeouts all of those are real
statistics<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:01.179> I<00:01:01.209> think<00:01:01.780> it's<00:01:01.899> real<00:01:02.049> nice

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
statistics and I think it's real nice

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.130 
statistics and I think it's real nice
that<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:03.219> game<00:01:03.369> loads<00:01:03.609> them<00:01:03.760> in<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:04.840> really

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
that the game loads them in it really

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.620 
that the game loads them in it really
interacts<00:01:06.040> with<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.520> player<00:01:07.030> more<00:01:07.330> when<00:01:07.540> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
interacts with the player more when the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.880 
interacts with the player more when the
game<00:01:07.810> is<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.800> real<00:01:08.980> deal<00:01:10.740> comparing<00:01:11.740> this<00:01:11.830> to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
game is the real deal comparing this to

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.710 
game is the real deal comparing this to
2k<00:01:12.280> 10<00:01:12.550> and<00:01:12.790> it's<00:01:12.940> pretty<00:01:13.150> much<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.510> same

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
2k 10 and it's pretty much the same

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.980 
2k 10 and it's pretty much the same
graphics<00:01:14.290> have<00:01:14.470> improved<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:15.760> course<00:01:16.120> a<00:01:16.390> lot

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
graphics have improved of course a lot

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.500 
graphics have improved of course a lot
of<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.200> effects<00:01:17.920> including<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.700> throwing

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
of the effects including the throwing

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.900 
of the effects including the throwing
has<00:01:20.040> changed<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.190> it's<00:01:21.370> become<00:01:21.640> quite

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
has changed and it's become quite

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.040 
has changed and it's become quite
difficult<00:01:23.010> in<00:01:24.010> this<00:01:24.280> game<00:01:24.490> compared<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.210> 2k

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
difficult in this game compared to 2k

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.700 
difficult in this game compared to 2k
which<00:01:26.350> was<00:01:26.530> relatively<00:01:26.950> easier<00:01:28.560> pitching<00:01:29.560> is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
which was relatively easier pitching is

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.320 
which was relatively easier pitching is
pretty<00:01:30.280> much<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.550> same<00:01:30.760> but<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.210> little

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
pretty much the same but it's a little

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.160 
pretty much the same but it's a little

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
the last season stats and you get your

the last season stats and you get your
pitches<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:38.440> get<00:01:38.560> introductory<00:01:39.160> or<00:01:39.370> not<00:01:39.550> how

pitches you get introductory or not how

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.830

to<00:01:40.450> exactly<00:01:41.320> use<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.740> pitching<00:01:42.100> in<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.330> 2k11<00:01:43.330> I

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
to exactly use the pitching in a 2k11 I

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.810 
to exactly use the pitching in a 2k11 I
want<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.860> talk<00:01:44.980> about<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.250> pitching<00:01:45.490> because

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
want to talk about the pitching because

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.790 
want to talk about the pitching because
I<00:01:46.360> did<00:01:46.659> sales<00:01:46.900> going<00:01:47.020> compared<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.590> show

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
I did sales going compared to the show

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.820 
I did sales going compared to the show
and<00:01:48.070> games<00:01:48.670> like<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.970> show<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:50.380> use<00:01:50.620> the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
and games like the show don't use the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.399 
and games like the show don't use the
analog<00:01:51.159> they<00:01:51.370> use<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.610> same<00:01:52.600> button<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.350> you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
analog they use a same button so you

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.280 
analog they use a same button so you
press<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.400> button<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:55.480> wind<00:01:55.810> up<00:01:56.020> and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
press the button and you wind up and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.570 
press the button and you wind up and
then<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.470> press<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.800> again<00:01:56.860> around<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.400> red

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
then you press it again around the red

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.370 
then you press it again around the red
area<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.240> it'll<00:01:58.479> eventually<00:01:58.810> throw<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
area and it'll eventually throw the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.410 
area and it'll eventually throw the
pitch<00:01:59.530> with<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.860> effect<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.370> I<00:02:00.460> find<00:02:01.270> it

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
pitch with that effect and I find it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.560 
pitch with that effect and I find it
kind<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.950> easy<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.250> not<00:02:03.670> very<00:02:03.909> interactive<00:02:04.150> as

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
kind of easy and not very interactive as

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.270 
kind of easy and not very interactive as
you<00:02:04.900> using<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.320> analog<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:05.860> trying<00:02:06.220> to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
you using the analog and trying to

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.240 
you using the analog and trying to
imitate<00:02:06.580> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
imitate the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.719 
imitate the
motion<00:02:08.210> of<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.259> pitch<00:02:09.470> while<00:02:10.009> you're<00:02:10.280> using

interesting<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.960> really<00:04:48.320> really<00:04:49.190> puts<00:04:49.370> the

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
interesting it really really puts the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.100 
interesting it really really puts the

you're there and I feel that not many

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.300 
you're there and I feel that not many
games<00:04:53.690> have<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.350> opportunity<00:04:54.890> to<00:04:54.980> do<00:04:55.100> that<00:04:55.250> so

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
games have the opportunity to do that so

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.000 
games have the opportunity to do that so
I'm<00:04:55.730> definitely<00:04:56.120> happy<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:57.620> game<00:04:57.830> does

much increase that power and all that so

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.320 
much increase that power and all that so
you<00:05:25.070> can<00:05:25.220> see<00:05:25.370> when<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:25.700> first<00:05:25.880> start<00:05:26.120> off<00:05:26.180> you

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
you can see when you first start off you

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.300 
you can see when you first start off you
have<00:05:26.420> versus<00:05:27.050> right-handed<00:05:27.620> pitcher<00:05:27.860> contact

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
have versus right-handed pitcher contact

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.940 
have versus right-handed pitcher contact
45<00:05:28.670> and<00:05:28.940> cotton<00:05:29.330> power<00:05:29.540> 50<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.080> then<00:05:30.650> improved

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
45 and cotton power 50 and then improved

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.330 
45 and cotton power 50 and then improved
over<00:05:31.220> time<00:05:31.430> so<00:05:32.120> you<00:05:32.440> go<00:05:33.440> and<00:05:33.650> that's<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.100> first

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
over time so you go and that's the first

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.550 
over time so you go and that's the first
pitch<00:05:34.550> I<00:05:34.700> get<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.090> see<00:05:35.240> it's<00:05:35.360> two<00:05:35.570> outs<00:05:35.780> bottom

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
pitch I get you see it's two outs bottom

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.740 
pitch I get you see it's two outs bottom
of<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.800> ninth<00:05:37.070> so<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.700> game<00:05:37.880> is<00:05:38.060> really<00:05:38.390> tight

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
of the ninth so the game is really tight
