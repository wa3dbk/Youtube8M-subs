00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 hi my name is jonas i'm a producer 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.069
 barber entertainment 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.069
 I will tell you about next car game 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.370
 in the fight 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.409
 every day we get a message from 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.800
 our fans and they all talk about 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.930
 one 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.540
 they want us to make another game 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.790
 types flew not a game called fleet of 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.960
 a game that would give such a feeling 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.060
 like flatout 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.430
 This is a unique racing game that 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.890
 combines derby and race with us for these 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.410
 years there were millions of fans of three games 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.450
 which we released and in this game we 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.070
 we want to return to our beginning we 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.530
 thought about the features that 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.750
 are breathtaking in the racing genre on this 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.240
 time we were guided by three games 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.670
 the first is of course the flat call we want 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 back to drive flatout and the other two 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.450
 this is street rod 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.490
 and derby from flatout and we will focus 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.920
 on careless incendiary ride 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.720
 the essence of the shootout but the fact that you never 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.630
 know what happens next 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.759
 turn and street rod 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.580
 we take the idea of building a park of cars 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.729
 your dreams of which then you see on 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.440
 race or derby and you will have everything you need 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.750
 tools to assemble 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.370
 the cars you want and finally in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.590
 derby on the barrel of souls is the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.200
 of destruction and we want to do something 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.090
 similar next car game damage 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.739
 will not only be external but will 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.090
 have a direct impact on 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.400
 gameplay 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.129
 we want to put you seat where you are and 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.680
 should be to do this we 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.230
 we simulate every component we follow 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.390
 the movement of the engine and each 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.310
 bumps the road we want you 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.769
 felt the car as a continuation of themselves 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.420
 and how she behaves in the physical world 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.430
 when you bump into something you 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.170
 realize that you really bumped 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.730
 and this is another reason for which we 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.099
 love these simple cars 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.870
 when you are driving a typewriter like this she 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.060
 makes you want to bump into 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.960
 something and it breeds passion for racing 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.210
 no rules and contact tight fight 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.250
 we were born to create this game 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.470
 this is not the first time we are trying 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.140
 create something like we create 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.120
 racing games for 13 years now and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.840
 our team has already done a few 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.210
 of games 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.200
 flatout flatout 2 and flatout ultimate 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.420
 carnage 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.460
 it's not just a re-creation of the sensation of 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.710
 flatout we are also working on physics 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.900
 a big destructible world and simulation 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.450
 damage all as in the first fleet and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.700
 these are the things we understand this 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.250
 easy for us we know what we can give 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.770
 this gameplay and technology 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.930
 we create this game already for 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.610
 a few years finally real 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.040
 continuation of flatout a and throughout 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.770
 For several years we have been talking to publishers. 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.240
 and we think they did not understand and they want 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.190
 bring it under the common market 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.930
 but we understand that this leads us to 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.600
 away from the good game you 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.530
 deserve the publishers assure us that 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.600
 for such a game 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.180
 such a unique racing game which 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.160
 we want to offer no audience but we 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.830
 communicated with fans and we hear your 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.750
 opinion publishers do not understand this game 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.239
 there is an audience and we know what we need 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.890
 make it our chance to work together and 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.489
 make the game we all want 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.860
 see 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.209
 the game is already fantastic it is already 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.640
 delivers a lot of fun with 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.799
 testing prototype machines and level 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.600
 on which we work we cannot 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.470
 wait to share it with you 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.820
 know together we will make it translated and 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.820
