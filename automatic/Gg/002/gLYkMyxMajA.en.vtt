media and how we think they're portrayed

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.319 
media and how we think they're portrayed
when<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> think<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.579> LG<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.210> algae<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.200> be

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
when I think of LG to be algae to be

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.720 
when I think of LG to be algae to be
LGBT<00:00:36.329> people<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> media<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
LGBT people in the media I think of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
LGBT people in the media I think of
people<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.000> Ellen<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.690> Jane<00:00:40.230> Lynch<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
people like Ellen and Jane Lynch and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
people like Ellen and Jane Lynch and
Neil<00:00:41.309> Patrick<00:00:41.520> Harris<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:43.140> they're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
Neil Patrick Harris and I think they're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
Neil Patrick Harris and I think they're
doing<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.530> great<00:00:43.620> job<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.640> not<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.510> they

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
doing a great job kind of not that they

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
doing a great job kind of not that they
necessarily<00:00:45.629> even<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> represent<00:00:46.890> us

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
necessarily even have to represent us

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220 
necessarily even have to represent us
because<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.180> gay<00:00:48.989> men<00:00:49.020> are

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
because it's not like all gay men are

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.299 
because it's not like all gay men are
liking<00:00:49.530> about<00:00:49.710> Jake<00:00:49.829> Harris<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.250> all
