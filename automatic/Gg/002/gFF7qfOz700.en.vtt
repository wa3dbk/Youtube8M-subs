didn't blow it off but in any event um
yeah<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.460> think<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.030> really<00:04:58.210> really<00:04:58.420> nice

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.370 
yeah I think this is really really nice
so<00:04:59.020> um<00:04:59.410> I<00:04:59.980> think<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.970> RPGSHOW<00:05:01.690> is<00:05:02.080> putting

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
so um I think that RPGSHOW is putting

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.960 
so um I think that RPGSHOW is putting
some<00:05:02.590> nice<00:05:02.740> things<00:05:03.040> out<00:05:03.220> there<00:05:03.430> really<00:05:03.640> trying

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.960 
to make an effort and showing um some
love<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.660> really<00:05:08.620> think<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:09.040> their<00:05:09.430> ears<00:05:09.700> to

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
love I really think that their ears to

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.510 
love I really think that their ears to
the<00:05:10.000> streets<00:05:10.420> in<00:05:10.720> terms<00:05:11.170> of<00:05:11.500> you<00:05:12.490> know

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
especially what I said and what other

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.600 
especially what I said and what other
people<00:05:14.350> are<00:05:14.410> saying<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.830> reference<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.430> bus
