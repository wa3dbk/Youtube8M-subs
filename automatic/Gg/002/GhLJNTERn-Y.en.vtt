then the next strat we're going to do an

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.670 
then the next strat we're going to do an
X<00:03:01.709> on<00:03:01.919> the<00:03:02.069> top<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.579> crisscross<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.780> then

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
X on the top so crisscross this and then

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.750 
X on the top so crisscross this and then
come<00:03:04.859> all<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.159> way<00:03:05.189> around<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.730> other

come all the way around to the other

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.179 
come all the way around to the other
side<00:03:05.969> and<00:03:06.299> once<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.599> get<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:07.049> take<00:03:07.980> this

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
side and once you get there take this

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.369 
side and once you get there take this
twist<00:03:08.639> it<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.000> you're<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.930> get<00:03:10.079> four

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
twist it and you're going to get four

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.770 
twist it and you're going to get four

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
pieces here this right here can just

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.780 
pieces here this right here can just
barely<00:03:12.989> be<00:03:13.260> tapped<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.280> we're<00:03:14.639> going<00:03:14.760> to

barely be tapped and we're going to

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
barely be tapped and we're going to
twist<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.239> off<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.659> it<00:03:15.750> comes<00:03:15.959> off<00:03:16.200> push

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
twist this off and it comes off push
