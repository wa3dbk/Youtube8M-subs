so<00:04:02.180> just<00:04:02.900> get<00:04:03.019> another<00:04:03.230> tree<00:04:03.620> quick<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:05.120> is

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
so just get another tree quick this is

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.910 
so just get another tree quick this is
our<00:04:05.420> wisdom<00:04:05.810> scroll<00:04:06.230> right<00:04:06.440> here<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.769> doesn't

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
our wisdom scroll right here it doesn't

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.559 
our wisdom scroll right here it doesn't
do<00:04:07.159> anything<00:04:07.489> but<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.819> pick<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.120> up<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.390> just

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
do anything but to pick it up you just

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.899 
do anything but to pick it up you just
hit<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.930> couple<00:04:08.959> times<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.650> hatchet<00:04:10.099> or<00:04:10.400> a

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
hit it a couple times the hatchet or a

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.300 
hit it a couple times the hatchet or a
mighty<00:04:11.209> pick<00:04:11.510> whatever<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.769> I<00:04:12.920> find<00:04:13.190> this

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
mighty pick whatever and I find this

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.210 
mighty pick whatever and I find this
probably<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.940> be<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> easiest<00:04:14.510> way<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.780> start

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
probably to be the easiest way to start

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.500 
probably to be the easiest way to start
right<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.370> just<00:04:16.400> broke<00:04:16.699> one<00:04:16.880> first<00:04:17.120> pic<00:04:17.299> eggs

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
right it just broke one first pic eggs

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.580 
right it just broke one first pic eggs
so<00:04:17.810> this<00:04:17.959> once<00:04:18.260> more<00:04:18.560> wood<00:04:18.799> here<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:20.590> yeah

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
so this once more wood here and yeah

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.800 
so this once more wood here and yeah
this<00:04:21.889> is<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.100> really<00:04:22.760> really<00:04:23.030> good<00:04:23.270> strategy

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
this is a really really good strategy

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.060 
this is a really really good strategy
for<00:04:23.840> starting<00:04:24.320> out<00:04:24.440> because<00:04:24.710> it's<00:04:24.889> going<00:04:24.979> to

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
for starting out because it's going to

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.620 
for starting out because it's going to
be<00:04:25.160> day<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.580> night<00:04:25.699> time<00:04:25.910> pretty<00:04:26.210> soon<00:04:26.389> and

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
be day and night time pretty soon and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.719 
be day and night time pretty soon and
this<00:04:27.380> is<00:04:27.560> going<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:27.860> be<00:04:28.010> for<00:04:28.220> sure<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.550> best

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
this is going to be for sure the best

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.409 
this is going to be for sure the best
way<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:28.970> start<00:04:29.720> off<00:04:31.419> ok<00:04:32.419> so<00:04:32.570> it's<00:04:33.380> select<00:04:34.330> am<00:04:35.330> i

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
way to start off ok so it's select am i

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:48.420 
way to start off ok so it's select am i
doing<00:04:35.690> put<00:04:35.870> on<00:04:35.930> my<00:04:36.020> would<00:04:38.080> take<00:04:39.080> planks

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.240 

come<00:04:49.430> on<00:04:49.550> put<00:04:49.730> it<00:04:49.760> down<00:04:50.000> okay<00:04:50.900> okay<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:52.130> is

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
come on put it down okay okay this is

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.800 
come on put it down okay okay this is
just<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.610> little<00:04:52.790> doorway<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.540> want<00:04:53.750> to

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
just a little doorway you want to

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.440 
just a little doorway you want to
probably<00:04:53.990> close<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.530> off<00:04:54.650> at<00:04:54.860> nighttime<00:04:55.450> you

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
probably close it off at nighttime you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.290 
probably close it off at nighttime you
can<00:04:56.690> move<00:04:57.350> these<00:04:57.680> into<00:04:58.040> a<00:04:58.070> corner<00:04:58.550> whatever

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
can move these into a corner whatever

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.300 
can move these into a corner whatever
just<00:04:59.660> picked<00:05:00.260> it<00:05:00.410> up<00:05:00.560> so<00:05:01.250> move<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.670> right<00:05:01.940> there

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.920 

yeah<00:05:07.310> so<00:05:07.610> then<00:05:07.760> that's<00:05:07.970> in<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.210> corner<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:08.600> then

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
yeah so then that's in a corner and then

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.330 
yeah so then that's in a corner and then
yeah<00:05:09.490> nice<00:05:10.490> allows<00:05:10.850> here<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.420> then<00:05:12.160> you<00:05:13.160> just

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
yeah nice allows here and then you just

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.390 
yeah nice allows here and then you just
make<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.240> roof<00:05:14.630> I<00:05:15.080> like<00:05:15.650> to<00:05:15.770> leave<00:05:15.920> one<00:05:16.160> block

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
make a roof I like to leave one block

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.710 
make a roof I like to leave one block
open<00:05:16.640> all<00:05:17.120> right<00:05:17.570> here<00:05:18.070> so<00:05:19.070> then<00:05:19.480> like<00:05:20.480> it

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
open all right here so then like it

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.510 
open all right here so then like it
nothing<00:05:21.170> can<00:05:21.380> really<00:05:21.590> get<00:05:21.860> in<00:05:21.980> here<00:05:22.220> really

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
nothing can really get in here really
