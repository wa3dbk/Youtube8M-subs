00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
 welcome 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.140
 so I say it immediately 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 this is a bit the field of dario moccia 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.310
 in which I can wind more in tip than 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 feet and with great humility and the utmost 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.360
 irony, however, is a subject that is in my mind 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.950
 I particularly care about it 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.840
 talking about I saw that he did not 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.669
 still done first as you will have 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 understood from the title we talk about harry 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.050
 potter and therefore if the most mischievous of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.270
 you will already be roaring by saying 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.860
 ok, they seem to give children a challenge 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.780
 then just for you I'm doing 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.030
 this video so listen and not 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 close this video because harry 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.739
 potter and his whole world is not alone 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 magic wands spells and discounts 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.649
 between good and evil they would compete as 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 It may seem 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.480
 there is much more I would not hesitate to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.520
 to say that in harry potter there is almost more 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.760
 politics than in any novel by 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.229
 george orwell so let's get started right away 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.610
 we all know the small ones ours 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.350
 object here to tell you his 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.780
 history you read book you look at i 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.060
 film but I'm here to tell you a little 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.460
 the background is what's behind and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 that maybe not everyone has noticed then 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.330
 let's start with the most obvious things 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 the first edition of harry potter e in 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.909
 Italy rivo antono 97 but I started 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.049
 we say the law in 2001 2002 then 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.119
 enough in time to get me 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.159
 the experience accompanied by harry 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.049
 growing up with him in the first book a 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.610
 11 years old and I too start more or less 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.320
 angel towards colle tallinn 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.900
 and that's just how jay kay hauling 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.750
 had conceived the work a passage into 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.500
 current through all stages of 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.110
 of adolescence and the growth of a 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.760
 boy and I luckily consider myself 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.500
 very lucky they could do it 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.060
 why 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.830
 I'm not among those who think it is 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.480
 just a thing for children if too 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.160
 you grew up with ricotta from 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.890
 understand century in his children's because 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.620
 from the first book that is expressly for 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.110
 a young audience of eleven like the 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.619
 protagonist seems towards the last that 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.000
 it has a much more adult tone and it is understood 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.410
 everyone understands things that a child 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.179
 who read the first book not 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.860
 would understand if he gets to read the last one 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.870
 about ten days later 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.660
 you have to be together just so you can 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.520
 understand certain things but even if 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.320
 instead at 7 m as harry and read the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.260
 seventh book might suggest 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.270
 some things that I will tell you now is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.550
 the concept is clear from the first book 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.550
 of blood blood pure blood sport 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.080
 these hierarchies of magicians 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.600
 there is also a bit of racism if we want to 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.610
 and here we will arrive later but let's start from 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.680
 blood in the Italian version there is a little 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.320
 of lack of clarity on this point 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.750
 because x files blood and food blog 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.880
 they are united by a single term 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.910
 that is half blood but in English there are two 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.970
 well separated terms the blog outs like 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.670
 for example piton harry are children of a 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.650
 magician and a child while i 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 mode blogs are like joining ad 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.540
 example that they are appropriate 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.209
 of magic having no relative 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.910
 magician and then seen by voldemort as 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.040
 of magic thieves 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.200
 hence the northern derogatory definition 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.600
 blood blood stained with mud 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.940
 in practice and never understood why 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.980
 during reprints have corrected of 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.480
 to be like a black sheep or something 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.000
 kind have left this word 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.280
 half blood that unites two different people 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.180
 aspects of voldemort 's racism but 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.420
 so much so 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.310
 so and let's talk about voldemort the analogies 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.090
 with Nazism ideas of course yes 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.430
 waste and want a pure breed 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.849
 only with a post to lovers 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.409
 purebred whose bloodline is 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.480
 she sang without even a small one 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.239
 smear of children with lots of 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.700
 similar intrinsic contradiction why 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.989
 the same way that hitler 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.659
 descendant of Jews pointed the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.200
 perfection of the Aryan race ie high 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.209
 blond blue eyes and perfectly 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.430
 Germans and obviously non-Jews 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.950
 similarly voldemort son of 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.750
 half blood and so he too in 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.430
 defect towards that race that he 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.769
 himself of sfregiava sought the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.139
 perfection of pure blood but it is not 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.750
 over here because if voldemort is a 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.430
 bearer of racism that therefore that 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.930
 it embodies all the evil that it has 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.669
 inspired any bad or modern 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.250
 we also have a silent side 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.080
 which embodies the ideals of eg 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.479
 winston churchill the same jake ironing 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.419
 has repeatedly confirmed his 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.389
 inspiration to this character for 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.599
 draw from it the philosophy and characteristics 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.740
 of silent no character is random 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.500
 nothing is left to chance and above all 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.080
 if we consider this background 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:47.300
 politicians find themselves really billions of 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.830
 meanings and things even if not there 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.409
 it would need to be said 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.030
 harry potter none of the seven books is 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.270
 a reading for children 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.680
 the first could still be but if 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.259
 we read it in its entirety not 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.630
 almost nothing childish at first remains 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.780
 among all the net division between good and 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.520
 bad that in harry potter there is never 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.460
 as the wolves says, the world is not 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.740
 divided between good people and Death Eaters 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.659
 each character his nuance he 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.789
 itself is not the classic good hard e 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.919
 pure and some bad are not i 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.230
 classic bad guys all in one piece 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.210
 for example, the smooth one at its tentenna 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.490
 and then it will cost you life in the cell a 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.120
 malfoy house or the same lucius that the 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.470
 end abandons any attempt to 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.480
 back up voldemort and flee with the 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.980
 family because I never understood that the most 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.740
 important to save the skin that 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.330
 fight for a wrong ideal but 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.310
 then not just racism because it's not there 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.440
 only politics and in the barrel there is 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.690
 obviously all the teachings that 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.620
 help a guy that is growing up with 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.480
 harry potter just to grow in the way 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.080
 more just and Christian Democrat of the term 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.540
 but in the most healthy way and how it comes 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.510
 taught precisely through the 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.500
 experiences of the characters the battles 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.450
 daily to find courage out 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.730
 friendship and all these values ​​that 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.500
 may seem trivial never spurs in 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.210
 this way we never are 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.010
 with the first experiences in love of 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.600
 same helium as the Hon 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.300
 obviously if harry potter comes 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.740
 criticized on the childish side I am not 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.930
 not even hear me though 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.340
 addressing you and I hope at least 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.860
 think what I'm telling you 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.110
 the only change is that too much 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.730
 at least think about it but instead if you talk 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.220
 of criticism from the religious point of view 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.320
 then I freak out 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.150
 because it is not even possible to think 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.820
 to demonize a book for the 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.010
 teachings that because obviously 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.230
 for the Christian community to think about 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.030
 magic is something out of the world that you 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.830
 sends astray the 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.990
 Christianity, in fact, Jesus mica 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.520
 multiply fish loaves with the 9th mica 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.540
 a wand did it directly with 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.790
 the hands 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.460
 I don't want to dwell so much so I think 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.550
 which will close the most voting things shortly 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:02.810
 disappointing I hope you will think about it and hope 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:05.930
 also that who knows at least one in a thousand between 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.190
 I hope more adults will change one 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.650
 a little 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.420
 this world because a whole world 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.400
 parallel to ours would be nice 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.700
 to know it even when you think it is 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.700
 too late
