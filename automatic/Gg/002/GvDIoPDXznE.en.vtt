lot as far as i'm concerned mostly
because<00:06:05.680> it's<00:06:05.949> so<00:06:06.070> much<00:06:06.220> like<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.580> TV<00:06:06.880> series

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
because it's so much like the TV series

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.360 
because it's so much like the TV series
and<00:06:07.449> i<00:06:07.720> found<00:06:07.930> it<00:06:08.080> as<00:06:08.199> entertaining<00:06:08.650> as<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:09.100> TV

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
and i found it as entertaining as the TV

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.100 
and i found it as entertaining as the TV
series<00:06:09.550> so<00:06:10.090> i<00:06:10.120> would<00:06:10.360> give<00:06:10.510> that<00:06:10.660> one<00:06:10.840> four

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
series so i would give that one four

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.409 
series so i would give that one four
stars<00:06:11.470> the<00:06:12.100> remaining<00:06:12.400> obaze<00:06:12.790> aren't<00:06:13.150> nearly

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
stars the remaining obaze aren't nearly

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.510 
stars the remaining obaze aren't nearly
as<00:06:13.540> much<00:06:13.780> fun<00:06:13.840> but<00:06:14.590> each<00:06:14.710> ova<00:06:15.040> offers

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
as much fun but each ova offers

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.279 
as much fun but each ova offers
something<00:06:15.790> unique<00:06:16.150> so<00:06:16.540> i<00:06:16.570> give<00:06:16.870> them<00:06:16.990> three

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
something unique so i give them three

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.140
