00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
about that the thing about this dish is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.060 
about that the thing about this dish is
it<00:04:15.880> how<00:04:16.450> much<00:04:16.510> me<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.110> water<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.590> put<00:04:17.860> will

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
beginning you're not that water onto to
dampen<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> little<00:04:29.620> bit<00:04:34.170> so<00:04:35.170> I'll<00:04:35.350> just<00:04:35.380> do<00:04:35.710> a

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
dampen it a little bit so I'll just do a

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:44.340 
dampen it a little bit so I'll just do a
little<00:04:35.920> taste<00:04:36.310> see<00:04:36.730> how<00:04:37.120> stir<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:43.570> now<00:04:43.960> we're

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
little taste see how stir so now we're

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.260 
little taste see how stir so now we're
going<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.530> do<00:04:44.710> is<00:04:44.890> grab<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.250> lot<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.790> little<00:04:46.150> bit

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
going to do is grab a lot a little bit

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:53.210 
going to do is grab a lot a little bit
of<00:04:46.420> the<00:04:46.660> edge<00:04:47.110> amiran<00:04:47.590> put<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.640> dash<00:04:49.120> of<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:50.850> and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
of the edge amiran put a dash of it and

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.480 
of the edge amiran put a dash of it and
finally<00:04:54.390> get<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.600> wheat<00:04:55.840> Silva

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.930 

and<00:05:00.090> just<00:05:00.300> stick<00:05:00.479> it<00:05:00.599> in<00:05:00.690> there

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.070 

it's<00:05:05.570> all<00:05:05.690> easier<00:05:06.170> if<00:05:06.320> you<00:05:06.410> could<00:05:06.560> on<00:05:06.910> 111
