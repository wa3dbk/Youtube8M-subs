00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.370
 and thanks for turning on 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.290
 outside peace very slowly and it 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.670
 is also snowing and just said I 'm doing 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.639
 first delicious cocoa and in today 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 video and that's the same way 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.060
 few ingredients or it 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.199
 just as easy as delicious 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.670
 Tastes here are a vanilla pod 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.609
 because we like to remove you from this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.470
 a chocolate bar with 72 percent 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.440
 cocoa component tooth bittersweet cream and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.360
 we have something here on the right 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.250
 mildest circa 300 milliliters in the pot 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.700
 which we heat up slowly 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.649
 At first, the hearth seems to be an ob 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:51.149
 easy snake and now we take care of it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.760
 the first time around the vanilla bean the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.840
 Get small at first cut out the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.829
 on and then we can do the marketing 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.829
 immediately cut out 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:17.600
 wonderful so that you can now in the milk 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.460
 and then we can do that 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.770
 chocolates pieces depending on 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.150
 how chocolate would like to have bought 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.160
 Of course you like more or less 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.920
 But chocolate also reintun variants 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.009
 with eg chocolate taste very 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.050
 excellent for still everything from the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.330
 vanilleschote rauszuholen now the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.619
 Both help with a short time in 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.149
 the milk there is also the last one 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.350
 have always pushed off the stage 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.800
 occasionally stir again and again 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.500
 rather, schmidt sees scholar slowly 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.820
 It 's slow to do so , so how? 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.399
 the milk is not directly up to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.149
 temper 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:07.740
 but then it is already prepared and 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:08.880
 tastes better in retrospect now 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.250
 I will be the vanilla bean ever 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.940
 get out there and give me one 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.940
 shot cream added 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.910
 the whole chocolate is now with 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.340
 the mesumer connected and there already the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.530
 correct temperature then assembled 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.270
 turn off and the chocolate is 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.270
 Actually, we are capable of it now 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.050
 So the hot chocolate phrases we are 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.760
 you can finish that too if necessary 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.730
 or a chocolate sprinkle 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.010
 delicious whipped cream and I thank you 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.350
 even for watching a lot of fun 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.150
 sipping cocoa and in advance 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.150
 Happy holidays and a happy new year
