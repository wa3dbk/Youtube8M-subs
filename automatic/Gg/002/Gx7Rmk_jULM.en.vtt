00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.290
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.160
 video about scientists want 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.050
 bring back to life 24 extinct species 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.210
 let's start with the video recently in the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.430
 city ​​of washington there was a 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.070
 meeting between scientists where 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.680
 He suggested that already extinct species could 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.870
 be recovered as it could be done and 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.360
 what consequences could this have 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.970
 recovery then we tell you 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.820
 what were the conclusions to which 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.250
 this group of scientists arrived 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.699
 dreamers what species could be 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.859
 recover regrettably between these 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.690
 recoverable species through a 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.519
 process that have called for 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.289
 extinction we can not find the 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:01:00.109
 dinosaurs its adn because it's too 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.610
 degraded but still the list is very 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.380
 interesting some of the most 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.640
 significant would be the parakeet of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.909
 California 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.620
 this species became extinct in 1904 between 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.659
 other reasons for the use of their 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.210
 colorful feathers in ladies hats 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.030
 the Cuban macaw victim of the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.090
 deforestation was extinguished before 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:31.020
 1900 the uro extinct in 1627 inhabited 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.600
 europe asia and north africa the whole 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.849
 a species from the island mauritius that was 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.159
 victim of his overconfidence when 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.369
 came the humans who used it as 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.670
 food the imperial woodpecker 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.819
 that has not been seen for more than 50 years 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.950
 it is considered extinct because its entire habitat 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.319
 it has been destroyed 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.569
 the mammoth thanks to the remains that have been 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.569
 found frozen and that 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.789
 They died four thousand years ago the 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.879
 mastodon native of northern america 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.119
 and central america went extinct 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:09.269
 12,000 years called to new zealand 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.090
 this species of the so-called birds 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.549
 elephant was a running species like 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.920
 the ostrich had more than 2 meters of 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.930
 height were extinguished due to the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.720
 excessive hunting done by the Maori 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.780
 around the year 1400 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.120
 the bucardo a kind of mountain goat 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.270
 native of the Pyrenees became extinct 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.260
 recently in the year 2000 and as not 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.570
 also due to excessive hunting the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.460
 saber - toothed tiger died a few 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.590
 10,000 years due to changes 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.930
 climatic conditions that led to the end of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.420
 the last ice age 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.450
 the Tasmanian tiger the only marsupial 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.010
 from the list he lived in australia tasmania 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.290
 and new guinea until 1960 good friends 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.080
 this is all I hope you liked 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 and interested recover some of these 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.240
 extinct species some years ago 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.940
 can in some way restore the damage 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.220
 done to the environment what can that 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.560
 be more counterproductive is to return to the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.140
 life extinct species 10,000 years ago 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.320
 like for example the tiger teeth of 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.480
 saber or the mammoth do not you think you believe 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.880
 that it can be something positive to go back to the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.820
 life extinct species 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.240
 point 1 subscribe to my channel in faith out 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.720
 1 see you in a next video until the 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.720
 next
