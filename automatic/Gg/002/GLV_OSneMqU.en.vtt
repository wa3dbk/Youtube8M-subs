00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.359
 "Legumes are good at heart" 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.296
 I have already talked about how substances present in legumes work 

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:14.364
 against obesity and diabetes. 

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:19.633
 But legumes also protect our cardiovascular system. 

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.558
 Herbal foods can be very important in maintaining health. 

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:25.573
 They can provide us with their healing properties. 

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:28.932
 We can prevent them from illness and / or treat various diseases and disorders directly. 

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:33.204
 They have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, protect our liver, lower cholesterol, 

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:37.269
 reduce blood pressure, reduce aging, act against diabetes, osteoporosis, 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.282
 DNA damage, heart disease and other health disorders. 

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:43.814
 People not consuming daily legumes may have 

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:48.949
 four times the risk of suffering from high blood pressure. 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:57.455
 Legumes such as chickpeas are used to treat high blood pressure and diabetes 

00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:01.664
 for millennia. Here you can see what they can do with cholesterol levels. 

00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:04.797
 Researchers have deployed people a diet so rich in fat that their cholesterol 

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:08.831
 could calmly compete with levels in the western world, about 5.3 mmol / l. 

00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:12.135
 Some of the cereals were exchanged for chickpeas. 

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:17.366
 Within five months, their cholesterol dropped by about 20 percent, to 4.1 mmol / l. 

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.467
 This is almost the target level, which is about 3.8 mmol / l. 

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:24.565
 Reduction by more than 15% for most participants. 

00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:29.323
 Chickpeas have consistently improved cholesterol on long-term administration. So not only 

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:34.035
 but it can be better than many of the cholesterol-lowering drugs. 

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:37.869
 In a randomized crossover study by adding two portions of lens, chickpeas, 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.300
 beans or peas a day to significantly reduce cholesterol, 

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:49.590
 that many of the participants have reached the threshold from which statins are normally prescribed. 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.970
 However, I still want to go back to the study because they have neglected this important thing. 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.800
 Participants started on a low-fat diet. 

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:03.530
 Really very low fat. Their initial cholesterol was about 3.1 mmol / l, so within 

00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:09.440
 margin. Only after the introduction of a diet rich in saturated fat did they 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.640
 that they had cholesterol levels as typical Americans. These levels could then be reduced 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.710
 adding chickpeas to their new and unhealthy diet. 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.800
 However, it would be better if they were eating healthy. 

00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:23.400
 It would be even better if they were enriched with chickpea hummus. 

00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:28.300
 A healthy diet with plenty of legumes.
