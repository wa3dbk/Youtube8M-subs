00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:25.150
 episode 534 how to make an organizer 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.150
 of desks with plastic bottles 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.680
 for this craft project we are going 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.010
 to use empty plastic bottles and 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.530
 washed decorative ribbon elements 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.530
 decorative glue and scissors 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.740
 here as you can see I have my pre bottle 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.110
 washed and we're going to use half of the 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.600
 bottle to make our 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.700
 organized the desk today and we're going 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.350
 to do this with a big bottle but 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.530
 It can also be done with bottles 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.229
 small as you can see here I have folded 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.140
 a little the bottle to facilitate the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.050
 cut the bottle and then cut 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.300
 around this this step should be 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.850
 performed by an adult as a child 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.990
 It can be cut with the bottle and the edge 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.110
 of the bottle as you can see here I'm going to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.240
 remove the wrapper from the bottle and not 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 matter if you have a little bit of the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.550
 wrap since we 're going to cover it with 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.220
 a decorative ribbon 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.100
 all my scissors again and now I'm going 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.130
 to cut the excess as you can see here 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.110
 the top part looks like a vase and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.440
 I left the top part here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.410
 little bit flat so you can put a 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.140
 little bit of glue and then add the 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.720
 decorative ribbon I take my ribbon 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.450
 decorative and I put it on an edge of the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.050
 bottle and then I'll go around the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.900
 bottle until you reach the point where 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.760
 I started putting my tape once when 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.020
 I came here I'm going to cut a bit of the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:11.510
 tape and then I'm going to accommodate the so that 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.840
 so then look good with the bottle 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.220
 You see here the tape was flat as 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.220
 the part where I made the cut is the part 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.230
 of the bottle that was flat now I put 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.129
 a little bit of glue and I put one of the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.549
 little foami flowers that already had a gap 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.620
 and that's all here as you can see I have 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.799
 different bottles of different 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.379
 smaller sizes bigger and 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.040
 inside of each bottle I have tacks 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:46.069
 I have gummies I have the pens and 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.870
 different things that I use daily 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.299
 I hope you liked this 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.519
 craft and make it at home because 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.230
 it's very easy and it's see you in the 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.230
 next video see you later
