in a relatively small containers again

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.660 
in a relatively small containers again
this<00:02:51.889> isn't<00:02:52.099> ideal

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
this isn't ideal

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.309 
this isn't ideal
and<00:02:52.909> this<00:02:53.000> isn't<00:02:53.209> long-term<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:54.049> your

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
and this isn't long-term this is your

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.979 
and this isn't long-term this is your
emergency<00:02:54.799> plan<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.549> corn<00:02:56.180> snake<00:02:56.269> like<00:02:56.569> this<00:02:56.599> or

emergency plan a corn snake like this or

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.440 
emergency plan a corn snake like this or
even<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.319> large<00:02:57.500> Python<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:58.819> you<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.180> kind<00:02:59.389> of

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
even a large Python but you can kind of

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.119 
even a large Python but you can kind of
get<00:02:59.599> them<00:02:59.689> to<00:02:59.750> fit<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.379> container<00:03:00.889> like<00:03:01.069> this

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
get them to fit in a container like this

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.729 
get them to fit in a container like this
and<00:03:01.310> again<00:03:01.669> I<00:03:02.180> am<00:03:02.629> emphasizing<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:03.500> was<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
and again I am emphasizing it was the

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.360 
and again I am emphasizing it was the
short<00:03:04.040> term<00:03:04.340> because<00:03:04.909> it's<00:03:05.239> an<00:03:05.329> emergency<00:03:05.780> you

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
short term because it's an emergency you

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.830 
short term because it's an emergency you
can<00:03:07.370> kind<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.609> set<00:03:07.790> them<00:03:07.849> up<00:03:08.030> they'll<00:03:08.480> survive

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
can kind of set them up they'll survive

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.599 
can kind of set them up they'll survive
so<00:03:09.169> be<00:03:09.349> okay<00:03:09.680> for<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.980> few<00:03:10.040> days<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.549> a

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
so be okay for a few days in a

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.430 
so be okay for a few days in a
