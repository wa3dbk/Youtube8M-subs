00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and apparently I'm going to assume it's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.679 
and apparently I'm going to assume it's
a<00:01:27.990> strongest<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.700> thus<00:01:29.700> far<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> day<00:01:30.329> faced

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
a strongest and thus far the day faced

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
a strongest and thus far the day faced
and<00:01:30.930> they<00:01:31.020> even<00:01:31.140> said<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.710> butts<00:01:32.250> probably

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and they even said that butts probably

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.569 
and they even said that butts probably
strongest<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.600> part<00:01:33.900> 3<00:01:34.310> unless<00:01:35.310> star

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
strongest and in part 3 unless star

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.370 
strongest and in part 3 unless star
platinum<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:36.180> some<00:01:36.390> kind<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.659> evolution<00:01:37.259> or

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
platinum get some kind of evolution or

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
platinum get some kind of evolution or
something<00:01:37.799> or<00:01:37.920> new<00:01:38.100> abilities<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.000> honestly

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
something or new abilities and honestly

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.819 
something or new abilities and honestly
I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> only<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.530> star

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
I think that's the only way star

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920 
I think that's the only way star
platinum<00:01:41.070> will<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.460> able<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> fight<00:01:42.030> deal

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
platinum will be able to fight deal

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.649 
platinum will be able to fight deal
deals<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.799> world<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.939> seems<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
deals of the world it seems like the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
deals of the world it seems like the

world it's you know the stands ability

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
world it's you know the stands ability
is<00:01:47.850> basically<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> manipulate<00:01:48.990> time<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.439> some

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
is basically the manipulate time in some

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
time and whatnot because later on you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.700 
time and whatnot because later on you
see<00:01:56.670> him<00:01:56.909> fucking<00:01:57.299> bully<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.930> senator<00:01:58.380> into

being his chauffer and the guy kept
trying<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> leave<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> every<00:02:01.590> time<00:02:01.799> after<00:02:02.009> he

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
trying to leave it every time after he

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.859 
trying to leave it every time after he
got<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> car<00:02:03.060> he<00:02:03.210> ended<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.659> back

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
got out of the car he ended up back

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.109 
got out of the car he ended up back
where<00:02:04.110> he<00:02:04.140> was<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.979> deal<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.430> seems<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.030> able

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
where he was so deal it seems to be able

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.730 
where he was so deal it seems to be able
to<00:02:06.270> manipulate<00:02:06.450> time<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> sense<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.439> he<00:02:07.560> can

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to manipulate time in a sense a he can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.219 
to manipulate time in a sense a he can
rewind<00:02:08.099> time<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.330> that's<00:02:09.750> probably<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
rewind time and that's probably a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.920 
rewind time and that's probably a
strongest<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> ability<00:02:11.700> no<00:02:12.030> not<00:02:12.270> probably<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
strongest and ability no not probably it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.430 
strongest and ability no not probably it
is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440

know what I mean it it seems like it's

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.450 
know what I mean it it seems like it's
10<00:04:48.030> meters<00:04:48.420> which<00:04:48.630> isn't<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:50.010> long<00:04:50.280> of

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
10 meters which isn't that that long of

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.910 
10 meters which isn't that that long of
a<00:04:50.520> distance<00:04:50.970> but<00:04:51.660> um<00:04:51.900> he<00:04:52.230> also<00:04:52.410> seems<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.830> be

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
a distance but um he also seems to be

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.380 
a distance but um he also seems to be
sort<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.220> like<00:04:53.340> star<00:04:53.640> platinum<00:04:53.910> in<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.180> fact

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
sort of like star platinum in the fact

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.910 
sort of like star platinum in the fact
that<00:04:54.480> he<00:04:54.570> uses<00:04:54.840> his<00:04:55.080> fists<00:04:55.500> like<00:04:55.680> star

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
that he uses his fists like star

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.820 
that he uses his fists like star
platinum<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.700> he<00:04:57.180> seems<00:04:57.450> to<00:04:57.540> be<00:04:57.600> very<00:04:57.690> fast<00:04:58.260> so

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
platinum and he seems to be very fast so

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.770 
platinum and he seems to be very fast so
I<00:04:58.860> ultimately<00:04:59.760> in<00:04:59.970> my<00:05:00.090> opinion<00:05:00.360> gonna<00:05:00.570> come

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
I ultimately in my opinion gonna come

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.190 
I ultimately in my opinion gonna come
down<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:00.990> Jotaro<00:05:01.590> versus<00:05:02.100> do<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.960> Jotaro<00:05:03.960> was

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
down to Jotaro versus do and Jotaro was

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.340 
down to Jotaro versus do and Jotaro was
probably<00:05:04.560> gonna<00:05:04.740> put<00:05:05.100> this<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:06.060> know<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.450> guess

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
probably gonna put this you know I guess

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.050 
probably gonna put this you know I guess
it's<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.560> hundred<00:05:07.770> years<00:05:08.040> or<00:05:08.100> more<00:05:08.370> 100<00:05:08.790> year

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
it's a hundred years or more 100 year

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.990 
it's a hundred years or more 100 year
