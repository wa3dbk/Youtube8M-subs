00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.170
Today on our 2014 Toyota Tundra Double Cab,
we&amp;#39;re going to be doing a test fit of

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.429
the WeatherTech Side Window Air Deflectors.
These are in the dark tint. It&amp;#39;s a 4 piece

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:20.360
so it&amp;#39;s made to fit both front and rear
windows. Part number on that is WT82450. Now,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:43.239
in your package you&amp;#39;ll have product catalog,
installation instructions, we&amp;#39;re going

00:00:43.239 --> 00:01:08.390
to 
have warranty information, and we&amp;#39;ll have

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:53.560
2 front and 2 rear 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:38.970
Air Deflectors. The Air Deflectors 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:04:34.030
are 
made of a 3 millimeter acrylic. They&amp;#39;re

00:04:34.030 --> 00:05:28.299
nice, long lasting, and durable.
