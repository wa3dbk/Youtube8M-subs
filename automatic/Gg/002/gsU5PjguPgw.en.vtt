shoulders<00:01:38.810> especially<00:01:39.050> when<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.590> comes<00:01:39.680> to

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
shoulders especially when it comes to

like<00:01:44.990> being<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.380> good<00:01:45.590> soloist<00:01:46.160> to<00:01:46.580> be<00:01:46.729> able<00:01:46.940> to

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
like being a good soloist to be able to

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.680
