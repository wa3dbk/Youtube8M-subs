 and they're going to see an excel file right here 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.470
 they choose where they want to extract it 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.470
 I'll leave it there 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.570

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.840
 video 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.650
 okay is to leave these two files 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.170
 can read read after download 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.990
 the encrypted bases and waldir write 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.729
 and will take them internet explained the way 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.310
 to download like this so it 's like 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.369
 see them on the internet at the moment 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.590
 good let's continue with ours now 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.770
 let's open this folder called make 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.750
 click 2 let's get into the book day and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.960
 let's open this author's application 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.420
 and rather we choose the language we give 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.380
 next well this seems to me by 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.110
 what I already have version 1.0 1.01 but 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.900
 this one will appear this poster 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.960
 normal 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.180
 they give it in next or normal and another 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.980
 next next and they start 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.380
 install in the best way this does not 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.039
 affects nothing just installs the last 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.189
 game version 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.189
 all that for the escairon folder and 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.079
 well these two files for first that 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.989
 all that before this step has to 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:25.170
 first disable your antivirus and already 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.819
 I have disabled why because this 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.950
 crack detects it with mobiles but 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.109
 quiet the buzzing or that each 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.379
 who want to play the game have to go 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.549
 here and disable your antivirus the 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.389
 which is violating placements 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:42.329
 malware virus bytes that is one of my 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.859
 best antivirus for me I do not know for 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.349
 example the abbot I think they are going to 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.409
 configuration and firewall something like that 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.359
 I remembered very well and he is doing something 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.639
 so you have to appear on the screen 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.340
 home that is of protection against 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.989
 system or something like that and they go off there 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.319
 many and you think you already know how 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.489
 to do that 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.489
 copy in these files 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.050
 and they stick us in the original folder well 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.320
 because I have them in the default 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.490
 notice I put the folder 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.110
 damask game launcher tv i am 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.960
 prepass what I already had the 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.670
 escairÃ³n good now so that he is a 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.910
 full ship we will be where 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.910
 is 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.750
 and then we press the space key 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.660
 that will not come out in this our game already 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.970
 has been cracked now I will leave you the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.200
 video as proof so they see that the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.200
