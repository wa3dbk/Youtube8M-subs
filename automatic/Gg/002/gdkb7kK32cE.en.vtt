make<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.079> on<00:01:23.200> here<00:01:23.380> but<00:01:23.530> then<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.070> wouldn't<00:01:24.219> be

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
make it on here but then it wouldn't be

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.529 
make it on here but then it wouldn't be
hundred<00:01:24.640> eighty<00:01:24.820> pounds<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.360> then<00:01:25.450> it

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
hundred eighty pounds and then it

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.380 
hundred eighty pounds and then it
wouldn't<00:01:25.719> be<00:01:25.840> affordable<00:01:26.289> but<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:26.890> is<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:28.210> on

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
wouldn't be affordable but it is now on

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.840 
wouldn't be affordable but it is now on

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.060 
lands eventually and you should see that
on<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.659> device<00:01:44.020> we'd<00:01:44.289> certainly<00:01:44.500> hope<00:01:44.829> so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
on this device we'd certainly hope so

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.950 
on this device we'd certainly hope so
it's<00:01:45.189> got<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.399> 1<00:01:45.609> gigahertz<00:01:45.909> dual-core<00:01:46.270> s4

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
it's got a 1 gigahertz dual-core s4

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.139 
it's got a 1 gigahertz dual-core s4
processor<00:01:47.170> on<00:01:47.590> board<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:47.920> certainly<00:01:48.340> powered

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
processor on board so certainly powered

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.969 
processor on board so certainly powered
enough<00:01:49.509> there<00:01:50.200> are<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.320> lot<00:01:50.469> of<00:01:50.500> really<00:01:50.799> great

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
enough there are a lot of really great

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.919 
enough there are a lot of really great
elements<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.549> Windows<00:01:51.820> Phone<00:01:52.030> 8<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:52.570> got<00:01:52.719> a<00:01:52.750> lot

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
elements to Windows Phone 8 we got a lot

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.499 
elements to Windows Phone 8 we got a lot
of<00:01:52.960> stick<00:01:53.320> for<00:01:53.590> our<00:01:53.710> s3<00:01:54.460> mini<00:01:54.490> comparison<00:01:55.390> with

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
of stick for our s3 mini comparison with

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.660 
of stick for our s3 mini comparison with
this<00:01:55.630> phone<00:01:55.810> because<00:01:55.929> we<00:01:56.200> said<00:01:56.380> for<00:01:56.500> example

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
this phone because we said for example

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.010 
this phone because we said for example
sharing<00:01:57.670> isn't<00:01:57.820> as<00:01:58.119> straightforward<00:01:58.329> as<00:01:58.869> on

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
sharing isn't as straightforward as on

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.499 
sharing isn't as straightforward as on
Android<00:01:59.499> and<00:01:59.649> it<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.460> we<00:02:00.820> know<00:02:00.939> you<00:02:00.999> say<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.390> is

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
Android and it is we know you say it is

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.359 
Android and it is we know you say it is
but<00:02:01.719> it<00:02:01.810> isn't<00:02:01.960> if<00:02:02.289> we<00:02:02.590> open<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.859> photo<00:02:03.039> for

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
but it isn't if we open a photo for

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.399 
but it isn't if we open a photo for
example<00:02:03.820> go<00:02:03.939> into<00:02:04.179> our<00:02:04.270> camera<00:02:04.630> roll<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:04.990> we

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
example go into our camera roll and we

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.050 
example go into our camera roll and we
want<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.679> share<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:06.039> straight<00:02:06.399> out<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.759> skype

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
want to share this straight out to skype

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.940 
want to share this straight out to skype
for<00:02:07.299> example<00:02:07.810> we<00:02:08.200> can't<00:02:08.470> do<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:08.770> because

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
for example we can't do that because

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.180 
for example we can't do that because
skype<00:02:09.550> isn't<00:02:09.759> on

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
skype isn't on

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.560 
skype isn't on
we<00:02:10.220> have<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.460> open<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.790> application<00:02:11.390> blah

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
continuous autofocus there was a little

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.730 
continuous autofocus there was a little
bit<00:02:58.970> slower<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.360> change<00:02:59.570> exposure<00:02:59.990> but<00:03:00.440> having

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
bit slower to change exposure but having

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.100 
bit slower to change exposure but having
said<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.060> for<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> budget<00:03:02.660> phone<00:03:02.870> it

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
said that for a budget phone it

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.410 
said that for a budget phone it

on to performance and we showed you that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.710 
on to performance and we showed you that
glitch<00:03:13.040> before<00:03:13.550> every<00:03:13.940> now<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.270> then<00:03:14.390> when<00:03:14.540> we

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
glitch before every now and then when we

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.020 
glitch before every now and then when we
come<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.230> swipe<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.770> between<00:03:16.100> menus<00:03:16.580> would

come to swipe in between menus would

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.840 
come to swipe in between menus would
actually<00:03:17.450> lock<00:03:17.750> out<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.980> just<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.610> screen

actually lock out and just the screen

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.850
