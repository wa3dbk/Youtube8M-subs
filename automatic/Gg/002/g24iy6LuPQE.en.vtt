00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
is the straight side so next up you have

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.599 
is the straight side so next up you have

themselves there's a little plastic

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.490 
themselves there's a little plastic
piece<00:03:34.209> in<00:03:34.389> here<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:34.840> use<00:03:35.019> this<00:03:35.199> in<00:03:35.379> order

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
piece in here and you use this in order

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.409 
piece in here and you use this in order
to<00:03:35.709> cover<00:03:36.010> up<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.549> port<00:03:36.879> that<00:03:37.000> you're<00:03:37.239> not

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
to cover up the port that you're not

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.379 
to cover up the port that you're not
using<00:03:37.859> for<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.280> bottom<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:39.970> headphones

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
using for the bottom of the headphones

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.610 
using for the bottom of the headphones
because<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.750> have<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.049> choice<00:03:41.260> where<00:03:41.530> they're

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
because you have a choice where they're

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.050 
because you have a choice where they're
going<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.799> use<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.980> left<00:03:42.190> or<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.400> right<00:03:42.489> port

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
going to use the left or the right port

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.449 
going to use the left or the right port
when<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.629> plug<00:03:43.900> in<00:03:44.139> your<00:03:44.290> actual<00:03:44.739> headphone

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
when you plug in your actual headphone

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.180 
when you plug in your actual headphone
cable<00:03:45.699> so<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.540> plug<00:03:46.810> up<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.620> opposite

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
cable so this is to plug up the opposite

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.189 
cable so this is to plug up the opposite
side<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.790> you're<00:03:48.940> not<00:03:49.090> going<00:03:49.419> to<00:03:49.599> use<00:03:49.870> I

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
side that you're not going to use I

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.319 
side that you're not going to use I
think<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.280> changes<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.669> sound<00:03:51.849> signature

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
think it changes the sound signature

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.869 
think it changes the sound signature
slightly<00:03:52.810> not<00:03:53.470> exactly<00:03:53.799> sure<00:03:53.889> but<00:03:54.400> we'll<00:03:54.760> get

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
slightly not exactly sure but we'll get

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.699 
slightly not exactly sure but we'll get
into<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.120> in<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.449> full<00:03:55.720> written<00:03:56.379> and<00:03:56.620> video
