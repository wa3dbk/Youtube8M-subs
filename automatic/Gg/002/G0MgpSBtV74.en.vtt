00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.919
 the zf practice 2013 looking for the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.960
 king of the compact class golf and co 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.460
 the test bench the grades are distributed 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.360
 and here the result of the independent 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.360
 laser show 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.550
 the ford focus question what is that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.230
 best selling car in the world 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.859
 No, not the car on it now 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.320
 think 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.390
 The golf is only seventh 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.660
 best selling car in the world is the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.480
 ford focus since 1998 in germany 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.640
 many many fans have and wacker in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 the top twenty of the admission statistics 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.570
 stop here at the zf practice test occurs the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 focus with a particularly interesting 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.450
 engine on a three-cylinder already 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.399
 has cleared international prices eco 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.969
 boost that means at ford 1 liter capacity 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.680
 plus turbo is equal to 125 ps to it 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.870
 it is surprising for the compact class 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 many motorcycle and motorcycle assistance systems 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.980
 great sound so the sound is right 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.210
 the performance of the focus on the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.210
 LandstraÃŸe can not keep up 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.409
 the fifth round a bit tough and 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.229
 In six you could still remember one 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.180
 bit more torque have the 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.540
 balanced suspension tuning is one 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.950
 the strengths of ford and the focus 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.240
 Feldmann slowly he is very comfortable 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.490
 Nevertheless , cooking is very fast 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.350
 There is criticism for the focus on the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.790
 static rating the tester 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.920
 fault bad survey 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.500
 operability and quality 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.630
 he gets in very tight though it's a big one 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.429
 vehicle is missing on the phone course 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.530
 the focus is a shot agility and 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.530
 dynamics around with audi bmw and vw 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.320
 to keep up with Opel Honda and Hyundai lets 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.940
 Behind it, the chart is kept in the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.500
 Contrast to other relatively much fabric 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.390
 the ford focus is just hard 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.490
 against the concentrated competition from the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.580
 volkswagen group and the houses bmw 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.679
 and Mercedes as a world car he has to 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.479
 Chinese Africans and Europeans 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.610
 equally liked 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.170
 and that is difficult from time to time 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.959
 and then help him in the end 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.000
 Assistance systems and the super engine 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.660
 nothing so it will certainly be 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.660
 getting better
