save<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> people<00:01:48.750> from<00:01:48.840> getting<00:01:49.140> mad<00:01:49.290> at

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
save a lot of people from getting mad at

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
save a lot of people from getting mad at
you<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:50.310> morels<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:51.000> grow<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> ground

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you now morels they grow in the ground

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.090 
you now morels they grow in the ground
so<00:01:52.049> they're<00:01:52.200> gonna<00:01:52.350> probably<00:01:52.590> need<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.009> be

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
so they're gonna probably need to be

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
in salt water and that just helps draw

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.889
