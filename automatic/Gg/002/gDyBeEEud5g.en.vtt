00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
and we're gonna use 1/3 of it with these

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.840

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
of our warm water is take about a third

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.780 
of our warm water is take about a third
of<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.900> cup<00:01:09.050> we're<00:01:09.470> gonna<00:01:09.590> throw<00:01:09.800> that<00:01:09.890> into<00:01:10.490> our

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
of a cup we're gonna throw that into our

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.420 
of a cup we're gonna throw that into our
yeast<00:01:11.360> just<00:01:12.290> stir<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.560> up<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.800> little<00:01:12.979> bit<00:01:13.159> break

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
yeast just stir it up a little bit break

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.880 
yeast just stir it up a little bit break
up<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.729> bumps<00:01:14.260> this<00:01:15.260> is<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.500> flour<00:01:15.710> we're

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
up the bumps this is the flour we're

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.280 
up the bumps this is the flour we're
gonna<00:01:16.010> be<00:01:16.159> using<00:01:16.280> it's<00:01:16.670> an<00:01:16.790> all-purpose

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
gonna be using it's an all-purpose

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.780 
gonna be using it's an all-purpose
gluten<00:01:18.290> free<00:01:18.470> blend<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:19.400> basically<00:01:19.670> a

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
gluten free blend so it's basically a

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.280 
gluten free blend so it's basically a
bunch<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.240> different<00:01:20.570> flours<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:20.960> starches

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
bunch of different flours and starches

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.980 
bunch of different flours and starches
together<00:01:21.830> it<00:01:22.130> really<00:01:22.549> takes<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:23.180> few<00:01:23.600> different

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
together it really takes a few different

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.590 
together it really takes a few different
types<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.680> flour<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.520> get<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.120> same<00:01:26.270> results

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
types of flour to get the same results

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.750 
types of flour to get the same results
you<00:01:26.690> would<00:01:26.750> get<00:01:26.960> with<00:01:27.190> gluten<00:01:28.190> is<00:01:28.250> baking<00:01:28.610> we

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
you would get with gluten is baking we

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.230 
you would get with gluten is baking we
added<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.570> xanthan<00:01:30.290> gum<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.820> other<00:01:31.970> thing<00:01:32.150> we

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
added the xanthan gum the other thing we

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.530 
added the xanthan gum the other thing we
put<00:01:32.360> in<00:01:32.510> here<00:01:32.780> are<00:01:33.010> powdered<00:01:34.010> eggs<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:35.420> can

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
put in here are powdered eggs you can

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.270 
put in here are powdered eggs you can
tell<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:35.869> yeast<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:36.409> already<00:01:36.830> active

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
tell that that yeast is already active

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.590 
tell that that yeast is already active
from<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.670> bubbles<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.180> are<00:01:40.479> should<00:01:41.479> we

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
from the bubbles that are should we

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.149 
from the bubbles that are should we
start<00:01:41.840> with<00:01:41.990> something<00:01:42.170> first<00:01:42.530> or<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.979> just

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
start with something first or is it just

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.920 
start with something first or is it just
kind<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.400> free-for-all<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.600> kind<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.869> a

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
kind of free-for-all it's kind of a

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.240 
kind of free-for-all it's kind of a

into<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:23.010> device<00:03:23.430> which<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.000> like<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.239> call

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
into this device which I like to call

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.550 
into this device which I like to call
the<00:03:24.750> tower<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.170> power<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:26.040> tower<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.640> power

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.099 

put<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.680> top<00:03:31.859> on<00:03:32.160> there<00:03:32.670> nice<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.030> tight<00:03:33.269> so

cooking<00:03:37.950> we've<00:03:38.549> let<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:39.000> bake<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.690> what

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
cooking we've let this bake and what

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.170 
cooking we've let this bake and what
we're<00:03:40.590> doing<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:40.920> are<00:03:41.070> we<00:03:41.190> checking<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.850> or

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
we're doing that are we checking this or

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
so there's a fair amount of checking

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.509 
so there's a fair amount of checking
involved<00:03:46.200> sometimes<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:47.010> stir<00:03:47.340> them

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
around a little bit to see that like

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.930 
around a little bit to see that like
nothing<00:03:49.049> sticks<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.560> bottom
