 [musics] 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.170
 i everyone is a do it issued spear Well this time in playing the Crucible Rumble match of water 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.150
 I think that want to go 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.250
 Click here to introduce this time 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.090
 the ep 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 Become the infinite theorem 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 During the navy was funny but it is a machine gun 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.830
 Third eye and speed play 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.360
 We have with 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:35.100
 In perfect balance 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.610
 A friend request came from it, but with perfect balance a recoil of the weapon is the limit 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.680
 Decline 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.530
 You have increased stability 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.649
 This is a 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.780
 It is when the spontaneous onset of Osiris 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:51.070
 Gold class 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.290
 It will be dropped in the item box 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:59.980
 It is a lot of Osiris series recently 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:01.640
 I'd like to use Corone Survey this time, but until then I have to fight normally 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.400
 Do not go 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.510
 iter illustration its distance is strong 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.510
 It was not applied or issued 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.700
 Let's ask for a day bench revenge 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.810
 Spear 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 Bach 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.850
 I think there is sometimes 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.670
 Ah 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 Hey hey 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.130

 [musics] 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.310
 OK

 [musics] 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.450
 I was surprised 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.450
 Set aside remaining in the frequently liquor can not take the item 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.789
 Right? 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.789
 [musics] 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.810
 Good 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.380
 Hey or First I snake this take 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.450
 Depending in amazing 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.110
 8 I want to say 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.110
 Mind you 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.099
 Hello

 What 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.130
 Yabe 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.130
 painful 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.250
 Really good 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.820
 I want to take over there 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.820
 State is likely to 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.730
 8 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.730
 It has been stable 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.870
 [musics] 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.940
 OK 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.950
 Seriously De 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.759
 Bone rumble is full of cats 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.870
 Good 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.090
 Yoshi Yoshi 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.040
 It is done 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.440
 Hmm 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.440
 It's pressed without putting missing a beat 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.250
 Yah 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.580
 Good 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.710
 Good 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.750
 [musics] 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.070
 After all umbra Ne 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.390
 Strong this is good 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.390
 From the vendor and Chin 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.520
 Good 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.520
 No but you'll and Well discussions it was one shot 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.390
 [musics] 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.560
 Wish 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.660
 Good 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.660
 notes 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.590
 I wonder if 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.129
 I'm scared, but I don't know what I'm trying to do 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.289
 Yo 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.330
 Yes 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.330
 In the end of the shoulder charge 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:03.670
 Somehow it was first down 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.670
 We were able to win 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:13.930
 It is this infinite theorem introduced this time, but 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:18.540
 I feel that the margin is a little bit less 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.540
 Pretty I both to power rate of fire stability 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:28.670
 It is high Range distance 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:30.820
 It feels like a little creepy, but because there isn't a wide range of recent meditations, this does not 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:36.340
 It feels like it's enough 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:44.010
 In stability when compared to Zolder not a hammer that I have recently used is different about three times or 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:44.010
 Range distance and other fine even though I like Jori's drama about fine half 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:54.349
 It is about ponton very strong 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:55.490
 It was an easy-to-use weapon People who are a little concerned about the magazine Should be better to use another weapon 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.310
 I think but 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:02.440
 Then yeah 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.940
 It was such a weapon that could use ppt completely enough in the current aspect 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.140
 a 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.830
 It was an infinite Theorem that I introduced this time. 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.220
 a 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:15.410
