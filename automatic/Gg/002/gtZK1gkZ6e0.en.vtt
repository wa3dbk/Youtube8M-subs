apparent<00:00:31.340> this<00:00:31.759> was<00:00:31.910> just<00:00:32.090> like<00:00:32.180> close

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
apparent this was just like close

fighting I just loved it Jim bad or
otherwise<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:36.350> first<00:00:36.620> I<00:00:36.770> send<00:00:36.980> out<00:00:37.100> Charlotte

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
otherwise so first I send out Charlotte

otherwise so first I send out Charlotte
my<00:00:38.030> shining<00:00:38.390> Evangeline<00:00:38.990> he<00:00:39.200> sends<00:00:39.440> out<00:00:39.530> its

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
my shining Evangeline he sends out its

my shining Evangeline he sends out its
aegislash<00:00:40.660> initially<00:00:41.660> I'm<00:00:41.780> thinking<00:00:42.230> he's

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
aegislash initially I'm thinking he's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.560 
aegislash initially I'm thinking he's
probably<00:00:42.770> gonna<00:00:42.980> do<00:00:43.190> some<00:00:43.400> setup<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.150> I<00:00:44.420> think

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
probably gonna do some setup so I think

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.150 
probably gonna do some setup so I think
this<00:00:44.900> is<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.050> best<00:00:45.260> time<00:00:45.500> if<00:00:45.680> any<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:46.010> you

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
sticky web get that set up myself and I

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.610 
sticky web get that set up myself and I
was<00:00:49.730> right<00:00:50.000> well<00:00:50.809> then<00:00:51.109> when<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.350> came<00:00:51.530> to

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
was right well then when it came to

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.290 
was right well then when it came to
doing<00:00:51.829> some<00:00:51.949> damage<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.550> tried<00:00:52.789> hidden<00:00:53.090> power

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
doing some damage I tried hidden power

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.750 
doing some damage I tried hidden power
fire<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:53.960> didn't<00:00:54.350> do<00:00:54.440> nearly<00:00:55.010> as<00:00:55.280> much<00:00:55.340> as<00:00:55.579> I

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
fire it didn't do nearly as much as I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.270 
fire it didn't do nearly as much as I
was<00:00:55.850> hoping<00:00:56.000> for<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.829> then<00:00:57.829> he<00:00:57.949> uses

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
was hoping for and then he uses

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.849 
was hoping for and then he uses
automatize<00:00:58.969> which<00:00:59.269> is<00:00:59.440> worried<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.559> it's

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
automatize which is worried and it's

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.299 
automatize which is worried and it's
like<00:01:00.980> okay<00:01:01.550> that's<00:01:02.030> new<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:03.559> was<00:01:03.679> faster

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
like okay that's new and I was faster

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.610 
like okay that's new and I was faster
and<00:01:04.730> now<00:01:05.000> I'm<00:01:05.059> really<00:01:05.480> worrying<00:01:05.960> because<00:01:06.080> he

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
and now I'm really worrying because he

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.260 
and now I'm really worrying because he
could<00:01:06.770> potentially<00:01:07.280> wipe<00:01:07.430> out<00:01:07.610> my<00:01:07.730> whole<00:01:08.000> team

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
could potentially wipe out my whole team

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.750 
could potentially wipe out my whole team
if<00:01:08.450> I'm<00:01:08.570> not<00:01:08.690> careful<00:01:09.310> he<00:01:10.310> does<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:10.670> much

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
if I'm not careful he does so much

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.600 
if I'm not careful he does so much
Charlotte<00:01:11.270> who<00:01:11.390> got<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.110> job<00:01:12.320> done<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:13.490> then

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
Charlotte who got the job done and then

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.490 
Charlotte who got the job done and then
I<00:01:13.730> send<00:01:13.940> out<00:01:14.030> mall<00:01:14.300> while<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:14.870> I<00:01:14.990> gotta<00:01:15.260> say

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
I send out mall while and I gotta say

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.190 
I send out mall while and I gotta say
this<00:01:15.710> once<00:01:15.980> Maggie<00:01:16.190> evolving<00:01:17.050> there's<00:01:18.050> no

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
this once Maggie evolving there's no

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.770 
this once Maggie evolving there's no
delay<00:01:18.500> between<00:01:18.710> video<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:20.090> choosing<00:01:20.659> the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
delay between video but choosing the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.359 
delay between video but choosing the
blue<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.140> send<00:01:21.350> out<00:01:21.439> next<00:01:21.829> was<00:01:21.950> stressful

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
blue to send out next was stressful

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.700 
blue to send out next was stressful
because<00:01:22.640> if<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:22.939> knew<00:01:23.240> if<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.540> wasn't<00:01:23.810> careful<00:01:24.170> my

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
because if I knew if I wasn't careful my

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.580 
because if I knew if I wasn't careful my
whole<00:01:24.860> party<00:01:25.340> was<00:01:25.460> gonna<00:01:25.579> get<00:01:25.729> wiped<00:01:25.909> out<00:01:26.150> and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
whole party was gonna get wiped out and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.649 
whole party was gonna get wiped out and
likely<00:01:27.590> he<00:01:27.770> use<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.890> sword<00:01:28.250> stance<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.299> did

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
likely he use a sword stance and I did

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.690 
likely he use a sword stance and I did
the<00:01:29.750> same<00:01:29.990> thing<00:01:30.020> thinking<00:01:30.920> he's<00:01:31.250> probably

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the same thing thinking he's probably

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.410 
the same thing thinking he's probably
gonna<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.030> prepare<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.810> KO<00:01:33.110> me<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.420> luckily

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
gonna just prepare to KO me and luckily

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.179 
gonna just prepare to KO me and luckily
I<00:01:35.600> was<00:01:35.810> right<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.470> pulled<00:01:36.740> off<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.890> sucker

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
I was right and I pulled off a sucker

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.340 
I was right and I pulled off a sucker
punch<00:01:37.520> he<00:01:37.909> was<00:01:38.030> possibly<00:01:38.509> thinking<00:01:38.600> maybe<00:01:39.229> I

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
punch he was possibly thinking maybe I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.170 
punch he was possibly thinking maybe I

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
got him down thank goodness and then he

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.499 
got him down thank goodness and then he
sends<00:01:45.020> out<00:01:45.140> Lucario<00:01:45.740> which<00:01:46.520> initially<00:01:47.149> might

would have k out if it wasn't for focus
sash<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:58.270> then<00:01:59.270> he<00:01:59.420> switches<00:01:59.750> out<00:02:00.049> now<00:02:00.740> this

is<00:02:01.039> a<00:02:01.070> really<00:02:01.490> smart<00:02:01.789> play<00:02:01.969> on<00:02:02.090> his<00:02:02.299> part<00:02:02.329> but

annoying so I open with Shadow Ball not
sure<00:02:41.620> what<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.160> expect<00:02:42.870> he<00:02:43.870> does<00:02:44.050> Thunderbolt

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
sure what to expect he does Thunderbolt

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.670 
sure what to expect he does Thunderbolt
does<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.580> good<00:02:45.850> chunk<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:46.960> he<00:02:47.050> has<00:02:47.170> left<00:02:47.380> over

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
does a good chunk but he has left over

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.980 
does a good chunk but he has left over
so<00:02:47.800> he's<00:02:47.950> beginning<00:02:48.280> some<00:02:48.550> HP<00:02:48.930> here<00:02:49.930> are

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
so he's beginning some HP here are

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.840 
so he's beginning some HP here are
trying<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.410> sludge<00:02:50.770> bomb<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> hopes<00:02:51.610> of

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
trying to sludge bomb in the hopes of

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.910 
trying to sludge bomb in the hopes of
possibly<00:02:52.540> getting<00:02:52.810> some<00:02:53.170> poison<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.770> him

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
possibly getting some poison on him

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.150 
possibly getting some poison on him
doesn't<00:02:54.760> go<00:02:55.030> off<00:02:55.270> he<00:02:55.750> roosts<00:02:56.350> which<00:02:56.620> was<00:02:56.770> smart

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
doesn't go off he roosts which was smart

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.610 
doesn't go off he roosts which was smart
of<00:02:57.280> him<00:02:57.460> i<00:02:57.610> guess<00:02:57.900> that's<00:02:58.900> pushing<00:02:59.320> for<00:02:59.500> what

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
of him i guess that's pushing for what

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.230 
of him i guess that's pushing for what
happens<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.040> long<00:03:00.280> run<00:03:00.310> he's<00:03:00.940> trying<00:03:01.150> to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
happens in the long run he's trying to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.920 
happens in the long run he's trying to
keep<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:01.450> guy<00:03:01.630> alive<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.520> any<00:03:03.520> switches

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
keep this guy alive and any switches

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.060 
keep this guy alive and any switches
thinking<00:03:04.930> i<00:03:05.020> might<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.410> done<00:03:05.530> sludge<00:03:05.890> bomb

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
thinking i might have done sludge bomb

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.210 
thinking i might have done sludge bomb
again<00:03:06.430> i<00:03:06.580> predicted<00:03:07.210> this<00:03:07.450> I<00:03:07.870> go<00:03:08.740> for<00:03:08.980> Shadow

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
again i predicted this I go for Shadow

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.880 
again i predicted this I go for Shadow
Ball<00:03:09.490> because<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.480> knew<00:03:10.840> he<00:03:11.200> was<00:03:11.260> going<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.500> try

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
Ball because I knew he was going to try

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.650 
Ball because I knew he was going to try
to<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.340> as<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.580> free<00:03:12.910> switch<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:13.390> sand

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
to do that as a free switch in sand

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.360 
to do that as a free switch in sand
sludge<00:03:14.050> bomb<00:03:14.320> would<00:03:14.530> do<00:03:14.680> nothing<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
sludge bomb would do nothing on the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.030 
sludge bomb would do nothing on the
choreo<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.600> shadow<00:03:16.810> ball<00:03:16.930> hits<00:03:17.260> Lucario's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
choreo so the shadow ball hits Lucario's

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.280 
choreo so the shadow ball hits Lucario's
down<00:03:18.280> that's<00:03:18.850> great<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:20.440> venema<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.930> I

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
down that's great and then venema this I

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.220 
down that's great and then venema this I
tried<00:03:23.950> my<00:03:24.130> best<00:03:24.160> with<00:03:24.370> Shadow<00:03:24.700> Ball<00:03:25.080> not<00:03:26.080> even

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
tried my best with Shadow Ball not even

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.820 
tried my best with Shadow Ball not even
close<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:27.070> then<00:03:27.190> my<00:03:27.910> Ganga<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.360> done<00:03:28.960> sleep

useless though it does open the window

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.810 
useless though it does open the window
for<00:03:35.260> further<00:03:35.650> possibilities<00:03:36.430> because<00:03:36.670> I

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
for further possibilities because I

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.050 
for further possibilities because I
