00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.500
G'day everyone, "Professor Shoelace" here,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
with another shoe lacing tutorial.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.800
And this one is about

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.200
"Over Under Lacing".

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.500
In fact the same method

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
that appears here on my tee-shirt!

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.500
Now on a real shoe,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
you can see the "over" crossovers

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.200
and the "under" crossovers

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.000
that give this lacing its name.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Here it is on the web site,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.300
... which, if I animate,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.800
you'll see why it gets the name

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.500
because you've got

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.000
an "over" ... "under" ...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"over" ... "under" ...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
"over" and "under" crossovers.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, let's see how that's laced

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
using a real shoe.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200
This shoe has six pairs of eyelets,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.500
which is an even number of eyelet pairs,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.300
so I've started across the outside

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.500
and I've fed in through

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.700
the bottom eyelet pairs.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.700
If you have a shoe with

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.000
seven pairs of eyelets,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.300
or any odd number,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.000
you would instead start across the inside

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and feed OUT through

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the bottom eyelet pairs.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.500
Now, having started correctly,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.800
create your first crossover,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500
and this is an "under" crossover,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.000
so we feed out through the next eyelet pair.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Cross over again,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
this time it's on the outside,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.000
so we feed *IN* through the next eyelet pair.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Cross over again on the inside,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.500
feed out through the next eyelet pair.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And you just keep following that method.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.000
Cross over on the outside and feed in again.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.000
Now "Over Under Lacing" is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
a very simple variation of

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.500
the most basic "Criss Cross Lacing",

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.700
which follows the same

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.000
sort of diagonal path,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
with the exception that the laces don't

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.500
run over the edges of the shoe

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
and thus it reduces a bit of friction.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And the second thing

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
I like about this is that

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.700
it's very easy to get your fingers

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.200
under these ... crossovers.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
See the ones that are on the outside?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.500
So it's easier to pull the lacing tight.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When you're finished, tie it off

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.500
with your ... shoelace knot.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.500
I'm using the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.000
world's fastest shoelace knot there.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.200
And that's it - "Over Under Lacing".

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.200
Hope you enjoyed it!

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.000
