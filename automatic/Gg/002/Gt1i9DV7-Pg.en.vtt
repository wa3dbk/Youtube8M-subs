and they roll this dice and depending on
what<00:01:25.229> happens<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.420> instance<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
what happens so for instance this one is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
what happens so for instance this one is
you<00:01:28.920> take<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.970> these<00:01:30.090> eggs<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.539> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you take a one of these eggs and you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.450 
you take a one of these eggs and you
will<00:01:30.869> bounce<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.440> off<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.890> table

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
will bounce it off the table

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
will bounce it off the table
so<00:01:33.210> you'd<00:01:33.360> hold<00:01:33.539> it<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.380> as

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so you'd hold it up about here and as

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.930 
so you'd hold it up about here and as
you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.649> imagine<00:01:34.740> their<00:01:35.190> eggs<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.759> they're

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
you can imagine their eggs but they're

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.210 
you can imagine their eggs but they're
rubberized<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.720> boom<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.830> bounce<00:01:38.039> off

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
rubberized so boom you see it bounce off

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
rubberized so boom you see it bounce off
the<00:01:38.340> table<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:38.759> once<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> bounces<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.899> hits

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the table there once it bounces and hits

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.680 
the table there once it bounces and hits
the<00:01:40.740> first<00:01:40.950> person<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.460> grab<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.909> gets<00:01:42.300> to<00:01:42.509> keep

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
the first person to grab it gets to keep

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.870 
the first person to grab it gets to keep
the<00:01:42.869> egg<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.649> once<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> keep<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> egg<00:01:44.460> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the egg now once you keep the egg you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.760 
the egg now once you keep the egg you
get<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.149> roll<00:01:45.330> this<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.960> figure<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.259> where<00:01:46.619> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
get to roll this and figure out where it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.700 
get to roll this and figure out where it
goes<00:01:47.060> well<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.569> go<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.140> between

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
goes well this would go in between

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
goes well this would go in between
you're<00:01:50.250> basically<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> inside<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> your

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
elbow this would be between your neck

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.490 
elbow this would be between your neck

it's bigger it's hard to hold it's more

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.559 
it's bigger it's hard to hold it's more
slippery<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:08.579> it's<00:03:08.670> worth<00:03:08.819> two<00:03:09.120> points<00:03:09.480> at

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569

actually<00:07:14.400> I<00:07:15.030> get<00:07:15.390> the<00:07:15.660> only<00:07:15.870> downsize<00:07:16.380> it<00:07:16.560> only

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
actually I get the only downsize it only

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.420 
actually I get the only downsize it only
plays<00:07:16.800> to<00:07:17.010> four<00:07:17.220> players<00:07:17.990> but<00:07:18.990> you<00:07:19.950> know<00:07:20.070> we've

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
plays to four players but you know we've

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.950 
plays to four players but you know we've
actually<00:07:20.580> played<00:07:20.820> it<00:07:21.030> with<00:07:21.120> more<00:07:21.330> so<00:07:21.540> I<00:07:21.570> think

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
actually played it with more so I think

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.480 
actually played it with more so I think
he<00:07:22.020> could<00:07:22.170> probably<00:07:22.260> break<00:07:22.680> those<00:07:22.890> rules<00:07:23.010> and

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490 
he could probably break those rules and

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.950 
he could probably break those rules and
again<00:07:23.760> we<00:07:23.850> use<00:07:23.970> the<00:07:24.000> house<00:07:24.240> rule<00:07:24.510> a<00:07:24.540> lot<00:07:24.840> of

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
again we use the house rule a lot of

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.120 
again we use the house rule a lot of
times<00:07:25.110> where<00:07:25.290> it's<00:07:25.410> not<00:07:25.560> when<00:07:25.650> the<00:07:25.740> first<00:07:25.950> egg

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130 
times where it's not when the first egg

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.200 
times where it's not when the first egg
falls<00:07:26.370> it's<00:07:26.520> when<00:07:26.610> all<00:07:26.640> the<00:07:26.760> eggs<00:07:26.970> are<00:07:27.060> gone

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
falls it's when all the eggs are gone

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.580 
falls it's when all the eggs are gone
because<00:07:27.780> that<00:07:27.900> just<00:07:27.990> keeps<00:07:28.230> it<00:07:28.320> going<00:07:28.470> a

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590 
because that just keeps it going a

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.050 
because that just keeps it going a
little<00:07:28.770> bit<00:07:28.890> longer<00:07:29.070> but<00:07:29.610> that<00:07:29.790> seems<00:07:29.940> to<00:07:29.970> be

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
little bit longer but that seems to be

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.670 
little bit longer but that seems to be
about<00:07:30.210> the<00:07:30.360> right<00:07:30.450> sign<00:07:30.690> but<00:07:30.930> if<00:07:31.560> you're

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
about the right sign but if you're

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.470 
about the right sign but if you're
looking<00:07:31.860> for<00:07:32.010> is<00:07:32.100> any<00:07:32.340> different<00:07:32.970> very<00:07:33.390> unique

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480 
looking for is any different very unique

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.300 
looking for is any different very unique
game<00:07:34.230> that<00:07:34.380> probably<00:07:34.530> nobody's<00:07:34.980> ever<00:07:35.130> played

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.310
