products in the marketplace more dynamic
more<00:00:47.230> exciting<00:00:47.800> we<00:00:48.310> focused<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.420> lot<00:00:49.780> on<00:00:50.040> the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
more exciting we focused a lot on the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.670 
more exciting we focused a lot on the
aerodynamic<00:00:51.970> aspect<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.840> because<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:53.440> does

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
aerodynamic aspect of it because it does

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.060 
aerodynamic aspect of it because it does
equate<00:00:54.310> to<00:00:54.550> fuel<00:00:55.270> efficiency<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.620> I<00:00:56.829> think

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
equate to fuel efficiency and I think

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.549 
equate to fuel efficiency and I think
this<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.520> beauty<00:00:57.910> about<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:59.140> we've<00:00:59.320> done

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
this is the beauty about what we've done

I'm<00:01:12.189> sure<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.880> this<00:01:13.090> design<00:01:13.600> it's<00:01:14.259> going<00:01:14.560> to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
I'm sure that this design it's going to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.139 
I'm sure that this design it's going to
hit<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.920> market<00:01:15.159> it's<00:01:15.759> going<00:01:15.939> to<00:01:16.030> be

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
hit the market it's going to be

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.580 
hit the market it's going to be
something<00:01:16.450> completely<00:01:16.749> different<00:01:17.350> than

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
something completely different than

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
think that the brand's aquasport the

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:25.080 
think that the brand's aquasport the
nameplate<00:01:22.659> after<00:01:23.139> sports<00:01:23.469> so<00:01:23.950> strong<00:01:24.369> that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
nameplate after sports so strong that

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.779 
nameplate after sports so strong that
it's<00:01:25.270> gonna<00:01:25.539> it's<00:01:25.840> going<00:01:26.139> to<00:01:26.229> help<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.619> lot<00:01:26.789> to
