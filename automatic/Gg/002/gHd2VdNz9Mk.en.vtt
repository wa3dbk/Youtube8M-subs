00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.490
 and has a project called immersed that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.610
 managed the launch of the chip which 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.830
 is and they were talking about your 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.610
 big competitor rift glasses because 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.670
 they 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.920
 the intention was to bring this feeling of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.039
 virtual reality docs rift without needing 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 of the glasses and the headset car but not 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.430
 they knew the image 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.189
 take a look at this here to be seen 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.439
 here somewhere a screen and the image 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.820
 projections around the screen 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.559
 Dude, remember the ilume room. 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 two years ago from microsoft said that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.040
 would come with xbox the year number 1 that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 it would be that technology that you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.480
 project an extension of the screen in your 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.629
 room with the projector back there I do not know 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.129
 this has not happened to microsoft already 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.309
 even made a story about it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.550
 number on our site had no point 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.250
 shows that there is more technology 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.890
 it would not be feasible to put the xbox alone 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.960
 because I would greatly increase the value of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 video game is now so it is 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.939
 presenting this is practically a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.220
 copy number fails only the projector that goes 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.130
 place several elements around the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.810
 screen and have already funding 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.020
 collective of 100,000 US dollars that were 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.450
 specifying each of these 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.450
 prototypes each of these parts goes 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
 cost a thousand dollars is more or less 2,800 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 and can be ordered inclusive of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.450
 Brazil gives them delivery in brazil then 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.150
 have obtained this funding then 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.180
 who to pay a thousand dollars will have access to 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.409
 this now thinks these custom dollars 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.229
 for each person 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.659
 we put this in the price of xbox 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.270
 or not to be totally unfeasible was 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.060
 exactly why it did not appear in the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 xbox onu more expensive 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.590
 They're talking like the idea. 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.909
 I do not know if they're the first to speak 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.409
 that their competitor is what the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.990
 Green have nothing to do with cosworth 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.759
 and appear with this same idea of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.759
 strange number
