00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the two testers of the cymbals this is

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.440 
the two testers of the cymbals this is
the<00:01:53.119> final<00:01:53.689> quality<00:01:54.110> control<00:01:55.119> before<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:56.149> play

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
the final quality control before I play

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.990 
the final quality control before I play
this<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.929> just<00:01:57.049> got<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.439> tell<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:58.009> every

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
this I just got to tell you that every

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.639 
this I just got to tell you that every
stage<00:01:59.299> of<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.600> cymbal<00:01:59.929> manufacturing

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
stage of the cymbal manufacturing

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.830 
stage of the cymbal manufacturing
process<00:02:01.069> we've<00:02:01.250> been<00:02:01.280> through<00:02:01.670> today<00:02:01.840> we've

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
process we've been through today we've

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.300 
process we've been through today we've
seen<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.470> quality<00:02:03.619> control<00:02:04.189> ie<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:06.310> to

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
seen the quality control ie to this to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.219 
seen the quality control ie to this to
this<00:02:07.429> master<00:02:07.729> cymbal<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:08.450> was<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.780> master

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
this master cymbal this was the master

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.070 
this master cymbal this was the master
cymbal<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:09.830> was<00:02:10.039> designed<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:11.080> prototyped

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
cymbal that was designed and prototyped

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.930 
cymbal that was designed and prototyped
and<00:02:12.380> then<00:02:12.709> beside<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.459> was<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> master

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
and then beside this was the master

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.570 
and then beside this was the master
cymbal<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.510> every<00:02:15.099> specification<00:02:16.099> from

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
cymbal that every specification from

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.309 
cymbal that every specification from
every<00:02:17.239> other<00:02:17.360> cymbal<00:02:17.780> had<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:17.989> be<00:02:18.080> made<00:02:18.290> to

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
every other cymbal had to be made to

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.059 
every other cymbal had to be made to
hence<00:02:19.840> they're<00:02:20.840> all<00:02:21.049> very<00:02:21.260> similar<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.920> is

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
hence they're all very similar that is

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.800 
hence they're all very similar that is
because<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.640> quality<00:02:22.790> control<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.540> has

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
because of the quality control that has

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.289 
because of the quality control that has
been<00:02:24.019> through<00:02:24.230> every<00:02:24.620> stage<00:02:24.980> we've<00:02:25.819> seen<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
been through every stage we've seen the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.660 
been through every stage we've seen the
fine-tuning<00:02:27.110> we've<00:02:27.349> seen<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.830> turning<00:02:28.099> we've

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
fine-tuning we've seen the turning we've

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.180 
fine-tuning we've seen the turning we've
seen<00:02:29.290> everything<00:02:30.290> else<00:02:30.470> has<00:02:30.620> gone<00:02:30.799> into<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.160> a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
seen everything else has gone into it a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.949 
seen everything else has gone into it a
couple<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.549> moment<00:02:31.910> couple<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.450> errors<00:02:32.630> we've

couple of moment couple of errors we've

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.839 
couple of moment couple of errors we've
missed<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:33.799> anyway<00:02:34.099> let's<00:02:34.310> hear<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:34.640> baby
