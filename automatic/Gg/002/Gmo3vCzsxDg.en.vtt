bit earlier for my European viewers but

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.310 
bit earlier for my European viewers but
I<00:03:41.370> can't<00:03:41.760> promise<00:03:42.090> anything<00:03:42.510> because<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.260> do

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
I can't promise anything because I do

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.100 
I can't promise anything because I do
new<00:03:43.680> my<00:03:43.830> beauty<00:03:44.160> sleep<00:03:44.190> I'm<00:03:44.880> not<00:03:45.540> getting<00:03:45.989> any

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
new my beauty sleep I'm not getting any

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.990 
new my beauty sleep I'm not getting any
prettier<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:48.620> yes<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.890> lot<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.310> stuff<00:03:50.610> happening

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
prettier so yes a lot of stuff happening

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.830 
prettier so yes a lot of stuff happening
and<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:52.620> went<00:03:52.980> on<00:03:53.130> for<00:03:53.459> longer<00:03:54.450> than<00:03:54.600> it

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
and this went on for longer than it

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.600 
and this went on for longer than it
should<00:03:54.870> have<00:03:55.080> me<00:03:55.440> me<00:03:55.860> sitting<00:03:56.070> here<00:03:56.220> talking
