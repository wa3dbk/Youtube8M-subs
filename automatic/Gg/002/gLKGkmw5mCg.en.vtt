00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
this little plot that goes obviously

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.570 
this little plot that goes obviously
making<00:02:15.810> stuff<00:02:16.170> up<00:02:16.380> totally<00:02:16.830> totally<00:02:17.070> my<00:02:17.459> other

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
making stuff up totally totally my other

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.500 
making stuff up totally totally my other
thing<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.760> noticed<00:02:17.880> when<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.150> was<00:02:18.239> playing<00:02:18.390> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
thing I noticed when I was playing the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.970 
thing I noticed when I was playing the
game<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.410> transition<00:02:19.800> from

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
game is that you can transition from

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.500 
game is that you can transition from
submissions<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.880> what<00:02:21.030> what<00:02:21.180> did<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.360> call

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
submissions of what what did you call

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.699 
submissions of what what did you call
that<00:02:21.570> well<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.080> call<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.260> submission

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
that well so we call that submission

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.530 
that well so we call that submission
switching<00:02:23.340> say<00:02:23.580> you're<00:02:23.730> going<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> Kimora

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
switching say you're going for a Kimora

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.060 
switching say you're going for a Kimora
for<00:02:24.720> example<00:02:25.170> performing<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.770> submission

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
for example performing a submission

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.190 
for example performing a submission
switch<00:02:26.489> will<00:02:27.120> allow<00:02:27.360> them<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.630> say<00:02:27.870> switch

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
switch will allow them to say switch

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.410 
switch will allow them to say switch
from<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.470> Kimora<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.100> then<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.850> for<00:02:30.060> an<00:02:30.150> armbar

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
from the Kimora to then go for an armbar

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.790 
from the Kimora to then go for an armbar
