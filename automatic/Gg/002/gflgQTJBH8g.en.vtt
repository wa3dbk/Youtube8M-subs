00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
hand so all these yellow portions that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.619 
hand so all these yellow portions that
you<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:00.989> right<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.829> actually

ventilated<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.040> flexible<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.880> more<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
ventilated and flexible so it's more of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
ventilated and flexible so it's more of
like<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> mesh<00:01:06.689> portion<00:01:07.680> something<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
like a mesh portion something that you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.630 
like a mesh portion something that you
would<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.939> find<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.900> a20<00:01:10.310> 4.0<00:01:11.310> s<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
would kind of find on the a20 4.0 s and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
would kind of find on the a20 4.0 s and
then<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> black<00:01:12.390> portions<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:13.049> actually<00:01:13.439> TPU

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
then the black portions are actually TPU

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.249 
then the black portions are actually TPU
that<00:01:14.790> gives<00:01:15.000> some<00:01:15.180> strength<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.659> rigidity<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that gives some strength and rigidity to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
that gives some strength and rigidity to
the<00:01:16.380> glove<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.939> portion

the glove now in this portion

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
even though online it tells you that the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.399 
even though online it tells you that the
back<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:21.000> rough<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> don't

back is like rough you know I don't

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.810

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
think this is like or I think they'll

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.460 
think this is like or I think they'll
hold<00:01:24.030> back<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> hand<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.750> TPU<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.200> that's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
hold back a hand is TPU and that's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.960 
hold back a hand is TPU and that's
really<00:01:25.710> gonna<00:01:25.830> affect<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.250> ventilation<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
really gonna affect the ventilation I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.640 
really gonna affect the ventilation I
think<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> same<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.350> rest<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
think that's the same as the rest of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.460 
think that's the same as the rest of

a<00:03:53.190> little<00:03:53.310> bit<00:03:53.489> about<00:03:53.609> grip<00:03:53.910> before<00:03:54.060> how<00:03:54.780> these

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
a little bit about grip before how these

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.080 
a little bit about grip before how these
had<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.380> 3d<00:03:55.769> gripped<00:03:56.100> tag<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.609> that<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
had the 3d gripped tag and that the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.020 
had the 3d gripped tag and that the
other<00:03:57.239> gloves<00:03:57.540> these<00:03:57.870> ones<00:03:58.430> don't<00:03:59.430> have<00:03:59.579> 3d

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
other gloves these ones don't have 3d

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.059 
other gloves these ones don't have 3d
regards<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.260> grip<00:04:01.440> is<00:04:01.560> great<00:04:01.859> I

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
regards to that the grip is great I

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.559 
regards to that the grip is great I
think<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:02.970> greatest<00:04:03.209> script<00:04:03.480> that

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
think this is the greatest script that

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.390 
think this is the greatest script that
Dee's<00:04:03.810> has<00:04:03.989> had<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.680> these<00:04:04.889> got<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.190> same

a little<00:04:25.490> bit<00:04:25.580> better<00:04:25.760> for<00:04:25.970> me<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.360> terms<00:04:26.540> of

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
a little bit better for me in terms of

however the back is a little bit thicker
than<00:04:31.910> added<00:04:32.510> zeros<00:04:32.840> which<00:04:33.800> kind<00:04:34.070> of<00:04:34.160> hinders

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.280 
than added zeros which kind of hinders
some<00:04:34.729> of<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.240> when<00:04:35.810> you're<00:04:35.900> even<00:04:36.169> all

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
some of that so when you're even all

that out I still get an 8 out of 10
football<00:04:38.240> field<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.690> remember<00:04:39.500> these<00:04:39.620> two

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
football field I remember these two

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.560 
football field I remember these two
gloves<00:04:40.100> are<00:04:40.430> different<00:04:40.970> so<00:04:41.300> that's<00:04:41.449> gonna

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
gloves are different so that's gonna

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.939 
gloves are different so that's gonna
make<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.930> ventilation<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.620> little<00:04:42.830> bit

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
make the ventilation a little bit

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.830 
make the ventilation a little bit
different<00:04:43.340> here<00:04:43.490> like<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> said<00:04:44.449> before<00:04:44.540> you

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
different here like I said before you

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.659 
different here like I said before you
have<00:04:44.870> this<00:04:45.320> like<00:04:45.830> where<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:46.130> have<00:04:46.280> this<00:04:46.400> mesh

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
have this like where you have this mesh

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.550 
have this like where you have this mesh
that's<00:04:46.850> really<00:04:47.180> breathable<00:04:47.540> allows<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.470> to

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
that's really breathable allows you to

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.500 
that's really breathable allows you to
flex<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.100> stretch<00:04:49.160> your<00:04:49.430> hand<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:49.880> on<00:04:50.300> this

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
flex and stretch your hand and on this

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.390 
flex and stretch your hand and on this
free<00:04:50.810> glug<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.560> don't<00:04:51.770> have<00:04:51.979> it<00:04:52.100> at<00:04:52.160> all<00:04:52.250> it

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
free glug you don't have it at all it

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.120 
free glug you don't have it at all it
seems<00:04:52.430> like<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.880> whole<00:04:53.000> back<00:04:53.210> hand<00:04:53.570> is<00:04:53.780> TPU<00:04:54.169> so

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
seems like the whole back hand is TPU so

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.409 
seems like the whole back hand is TPU so
you<00:04:55.190> know<00:04:55.400> this<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:55.790> not<00:04:55.910> gonna<00:04:56.090> give<00:04:56.300> you<00:04:56.389> a

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
you know this is not gonna give you a

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.540 
you know this is not gonna give you a
lot<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:56.600> ventilation<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.740> do<00:04:57.889> have<00:04:58.070> a<00:04:58.100> lot<00:04:58.370> on

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
lot of ventilation you do have a lot on

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.430 
lot of ventilation you do have a lot on
the<00:04:58.669> fingertips<00:04:59.180> which<00:04:59.510> is<00:04:59.690> great<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.380> you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
the fingertips which is great but you

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.620 
the fingertips which is great but you
don't<00:05:00.530> have<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.889> lot<00:05:01.160> on<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.639> palm<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:02.240> don't

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
don't have a lot on the palm you don't

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.540 
don't have a lot on the palm you don't
have<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> lot<00:05:03.020> on<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.350> wrist<00:05:03.560> closure<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:04.400> you

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
have a lot on the wrist closure and you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.730 
have a lot on the wrist closure and you
don't<00:05:04.729> have<00:05:04.910> a<00:05:04.970> lot<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.690> know<00:05:05.810> at<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.200> back<00:05:06.680> of

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
don't have a lot you know at the back of

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.070 
don't have a lot you know at the back of
hand<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.520> overall<00:05:07.940> in<00:05:08.240> terms<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.510> ventilation

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
hand so overall in terms of ventilation

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.530 
hand so overall in terms of ventilation
between<00:05:09.710> these<00:05:09.830> two<00:05:10.010> gloves<00:05:10.310> these<00:05:10.790> got<00:05:11.030> a<00:05:11.060> 7

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
between these two gloves these got a 7

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.500 
between these two gloves these got a 7
out<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.870> 10<00:05:12.700> durability<00:05:13.700> on<00:05:13.850> these<00:05:14.000> gloves<00:05:14.240> you

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
out of 10 durability on these gloves you

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.909 
out of 10 durability on these gloves you
know<00:05:14.570> this<00:05:14.750> is<00:05:14.840> not<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:15.020> long-term<00:05:15.290> durability

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
know this is not a long-term durability

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.310 
know this is not a long-term durability
test<00:05:16.460> but<00:05:17.150> there<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.419> gonna<00:05:17.570> be<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:17.810> little<00:05:18.200> bit

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
test but there is gonna be a little bit

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.379 
test but there is gonna be a little bit
of<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.950> difference<00:05:19.430> so<00:05:19.610> again<00:05:19.880> if<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.090> look<00:05:20.240> at

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
of a difference so again if you look at

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.840 
of a difference so again if you look at
this<00:05:20.539> this<00:05:21.320> is<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.500> solid<00:05:21.800> built<00:05:22.220> glove<00:05:22.460> it's

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
this this is a solid built glove it's

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.790 
this this is a solid built glove it's
great<00:05:23.120> I<00:05:23.270> didn't<00:05:23.510> see<00:05:23.600> any<00:05:23.810> issues<00:05:24.229> with<00:05:24.410> it<00:05:24.440> I

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
great I didn't see any issues with it I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.520 
great I didn't see any issues with it I
don't<00:05:25.100> see<00:05:25.310> any<00:05:25.520> issues<00:05:25.789> in<00:05:26.780> long-term<00:05:27.260> use

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
don't see any issues in long-term use

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.219 
don't see any issues in long-term use
now<00:05:28.070> when<00:05:28.220> you<00:05:28.280> do<00:05:28.430> have<00:05:28.669> in<00:05:29.539> this<00:05:29.750> free<00:05:29.960> glove

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
now when you do have in this free glove

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.379 
now when you do have in this free glove
like<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.590> total<00:05:30.800> right<00:05:31.460> hand<00:05:31.700> being<00:05:31.880> that<00:05:32.030> TPU

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
like the total right hand being that TPU

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.330 
like the total right hand being that TPU
material<00:05:32.560> let's<00:05:33.560> see<00:05:33.650> if<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:33.770> can<00:05:33.919> show<00:05:34.100> you<00:05:34.160> it

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
material let's see if I can show you it

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.879 
material let's see if I can show you it
actually<00:05:34.520> started<00:05:35.000> cracking<00:05:35.570> I'm<00:05:36.470> not<00:05:36.710> sure

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
actually started cracking I'm not sure

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.740 
actually started cracking I'm not sure
if<00:05:36.979> you<00:05:37.070> can<00:05:37.190> see<00:05:37.430> that<00:05:37.639> above<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.479> adidas

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
if you can see that above the adidas

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.620 
if you can see that above the adidas
sign<00:05:39.080> in<00:05:39.380> that<00:05:39.919> yellow<00:05:40.130> portion<00:05:40.729> on<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.150> stand

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
sign in that yellow portion on the stand

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.570 
sign in that yellow portion on the stand
colorway<00:05:41.960> right<00:05:42.169> there<00:05:42.380> where<00:05:43.099> the<00:05:43.250> TPU

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
colorway right there where the TPU

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.760 
colorway right there where the TPU
actually<00:05:44.180> started<00:05:44.570> just<00:05:44.720> cracking<00:05:45.050> a<00:05:45.289> little

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
actually started just cracking a little

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.339 
actually started just cracking a little
bit<00:05:45.950> maybe<00:05:46.820> you<00:05:47.000> can<00:05:47.150> see<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:47.450> but<00:05:48.110> for<00:05:48.320> that

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
bit maybe you can see it but for that

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.430 
bit maybe you can see it but for that
reason<00:05:48.470> you<00:05:49.430> know<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.880> gave<00:05:50.240> these<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.810> 7<00:05:51.260> out<00:05:51.410> of

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
reason you know I gave these a 7 out of

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.589 
reason you know I gave these a 7 out of
10<00:05:51.530> for<00:05:51.710> durability<00:05:52.220> not<00:05:52.940> sure<00:05:53.210> if<00:05:53.389> that's

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
10 for durability not sure if that's

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.150 
10 for durability not sure if that's
just<00:05:53.660> this<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.200> how<00:05:54.320> I've<00:05:54.440> been<00:05:54.620> storing<00:05:54.889> them

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
just this and how I've been storing them

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.120 
just this and how I've been storing them
but<00:05:56.000> that's<00:05:56.330> what<00:05:56.570> I<00:05:56.780> gave<00:05:56.840> these<00:05:57.229> gloves<00:05:57.470> just

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
but that's what I gave these gloves just

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.529 
but that's what I gave these gloves just
because<00:05:58.370> I'm<00:05:58.460> concerned<00:05:58.639> over<00:05:59.150> a<00:05:59.210> long<00:05:59.330> time

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
because I'm concerned over a long time

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.870 
because I'm concerned over a long time
used<00:05:59.840> is<00:06:00.110> that<00:06:00.320> TPU<00:06:00.860> on<00:06:01.160> that<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.520> back<00:06:01.669> of<00:06:01.700> the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
used is that TPU on that the back of the

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.640 
used is that TPU on that the back of the
hand<00:06:02.120> we're<00:06:02.599> gonna<00:06:02.660> start<00:06:02.930> cracking<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:03.530> then

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
hand we're gonna start cracking and then

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.159 
hand we're gonna start cracking and then
just<00:06:04.070> visually<00:06:04.550> you<00:06:05.479> know<00:06:05.510> impact<00:06:05.990> your

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
these gloves are for receivers I have a

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.129 
these gloves are for receivers I have a
little<00:06:25.400> different<00:06:25.849> opinion<00:06:26.479> on<00:06:26.660> these<00:06:26.930> gloves

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
little different opinion on these gloves

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.379 
little different opinion on these gloves
I<00:06:27.380> think<00:06:27.620> you<00:06:28.370> know<00:06:28.490> position<00:06:28.910> is<00:06:29.120> more<00:06:29.210> like

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
I think you know position is more like

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.900 
I think you know position is more like
linebacker<00:06:29.930> more<00:06:30.680> like<00:06:30.830> tie<00:06:31.070> dandy<00:06:31.520> and<00:06:31.669> these

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
linebacker more like tie dandy and these

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.339 
linebacker more like tie dandy and these
are<00:06:32.060> receiver<00:06:32.389> gloves<00:06:32.630> but<00:06:32.840> I<00:06:32.870> do<00:06:32.930> feel<00:06:33.289> like

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
are receiver gloves but I do feel like

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.719 
are receiver gloves but I do feel like
these<00:06:33.650> are<00:06:33.830> for<00:06:33.860> a<00:06:34.070> little<00:06:34.310> bit<00:06:34.460> bigger

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
these are for a little bit bigger

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.490 
these are for a little bit bigger
players<00:06:35.090> one<00:06:35.750> of<00:06:35.780> the<00:06:35.870> reasons<00:06:36.140> why<00:06:36.289> if<00:06:36.409> you

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
players one of the reasons why if you

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.060 
players one of the reasons why if you
look<00:06:36.530> at<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.830> wrist<00:06:37.010> closure<00:06:37.280> you<00:06:37.700> know<00:06:37.789> I<00:06:37.820> put

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
look at the wrist closure you know I put

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.310 
look at the wrist closure you know I put
upfront<00:06:38.370> here<00:06:38.700> you'd<00:06:39.180> see<00:06:39.420> it's<00:06:39.600> loose<00:06:40.020> around

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
upfront here you'd see it's loose around

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.350 
upfront here you'd see it's loose around
my<00:06:40.500> wrist<00:06:40.770> you<00:06:41.040> know<00:06:41.490> I<00:06:41.520> do<00:06:41.670> have<00:06:41.970> a<00:06:42.030> little<00:06:42.210> bit

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
my wrist you know I do have a little bit

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.700 
my wrist you know I do have a little bit
of<00:06:42.420> a<00:06:42.510> baby<00:06:42.660> wrist<00:06:42.960> so<00:06:43.110> that's<00:06:43.290> something<00:06:43.500> with

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
of a baby wrist so that's something with

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.950 
of a baby wrist so that's something with
you<00:06:43.800> too<00:06:43.980> if<00:06:44.100> you<00:06:44.160> have<00:06:44.400> thinner<00:06:44.730> wrists<00:06:45.000> this

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.750 
you too if you have thinner wrists this
glove<00:06:46.230> might<00:06:46.530> not<00:06:46.920> be<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.160> best<00:06:47.280> option<00:06:47.520> you

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
glove might not be the best option you

might<00:06:47.880> want<00:06:48.090> to<00:06:48.150> look<00:06:48.300> at<00:06:48.420> something<00:06:48.690> like<00:06:48.750> the

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
might want to look at something like the

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.430 
might want to look at something like the
adizero<00:06:49.320> 4.0<00:06:50.160> I<00:06:50.820> just<00:06:51.360> feel<00:06:51.510> like<00:06:51.690> it's<00:06:51.960> not<00:06:52.110> as

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
adizero 4.0 I just feel like it's not as

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.430 
adizero 4.0 I just feel like it's not as
flexible<00:06:53.430> you<00:06:54.270> don't<00:06:54.450> have<00:06:54.660> that<00:06:54.870> range

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
flexible you don't have that range

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.320 
flexible you don't have that range
motion<00:06:55.800> doesn't<00:06:55.980> impact<00:06:56.730> like<00:06:56.940> you<00:06:57.060> closing

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330

your<00:06:57.510> hand<00:06:57.660> as<00:06:57.780> much<00:06:57.900> as<00:06:58.020> they<00:06:58.110> add<00:06:58.230> a<00:06:58.260> zero<00:06:58.530> so

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
your hand as much as they add a zero so

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.380 
your hand as much as they add a zero so
that<00:06:59.040> it<00:06:59.460> gives<00:06:59.700> you<00:06:59.880> a<00:06:59.910> little<00:07:00.090> bit<00:07:00.210> more

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390
