00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 What do you think of the channel channel? 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.810
 truth of the channel but it is the steering wheel rodrigo 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.340
 cardoso 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.200
 I'm here with my car for those who do not 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.450
 You know, I'm still code conscious. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.600
 If I made a video talking about it, it's the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 recent even in a seat Cordoba 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.449
 I have a problem with the exchange here. 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.590
 in fact the exchange rate with that having 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.980
 been raised and I opened my other day 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.870
 or open the other day was coming back to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.210
 House 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 I noticed that my car stopped hitching 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.989
 the first gear 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.629
 there it was actually difficult 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.410
 I saw that he gave a very loud knock the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.030
 tek 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.170
 when I tried to engage the first 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.940
 but I do not score well not giving 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.690
 lots of attention on the half-way without money 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.610
 also ne 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.500
 what happens I went to the location in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.469
 back the first march began to give 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.920
 problem began to get difficult to engage 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.690
 It is but still came a bit close 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.610
 house only has 2 km to get home 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.970
 still 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.040
 the man did not enter the first nor the stick 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.320
 I had to come from 2nd and 3rd coming out of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.689
 second burning clutch gasoline 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.490
 Going home from the hat I got it. 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.439
 get to the place coming out of traffic 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.360
 were infernal traffic generates 4 and 6 already 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.150
 enter the peak hours were already in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.040
 considerable traffic and could not afford to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.570
 the car stopped on the avenue and I do not know 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.090
 kind of complicated 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 Then I went into the garden neighborhood near 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.869
 house where there was no traffic 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.640
 I stopped there and I tried to hit the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.290
 first forcing it to open the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.810
 hood at the front 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.930
 so I came here in this part here guys 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.259
 to show that with the key in that part 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.119
 here at the top of the key he 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.460
 I was not even aware that I was 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.229
 I do not know if metal or plastic c 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.899
 truth seems to feed by the logic of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.439
 metal plate right here above me 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.219
 I have a spring and here it has 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.490
 a sphere 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.640
 in this sphere pierced mieh and was naked 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.840
 Metal, he did not have any grease there. 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.879
 I spent the grease so I can not now 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.920
 very well, I was 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.260
 old yellow grease 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.670
 logically that I will finish 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.450
 clear that here in fact the car is 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.510
 leaning 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.989
 I spent a bit of grace here 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.510
 got a little softer lever of the 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.110
 exchange rate but the first 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.870
 engaging then that I went to do the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.080
 put here as if it were the position of 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.750
 first're actually going to do the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.640
 next I'll put it like it 's a 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.569
 room is good here 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.459
 the fourth gear position 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:57.930
 I'll show you a play there. 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:03:02.730
 engine side open jacapu 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.069
 they can see here the motor reservoir 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.560
 radiator water water water dodo 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.400
 cleaner and concentrates and I have this 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.620
 ask me here I had not really do not know 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 The name of this piece is very mechanical. 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.049
 but I have her that has been shown yet 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.030
 where is she behind this interconnected piece 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.030
 with a new order 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.269
 Look, sony is fucking me, he talks more 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.820
 cell phone and the alleged hand in the 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.170
 ball in I came here I pulled a lake 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.340
 you can see that there I will 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.130
 show you guys later will change the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:45.570
 position of the lever and here the loose part 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.640
 to get near her is missing a bushel 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.590
 here, then, a bush is really loose 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.269
 it was mixed with the smell 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.670
 from side to side 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.440
 The bush has already left in my hand so 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.660
 I was not inventing the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.760
 first march I believe that in fact 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.560
 She's going to give me a break and for me, sister. 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.780
 first huge march with the blow 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.769
 the tek is very strong so i think i have to 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.650
 make this move and have all these 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.489
 parts having a bushing having a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.630
 bush here 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.190
 This is all she has here. 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.889
 that I do not know exactly what 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.630
 You name it so you can only take it up. 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.849
 dropping and inserting bushing 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.360
 he has that part down also this 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.360
 plastic part 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.810
 they can arm there and it's turned on in the field 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.550
 now I remember that I put it on the fourth 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.550
 also show you guys again 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.319
 Look, he spoke. He changed the position. 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.509
 If I move there, it's going to change the 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.550
 position here then if I move here he 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.400
 will move the position in that piece there in the 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.889
 in front of what happens in the first he 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.810
 try to enter would be here and would not come 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.849
 entered only the third direct jump is 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.800
 basically instead of talking I did 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.199
 this movement is as if I did this 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.150
 movement 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.270
 so the bush is loose in my hand 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.590
 I'm seeing a zone to show and a 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.990
 bush in here too 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.090
 I do not know if I'll see. 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.610
 legal and in the video but this is where 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.610
 key is leaning on a loofah looks 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.879
 just born there is a play actually 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.229
 Burst Grease key head 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:30.210
 Olympiad but finally get first 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.029
 in the traffic because of this I'm going 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.240
 buy the replacement kit 17 cÃ³rdoba tip 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:38.819
 It's from what I saw on the internet from the wind 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.710
 from golf 94 to gulf 98 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.060
 I did not see the specification very well, I'll see 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.500
 this still put in the comments to 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.889
 prim specification 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:51.810
 This is gt and what is glx glx if 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.979
 I am not mistaken has a golf I too will 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.520
 see it right 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:59.039
 I'll buy and come back and make the exchange. 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.560
 my seeing if I were the exchange of all 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.770
 is there are two non -85 kits that comes with 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.409
 the party that was yellow in the 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.110
 front and there is one that comes to the bench as well 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.599
 with my car it's all lever 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.520
 Right here I do not see any problem is 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.379
 more on the part of the witches even won 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.909
 with the cheapest kit on the free market 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.680
 eighty-five reais and I can 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.690
 The result for you is who has 17 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.360
 Cordoba I believe that after this 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.210
 result will be interesting there because 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.139
 we know who has 17 cordoba some 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.250
 they know others do not 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:34.409
 many pieces are from golf is for example 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.820
 this panel here already told me that it is 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.820
 whole golf 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.760
 the piece that part here if I 'm not mistaken 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.130
 from polo classic 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.910
 the front panel also the buttons 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.100
 then several pieces serve in this car and 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.630
 Some national cars out there from Volks 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.050
 including the engine if I'm not mistaken 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:59.250
 has an audi symbol and several pieces 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:05.100
 They will be those cars of kings also in 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:07.110
 sac of kings and kings is also 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.920
 When I got the car I was missing three 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.710
 elections 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.610
 these three times I bought as being 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.540
 golf is golf kombi kova several 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.130
 different cars 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.750
 so if you need any 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:24.590
 Anything there in the seat? 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:27.570
 Cordoba is a great car for me. 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.120

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:33.950
