00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.920
 the work they provide us and 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.869
 for their entertainment 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.289
 so I'll immediately start to 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.789
 introduce me is the chis apic 16 years 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.729
 youtuber for eight months 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.560
 I have 700 subscribers so here I would like 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.789
 expand my community that's why 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.740
 I try to go on these two channels 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.820
 and that would make me a huge hug 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.409
 pleasure to spend there 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.179
 so I'm going right now 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.009
 introduce the gameplay so it's a 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.819
 gameplay on the meltones map in 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:36.390
 domination 6 v6 hardcore attempt 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:40.319
 Nuclear Tac 45 with the c4 and size 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.700
 45 laser finder it seems to me no visa 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.789
 reflex to its visitors to laser it's 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.140
 on the old codes so I apologize 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.509
 I will introduce you a little bit 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.310
 gameplay with which he played with drones 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.030
 microstation fog drones the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.739
 base to try nuclear dice so you 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.050
 will see later if they succeed in 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.509
 nuclear or not a little bit of 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.399
 suspense would not hurt so 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.619
 here I have a little bit about you 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.539
 something that appeals to me 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.819
 so I would like to know what you 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.690
 do you think subscribers to consult or 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.239
 cf codes 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.430
 do you think nuclear two bo2 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.709
 is harder or easier to see than 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.000
 on the old games ie is this 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.010
 the two nuclear bo2 more 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.110
 simple as having a nuclear on 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.860
 modern warfare 2 nuclear on modern 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.080
 warfare 3 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.920
 and so I go a little bit 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.220
 give my point of view myself 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.770
 for me on modern warfare 3 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.730
 there was still be finally 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.050
 specialists who was really very 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.239
 useful to unlock a moab 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.739
 so it was really helpful and that 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.150
 made it a little easier but 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.750
 it was not within the reach of everyone 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.360
 world anyway 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.350
 you had to have a good level when 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.810
 even then on modern warfare 2 there 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.150
 had there nuclear except that nuclear 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.510
 was very easy to get it was enough 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.620
 to play in arrive to warn dahico 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.410
 and in nuclear 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.600
 you just had to make 6 kg minimum 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.450
 to unlock your arrival then the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.069
 machine went up alone so no 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.830
 really if he really did not 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.410
 huge so that's really the scope of 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.970
 everyone while on bo 2 after 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.590
 it's my opinion I think it a little more 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.100
 because there is no already 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.569
 specialists that there is no 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.269
 district helping you unlock them 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.040
 Here I would like you already told me 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.180
 that in the comments your opinion and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.709
 I also want to ask you another 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.150
 question I do not want to answer because 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.680
 that it is rather your opinion that 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.690
 interests me but I would like to know 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.060
 the future of the community compared 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.070
 at the next consoles if the old ones 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.980
 if the old consoles for example 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.989
 like the xbox or the ps3 will die in 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.000
 the closets or so if he will stay 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.400
 a community playing on the old 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.540
 codes the old passes the old ones 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.160
 consoles and all that would really make me 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.380
 pleasure that you will tell me that in the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.989
 comments on this I finished my 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.630
 comment here is a very very video 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.730
 short because of the speed between 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.709
 other nuclear power that is 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.540
 unlocked at this moment so I'll you 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.720
 make a big kiss it was the thread that 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.720
 pike
