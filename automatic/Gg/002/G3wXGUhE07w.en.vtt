00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Now comes a video on her csm 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.460
 Today I wanted a pretty 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.250
 imagine pretty cool workshop web 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.309
 with the eureka control can improve 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.530
 and the map can learn that 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.210
 really blatantly so that's with 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.850
 distance if i have the best workshop web 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.199
 the currently so on the way is so 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.660
 Web really helps a lot 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.430
 continue if you fire the map and me 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.510
 knew then you have this video on 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 in any case helped me so 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.599
 make sure you get a lot out of it 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 In any case, it will be a lot better 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.619
 helped a lot 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.570
 the web history codemasters and you see 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.040
 already one has here almost a field where 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.960
 you then have to control your way 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 earlier it was learned from crisis 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 So it went now as well as are old hare 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.450
 but his old contract would be 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.770
 it used quasi so that one on one 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.629
 wall somewhere shot at any 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.820
 somehow wait for match and then you can 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.410
 looked at the recall and that then 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 tried to control and so to speak 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.879
 industry climbing to make smaller 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.199
 through this map but here is the whole 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.270
 perhaps easier could it 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.620
 learn a lot better and therefore helps 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.690
 just this app really next sitting 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.939
 a great help for everyone 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.830
 players and now first as a 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.600
 small construction of the mep you have here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 you can use almost the whole weapon 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.640
 bp is of course a bad one now 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 for example because rica control is not 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.020
 necessarily so the advantage so needs 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.290
 you can not really but here m4 for example 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.580
 you control the riedberg here ak 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.080
 stop all weapons here then too 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.100
 still the pistols listed but there 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.290
 As I said , it does not really exist 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.740
 control so you have to now synonymous 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.020
 not to clarify so you can almost 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.720
 then select the weapons then around the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.360
 to describe hirschau impact 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.820
 time, so to speak, if you have that out then 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 your impax will be almost normal 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.220
 displayed as well as in matchmaking 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.930
 is and everywhere 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 but if you do that then you will 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.890
 your bullet holes are marked here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.030
 that means we see that better 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.909
 I can definitely give you something 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.619
 Would recommend because you are here 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.000
 canceled freakwave wants to see 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.920
 would like to improve spray tan 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.479
 reset can be pressed here and here 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.890
 push that makes the whole quasi 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.009
 bullet holes and so everything away again 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.390
 are therefore directed therefore movement 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.000
 lures you it is then firmly here 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.560
 that you can not move that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.640
 is actually synonymous relatively so no matter 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.160
 You can do that if you feel like it 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.350
 but 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.460
 can move freely but diamond 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.660
 is also very useful if you are 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.730
 right in the middle of this thing 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.430
 So you can also apply to everyone 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.310
 case then you can still use here 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.050
 set bullet time what that is 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.250
 If you inspect your weapon I will 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.530
 right now do you have quasi 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.760
 here super slomo so all that totally 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.010
 slowly and you can then in so to speak 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.810
 Mega acids recall I control 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.390
 I hope that's just the way it is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.850
 We can learn this slowly now 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.200
 But I have no idea I find 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.150
 I did not say it was necessarily 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.240
 needs because one should prefer to 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.350
 win as it is in real here 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.640
 By the way, it also comes out again when the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.560
 effect or not back to police 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.480
 So do not worry if you can 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.010
 times have set next shows 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.660
 the big one and that's what I think 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.390
 with distance, the best thing about this map 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.560
 that's really a brilliant idea that you 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.030
 You see, that 's a little green one 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.820
 point when you shoot then he moves 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.530
 He shows that to us 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.810
 It is like controlling enrica 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.070
 moving a body is so eureka 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.060
 So the real thing is controlled 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.440
 rica control 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.810
 Here, too, sees that up here again 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.570
 from drk we do the whole thing in general 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.250
 But this little green dot is here 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.720
 He then always shows her to her head 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.090
 so you have to move it all the way 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.740
 is bundled as I said it is war 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.910
 control 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.709
 do not worry so i will never do that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.170
 perfect, that's all in 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.000
 one is in a tiny field in it 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.950
 no pro player can do that either 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.810
 is just impossible because hertha still 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.200
 a little bit of random factors 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.209
 the recall is so 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.530
 her quasi perfect but manage it 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.030
 so you can help that field here 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.220
 keeps as small and bundled as possible 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.840
 Keep this ghost synonymous for most 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.190
 Weapons available so for the weapons like 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.840
 Of course, the abb is not 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.390
 available because he has none 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.709
 corresponding recoil but for so 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.989
 fully automatic weapons such as 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.700
 for example the m 44 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.230
 that is in any case present so there 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.700
 can one learn that and has that 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.230
 So all the main weapons so from the 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.750
 Storm rifles here it is for every weapon 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.580
 also for the mps and that's all 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.670
 available here see the bottom left 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.709
 is the whole weapon available 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.570
 for the sms it is only for the 490 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.100
 available for the other sms it is 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.540
 a valable but I guess that 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.120
 will then be in the next updates of the 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.630
 map, of course, at some point 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.800
 and shotguns and amg and pistols are there 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.780
 is not over but i think now is 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.360
 available 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.289
 with the cz you can also the recall there 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.590
 It could definitely be synonymous with 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.090
 teachers could then what always the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.169
 You can then choose weapon 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.120
 Let's take a look at the rector 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.070
 is controlled and is equipped shows 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.200
 Then you also how to do that then 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.789
 has to move to the next 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.570
 other features first in finds 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:51.220
 emma that's just virtually unlimited 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.360
 I do not have any ammunition for you 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.800
 really would recommend that you us 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.210
 lawyer because if you ever against the wall 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.289
 sprayed at the end almost infinitely long and 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.150
 in the end, it just works 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.280
 back and forth and that's almost a 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.539
 Do not really conclude that yourself 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.070
 So you have those in the 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.990
 matchmaking or something like that because you almost never 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.850
 in find one has the right server 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.200
 that's why it does not bring that much 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.180
 then you always have to load 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.310
 after shooting but I find time 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.030
 better multi target then you have here 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.169
 so much more targets 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.560
 then especially good with the bus 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.620
 drive that you can almost see how 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.630
 must talk about that was then yes 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.630
 almost in the spray then again huber 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.860
 that speaks for it because that one can also 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.210
 Definitely good for practicing 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.650
 because it's so common for you to get up 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.669
 the individually quickly pass by 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.789
 that had to be a good one 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.620
 works on board what i said 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.660
 not exactly what it is for me but me 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.090
 Mine that will change that was her 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.210
 also because coincidental is that then 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.520
 eureka is set on the specific 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.470
 that's not so much forgiving and 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.120
 the pension factor for the recall control 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.539
 disappears 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.900
 the target ticket then you see here has 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.950
 me, a kind of pub terrorist 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.000
 you can play the games 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.370
 maybe used to it sincerely 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.660
 people can not get any idea 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.099
 but also help quite well 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.720
 I do not actually have it on now either 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.460
 so you can still here the 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.990
 zielscheibe shoot further back 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.150
 that will be more difficult because of course 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.900
 then mistakes are faster 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.780
 visible 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.530
 but if you ever, I now times completely 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.050
 far to the rear 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.280
 if you take care that big 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.900
 But then it does not work anymore 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.870
 right now I'll take you to the 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.420
 height of ghost 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.150
 and you see that the balls are like that 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.050
 go higher than in the middle so that 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.820
 That's not right anymore 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.020
 that means you can do it 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.460
 then not only on the big animal right 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.110
 leave to what extent that pulls outward 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.430
 therefore the wholesale the king only quasi 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.260
 really good if you use this 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.420
 for this inner circle so for the 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.530
 used for the first stage so that 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.910
 almost now synonymous with the video I hope 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.140
 that I liked you I am 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.760
 really sure that this map you 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.810
 can help quite a bit because rikon 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.660
 quite narrow is a pretty important one 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.040
 thing in cs go what you do on each 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.330
 could match or on most 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.530
 distances and then just good clean 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.450
 That's why it's really one 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.170
 pretty important thing here is the map 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.850
 In any case, in the description 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.620
 linked then you have a workshop 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.780
 link because it would have on the workshop 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.130
 subscribe then click on the map 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.350
 you download the automatically down and 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.850
 then in cs go by workshop maps you can 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.070
 then easily select and play 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.060
 So that's the way it would be 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.890
 map get that is not synonymous 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.360
 virus or so could not worry 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.010
 I then down to normal and safe 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.970
 load here if you like the video 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.320
 if I had to thumb myself 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.620
 above, passwords are looking forward to skin three 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.620
