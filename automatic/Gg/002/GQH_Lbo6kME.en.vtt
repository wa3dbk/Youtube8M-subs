00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
mean their form has been pretty rough

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.639

this<00:00:37.890> season's<00:00:38.340> been<00:00:38.579> up<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.930> should

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this season's been up and down I should

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.889

think it's very very difficult for

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.290 
think it's very very difficult for
Manchester<00:00:43.800> United<00:00:43.829> fans<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.520> kind<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.910> put

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
Manchester United fans to kind of put

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.790 
Manchester United fans to kind of put
together<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.899> happened<00:00:45.930> last<00:00:46.320> season<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
together what happened last season and

together what happened last season and
what's<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.430> season<00:00:47.640> yeah

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
what's going on this season yeah

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.119 
what's going on this season yeah
obviously<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.289> change<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.649> manager<00:00:49.950> has<00:00:50.039> had

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
obviously the change of manager has had

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.459 
obviously the change of manager has had
a<00:00:50.160> massive<00:00:50.550> difference<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> consistency

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
a massive difference but the consistency
