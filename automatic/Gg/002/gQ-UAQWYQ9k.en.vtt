00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
bit with that so that completes the lip

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.080 
bit with that so that completes the lip
lining<00:04:04.440> portion<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.670> now<00:04:05.820> you<00:04:05.880> have

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
lining portion of it so now you have
