00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.160
 Hey, friends. 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.540
 I am Jesse of the Shining Orchestra, from Taiwan. 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.900
 Here you have to look at the BOSS GT-100 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.360
 This comprehensive effect is very good. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.120
 Very simple to use 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.880
 Can easily call out the sound you want in your brain 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.020
 It can help you create the sounds your orchestra needs. 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.540
 Or whether you are an independent musician 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.600
 Still a sound technician, you can also use this guy to do a lot of things. 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.670
 Believe me, I have also used it to make some sounds. 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.890
 I like it very much 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.480
 I will present a few of the sounds I use often. 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.260
 There are some special sounds. 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.780
 I have never used it in live performances. 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.540
 But I often use it in the studio. 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.540
 Next, let you listen, thank you. 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.720
 OK, the first tone 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.400
 I named it "Tight Metal" 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.580
 It is a very modern sound 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.600
 I use it in live performances and studios. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.060
 I will play it for you now. 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.980
 Ok, friends. 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.750
 Now I want to demonstrate the second tone. 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.030
 In my GT-100 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.790
 Named "JBL lead" 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.610
 JBL is my name 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.610
 Abbreviation for Jesse Black Liu 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.680
 Please listen 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.200
 This tone uses a harmonic effect 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.190
 It can sound like a guitarist, itâ€™s cool 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.120
 With this sound, you don't have to find another guitarist. 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.560
 And I named it "One with 4 hands" 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.560
 Come listen 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.250
 You can download the 10 sounds I made. 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.490
 Contains several sounds that I just played 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.940
 All on the BOSS TONE CENTRAL website 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.660
 I hope you will like it. 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.400
 Just all the sounds that I showed you. 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.120
 Thank you
