honestly I don't think I would have
bought<00:03:36.630> picks<00:03:36.930> plus<00:03:37.260> because<00:03:38.100> i<00:03:38.250> think<00:03:38.310> this

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
bought picks plus because i think this

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.720 
bought picks plus because i think this
does<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.120> job<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:39.570> works<00:03:39.900> great<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.730> my

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
be interested in I'm not knocking the

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.440

fix<00:06:08.100> plus<00:06:08.310> at<00:06:08.460> all<00:06:08.550> I<00:06:08.580> still<00:06:08.880> love<00:06:09.030> it<00:06:09.060> but<00:06:09.300> this

is<00:06:09.630> definitely<00:06:09.870> a<00:06:10.140> great<00:06:10.380> alternative<00:06:10.590> I

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
is definitely a great alternative I

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.010 
is definitely a great alternative I
think<00:06:11.250> they<00:06:11.340> both<00:06:11.370> work<00:06:11.850> in<00:06:12.060> very<00:06:12.720> very

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
think they both work in very very

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.080 
think they both work in very very
similar<00:06:13.350> capacities<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.760> main<00:06:15.060> difference

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
similar capacities the main difference

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.510 
similar capacities the main difference
that<00:06:15.630> I<00:06:15.720> found

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
that I found

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.999 
that I found
is<00:06:16.849> that<00:06:17.210> this<00:06:17.389> does<00:06:17.569> make<00:06:17.750> my<00:06:17.900> skin<00:06:18.139> go<00:06:18.560> oily

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
is that this does make my skin go oily

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.029 
is that this does make my skin go oily
before<00:06:19.430> this<00:06:19.639> does<00:06:19.910> um<00:06:20.440> but<00:06:21.440> like<00:06:21.620> I<00:06:21.710> said<00:06:21.770> my

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
before this does um but like I said my

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.469 
before this does um but like I said my
skin<00:06:22.250> is<00:06:22.370> kind<00:06:22.430> of<00:06:22.639> prone<00:06:22.819> to<00:06:22.970> that<00:06:23.000> anyway

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479
