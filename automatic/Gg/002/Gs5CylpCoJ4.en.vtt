originally<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:56.430> probably<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.240> 1920<00:01:57.960> by

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
originally it's probably I'm 1920 by

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.340 
originally it's probably I'm 1920 by
1080<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.829> mine<00:01:59.070> ones<00:01:59.689> we<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.110> is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
1080 like mine ones we have to do is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.910 
1080 like mine ones we have to do is
where<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.710> says<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.740> go

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
where it says what here you have to go

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.280 
where it says what here you have to go
into<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.549> change<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.360> thirty<00:02:07.110> eight

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
into that and change it to thirty eight

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.430 
into that and change it to thirty eight
forty<00:02:07.320> which<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.039> what<00:02:08.220> I've<00:02:08.369> done<00:02:08.399> there

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
forty which is what I've done there

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.660 
forty which is what I've done there
right<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.679> we're<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> adjust<00:02:11.430> I've

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
right now we're going to adjust I've

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
right now we're going to adjust I've
been<00:02:11.819> playing<00:02:12.090> around<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.780> 1080<00:02:13.290> I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
been playing around with it in 1080 I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.760 
been playing around with it in 1080 I
can't<00:02:14.129> seem<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.400> scroll<00:02:14.849> down<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.470> only

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
can't seem to scroll down you can only

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.920 
can't seem to scroll down you can only
see<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.520> move<00:02:17.700> up<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.300> when<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.510> try<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.810> move

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
see can move up so when you try and move

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.080 
see can move up so when you try and move
look<00:02:19.379> around<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.160> camera<00:02:20.489> around<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> map

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
look around the camera around the map

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.330 
look around the camera around the map
you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.930> move<00:02:22.080> up<00:02:22.260> left<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.739> right<00:02:22.860> B<00:02:23.160> can't

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
you can move up left and right B can't

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.670 
you can move up left and right B can't
move<00:02:23.489> down<00:02:23.760> because<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> bar<00:02:24.330> at<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> bottom

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
move down because the bar at the bottom

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.449 
move down because the bar at the bottom
so<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.709> can<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.010> make<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.250> screen

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
so you can have to make the screen

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.850 
so you can have to make the screen
slightly<00:02:26.849> smaller<00:02:27.120> I'm<00:02:28.050> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.319> go<00:02:28.470> for

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
slightly smaller I'm going to go for

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.100 
slightly smaller I'm going to go for
probably<00:02:30.319> reduce<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.410> by<00:02:31.500> 100<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.040> go<00:02:33.110> 980<00:02:34.110> 0

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
probably reduce it by 100 and go 980 0

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.650 
probably reduce it by 100 and go 980 0
that<00:02:37.110> should<00:02:37.290> give<00:02:37.470> us<00:02:37.500> enough<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.629> then<00:02:39.629> you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
that should give us enough and then you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.390 
that should give us enough and then you
go<00:02:39.930> save<00:02:41.269> now<00:02:42.560> at<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.709> point<00:02:43.950> you're<00:02:44.129> good<00:02:44.280> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
go save now at this point you're good to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.160 
go save now at this point you're good to
close<00:02:44.640> out<00:02:44.879> of<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.360> open<00:02:45.780> up<00:02:46.019> your

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
close out of that and open up your

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.229 
close out of that and open up your
league<00:02:48.860> from<00:02:49.860> here<00:02:50.190> what<00:02:50.370> I'll<00:02:50.519> do<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.180> will

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
league from here what I'll do is I will

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.009 
league from here what I'll do is I will
switch<00:02:51.989> onto<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:53.090> camera<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:54.420> see<00:02:54.540> both

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
switch onto a camera so you can see both

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.070 
switch onto a camera so you can see both
of<00:02:55.050> my<00:02:55.290> screens<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.920> what<00:02:56.040> they<00:02:56.160> look<00:02:56.340> like

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
spaces on the bottom and the top roughly

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.680 
spaces on the bottom and the top roughly
equally<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:35.069> as<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.549> can<00:03:35.640> see<00:03:35.879> we<00:03:36.390> are<00:03:36.420> now

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
equally and as you can see we are now

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:45.080 
equally and as you can see we are now
running<00:03:38.180> across<00:03:39.180> two<00:03:39.629> monitors<00:03:43.790> I'll<00:03:44.790> get<00:03:45.000> rid

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
running across two monitors I'll get rid

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.449 
running across two monitors I'll get rid
of<00:03:45.180> my<00:03:45.239> lock<00:03:46.019> cam<00:03:46.379> I<00:03:46.620> had<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.040> before<00:03:47.340> for

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
of my lock cam I had that before for

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.759 
of my lock cam I had that before for
testing<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:47.940> now<00:03:48.510> as<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.840> can<00:03:48.959> see<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.319> can

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
testing and now as you can see I can

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.690 
testing and now as you can see I can
scroll<00:03:50.190> down<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:51.060> up<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.599> across<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.230> across

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
scroll down and up and across and across

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.259 
scroll down and up and across and across
so<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.090> are<00:03:54.239> now<00:03:54.420> running<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:57.110> dual<00:03:58.110> monitors

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
so you are now running on dual monitors

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.449 
so you are now running on dual monitors
so<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.540> does<00:04:00.720> look<00:04:00.930> quite<00:04:01.049> cool<00:04:01.319> as<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.069> saying

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
so it does look quite cool as I saying

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.500 
so it does look quite cool as I saying
then<00:04:02.670> problem<00:04:02.909> is<00:04:03.060> when<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.239> get<00:04:03.330> to<00:04:03.360> this

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
then problem is when you get to this

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.800 
then problem is when you get to this
little<00:04:03.689> middle<00:04:04.470> gap<00:04:04.739> here<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:06.540> can<00:04:06.659> cause

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
little middle gap here you can cause

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.580 
little middle gap here you can cause
problems<00:04:07.909> because<00:04:08.909> as<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.330> see<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:10.439> can

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
problems because as you can see you can

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.110 
problems because as you can see you can
imagine<00:04:10.980> if<00:04:11.099> you<00:04:11.250> are<00:04:11.310> playing<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.849> skill-shot

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
imagine if you are playing a skill-shot

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.250 
imagine if you are playing a skill-shot
chair

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
chair

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.750 
chair
or<00:04:13.650> Israel<00:04:14.099> and<00:04:14.250> you've<00:04:14.940> got<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.120> guy<00:04:15.410> here<00:04:16.760> it's

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
or Israel and you've got a guy here it's

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.479 
or Israel and you've got a guy here it's
like<00:04:17.910> looking<00:04:18.239> through<00:04:18.269> water<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.139> to

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
like looking through water you have to

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.920 
like looking through water you have to
when<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.609> shoot<00:04:20.940> your<00:04:21.030> skillshots<00:04:21.510> if<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.810> can

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
when you shoot your skillshots if I can

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.670 
when you shoot your skillshots if I can
give<00:04:22.019> an<00:04:22.079> example

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
give an example

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.260 
give an example
you<00:04:23.040> shoot<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.280> from<00:04:23.460> one<00:04:23.610> side<00:04:23.639> I<00:04:24.060> won't

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
you shoot it from one side I won't

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.430 
you shoot it from one side I won't
necessarily<00:04:24.479> pop<00:04:24.900> out<00:04:25.080> where<00:04:25.260> you're<00:04:25.350> going

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
necessarily pop out where you're going

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.920 
necessarily pop out where you're going
to<00:04:25.530> think<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.889> this<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.520> see<00:04:26.699> there<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.180> move

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
to think of it this you see there I move

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.650 
to think of it this you see there I move
back<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.139> bit<00:04:28.790> clearer<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:31.800> can<00:04:31.830> see<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:33.120> the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
back a bit clearer you can see that the

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.750 
back a bit clearer you can see that the
line<00:04:33.870> leaves<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.410> screen<00:04:34.620> slightly<00:04:35.550> above

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
line leaves the screen slightly above

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.370 
line leaves the screen slightly above
where<00:04:35.910> it's<00:04:36.000> going<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.150> come<00:04:36.330> out<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:37.229> it'll

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
where it's going to come out so it'll

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.260 
where it's going to come out so it'll
kind<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:39.949> it's<00:04:40.949> pretty<00:04:41.250> minimal<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.090> does

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
kind of it's pretty minimal but it does

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.659 
kind of it's pretty minimal but it does
make<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.870> difference<00:04:43.280> if<00:04:44.280> you're<00:04:44.400> going<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.610> be

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
make a difference if you're going to be

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.529 
make a difference if you're going to be
doing<00:04:44.880> that<00:04:45.000> just<00:04:45.600> be<00:04:45.780> where<00:04:46.020> I'm<00:04:47.449> looking<00:04:48.449> at

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
doing that just be where I'm looking at

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.930 
doing that just be where I'm looking at
it<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.720> know<00:04:48.750> there's<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.430> size<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.639> gap<00:04:50.820> at

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
it you know there's a size the gap at

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.580 
it you know there's a size the gap at
the<00:04:51.000> top<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.330> screen<00:04:51.539> in<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.199> bottom<00:04:52.470> of

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
the top of the screen in the bottom of

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.529 
the top of the screen in the bottom of
the<00:04:52.650> screen<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:53.520> could<00:04:53.669> probably<00:04:53.850> make<00:04:54.180> their

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
the screen you could probably make their

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.610 
the screen you could probably make their
resolution<00:04:56.060> slightly<00:04:57.060> bigger<00:04:57.810> we<00:04:58.260> made<00:04:58.470> it

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
resolution slightly bigger we made it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.890 
resolution slightly bigger we made it
nine<00:04:59.100> eight<00:04:59.430> hundred<00:05:00.030> there<00:05:00.539> something<00:05:00.840> you

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
nine eight hundred there something you

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.279 
nine eight hundred there something you
can<00:05:01.050> play<00:05:01.260> with<00:05:01.530> just<00:05:01.919> fiddle<00:05:02.340> with<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:03.289> the

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
can play with just fiddle with the the

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.820 
can play with just fiddle with the the
resolutions<00:05:04.979> as<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:06.210> want<00:05:06.449> to<00:05:06.810> make<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.199> fit

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
resolutions as you want to make it fit

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.810 
resolutions as you want to make it fit
your<00:05:07.860> screen<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.850> best<00:05:10.070> ninety<00:05:11.070> nine<00:05:11.610> eighty

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
your screen the best ninety nine eighty

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.290 
your screen the best ninety nine eighty
was<00:05:12.060> just<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.389> suggestion<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.850> thought<00:05:15.120> of

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
was just a suggestion that I thought of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.629 
was just a suggestion that I thought of
I<00:05:15.510> don't<00:05:16.320> really<00:05:16.470> make<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.680> different<00:05:17.100> I'll

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
I don't really make a different I'll

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.850 
I don't really make a different I'll
probably<00:05:17.849> try<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.389> few<00:05:18.690> games<00:05:18.930> out<00:05:19.349> with<00:05:19.710> this

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
probably try a few games out with this

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.969 
probably try a few games out with this
set<00:05:20.190> up<00:05:20.750> but<00:05:21.750> yeah<00:05:21.870> if<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.560> liked<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.860> video
