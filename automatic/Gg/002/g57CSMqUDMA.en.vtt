00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.580 
ahead and give myself a trim I think I
need<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.190> take<00:02:48.490> off<00:02:48.760> around<00:02:49.120> an<00:02:49.540> inch<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.410> two

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
need to take off around an inch to two

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.000 
need to take off around an inch to two
inches<00:02:51.300> from<00:02:52.890> from<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.040> back<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.580> then<00:02:56.010> just

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
inches from from the back and then just

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.740 
inches from from the back and then just
to<00:02:57.160> start<00:02:57.460> i'll<00:02:57.610> probably<00:02:57.880> take<00:02:58.120> off<00:02:58.270> half<00:02:58.540> an

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
to start i'll probably take off half an

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.200 
to start i'll probably take off half an
inch<00:02:58.930> everywhere<00:02:59.440> else<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.010> i'll<00:03:00.610> see<00:03:00.850> how<00:03:01.030> it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
inch everywhere else but i'll see how it

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.010 
inch everywhere else but i'll see how it
goes<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.780> then<00:03:02.970> over<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.240> process<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.870> this

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
goes and then over the process of this

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.920 
goes and then over the process of this
coming<00:03:05.290> year<00:03:05.470> i<00:03:05.920> will<00:03:06.490> go<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.420> trim<00:03:07.750> my

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
coming year i will go in and trim my

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.600 
coming year i will go in and trim my
hair<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:09.600> couple<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.720> times<00:03:10.960> just<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:12.100> thicken

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
hair a couple of times just to thicken

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.670 
hair a couple of times just to thicken
it<00:03:12.850> up<00:03:13.030> I've<00:03:13.660> been<00:03:14.050> waiting<00:03:14.230> all<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:14.620> time

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
it up I've been waiting all this time

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.730 
it up I've been waiting all this time
for<00:03:14.920> my<00:03:15.310> hair<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.640> grow<00:03:16.420> past<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:17.200> certain<00:03:17.530> point

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
for my hair to grow past a certain point

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.610 
for my hair to grow past a certain point
before<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.340> started<00:03:18.700> cutting<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:20.470> about

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
before I started cutting and it's about

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.830 
before I started cutting and it's about
at<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:21.100> point<00:03:21.400> right<00:03:21.640> now<00:03:22.260> also<00:03:23.260> I'm

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
at that point right now also I'm

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.540 
at that point right now also I'm
wondering<00:03:25.840> whether<00:03:26.020> I<00:03:26.170> may<00:03:26.650> be<00:03:26.709> very<00:03:27.340> very

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
wondering whether I may be very very

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.340 
wondering whether I may be very very
close<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.120> my<00:03:28.240> terminal<00:03:28.540> limb<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:32.170> know<00:03:32.320> I

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
close to my terminal limb so you know I

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.560 
close to my terminal limb so you know I
figure<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:33.190> don't<00:03:33.580> really<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.030> much<00:03:34.360> to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
figure I don't really have that much to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.020 
figure I don't really have that much to
lose<00:03:34.780> if<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.200> start<00:03:35.470> cutting<00:03:35.650> my<00:03:35.950> hair<00:03:36.900> um<00:03:39.030> this

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
lose if I start cutting my hair um this

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.310 
lose if I start cutting my hair um this
is<00:03:40.300> my<00:03:40.330> shower<00:03:40.900> comb<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:42.250> perspex<00:03:42.850> come<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
is my shower comb so perspex come the

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.030 
is my shower comb so perspex come the
noisy<00:03:44.590> ones<00:03:44.920> but<00:03:45.670> it's<00:03:46.060> very<00:03:46.480> slippery<00:03:47.040> so

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
noisy ones but it's very slippery so

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.390 
noisy ones but it's very slippery so
that's<00:03:48.490> the<00:03:48.670> reason<00:03:48.700> why<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.209> like<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.400> when

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
that's the reason why I like it and when

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.930 
that's the reason why I like it and when
I<00:03:51.430> wanted<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.720> did<00:03:53.620> something<00:03:53.890> to<00:03:54.310> get<00:03:54.640> rid<00:03:54.700> of

I wanted I I did something to get rid of

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.210 
I wanted I I did something to get rid of
the<00:03:55.090> spine<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:56.110> goes<00:03:56.380> through<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.740> middle<00:03:57.070> I

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
the spine that goes through the middle I

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.300 
the spine that goes through the middle I
burnt<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.270> over<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.630> candle<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.320> helped<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.040> colo

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
burnt it over a candle I helped the colo

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.590 
burnt it over a candle I helped the colo
a<00:04:00.520> candle<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.750> burnt<00:04:02.230> off<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.670> if

a candle and that burnt off that that if

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.630 
a candle and that burnt off that that if
you<00:04:04.690> know<00:04:04.810> what<00:04:04.900> I'm<00:04:04.990> talking<00:04:05.170> about<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:06.610> a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
you know what I'm talking about that a

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.540 
you know what I'm talking about that a
comb<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:07.150> two<00:04:07.420> pieces<00:04:07.720> glued<00:04:08.620> together<00:04:08.800> for

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
comb is two pieces glued together for

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.280 
comb is two pieces glued together for
most<00:04:09.790> combs<00:04:10.120> or<00:04:10.330> two<00:04:10.510> pieces<00:04:10.750> glued<00:04:11.110> together

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
most combs or two pieces glued together

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.350 
most combs or two pieces glued together
and<00:04:11.770> where<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.370> two<00:04:12.550> pieces<00:04:12.790> come<00:04:13.180> together

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
and where the two pieces come together

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.510 
and where the two pieces come together
there's<00:04:13.840> usually<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.770> rough<00:04:15.130> part<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:17.489> what<00:04:18.489> I

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
there's usually a rough part so what I

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.449 
there's usually a rough part so what I
did<00:04:18.640> with<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.090> comb<00:04:19.419> was<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:20.109> held<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.190> over<00:04:21.310> a

flame and don't do this with a comb that
you<00:04:25.000> spent<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.360> lot<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.540> money<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.320> only

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
you spent a lot of money on I only

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.020 
you spent a lot of money on I only
spent<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.030> dollar<00:04:27.180> on<00:04:27.480> this<00:04:27.660> cone<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:29.130> burns

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
spent a dollar on this cone and it burns

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.460 
spent a dollar on this cone and it burns
out<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:31.380> spine<00:04:32.060> from<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.120> comb<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:33.720> made<00:04:34.320> it

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
out that spine from the comb and made it

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:45.410 
out that spine from the comb and made it
smooth<00:04:37.880> yeah<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:40.760> let<00:04:41.760> me<00:04:41.850> turn<00:04:42.030> around<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:45.210> I

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
smooth yeah so let me turn around and I

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.120 
smooth yeah so let me turn around and I
can<00:04:45.600> feel<00:04:45.900> my<00:04:46.050> hair<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.350> recording<00:04:46.920> because

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
can feel my hair is recording because

00:04:47.130 --> 00:05:01.969 
can feel my hair is recording because
the<00:04:47.580> ends<00:04:48.030> are<00:04:48.150> starting<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:49.800> catch

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.710 

looks<00:05:02.979> like<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:03.310> looks<00:05:03.790> like<00:05:04.030> that<00:05:04.090> looks

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
looks like that looks like that looks

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:13.519 
looks like that looks like that looks
like<00:05:05.020> ad

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:13.529 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:23.199 

and<00:05:13.969> this<00:05:14.969> is<00:05:15.119> my<00:05:15.299> little<00:05:15.479> tail<00:05:19.639> there<00:05:20.639> I

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:23.209 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:27.709 

imagine<00:05:24.209> I'll<00:05:24.419> probably<00:05:24.919> need<00:05:25.919> to<00:05:25.979> cut<00:05:26.939> up<00:05:27.239> to

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
imagine I'll probably need to cut up to

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.599 
imagine I'll probably need to cut up to
this<00:05:28.469> level<00:05:28.769> here<00:05:29.309> at<00:05:29.549> least<00:05:31.189> it's<00:05:32.189> not<00:05:32.219> really

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:32.609 
this level here at least it's not really

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:37.669 
this level here at least it's not really
much<00:05:32.819> underneath<00:05:33.269> here<00:05:36.109> it's<00:05:37.109> probably<00:05:37.499> less

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:37.679 
much underneath here it's probably less

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:40.549 
much underneath here it's probably less
than<00:05:37.889> four<00:05:38.159> inches<00:05:38.329> so<00:05:39.329> cut<00:05:39.659> around<00:05:39.869> the<00:05:40.169> level

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:40.559 
than four inches so cut around the level

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:47.629 
than four inches so cut around the level
of<00:05:40.769> the<00:05:41.689> bra<00:05:42.689> strap<00:05:43.109> and<00:05:44.329> then<00:05:45.559> take<00:05:46.559> off<00:05:46.769> just

section I don't see anything but I can

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:13.929 
section I don't see anything but I can
definitely<00:06:11.699> see<00:06:12.329> some<00:06:12.659> single<00:06:13.379> strand<00:06:13.649> knots

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:13.939

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:17.519 
and that comes with the territory I

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:19.549 
and that comes with the territory I
guess<00:06:18.389> I'm<00:06:18.539> at<00:06:18.689> the<00:06:18.809> point<00:06:19.019> right<00:06:19.199> now<00:06:19.349> where

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:19.559 
guess I'm at the point right now where

I do my own hair I'm noticing the differ

I do my own hair I'm noticing the differ
plus<00:07:27.230> i'm<00:07:27.470> familiar<00:07:27.650> with<00:07:27.950> my<00:07:28.220> own<00:07:28.400> curl

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
plus i'm familiar with my own curl

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.960 
plus i'm familiar with my own curl
pattern<00:07:29.510> but<00:07:30.250> when<00:07:31.250> my<00:07:31.430> hair<00:07:31.669> was<00:07:31.700> wet<00:07:32.150> I<00:07:32.740> I

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970 
pattern but when my hair was wet I I

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.400 
pattern but when my hair was wet I I
figured<00:07:34.970> that<00:07:35.150> to<00:07:35.450> other<00:07:35.630> people<00:07:35.750> they<00:07:36.230> would

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.410 
figured that to other people they would

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.900 
figured that to other people they would
not<00:07:36.620> be<00:07:36.800> able<00:07:36.889> to<00:07:37.160> tell<00:07:37.430> that<00:07:37.460> I've<00:07:37.700> done

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:37.910 
not be able to tell that I've done

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.570 
not be able to tell that I've done
something<00:07:38.389> to<00:07:38.510> my<00:07:38.690> hair<00:07:39.010> but<00:07:40.090> you<00:07:41.090> know

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
something to my hair but you know

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.010 
something to my hair but you know
hopefully<00:07:43.580> it<00:07:44.030> will<00:07:44.150> give<00:07:44.330> me<00:07:44.480> the<00:07:44.510> result

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.020 
hopefully it will give me the result

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.580 
hopefully it will give me the result
that<00:07:45.169> I<00:07:45.200> want<00:07:45.560> which<00:07:45.889> is<00:07:45.919> less<00:07:46.430> reversion<00:07:47.210> or

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.590 
that I want which is less reversion or

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.740 
that I want which is less reversion or
at<00:07:48.590> least<00:07:48.889> my<00:07:49.850> hair<00:07:50.060> will<00:07:50.180> take<00:07:50.389> a<00:07:50.419> little<00:07:50.600> bit

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:50.750 
at least my hair will take a little bit

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.580 
at least my hair will take a little bit
longer<00:07:51.139> to<00:07:51.470> revert<00:07:51.830> and<00:07:52.389> that<00:07:53.389> way<00:07:53.840> it<00:07:54.320> won't

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.590 
longer to revert and that way it won't

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.420 
longer to revert and that way it won't
tangle<00:07:55.220> as<00:07:55.550> much<00:07:55.820> and<00:07:56.169> also<00:07:57.169> when<00:07:58.010> I<00:07:58.040> wash<00:07:58.400> it

that<00:07:59.300> it<00:07:59.479> doesn't<00:07:59.930> tangle<00:08:00.139> as<00:08:00.500> much<00:08:01.100> in<00:08:01.430> the

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:01.490 
that it doesn't tangle as much in the

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.280 
that it doesn't tangle as much in the
shower<00:08:02.169> and<00:08:03.250> I<00:08:04.450> life<00:08:05.450> I've<00:08:05.660> missed<00:08:05.930> anything
