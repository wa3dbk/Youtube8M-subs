00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
just minor differences in between this

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.740 
just minor differences in between this
version<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.369> modern<00:00:29.939> warfare<00:00:30.000> 2<00:00:30.359> version

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.330 
version and the modern warfare 2 version
I<00:00:30.900> notice<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> opening<00:00:31.859> route<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.219> he

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I notice the opening route here he

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.650 
I notice the opening route here he
doesn't<00:00:32.640> go<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> way<00:00:33.000> up<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> green

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
doesn't go all the way up to the green

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.979 
doesn't go all the way up to the green
car<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.739> he<00:00:34.860> does<00:00:35.149> go<00:00:36.149> towards<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> same

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
car but he does go towards the same

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.930 
car but he does go towards the same
direction<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.370> know<00:00:38.460> towards<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
direction and then you know towards the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.580 
direction and then you know towards the
edge<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> map<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.629> typical<00:00:40.260> seananners

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
edge of the map in typical seananners

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.930 
edge of the map in typical seananners
fashion<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.160> notice<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.430> he<00:00:41.520> didn't<00:00:41.850> go

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
fashion but notice how he didn't go

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
fashion but notice how he didn't go
directly<00:00:42.450> through<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> doorway<00:00:42.989> there<00:00:43.260> just

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
directly through the doorway there just

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.810 
directly through the doorway there just
in<00:00:43.649> case<00:00:43.710> people<00:00:44.100> were<00:00:44.160> aiming<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
in case people were aiming down the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.910 
in case people were aiming down the
hallway<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:45.899> made<00:00:46.079> sure<00:00:46.289> he<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.469> behind<00:00:46.800> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
hallway he made sure he was behind that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.529 
hallway he made sure he was behind that
blockade<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.610> case<00:00:47.760> he<00:00:47.879> needed<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.329> cover

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
blockade in case he needed to get cover

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.959 
blockade in case he needed to get cover
so<00:00:48.809> he<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.800> able<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.160> sneak<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.489> behind<00:00:50.550> them

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so he was able to sneak up behind them

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
so he was able to sneak up behind them
using<00:00:51.329> his<00:00:51.510> headset<00:00:51.930> hearing<00:00:52.530> where<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> gun

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.830 
using his headset hearing where the gun
shots<00:00:53.190> were<00:00:53.370> coming<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.000> looking<00:00:54.719> at

here which he does for a second and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.710 
here which he does for a second and
pulls<00:01:43.110> off<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> kill<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.710> two<00:01:43.909> or<00:01:44.909> go<00:01:45.180> left<00:01:45.570> down

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
pulls off a kill or two or go left down

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.100 
pulls off a kill or two or go left down
that<00:01:46.549> down<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> alleyway<00:01:48.090> over<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
that down the alleyway over here and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.580 
that down the alleyway over here and
this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.890> another<00:01:50.159> another<00:01:50.759> interesting

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
this is another another interesting

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.780 
this is another another interesting
point<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.860> should<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.340> should<00:01:53.460> make

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
point that I should I should make

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.859 
point that I should I should make
whenever<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.299> confronted<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
whenever you're confronted with a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.260 
whenever you're confronted with a
grenade<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:56.130> prone<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> try<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
grenade like this go prone and try and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.090 
grenade like this go prone and try and
get<00:01:57.780> some<00:01:57.930> cover<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.259> between<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
get some cover in between you and the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.039 
get some cover in between you and the
grenade<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.880> know<00:01:59.969> he<00:02:00.119> probably<00:02:00.420> didn't<00:02:00.960> know

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
grenade you know he probably didn't know

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
grenade you know he probably didn't know
exactly<00:02:01.409> where<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.799> grenade<00:02:02.189> landed<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.759> mean

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
exactly where that grenade landed I mean

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.190 
exactly where that grenade landed I mean
it<00:02:03.119> kind<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> looked<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> went<00:02:03.960> into

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it kind of looked like it went into

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.899 
it kind of looked like it went into
those<00:02:04.350> flower<00:02:04.619> baskets<00:02:05.070> behind<00:02:05.399> him<00:02:05.549> but

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
those flower baskets behind him but

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.240 
those flower baskets behind him but
going<00:02:06.780> prone<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.290> almost<00:02:07.530> always<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.099> best

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
going prone is almost always the best

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.650 
going prone is almost always the best
maneuver<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.970> take<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.390> trying

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
maneuver that you can take when trying

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.750 
maneuver that you can take when trying
to<00:02:09.780> avoid<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.050> grenade<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:11.129> let's<00:02:11.340> rewind<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to avoid a grenade so let's rewind and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
to avoid a grenade so let's rewind and
talk<00:02:11.940> about<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.300> last<00:02:12.510> kill<00:02:12.810> you'll<00:02:13.170> see<00:02:13.290> he

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
talk about that last kill you'll see he

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.020 
talk about that last kill you'll see he
drops<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.890> enemy<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> last<00:02:14.550> stand<00:02:14.820> but

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
drops the enemy in the last stand but

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.240 
drops the enemy in the last stand but
instead<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.630> putting<00:02:15.900> himself<00:02:16.050> at<00:02:16.410> risk<00:02:16.470> he

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
instead of putting himself at risk he

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.830 
instead of putting himself at risk he
ducks<00:02:17.490> behind<00:02:17.640> cover<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.300> switches<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.750> his

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
ducks behind cover and switches to his

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.810 
ducks behind cover and switches to his
secondary<00:02:19.320> this<00:02:19.680> disorients<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> enemy<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
secondary this disorients the enemy and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.400 
secondary this disorients the enemy and
allows<00:02:21.090> him<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.300> regroup<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.990> minimal

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
allows him to regroup with minimal

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.260 
allows him to regroup with minimal
chance<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.830> dying<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.310> then<00:02:23.820> here<00:02:23.970> he<00:02:24.120> can

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
chance of dying and then here he can

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.230 
chance of dying and then here he can
reload<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.750> continue<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.880> one<00:02:27.060> thing<00:02:27.180> that

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
reload and continue on so one thing that

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.630 
reload and continue on so one thing that
you'll<00:02:27.480> see<00:02:27.600> him<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> lot<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:29.340> know<00:02:29.460> go

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you'll see him do a lot is you know go

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.210 
you'll see him do a lot is you know go
into<00:02:29.670> cover<00:02:30.120> duck<00:02:31.020> down<00:02:31.170> call<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.950> an<00:02:32.070> air

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
into cover duck down call in an air

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.780 
into cover duck down call in an air
strike<00:02:32.250> or<00:02:32.760> air<00:02:32.880> support<00:02:33.330> reload<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> gun<00:02:34.500> and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
strike or air support reload the gun and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.980 
strike or air support reload the gun and
which<00:02:35.790> he<00:02:35.910> does<00:02:36.090> right<00:02:36.300> here<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.630> then<00:02:36.870> he

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
which he does right here and then he

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.050 
which he does right here and then he
goes<00:02:37.140> right<00:02:37.350> back<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.590> finding<00:02:38.430> cover<00:02:38.670> to

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
goes right back to finding cover to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460 
goes right back to finding cover to
flank<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.630> enemy<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.990> shoot<00:02:40.200> them<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
flank the enemy and shoot them in the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.400 
flank the enemy and shoot them in the
back<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.300> gets<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.450> guy<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:42.810> unfortunately

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
back and gets this guy but unfortunately

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.650 
back and gets this guy but unfortunately
doesn't<00:02:43.620> expect<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.340> guy<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.090> be<00:02:45.270> sneaking

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
doesn't expect this guy to be sneaking

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.410 
doesn't expect this guy to be sneaking
up<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.900> him<00:02:45.959> with<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> knife<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:47.239> horrible<00:02:48.239> aim

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
up on him with a knife and horrible aim

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.990 
up on him with a knife and horrible aim
so<00:02:49.290> here<00:02:49.500> he<00:02:49.620> responds<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.459> immediately

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
so here he responds and immediately

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.910 
so here he responds and immediately
falls<00:02:51.270> into<00:02:51.450> his<00:02:51.780> routine<00:02:51.989> tactic<00:02:52.800> of

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
falls into his routine tactic of

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.770 
falls into his routine tactic of
scanning<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.700> perimeter<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.330> map<00:02:54.540> and

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
scanning the perimeter of the map and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.020 
scanning the perimeter of the map and
this<00:02:55.560> works<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.190> seananners<00:02:56.489> not<00:02:56.790> only

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
this works for seananners not only

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.210 
this works for seananners not only
because<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.390> his<00:02:57.720> low<00:02:57.989> sensitivity<00:02:58.380> but

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
because of his low sensitivity but

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.560 
because of his low sensitivity but
because<00:02:59.580> when<00:02:59.820> you're<00:02:59.970> along<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.300> edge<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
because when you're along the edge of

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.420 
because when you're along the edge of
the<00:03:00.690> map<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.590> know<00:03:01.709> you're<00:03:01.860> always<00:03:01.980> covered

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the map you know you're always covered

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.070 
the map you know you're always covered
on<00:03:02.520> at<00:03:02.670> least<00:03:02.820> one<00:03:02.970> side<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.450> your<00:03:03.600> body<00:03:03.780> and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
on at least one side of your body and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.890 
on at least one side of your body and
you<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:04.709> simply<00:03:04.860> shoot<00:03:05.220> inward<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.900> keeping

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
you can simply shoot inward and keeping

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.600 
you can simply shoot inward and keeping
your<00:03:06.989> sensitivity<00:03:07.560> low<00:03:07.709> while<00:03:08.130> doing<00:03:08.340> this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
your sensitivity low while doing this

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.790 
your sensitivity low while doing this
helps<00:03:08.850> keep<00:03:09.180> your<00:03:09.330> aim<00:03:09.540> steadier<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
helps keep your aim steadier and the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.770 
helps keep your aim steadier and the
result<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.340> higher<00:03:11.520> accuracy<00:03:11.910> I've<00:03:12.510> actually

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
result is higher accuracy I've actually

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.570 
result is higher accuracy I've actually
recently<00:03:13.200> lowered<00:03:13.590> my<00:03:13.770> sensitivity<00:03:14.220> from

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
recently lowered my sensitivity from

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.190 
recently lowered my sensitivity from
five<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.910> three<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.360> have<00:03:15.600> been<00:03:15.750> practicing

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
five to three and have been practicing
