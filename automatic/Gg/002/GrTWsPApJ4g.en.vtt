00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
image is going at ways now on my carbon

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.039 
image is going at ways now on my carbon
sheet<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:21.580> my<00:02:21.700> thermal<00:02:22.090> sheet<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.600> image<00:02:22.900> is

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
sheet for my thermal sheet the image is

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.729 
sheet for my thermal sheet the image is
going<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.650> way<00:02:23.829> as<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.640> could<00:02:24.910> see<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.620> it

paper in a tray and another issue is

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.009 
paper in a tray and another issue is
right<00:03:18.310> behind<00:03:18.549> here<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:20.760> wheel<00:03:21.989> with<00:03:22.989> a

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
right behind here is a wheel with a

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.470 
right behind here is a wheel with a
rubber<00:03:23.350> tire<00:03:23.680> here<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.519> rubber<00:03:24.760> tire<00:03:25.000> here

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
rubber tire here and a rubber tire here

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.840 
rubber tire here and a rubber tire here
now<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.230> only<00:03:26.410> modification<00:03:26.799> I<00:03:27.280> did<00:03:27.519> was

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
now the only modification I did was

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.610 
now the only modification I did was
these<00:03:28.299> rubber<00:03:28.660> tires<00:03:29.049> have

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
these rubber tires have

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.110 
these rubber tires have
treads<00:03:29.830> on<00:03:30.010> them<00:03:30.159> just<00:03:30.340> like<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.580> tire<00:03:30.849> that's

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
treads on them just like a tire that's

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.930 
treads on them just like a tire that's
why<00:03:31.269> I<00:03:31.330> call<00:03:31.569> them<00:03:31.750> try<00:03:32.069> tires<00:03:33.069> but<00:03:33.819> they're

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
why I call them try tires but they're

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.119 
why I call them try tires but they're
actually<00:03:34.090> feed<00:03:34.810> bands<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.920> want<00:03:36.069> to

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
actually feed bands so you want to

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.460 
actually feed bands so you want to
reverse<00:03:36.640> those<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.330> they're<00:03:37.480> flat<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.349> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
reverse those so they're flat so the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.440 
reverse those so they're flat so the
treads<00:03:38.739> are<00:03:38.860> actually<00:03:39.129> showing<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:40.060> the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
treads are actually showing on the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.600 
treads are actually showing on the
inside<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.470> looks<00:03:41.650> like<00:03:41.830> fat<00:03:42.129> flat

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
inside and it just looks like fat flat

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.059 
inside and it just looks like fat flat
rubber<00:03:42.909> bands<00:03:43.319> that'll<00:03:44.319> give<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.590> lot
