mean<00:04:29.400> this<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.730> real<00:04:30.030> important<00:04:30.570> thing<00:04:30.720> we

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
mean this is a real important thing we

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.840 
mean this is a real important thing we
had<00:04:31.110> millions<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.250> billions<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.550> dollars

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
had millions and billions of dollars

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.910 
had millions and billions of dollars
with<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.090> cars<00:04:33.420> in<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:34.140> lower<00:04:34.290> garage<00:04:34.500> and

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
with the cars in the lower garage and

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.310 
with the cars in the lower garage and
they<00:04:35.190> must<00:04:35.400> be<00:04:35.550> protected<00:04:35.850> at<00:04:36.240> all<00:04:36.390> costs<00:04:36.750> and

they must be protected at all costs and

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.990 
they must be protected at all costs and
hence<00:04:37.680> that's<00:04:37.950> how<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.160> did<00:04:38.370> all<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.670> the

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
span so I didn't want to ever have a

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.850 
span so I didn't want to ever have a
case<00:05:42.699> where<00:05:43.150> a<00:05:43.180> car<00:05:43.569> would<00:05:43.810> hit<00:05:44.050> a<00:05:44.080> pillar<00:05:44.440> sure
