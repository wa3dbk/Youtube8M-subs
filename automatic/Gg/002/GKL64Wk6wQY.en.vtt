gonna give you a neat little trick today
though<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.520> change<00:00:32.790> your<00:00:32.969> writing<00:00:33.329> I'm

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
though they can change your writing I'm

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.760 
though they can change your writing I'm
going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> show<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.170> how<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.440> fine<00:00:34.739> tune

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
going to show you how you can fine tune

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950 
going to show you how you can fine tune
the<00:00:35.160> rails<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.579> tonot<00:00:36.059> kite<00:00:36.239> board<00:00:36.480> with

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the rails of your tonot kite board with

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
the rails of your tonot kite board with
just<00:00:36.989> some<00:00:37.380> sandpaper<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.730> block<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.120> wood

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
just some sandpaper and a block of wood

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.420 
just some sandpaper and a block of wood
our<00:00:39.510> rails<00:00:39.840> are<00:00:40.079> extremely<00:00:40.770> important<00:00:41.160> part

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
our rails are extremely important part

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.360 
our rails are extremely important part
of<00:00:41.660> most<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:42.930> designs<00:00:43.350> basically<00:00:44.160> it's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
of most of all designs basically it's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.990 
of most of all designs basically it's
the<00:00:44.670> area<00:00:45.510> where<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> water<00:00:46.579> separates<00:00:47.579> from

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the area where the water separates from

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.080 
the area where the water separates from
the<00:00:48.120> board<00:00:48.660> servants<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.610> control<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> lot

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the board servants you can control a lot

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.410 
the board servants you can control a lot
by<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.989> water<00:00:52.260> ease<00:00:52.530> takes<00:00:53.280> place<00:00:53.610> we

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
by how that water ease takes place we

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
by how that water ease takes place we
seem<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.719> pay<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> attention<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
seem to pay a lot of attention to it and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
seem to pay a lot of attention to it and
the<00:00:56.550> circuit<00:00:57.059> board<00:00:57.239> will<00:00:57.480> appreciate<00:00:58.320> its

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the circuit board will appreciate its

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.950 
the circuit board will appreciate its
support<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> high<00:01:00.180> point<00:01:00.539> well<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
support but in the high point well it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
support but in the high point well it
just<00:01:00.989> seems<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.559> overlooked<00:01:01.890> quite<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> bit

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
just seems to be overlooked quite a bit

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969 
just seems to be overlooked quite a bit
the<00:01:02.789> same<00:01:03.000> principles<00:01:03.660> hold<00:01:03.870> true<00:01:04.199> though<00:01:04.439> for

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the same principles hold true though for

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.100 
the same principles hold true though for
the<00:01:05.129> type<00:01:05.339> 1<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> doesn't<00:01:06.090> super<00:01:06.659> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the type 1 as it doesn't super so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.219 
the type 1 as it doesn't super so
basically<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.420> straight<00:01:09.990> edge

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
basically if you have a straight edge

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
basically if you have a straight edge
you<00:01:11.360> know<00:01:12.560> whatever<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> release<00:01:14.369> off<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you know whatever kind of release off of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.510 
you know whatever kind of release off of
it<00:01:15.200> straight<00:01:16.200> away<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.130> early

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it straight away so you have early

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.780 
it straight away so you have early
separation<00:01:18.030> between<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> board<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
separation between the board and the

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.550 
separation between the board and the
water<00:01:22.100> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:24.299> rounded<00:01:24.750> edge<00:01:24.900> we

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
water if you have a more rounded edge we

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
water if you have a more rounded edge we
can<00:01:25.740> control<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.060> water<00:01:27.270> wraps<00:01:28.159> up<00:01:29.159> over

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
can control how that water wraps up over

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.149 
can control how that water wraps up over
the<00:01:30.210> edge<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> board<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.320> they're

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
water is quite pronounced makes it very

slippery they are so for real you can
you<00:02:04.729> can<00:02:04.850> see<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.600> softness<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.409> rail<00:02:06.679> and

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
you can see the softness of the rail and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.339 
you can see the softness of the rail and
it's<00:02:07.490> more<00:02:08.030> pronounced<00:02:08.720> on<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.929> circuit<00:02:09.319> board

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
it's more pronounced on a circuit board

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.830 
it's more pronounced on a circuit board

our ribs so thick it's a couple of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.650 
our ribs so thick it's a couple of
reasons<00:02:29.150> really

reasons really

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.900

really<00:04:25.760> felt<00:04:26.030> because<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.330> all<00:04:26.570> channels<00:04:26.960> and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
really felt because of all channels and

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.110 
really felt because of all channels and
the<00:04:27.320> ability<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:28.400> really<00:04:28.610> grab<00:04:28.850> one<00:04:29.030> of

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
the ability to to really grab one of

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.880 
the ability to to really grab one of
those<00:04:29.270> channels<00:04:29.570> we<00:04:30.110> wanted<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.530> ability<00:04:30.650> to

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
those channels we wanted the ability to

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.980 
those channels we wanted the ability to
have<00:04:31.070> any<00:04:31.250> more<00:04:31.520> rounded<00:04:32.090> rail<00:04:32.330> should<00:04:32.870> the

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
have any more rounded rail should the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.050 
have any more rounded rail should the
right<00:04:33.170> and<00:04:33.380> desire<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:33.800> sort<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.310> right<00:04:34.550> so

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
right and desire that sort of right so

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.880 
right and desire that sort of right so
he<00:04:35.180> got<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.510> red<00:04:35.660> sticker<00:04:35.870> with<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.350> puck<00:04:36.650> and

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
he got the red sticker with the puck and

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.450 
he got the red sticker with the puck and
on<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.400> flow<00:04:37.640> the<00:04:38.540> cloth<00:04:38.780> generally<00:04:39.500> has<00:04:40.160> more

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
on the flow the cloth generally has more

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.970 
on the flow the cloth generally has more
pull<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.240> more<00:04:41.510> groundwater<00:04:42.470> because<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.919> the

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
pull and more groundwater because of the

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.830 
pull and more groundwater because of the
channels<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:43.790> we<00:04:43.910> thought<00:04:44.090> they<00:04:44.270> saw<00:04:44.510> in<00:04:44.750> the

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
channels so we thought they saw in the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.690 
channels so we thought they saw in the
real<00:04:44.990> small<00:04:45.320> we<00:04:45.710> can<00:04:45.860> really<00:04:46.040> balance<00:04:46.250> right

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
real small we can really balance right

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.700 
real small we can really balance right
on<00:04:46.760> well<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.600> fluid<00:04:47.960> in<00:04:48.050> general<00:04:48.500> was<00:04:48.680> a

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
on well the fluid in general was a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.730 
on well the fluid in general was a
smoother<00:04:49.460> way<00:04:49.610> anymore<00:04:49.880> so<00:04:50.720> we<00:04:51.290> need<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.620> go

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
smoother way anymore so we need to go

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.710 
smoother way anymore so we need to go
sniff<00:04:52.070> of<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.310> rails<00:04:52.490> where<00:04:52.940> we<00:04:53.030> just<00:04:53.180> rotated

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
sniff of the rails where we just rotated

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.220 
sniff of the rails where we just rotated
and

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
and

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.020 
and
it<00:04:54.590> defines<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.640> right<00:04:57.670> so<00:04:58.670> start<00:04:58.970> off

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
it defines you the right so start off

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.500 
it defines you the right so start off
making<00:04:59.330> smooth<00:05:00.320> long<00:05:01.010> strokes<00:05:01.610> don't<00:05:02.060> stay<00:05:02.420> in

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
one area for too long so the longer the

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.880 
one area for too long so the longer the
stroke<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.390> less<00:05:05.690> chance<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:06.350> you<00:05:06.770> getting

feature of ability of thank you the
rails<00:05:30.140> if<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:30.920> use<00:05:31.130> bindings<00:05:31.640> you<00:05:32.240> could

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
rails if you use bindings you could

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.680 
rails if you use bindings you could
possibly<00:05:33.200> just<00:05:33.620> fine-tune<00:05:34.610> one<00:05:34.940> rail<00:05:35.180> for

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
possibly just fine-tune one rail for

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.100 
possibly just fine-tune one rail for
choppy<00:05:36.500> conditions<00:05:37.030> lead<00:05:38.030> one<00:05:38.330> rail<00:05:38.600> fairly

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
choppy conditions lead one rail fairly

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.190 
choppy conditions lead one rail fairly
sharp<00:05:39.470> so<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:39.710> run<00:05:40.040> off<00:05:40.280> one<00:05:40.610> side<00:05:40.970> I<00:05:41.330> believe

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
sharp so you run off one side I believe

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.250 
sharp so you run off one side I believe
it's<00:05:42.410> a<00:05:42.620> very<00:05:42.940> sharp<00:05:43.940> give<00:05:44.720> you<00:05:44.840> smoother

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
it's a very sharp give you smoother

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.170 
it's a very sharp give you smoother
conditions<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:46.130> you<00:05:46.460> can<00:05:46.610> then<00:05:46.820> switch<00:05:47.060> your

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
conditions and you can then switch your

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.320 
conditions and you can then switch your
wagons<00:05:47.810> around<00:05:48.430> what<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.640> section<00:05:50.120> of<00:05:50.240> the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
wagons around what you section of the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.870 
wagons around what you section of the
you'll<00:05:50.450> say<00:05:50.720> so<00:05:51.260> basically<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:51.830> have<00:05:52.160> options

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
you'll say so basically you have options

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.520 
you'll say so basically you have options
of<00:05:52.970> two<00:05:53.090> different<00:05:53.330> boards<00:05:53.660> play<00:05:54.290> with<00:05:54.440> an

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
of two different boards play with an

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.770 
of two different boards play with an
experiment<00:05:55.100> with<00:05:55.220> it<00:05:55.340> trying<00:05:56.180> different<00:05:56.420> uh

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
experiment with it trying different uh

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.230 
experiment with it trying different uh
riff<00:05:57.230> configurations<00:05:57.950> on<00:05:58.100> one<00:05:58.280> side<00:05:58.550> first<00:05:58.910> if

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
riff configurations on one side first if

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.700 
riff configurations on one side first if
you<00:05:59.450> like<00:05:59.600> it<00:05:59.810> you<00:05:59.990> could<00:06:00.080> reduce<00:06:00.380> it<00:06:00.560> on<00:06:00.650> the

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
you like it you could reduce it on the

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.520 
you like it you could reduce it on the
other<00:06:00.800> side<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:02.210> know<00:06:02.240> -<00:06:02.720> same<00:06:02.990> way<00:06:03.170> and<00:06:03.380> maybe

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
other side you know - same way and maybe

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.140 
other side you know - same way and maybe
they<00:06:03.770> want<00:06:03.980> more<00:06:04.220> bikes<00:06:04.520> you<00:06:04.760> really<00:06:05.030> could

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
they want more bikes you really could

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.240 
they want more bikes you really could
shop<00:06:05.390> on<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.720> toe<00:06:05.900> side<00:06:06.140> he'll<00:06:06.680> say<00:06:06.950> a<00:06:06.980> little

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
shop on the toe side he'll say a little

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.430 
shop on the toe side he'll say a little
bit<00:06:07.400> rounder<00:06:07.880> his<00:06:08.270> lots<00:06:08.570> of<00:06:08.690> variations<00:06:09.230> and

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
bit rounder his lots of variations and

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.620 
bit rounder his lots of variations and
basically<00:06:09.860> it's<00:06:10.370> all<00:06:10.640> your<00:06:10.820> personal<00:06:11.240> choice

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
basically it's all your personal choice

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.440 
basically it's all your personal choice
what<00:06:12.410> you<00:06:12.440> think<00:06:13.070> will<00:06:13.460> make<00:06:13.640> your<00:06:13.910> boy<00:06:14.090> bright

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
what you think will make your boy bright

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.390 
what you think will make your boy bright
the<00:06:14.600> best

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400

as<00:06:34.040> you<00:06:34.370> see<00:06:34.640> we've<00:06:35.240> decided<00:06:35.630> into<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.140> aspect

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
as you see we've decided into the aspect

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.279 
as you see we've decided into the aspect
of<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.830> board<00:06:37.070> where<00:06:37.580> Daniel

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
of the board where Daniel

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.529 
of the board where Daniel
fine-tune<00:06:38.830> those<00:06:39.279> wheels<00:06:39.580> to<00:06:40.029> get<00:06:40.180> that<00:06:40.389> is

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
fine-tune those wheels to get that is

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.139 
fine-tune those wheels to get that is
that<00:06:40.749> right<00:06:41.050> you<00:06:41.529> like<00:06:41.740> so<00:06:42.129> basically<00:06:42.279> all<00:06:42.759> the
