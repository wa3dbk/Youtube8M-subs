 to the homonymous book from which it is taken 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.510

 how many years have you done artyom is our protagonist 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.540
 a young nuclear place living in the subway fly state 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.940
 twenty years in the future

 subway stations reconverted the outpost the journey itself 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.230
 it's hard for people to die and homeless fellow travelers from the past to come 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.770
 turbulent accounts pending but all in all bonton 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.390
 you move among the tunnels you shoot little but when you do it to survive 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.230
 you make some encounters finally go out into the visible fly 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.890
 only for short periods and equipped with a mask so as not to remain contaminated 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:33.259
 the first hour and a half of atypical 2033 meter 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.259
 really beautiful sidebar of traits 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.739
 the next hour continues on the same line 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.180
 alternating firefights with those that can hardly be defined 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.459
 how sprawl action being extremely linear without substantial possibilities 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.260
 of choice 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.669
 rather as a sort of interactive narrative 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.859
 the almost due to the presence on screen of a character controlled by di

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.049
 effective scripting 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.130
 when it comes to handgun shooting 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.330
 the work done by the developers abortion at the questioning of the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.730
 normal superiority of the user with respect to decreasing opponents 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.430
 these last number but almost it was a survival horror

 giving them a few shots to shoot when facing non-human abersee 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.580
 not taking the presence of the knife as a last hope unrealistic 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.230
 there are however some passages on which there is still work to be done 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.430
 or that in any case will have to show an evolution during the adventure 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.969
 in particular level design that in its substantial simplicity convinces 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.159
 when under the ground but it seemed - characterized on the outside with i 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.359
 passages between the ruins of the boxes alternating with and corridors of luck 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.639
 decidedly uninspired

 they are extremely simple but the sensation of physicality rendered by weapons 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.980
 and it's heavy movements. right not to represent in itself a value

 also added to play 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.200
 but they marry with the will to increase their lives to the maximum 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.479
 very good sound that will accompany a visual compartment of 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.460

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.050
 on PC it was guaranteed by a truly exceptional lighting with multiple sources of 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.780
 light able to create convincing shadows and go hand in hand with 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.770
 of particle effects of the highest order

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.279
 quite clearly 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.059
 but it still makes no sense to give definitive judgments on a version that is not

 meter 2033 is expected for March 19 instead I pc and xbox 60 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.660
 there is still time for talking again in the coming weeks
