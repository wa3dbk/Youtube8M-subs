00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 the board of trustees spoke that special 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.850
 Walls believes team of your occurrence 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 is this live music like many of 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.050
 these orchestras there's still I 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.030
 white price is almost back 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.940
 very special that never cold here yet 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.550
 his own band operate well that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 is also the reason why I am here 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.449
 because I never met there 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.780
 and I just said okay I 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.520
 do it with and for myself I do 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.050
 Otherwise no appearances with strangers 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.470
 if on my own if you like yourself 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 Time 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.060
 I do not know where the boys are when they are 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.649
 of course we always play live 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.180
 everything was as yesterday as you were 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.030
 we played the reutlingers 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.090
 big concert and so on that was 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.610
 also the reason why i said okay so 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.110
 ambitious people back to your to 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.060
 you should just support 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.670
 He has a dream in front of him 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.250
 Young boy dreams of a big band 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 and she has too, and you should 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.880
 help but otherwise there is really 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.909
 not so much i have with me 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.700
 of course in bigband logically because 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.560
 I rock'n roll time yes with big 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.159
 Grown up in the basement 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.630
 and also my first tours at that time 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.390
 with big points did so with 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.520
 sue or 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.400
 what was up or with max greger and such 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.729
 because it was a different time then 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.740
 because it is almost me in the age of almost 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.080
 no musician was yes it is not like that 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.580
 today where you say okay we need one 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.090
 student band but no one is allowed over 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.740
 be ten years old then there is that yes 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.479
 I did not even have that time when I was with 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.950
 I did not go to the stage for 16 years 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.659
 Once his age found and had to 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.130
 really with me, I'll say it in 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.959
 quotes with the old gentlemen 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.739
 go to the stage what was with the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.230
 conny froboess 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.300
 Well that was no music no 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.550
 musician that was actress but we 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.130
 At the beginning of this I say I once 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.920
 as the music for the young people 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.760
 special music for the young people that 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.920
 was the rock'n'roll time 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.080
 was created or was invented 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.360
 we start the first two years the 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.890
 The only way you can do that today 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.890
 not imagine anymore but it was like this 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.320
 Jena 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.270
 7 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.780
 4 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.200
 the roundabouts 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.450
 Peter Kraus already has it now 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.460
 actually achieved pretty much everything 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.610
 made a great career 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.980
 What's left is it is too 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.780
 really watch this evening of life 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.570
 Enjoy and keep on with music always 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.220
 to be accompanied further 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.400
 it stays too much because my head is always 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.510
 the last tour is full 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.020
 how successful we made 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.020
 Have written 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.630
 I always do something new now 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.910
 In July, for example, there will be a feature film 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.000

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.540

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.580

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.910
 people would see me 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:25.090
