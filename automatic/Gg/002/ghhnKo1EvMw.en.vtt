00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.000 

that's<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.220> picture

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
that's the picture

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.470 
that's the picture
posts<00:02:18.010> are<00:02:18.099> pretty<00:02:18.310> cool<00:02:18.519> right<00:02:18.579> now<00:02:18.879> each

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
posts are pretty cool right now each

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.229 
posts are pretty cool right now each
post<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:20.079> limited<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.980> 400<00:02:21.459> characters<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
post is limited to 400 characters and

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.479 
post is limited to 400 characters and
pictures<00:02:23.079> for<00:02:23.319> now<00:02:23.439> but<00:02:23.680> eventually<00:02:23.829> we<00:02:24.340> know

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
pictures for now but eventually we know

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.720 
pictures for now but eventually we know
that<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.969> will<00:02:25.090> most<00:02:25.299> likely<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.629> expanding

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that that will most likely be expanding

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.580 
that that will most likely be expanding
hopefully<00:02:27.730> video<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.359> other<00:02:28.540> cool<00:02:29.200> different

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
hopefully video and other cool different

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.500 
hopefully video and other cool different
ideas<00:02:29.920> for<00:02:29.950> four<00:02:30.579> channels<00:02:30.909> to<00:02:31.030> be<00:02:31.180> able<00:02:31.390> to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
ideas for four channels to be able to

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.979 
ideas for four channels to be able to
share<00:02:31.689> content<00:02:33.180> when<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.269> have<00:02:34.389> your<00:02:34.569> channel

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
share content when you have your channel

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.420 
share content when you have your channel
you<00:02:35.139> can<00:02:35.260> actually<00:02:35.680> do<00:02:35.889> a<00:02:35.920> couple<00:02:36.250> more<00:02:36.370> things

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
you can actually do a couple more things

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.190 
you can actually do a couple more things
so<00:02:36.760> for<00:02:36.909> example<00:02:36.969> this<00:02:37.359> is<00:02:37.510> our<00:02:37.629> channel<00:02:38.049> we

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
so for example this is our channel we

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500 
so for example this is our channel we
have<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.859> good<00:02:39.069> chunk<00:02:39.519> of<00:02:39.670> subscribers<00:02:40.329> and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
have a good chunk of subscribers and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.170 
have a good chunk of subscribers and
stuff<00:02:40.719> and<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.230> lot<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.769> visits<00:02:42.189> we<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.459> three

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
stuff and a lot of visits we have three

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.929 
stuff and a lot of visits we have three
posts<00:02:43.540> up<00:02:43.659> which<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.109> can<00:02:45.090> add<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:47.189> and<00:02:48.189> as<00:02:48.849> you
