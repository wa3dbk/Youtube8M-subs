00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.180
 I am today 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.840
 Great now 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:15.640
 using 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.000
 I will introduce this terminal This is the terminal 8000 of the terminal main 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.419
 This is iphone 4 s 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.310
 Comparison Then Isshoma 5 inches Toshiyama is quite large as 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.310
 And thinness is surprisingly thin 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.950
 This is Oh 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.820
 Good 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:40.340
 Quite in hand because of along I think Naa there is Deato round of good 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:43.090
 It fits and says what I actually use with this 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.450
 Your terminal is 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 Because it is a type of dual sim Well sim card is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 Open the inside 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.970
 Two 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.800
 I 'm back home 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.810
 Another Kappo field game l 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.180
 Thing that supports 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.960
 In fact 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.960
 Because I could use Softbank 's sim in China 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.230
 I think this does not give information 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.360
 Low capacity 2000 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.890
 It is about 2000 because there are about 2000 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:29.450
 I will last a long time 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.450
 I use really well to look at the books and say that you are using what director's 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:41.880
 I often ride a train or bus, but at that time 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 I have read books on a 7- inch tablet until now 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.520
 I'm in China and it's China, it's so crowded, but if it 's crowded, I read it with one hand 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.430
 When 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.040
 It's dangerous and the swing is so intense 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:04.840
 It will not be stable if printing is a little, so I already bought it for viewing on a smartphone . 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.610
 After all, a little character's smartphone is too small even opening videos, no matter how high 4 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.770
 inch 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.840
 It is a liquid crystal about 3.7 inches 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.550
 It can be used to read letters 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.520
 I 'm in a hurry now and using it very usefully 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:27.060
 Not so expensive in this terminal age renovation 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.060
 Do you have a terminal? 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.630
 Because you can see the letters and so on 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.630
 In the same department is 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.530
 I do not know that it is all right 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.290
 Like this 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.970
 Deco character too 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.980
 I can read it temporarily 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:14.210
 It's pretty good I 've got a battery android 4.0 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.210
 So you have a good launcher too 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.830
 It is easy to adjust the light 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.630
 That's where this conclusion comes in handy 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.790
 ãƒ¼ 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:36.170
 ame 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.170
 I thought that you could see it in a pan but it looks a bit more beautiful 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.840
 I used Echishu or English 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.280
 It wo n't look beautiful when you get out 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.280
 Actually it is a little more beautiful 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.260
 It's been a while since I went to China 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.740
 Thickness is a little different 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.900
 Position of head button 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:12.129
 It is not a village thing which is different from something , but this is also a village thing 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:14.770
 Care when the like a fake of the fake is to buy because it seems that around and quite full 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.710
 But please put 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.750
 this 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.170
 The fake- looking guy already has the same price 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.190
 Honestly because it's kinda heavy and hot 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.660
 It is after ease of use was not such a good 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.610
 Tandemer 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.160
 This is not a brand as it is not originally a product of that firm car manufacturer with care 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.770
 Because it is a product 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.020
 Be careful as much as possible 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.020
 Recommended to be purchased 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:52.910
 If you feel like it, come to the shop and get in touch with me 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.000
 I would like to buy a purchase after being convinced 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.240
 think 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.880
 Part of the chanting on the floor 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:09.650
 To come to the shop to real because not displayed and this is a moving lantern 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.650
 Be Nde I think that those who they swollen because I am watching is no doubt 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:13.889
 Perhaps 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.139
 The law is stupid 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.159
 This ice tee is great at this price 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.159
 I think it's good 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.990
 that's all
