00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.430
 hello youtube friends today I bring you one 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.559
 news that 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.340
 it's amazing because I was 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.830
 waiting and today he has updated it 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.310
 the terminal how big 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.269
 donald the authorized 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.960
 last update of huawei which is the 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:30.630
 176 and it's in that version you can do 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 road and look how it has been 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.420
 change we have removed turn on more 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.410
 very fast and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.880
 we read that the orange logo is removed 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.400
 and he gets the huawei 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.400
 and now you will see how it is surrounded 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.590
 the water 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.590
 and change the changed interface 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.880
 I do not know anything else in this new 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.240
 update we have a new thing of 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.180
 and I say good forgiveness is that I'm a little 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.260
 excited for the new update 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.140
 Huawei in this update includes ai 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.850
 ai cloud that is like him 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:34.330
 the icloud and ios but of huawei that we 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.229
 allows you to save up to 160 gigabytes of 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:42.130
 storage and save copies of 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.120
 music security and so on 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.990
 and we are going to proceed 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.990
 the face 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.600
 the next day I will make a video about how 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.049
 the installation is done to me has 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.509
 cost a bit because I did not understand very 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.840
 well how was the system this 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.789
 terminal today I've rooted in others 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.090
 mobile like you are from the suns are 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.580
 those mobiles are easier to surround 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.690
 but this one had to be updated and today 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.660
 we are a bit distrustful 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.570
 but good here we have to give you 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.570
 root access to cpu master free 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.500
 here we have the control of the cpu 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.430
 is surrounded we can move the minimum 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:47.220
 we can slow down to leave it 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:50.090
 to a gears so that it does not consume much and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.620
 here we go configure the parameters 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.190
 and there we are going to do a see more if it is like that 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.700
 How do you say 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.319
 but let's change the speed 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.319
 how to put it to the fullest 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.770
 let's leave it in person 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.120
 well there goes before 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.459
 good as I was saying this next day of 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.790
 a tutorial on the installation of the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.960
 new update of huawei plus the 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.080
 root 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.480
 thanks to all the subscribers and for 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.390
 see the comment 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.650
 Sorry for watching the video and for commenting 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.650
 in the previous videos 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.980
 here we have 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.980
 elbert mange 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.900
 to see if now with the root we can 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.350
 optimize the ram 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:18.250
 and I've seen some comments on 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:21.459
 after the start said of the 393 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.980
 megas and has commented I do not remember what 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.910
 user and said what 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.569
 which of those 500 is distributed a memory 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.280
 that for the system pay the living 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:39.360
 and the other one for the user 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.600
 and I had forgotten that I have guessed right 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.160
 comment that and I give every reason to 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.169
 that user and thank you very much for 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.169
 correct and correct me 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.990
 good 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.910
 but what score does it come out of so 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.750
 I've seen myself in other videos on youtube 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.440
 about this terminal would go about 7000 of 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.440
 punctuation 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.550
 the atlantis 36 cps 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:46.550
 this terminal would not have hurt 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:48.170
 ep a month of about 230 205 adreno 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.710
 in the morning to go a little more 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.710
 fluid 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.730
 but he's pretty good at answering me 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.730
 is using it almost two weeks 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.320
 it was also a little bit with the ramp 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:12.080
 that I use many applications at once 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.080
 but otherwise responds fast 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.220
 good 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.920
 the speed of the headquarters card 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.610
 on my sd card is needed because 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.610
 a class gives 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:33.430
 if I update it 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.430
 I buy another one of better class again 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:47.740
 good one hundred percent 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.740
 with a score of 6 thousand 887 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.949
 we see that the 1091 gpu branch 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:04.810
 and to put the username 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.659
 it's more than good but we 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:11.440
 that interested him over there 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:15.550
 there are people who do it more 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.009
 I do not know why it is but I do not have much 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.689
 experience on android 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:26.259
 and nothing friends I say goodbye with this and the 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:28.449
 next day upload the video I said 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.820
 Thank you very much 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:33.210
 subscribe and comment 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.210
 goodbye
