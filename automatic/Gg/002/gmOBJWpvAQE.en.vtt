00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.690 
the spool bearings on your zillion
type-r<00:00:10.630> by<00:00:11.530> upgrading<00:00:12.009> the<00:00:12.129> bearings<00:00:12.519> to

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
type-r by upgrading the bearings to

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.400 
type-r by upgrading the bearings to
better<00:00:13.059> ceramic<00:00:13.599> bearings<00:00:13.809> you're<00:00:14.259> gonna

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
better ceramic bearings you're gonna

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.170 
better ceramic bearings you're gonna
have<00:00:14.559> them<00:00:14.709> they're<00:00:15.039> more<00:00:15.400> controlled<00:00:15.879> cast

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
to first prep the bearings so let's take

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:05.060 
to first prep the bearings so let's take
the<00:01:57.120> bearings<00:01:57.450> out<00:02:03.710> what<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:04.800> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.980> be

as you might get any contamination or
sediments<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.300> bearings<00:02:27.630> just<00:02:28.620> remove

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
sediments in the bearings just remove

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.160 
sediments in the bearings just remove
one<00:02:28.950> side<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.550> seal<00:02:29.760> put<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> drop<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.600> oil<00:02:30.810> in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
one side of seal put the drop of oil in

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.890 
one side of seal put the drop of oil in
and<00:02:31.380> then<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:32.940> put<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.330> seal<00:02:33.630> back

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and then you can now put the seal back

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.270 
and then you can now put the seal back
on

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.040 

they're<00:02:42.280> all<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> seals<00:02:43.270> are<00:02:43.450> off<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.870> then

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
they're all the seals are off and then

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.840 
they're all the seals are off and then
just<00:02:47.230> take<00:02:47.470> your<00:02:47.500> favorite<00:02:47.980> bearing<00:02:48.430> oil<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
just take your favorite bearing oil the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.730 
just take your favorite bearing oil the
one<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.180> like<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.480> use<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.290> Boca

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
one that I like to use is the Boca

can<00:03:10.180> run<00:03:10.330> these<00:03:10.480> bearings<00:03:10.840> dry<00:03:11.170> but<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.490> to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
can run these bearings dry but I like to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.550 
can run these bearings dry but I like to
put<00:03:12.850> some<00:03:13.060> oil<00:03:13.240> in<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:14.020> quiet<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.530> down

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
put some oil in it to quiet it down

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.380 
put some oil in it to quiet it down
otherwise<00:03:15.070> it's<00:03:15.400> gonna<00:03:15.520> be<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:16.000> really

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390

one on the side plate we're gonna do

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.110 
one on the side plate we're gonna do
this<00:04:02.400> one<00:04:02.640> first<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:05.280> change<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.610> bearing<00:04:05.970> on

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
this one first to change a bearing on

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.520 
this one first to change a bearing on
make<00:04:06.450> sure<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.720> get<00:04:07.260> your<00:04:07.409> a<00:04:07.440> small

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
make sure you get your a small

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.170 
make sure you get your a small
screwdriver<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.459> see<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.849> bearing

screwdriver you can see a bearing
retainer<00:04:09.299> on<00:04:09.750> here<00:04:10.110> make<00:04:10.620> sure<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.829> put<00:04:10.980> your

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
retainer on here make sure you put your

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.800 
retainer on here make sure you put your
finger<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.579> otherwise<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.360> retainers

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
finger on it otherwise the retainers

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.569 
finger on it otherwise the retainers
gonna<00:04:13.019> fly<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.590> trust<00:04:14.040> me<00:04:14.190> if<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.400> flies

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
gonna fly and trust me if it flies

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.569 
gonna fly and trust me if it flies
you'll<00:04:14.819> fly<00:04:15.030> really<00:04:15.269> really<00:04:15.750> far<00:04:16.130> just<00:04:17.130> put<00:04:17.459> on

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
you'll fly really really far just put on

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.060 
you'll fly really really far just put on
there<00:04:17.760> like<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:19.519> pop<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.669> out<00:04:21.740> once<00:04:22.740> it's<00:04:22.919> out

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
there like this pop it out once it's out

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.100 
there like this pop it out once it's out
you<00:04:23.310> can<00:04:23.400> just<00:04:23.580> remove<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.660> your<00:04:24.780> finger

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.500 

the<00:04:53.550> next<00:04:53.760> pairing<00:04:54.000> we're<00:04:54.210> going<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.420> be

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
the next pairing we're going to be

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.300 
the next pairing we're going to be
replacing<00:04:54.810> is<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.710> one<00:04:56.010> on<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.280> spool<00:04:57.230> now

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
replacing is a one on the spool now

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.280 
replacing is a one on the spool now

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
one in just like that and then to

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:58.689 
one in just like that and then to
install<00:05:50.680> just<00:05:51.680> pop<00:05:51.980> the<00:05:52.160> pin<00:05:52.550> back<00:05:52.760> in

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.480

not<00:06:02.699> gonna<00:06:02.909> clear<00:06:03.389> it<00:06:03.419> so<00:06:03.930> we<00:06:04.439> can't<00:06:04.649> use<00:06:04.860> the

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
not gonna clear it so we can't use the

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.129 
not gonna clear it so we can't use the
same<00:06:05.219> method<00:06:05.639> that<00:06:05.849> we<00:06:06.029> installed<00:06:06.509> to<00:06:06.809> put<00:06:07.020> the

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
same method that we installed to put the

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.829 
same method that we installed to put the
pin<00:06:07.409> back<00:06:07.439> in<00:06:08.059> what<00:06:09.059> we're<00:06:09.180> gonna<00:06:09.270> do<00:06:09.509> is<00:06:09.659> I'm

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:09.839 
pin back in what we're gonna do is I'm

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.359 
pin back in what we're gonna do is I'm
you're<00:06:10.080> gonna<00:06:10.199> see<00:06:10.439> there's<00:06:10.649> some<00:06:10.860> groove<00:06:11.189> on

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:11.369 
you're gonna see there's some groove on

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:15.189 
you're gonna see there's some groove on
the<00:06:11.490> side<00:06:11.520> here<00:06:12.499> we're<00:06:13.499> lined<00:06:13.770> a<00:06:13.949> small<00:06:14.520> groove

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
the side here we're lined a small groove

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.249 
the side here we're lined a small groove
with<00:06:16.199> the<00:06:16.229> end<00:06:16.830> that's<00:06:17.099> sticking<00:06:17.460> out<00:06:17.699> and

easy<00:06:26.699> to<00:06:26.999> see<00:06:27.270> this<00:06:27.479> but<00:06:29.300> we're<00:06:30.300> gonna<00:06:30.389> slide

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:30.899 
easy to see this but we're gonna slide

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:35.299 
easy to see this but we're gonna slide
the<00:06:31.139> pin<00:06:31.379> under<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:31.860> screw<00:06:32.430> here<00:06:32.909> and<00:06:34.309> just

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:35.309
