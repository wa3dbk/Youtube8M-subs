00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello I'm very musical style 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.900
 Welcome to a new video today 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.940
 is there again a camp strike who 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.969
 it would have thought we are at numero 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.390
 two of the kent state week arrived and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.380
 today there is a rimington r5 so is 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.840
 the weapon I think that's one 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.340
 rather oblique assault rifle that was 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.830
 not so bad the closing rate 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.330
 but has for the distance real 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.119
 pretty much off you could do that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.380
 weapon pretty well with the acs mb three 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.669
 maybe compare 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.690
 and I can actually get it to anyone 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.059
 I mean that's one 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.920
 standard came on rockten in 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.690
 freedom for all and yes it has 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.489
 actually nice but talk today 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 Let's talk about a topic that maybe 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.899
 but a little bit trivial is 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.640
 just for me is pretty important 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.530
 or I'm concerned because I know 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.719
 not if you realize maybe I have 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.829
 a little moment or so, but we 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.600
 look over a little bit today 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.300
 fatigue because just for gamers and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 also the people go to school to work 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.080
 or studying and especially the people 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.580
 At the same time, these are what are in 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 in a certain way applies to me 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.930
 maybe that is a central problem 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.689
 At least when people say I do 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.460
 you are a long sleeper and a bit 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.830
 problems with that we have for or 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.939
 to go to bed in time for me 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.439
 really have the feeling that I am in the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.570
 last time first, a little bit always 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.950
 goes to bed too late and then because of that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.570
 really little sleep meanwhile 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 it is with me even partially under the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 week so I mean with me it is on 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.700
 always weekend so I really 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.590
 by limp but am under the week 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.509
 I'm already so tired that I am 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.150
 always be able to start at noon and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.409
 then most of what happens in the video 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.250
 Be a bit later, I mean 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.540
 yes, at the moment 20 o'clock I believe and around the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.520
 time a little late to expire 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.140
 Of course, it's not just because of me 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.450
 I am tired that I do not like videos 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.700
 of course I have to do it right 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.610
 But I can feel the weariness 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.409
 not hide somehow and what also 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.390
 funny is how it is soon 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.469
 I will straighten soon I have that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.180
 already announced 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.680
 live streams will also be coming soon and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.579
 maybe someday a 24th 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.200
 hours of live streaming 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.650
 I have no idea if I will 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.390
 but will create 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.160
 That's another story 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.340
 During the week I go pretty much 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.630
 late when I mean I always go around like that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.100
 midnight actually penn and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.630
 I get up at 7 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.790
 if the next day to school 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.440
 I have to go that in the hours 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.240
 sleep that is actually I say so 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.550
 because I did not have one now 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.990
 I direct comparison I know my 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.840
 person I will not name any names 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.840
 but she is supposed to be in a wheelchair 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.850
 and do youtube videos and hated though 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.050
 the person, for example, is partial 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.640
 Always go through and out during school hours 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.800
 sometimes not at school 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.390
 actually I'm pretty blatant 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.890
 really some already the next day 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.320
 if I go to bed later 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.820
 I'm tired but I'm watching 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.330
 do not go to bed before 1 o'clock 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.650
 Of course then stupid and I want now 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.540
 not synonymous somehow so or so 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.590
 I do not know at the age of twelve or so 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.630
 he still stated in one 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.690
 promised here I always go around 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.459
 Sleep 20 or 21 o'clock and then the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.220
 others are so big on 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.780
 I was awake yesterday until midnight 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.239
 I'm the bar 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.489
 Did you actually know that barbie 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.080
 has become the keyword of the year 2013 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.300
 pretty much I mean it's mine 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.550
 actually a terrific performance for 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.340
 Arrest orders has, so to speak, the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.870
 vocabulary of the adolescents 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.640
 revolutionized by what you believe or 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.760
 woodpecker speaks someone in your environment 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.980
 used the word bar where I regularly 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.570
 my old know neither where is current 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.580
 Of course you always had this one 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.900
 speak but really use 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.730
 but you do not actually do that word 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.780
 I mean 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.450
 after all, we can look forward to 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.940
 I mean the year before in youth 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.920
 bundestages of the year of course and 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.230
 swag before that is why it is now 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.330
 what German what not from the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.060
 american room but from the 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.250
 Kurdish room comes or so but 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.540
 back to the topic as I said with the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.739
 sleep so I think I'll take 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.299
 I really going soon be time to 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.459
 spring to bed and then 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.810
 to sleep longer because I am 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.030
 actually quite big 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.200
 long sleeper if I can sleep then 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.450
 So I can not sleep much 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.220
 Slimming I really use the time 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.470
 I sleep hours 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.730
 sometimes even when the alarm clock 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.329
 rings with me now I turn it 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.459
 on striker thomas mummer of course and 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.630
 I'll ring again in ten minutes 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.340
 Keep those on bad and that works 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.120
 then so for hours then I'm in like that 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.950
 half asleep 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.300
 I do not know one or the other 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.710
 others know what i mean maybe 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.330
 is that something new for you? 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.880
 He completely goes to bed regularly 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.530
 I mean just since the release of 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.250
 ghost if you always one, of course 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.050
 a bit more 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.370
 and just after the first few days 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.080
 or as the game or become the game 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.710
 but maybe it does 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.120
 Some are still partially there 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.190
 invested you I say a little bit 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.870
 maybe more of his evening 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.850
 from his night in the game in and out 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.780
 negligently then his sleep and it 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.790
 was a thing that actually me 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.740
 would be interesting and pretty good 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.210
 when do you actually go like that? 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.340
 for example, the next day in the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.130
 school might have to study 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.200
 or need to work when you go 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.090
 then actually always sleep around like 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.590
 much time and especially when do you have to 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.070
 get up so I know about how 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.210
 a lot of sleep 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.690
 so i have my fur i am me 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.460
 just a lot of sleep 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.530
 So it needs the fittest me 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.150
 I mean've always now every 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.350
 I'll have some espresso tomorrow 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.060
 I'm actually the coffee drinker 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.480
 I used to drink cocoa in the past 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.990
 it was still a little boy that was 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.800
 were still times but yes meanwhile 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.479
 I always drink like that somehow 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.340
 espresso or something that makes me 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.020
 halfway fold but this one 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.550
 noon sleep grabs me over you know 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.320
 like that because you just kind of 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.300
 his day actually sleeps 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.240
 totally stupid so i mean in time 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.190
 I do videos and so but as it 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.150
 in fact, every one of his things that 's it 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.860
 actually slow, too 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.500
 sure with the video today a real one 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.729
 often a moderate topic and yes im 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.830
 background you still see what I the 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.479
 last kick for the cam I need 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.340
 always a bit around but then on 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.800
 everything works well in the end 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.280
 ends as always with a 30 florist too 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.500
 zero 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.479
 and yes people you can find now 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.850
 links the last issue of the cam 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.260
 week the last video and I hope 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.640
 Of course you liked it 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.650
 if you liked it is 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.840
 of course leave a rating there and 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.760
 people that's it i think i'm leaving now 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.110
 first sleep until next time 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.110
 people look and adios
