00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.130
 hello very good to everyone as this is from 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.750
 spring love here in the south of 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.320
 Spain as I say spring has 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.379
 come to stay there is sun and more 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.889
 heat and it looks like it changes his face to 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.820
 the people 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.800
 good in view of this 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.090
 in the spring it is characterized by the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.180
 flowers and such I have decided to do this 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.849
 point today that is called point of petals 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.070
 very nice and although it seems complicated 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.630
 because it is not actually have 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.380
 only two special laps 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.380
 We have to work 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.100
 to knit we need to assemble a 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.050
 Number of points multiples of four more 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.800
 one plus two shore points 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.400
 the first six laps are made 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 in point or plain or jersey 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.040
 the first round and all odd 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.579
 they are on the right side of the 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.040
 work 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.259
 and it has been the other way round the second 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.939
 right third upside down and so on 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.640
 successively until you reach the seventh 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.430
 which is the first one in which actually 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.630
 we have to work and the one that I'm going to 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.330
 do here not to lose them 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.310
 time anyway remember that 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.240
 the written instructions were in the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.260
 Blog 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.270
 I'm google.com and I'm going to leave you 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.270
 down in the information box as 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.429
 always so that you have them 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.240
 I really like this point because it is not 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.240
 nothing common 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.880
 it does not become openwork but it does have 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.840
 some ideal hole for any 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.840
 jersey 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.940
 autumn or spring 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.920
 also the effect is very different 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.310
 depending on the type of braun of threads 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.530
 of fiber that we use let's go seventh 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.810
 back point of edge that is not knitted 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.000
 and here begins what comes between 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.920
 Asterisks in the instructions is 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.170
 what we are going to repeat always in the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.990
 seventh 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.230
 2 reverse 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.690
 a long point of the right what do you want 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.420
 saying this we would normally have the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.970
 next point right now but 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.790
 this being long means that instead 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.370
 of doing it here I'm going to do three 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.640
 turns below and how I tell those 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.940
 three laps it is not here is here 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.330
 down 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.330
 one 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.150
 next I spike three laps down 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.900
 and I'm going to do is a point of the right 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.900
 one 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.959
 linked as always 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.849
 coli over there and the tissue that's why 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.350
 long flame because it is longer than 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.790
 the normals 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.400
 the next one is the other way around 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.590
 and the next is another length of the right 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.150
 what I'm going to do in the same way 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.340
 same place where I did the previous 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.330
 and it is easily seen because it has already been done 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.590
 a spike hole there 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.590
 it happened to me linked 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.790
 that's what goes between asterisks what 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.360
 let's repeat until the end 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.750
 back I'll do it once again two 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.750
 reverse 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.439
 a long point of the right in the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.520
 next point but three more laps 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.520
 down 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.520
 2. 3 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.860
 because I'm knitting a point of 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.860
 straight 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.550
 and the next one is another length of the right 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.550
 in the same place 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.219
 and this is repeated until the end we are going to 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.790
 finish this round with 1 reverse point and 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:17.890
 the shore point 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.890
 then let's do the octave 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.330
 eighth lap back of the fabric 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.120
 or reverse of labor 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.430
 what are we doing here, you are very simple 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.000
 but I 'm going to show them to start 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.300
 shore point 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.430
 and right point 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.139
 and here comes what is between 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.099
 asterisks in the instructions 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.099
 a right 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.070
 3 reverse 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.139
 two rights 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.120
 we repeat 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.640
 rights 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.590
 and so on until the end until 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.590
 let's finish with the shore point 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.440
 ok let's go to the ninth and last round 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.870
 how is it going 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.790
 having form 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.160
 this is the other turn in which you have to 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.620
 actually we have done work 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.100
 something different in the seventh and now in 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.240
 the ninth 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.240
 point of brightness 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.380
 and now comes what is between 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:43.600
 asterisks in the instructions a reverse 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.600
 two stitches together upside down 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.420
 two 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.960
 a reverse 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.840
 and slide a point as if we were to 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.840
 weave the right 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.090
 behind 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.090
 next network 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.410
 and now the one that we have slid that is the 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.600
 previous to the last one we mounted on the 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.070
 latest 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.640
 and it is already repeated 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.640
 a reverse 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.260
 whenever they have to make two points 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.950
 or three or four or five do 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.950
 one by one 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.409
 upside down 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.220
 I passed the thread and slipped the next 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.880
 point as if to knit the 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.529
 straight 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.489
 the next king 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:48.529
 and the slipped which is the penultimate 

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:52.510
 amount over the last 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:56.850
 once again a setback 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.850
 two together baby 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:03.699
 slip or next as if to 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.699
 weave the right 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.030
 rode the penultimate the d 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.610
 and so end 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.390
 ok and we have already finished here they have the 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:25.780
 petals 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.780
 so it looks from behind is not so ugly either 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.000
 and it's a point nothing seen around there 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.280
 uncommon, so 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.890
 already know any question they have 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.310
 can you leave me in comments here 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.680
 down 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.740
 in the blog directly I am bully 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.630
 dotcom you enjoy it and that what 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.380
 learn fast a hug 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.380
 thanks for being there
