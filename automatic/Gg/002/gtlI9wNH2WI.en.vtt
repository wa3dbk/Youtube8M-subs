00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.080
 Very good friends, we start with this 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.970
 series of guides to take out some costumes 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.160
 alternative in dragon ball if you do not see 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.710
 let's start here by taking out the suit 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.300
 from the big saya man we go to the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.670
 secondary missions and we will choose 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.579
 the mission that is called and came the great 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.710
 salamanca in vision number 30 to them 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.390
 I ask you to pay close attention to the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.700
 times in which the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.440
 missions and also in the order in the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.730
 which I will be mentioning that he defeated 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.810
 the enemies 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.760
 many of these alternative costumes 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.129
 depend on the order in which you defeat 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.170
 your enemies in the missions and also 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.430
 others depend on time that's why 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.640
 I tell them to pay attention because 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.250
 Then they will tell you why they do not come out 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.579
 the character that is going to give them the costume or 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.199
 because the enemy does not appear to them which 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.809
 which they must also face for 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.219
 take out some accessory then in the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.890
 order in which defeat the enemies 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.720
 first I went to attack the west where 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.550
 says west suburbs where you 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.040
 you find the exam that was that 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.710
 defeat first after rooting 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.410
 rapids and then finally defeat 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.820
 napa in that order first was wrong 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.200
 after rabbit 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.820
 after defeating those enemies in 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.610
 the suburbs I went to the corporation 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.550
 capsule where two characters appear 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.350
 of the special forces I came or the 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.540
 order to defeat these enemies first 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.960
 defeat the frizer assistant that is the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.380
 weaker enemy then defeat the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.330
 world and finally defeat putter the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.430
 blue character 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.170
 already last after defeating 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 these to these enemies of the forces 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.050
 specials I came and I went where I started 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.050
 The mission 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.600
 and where the vision starts, the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.869
 great jaima in 1 and 2 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.700
 just you approach them notice 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.929
 at the time when you defeat 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.799
 to the enemies and where I am 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.780
 here 12 around 12 10 seconds 12 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.250
 minutes with 10 seconds then here you 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.040
 you find granxa llamas simply 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.780
 you go to him and talk you talk to him and 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.629
 will give you the equipment 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.640
 the team that gives you the one in your suit is 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.680
 totally random you can not 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.209
 choose the equipment that gives you sometimes you 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.060
 can give the same over and over again but 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.620
 As you can see, the mission is fast 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.599
 then they do not take long in 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.090
 get the costume completely once 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.069
 it gives your team as there says to 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.349
 simply end the broadcast not the 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.160
 finish another one coming out if you must defeat 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.849
 to your enemies 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.739
 pass it completely then a 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.390
 time here it took me a bit because it brought 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.459
 powers that did not serve me 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.989
 too much but then you can spend a lot 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.569
 faster than me in less than five 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.730
 minutes and good once they are finished 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.920
 the mission will get some piece of the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.160
