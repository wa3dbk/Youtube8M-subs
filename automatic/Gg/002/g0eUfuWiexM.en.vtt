00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.330
 good afternoon today we will be with you 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.790
 prepare a festive appetizer of herring 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.730
 or more precisely, we will cook 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.180
 such canapes are small eateries less 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.760
 sandwiches 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.670
 and for this we need herring fillets 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.780
 rye bread curd cheese butter 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.780
 cream and dill 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.449
 from myakishev 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.129
 either do the basis for our less 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:37.220
 sandwiches that is cut out such 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.770
 squares are rectangles the size of 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:45.010
 Matchbox 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.010
 It is about the here and rectangles 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.579
 if you have a form for cooking 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.030
 cookies that can be beautiful will probably 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.030
 by forms 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.309
 I squeeze obtain a roughly 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.309
 mold 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.490
 well so on then these pieces lightly 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.100
 dried in a dry frying pan over 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.710
 one and a half to two minutes on each side to 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.530
 the appearance of a small 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.470
 brown tint smearing pieces 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:39.970
 bread with butter on one side 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:47.460
 approximately 2 3 millimeters thicker 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:50.410
 it is not necessary now the same operation 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.620
 doing with applying any 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:58.960
 I took green cheese 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:02.020
 with dill but only a layer here 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.790
 a little bit thicker you can do that is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.640
 it's about three to four millimeters but and 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.510
 thicker layer does not make sense so 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.890
 as in this case, these sandwich makers can 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.750
 turn out to be a little dryish 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.920
 so 3-4 millimeters is itself 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.070
 optimal curd coating thickness 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.070
 cheese 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:37.660
 decorate with dill sprigs 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:40.290
 cut herring into fresh herring 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.290
 triangles 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:54.329
 and laid and and on top of our 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.790
 the resulting mini-tour quit and all 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.890
