00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.340 
way to do it I did that was training
clients<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.330> made<00:04:53.510> sure<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.660> had<00:04:53.690> protein<00:04:54.140> bars

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
clients I made sure I had protein bars

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.080 
clients I made sure I had protein bars
me<00:04:54.620> make<00:04:54.800> sure<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.950> shakes<00:04:55.340> me<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.640> lot<00:04:55.820> of<00:04:55.910> water

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
me make sure I shakes me a lot of water

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.690 
me make sure I shakes me a lot of water
a<00:04:56.390> lot<00:04:56.690> of<00:04:56.810> caffeine<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.800> first<00:04:58.100> week<00:04:58.370> we<00:04:58.610> can

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
a lot of caffeine the first week we can

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.070 
a lot of caffeine the first week we can
have<00:04:58.910> is<00:04:59.030> going<00:04:59.150> to<00:04:59.240> be<00:04:59.300> hard<00:04:59.630> your<00:04:59.840> body's

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
have is going to be hard your body's

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.570 
have is going to be hard your body's
gonna<00:05:00.200> be<00:05:00.290> hungry<00:05:00.590> it's<00:05:00.830> not<00:05:00.919> adjusted<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.550> it

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
gonna be hungry it's not adjusted to it

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.790 
gonna be hungry it's not adjusted to it
but<00:05:02.210> your<00:05:02.330> metabolism<00:05:02.990> adjust<00:05:03.410> pretty

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
but your metabolism adjust pretty

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.780 
but your metabolism adjust pretty
quickly<00:05:04.100> so<00:05:04.400> then<00:05:05.300> what<00:05:05.480> happens<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.840> you<00:05:06.020> fast

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
quickly so then what happens is you fast

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.090 
quickly so then what happens is you fast
for<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.820> few<00:05:08.000> weeks<00:05:08.120> then<00:05:08.390> you<00:05:08.480> go<00:05:08.630> from<00:05:08.810> there

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
for a few weeks then you go from there

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.830 
for a few weeks then you go from there
but<00:05:10.100> you<00:05:10.220> started<00:05:10.700> slow<00:05:11.060> you<00:05:11.240> started<00:05:11.600> like<00:05:11.720> I
