for twenty yards I tested it's it's spot

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.830 
for twenty yards I tested it's it's spot
on<00:02:54.210> at<00:02:54.600> twenty<00:02:54.900> yards<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.970> if<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.120> can<00:02:57.330> use

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
rangefinder

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.310 
rangefinder
give<00:03:08.970> them<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.150> get<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> feel<00:03:09.540> for<00:03:10.050> what's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
give them to get a feel for what's

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.800 
give them to get a feel for what's
twenty<00:03:11.160> what's<00:03:11.400> forty<00:03:11.820> what<00:03:11.970> sixty<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.660> then

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
twenty what's forty what sixty and then

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.230 
twenty what's forty what sixty and then
when<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.650> see<00:03:13.830> your<00:03:13.980> deer<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:14.940> use<00:03:15.090> the
