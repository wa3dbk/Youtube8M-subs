00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
pencil so it rubs away really easily and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.720 
pencil so it rubs away really easily and
you<00:00:54.870> also<00:00:55.170> need<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.739> make<00:00:55.980> sure<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.399> every

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730

single element of the illustration is
actually<00:00:58.739> touching<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.910> nothing<00:01:00.390> gets<00:01:00.539> cut

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
actually touching so nothing gets cut

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.160 
actually touching so nothing gets cut
away<00:01:01.670> but<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:03.000> once<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> cut<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> out
