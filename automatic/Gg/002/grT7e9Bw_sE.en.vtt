00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.130
 Want morning and so welcome the guests - for a long time the world is 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.770
 The op 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.440
 and split the VBU read Syberg Dinslaken 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.490
 and Schmidt this Seibert in matters that is a cleaning fit 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:19.150
 and to be sure, it's just delicious, practically demonstrating the boards 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.550
 have to be the same 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.849
 and I just want this law now 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:24.960
 Patterson denied 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.020
 an advance 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.050
 if you already see yourself like that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.220
 think for yourself 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.440
 getting used to it is such a silence so to speak that can be here 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.020
 deform 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.239
 and around he is meant to and keyboards 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.550
 Euro ready for a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.810
 above was similar things on the car or so to clean 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.910
 because you can 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.900
 to press into something then practically takes the formal and the dirt 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.850
 stay with him 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.520
 during this silence here 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.520
 and at the same time the quay removes more and percent pathogens and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 Bacteria and what do I know 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.690
 Percent so first as it lies in the hand 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 So the hands stay really clean 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.830
 if you are sad that it threatens so a bit in you 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.450
 but Tarsus is pleasant 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.970
 and safe defense of the functionality fixed here and with 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.820
 mine 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.560
 Altena Foster Tour this really counts: I did not clean it 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.600
 and the application is very simple 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.650
 So just this mucus 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.730
 Patrician Volltastatur where 1 4 liter racks 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.070
 Now quite important with this one does not tend to 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.050
 «You meet so wet from the top just press 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.960
 just click 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.850
 do it a few times and that 's just for sure in this harvested one 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.390
 Keyboard gets 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 That may be that some people are glad us, so to speak 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.250
 So just a third 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 promptly might have heard 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.840
 so that worked out is a pressed down 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.360
 Of course this is done carefully 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.460
 simply peel off 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.290
 We will see the result soon 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.429
 then we are already that in this last september 11th 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.980
 and it is really amazing 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.119
 this result is 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.229
 look at this 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.219
 like all the dirt off my keyboard that's really important now a lot 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.789
 Niederbachem gets stuck 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.459
 when they like what 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.339
 Form is adopted 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.619
 and if I'm that he was ahead of the big day, it really is 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.739
 clean then of course you have to go over it again that's logical 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.369
 that it gets really clean 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.889
 but then that was really useful 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.559
 and this track is so catch so to speak we just believe it all over 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.389
 and around besides catching hands back and forth 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.039
 Yet another example of course you can not just use the keyboard 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.509
 enter but also for example mobile phones 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.649
 Question 2 the keyboard way 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.759
 the NDR that it is not so funny 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:04.849
 Peter make a nice impression by doing this is these cleaning measures 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.519
 she may be up to 10 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.519
 bigger with that too is the feature is almost 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.709
 that so 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.459
 when we four go to this race 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.249
 and we'll meet again 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.369
 Ulrich Förster nothing happens as I said it is a very large slime 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.369
 So there is nothing anyway device broken synonymous nothing 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.239
 the interest in 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.739
 that's the miracle if I've ever done that mother not 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.629
 stay recognized 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.629
 if that's gone again 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.689
 we already thought Akbulut not missing 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.799
 "When you look 7 4 really nice I found that funny 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.139
 So we really want that exact imprint of the phone 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.989
 and then you can see that it is really in the smallest angle 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.459
 that you can do that also with the heating 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.639
 and if you have such a heater Hogan should have titles 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.769
 I also have the percent 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.769
 their devotion Prospekts what we sown 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:11.219
 So these different applications 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.219
 and yes 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:17.870
 The warm weather is still to say that is of course not for toddlers 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.230
 This then the Wense percent 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.490
 something tear this time succeed I say now 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.009
 and around 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.009
 to say the final word 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:34.479
 Massey is of course not Edi usable man it is clear that it 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.539
 also ahead 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.020
 Selling so much that's not good anymore 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.150
 there is a certain scale on so courtship around the pig this color has become quite 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.669
 He does not have that in his hair again 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.500
 then one should rather silence once past were the receptiveness 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.870
 is no longer guaranteed 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.830
 yes, what the hell could have been from this video you can say that 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.340
 it really very useful a very good pig happens 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.860
 clearly percent does not come in the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.999
 So he 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.139
 some as surface is super and around 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.639
 and of course perfect to get voter associations 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.080
 So to put that on the keyboard but the keys make way but 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.249
 I mean so much between now but it is really a super 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.800
 when art centers 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.050
 thus, the sentence deviates east of this video 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.990
 Euro at 4 09
