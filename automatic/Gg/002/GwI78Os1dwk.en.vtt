00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and then you guys talkin 'about it 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.839
 I liked boj b good wine through this 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.480
 video there to power and explaining to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.090
 you a little bit more is who I am my 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.809
 work on my songs and everything 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.820
 more 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 Good, I got it right and since 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 childhood was five years old 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.470
 When I started to listen, it 's through the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.590
 brother influence has always been national to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.189
 cube is always this kind of rule so 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.080
 I'm always always old. 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.030
 accompanying the work of all of them 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.840
 so it has been an influence for me 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.989
 also 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 in antiquity of rap so more or 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.370
 But I came to speak also about the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.760
 that encouraged writing was the issue 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.129
 of my separated parents also separated 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320
 15 years ago 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.800
 It was not easy for me as it was for anyone. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.170
 It's easy but I'm feeling pretty 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.199
 write also 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.840
 even today I write sometimes 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.580
 letters kinda sad passing me by 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.240
 hard moments 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.040
 the joy is for that reason that some 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.110
 have some type of medicine 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 so it is also good that since small and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.040
 at school and in the world 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.689
 My life as I spoke and I wanted to 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.570
 show everyone who is living 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.710
 today that used in the past that the world 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.840
 turns around and everything changes independently 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.329
 of everything I chase after my dream 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.399
 joined in being able to perform in 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.770
 some things in the day have no influence 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.110
 of the project ache emicida 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.939
 for those who like or not the people in the cup 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.759
 also has personal influence of the tram 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.039
 stronda wanted to talk about the 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.740
 Question of dreams that I am brat 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.950
 always the former councilman since childhood 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.009

 focus you do not receive the money that is 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.910
