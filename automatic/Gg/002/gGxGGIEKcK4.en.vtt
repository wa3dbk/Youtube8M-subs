next<00:01:00.610> I'm<00:01:00.700> going<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.970> do<00:01:01.329> a<00:01:01.600> spider<00:01:02.470> web<00:01:03.390> design

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
next I'm going to do a spider web design

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.300 
next I'm going to do a spider web design
start<00:01:06.400> off<00:01:06.520> by<00:01:06.700> just<00:01:06.729> going<00:01:07.720> up<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:08.979> down<00:01:09.100> on

start off by just going up and down on
left<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.000> right<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.640> then<00:01:12.909> from<00:01:13.270> these<00:01:13.720> four

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
left and right and then from these four

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.980 
left and right and then from these four
I'm<00:01:14.920> go<00:01:15.160> out<00:01:15.430> on<00:01:15.940> each<00:01:16.300> one<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.259> them<00:01:18.990> making

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
I'm go out on each one of them making

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.090 
I'm go out on each one of them making
the<00:01:20.350> spider<00:01:21.040> web<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.780> from<00:01:23.020> these<00:01:23.200> 8<00:01:23.470> i'm

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
the spider web and then from these 8 i'm

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.590 
the spider web and then from these 8 i'm
going<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.460> bring<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.850> in<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:31.210> want<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.420> wipe

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
going to bring it in you want to wipe

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.990 
going to bring it in you want to wipe
off<00:01:31.869> whatever<00:01:32.619> tool<00:01:32.979> you're<00:01:33.220> using<00:01:33.280> after

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
off whatever tool you're using after

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.649 
off whatever tool you're using after
every<00:01:34.330> couple<00:01:35.289> of<00:01:35.530> swipes

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.989 

then<00:01:42.259> after<00:01:42.469> I<00:01:42.530> get<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.950> I'm<00:01:43.189> ugh<00:01:43.369> bring<00:01:43.880> it

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
then after I get that I'm ugh bring it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:45.910 
then after I get that I'm ugh bring it
all<00:01:44.149> together<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.049> looks<00:01:45.229> nice<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.679> neat

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
all together so it looks nice and neat

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.950 
all together so it looks nice and neat
and<00:01:47.140> then<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.259> pattern<00:01:48.710> or<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:49.819> design<00:01:50.689> I'm

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
and then the pattern or the design I'm

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.699 
and then the pattern or the design I'm
going<00:01:51.289> for<00:01:51.560> is<00:01:51.859> right<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.119> middle<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
going for is right in the middle so the

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.489 
going for is right in the middle so the
color<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:55.490> used<00:01:56.000> for<00:01:56.209> my<00:01:56.450> base<00:01:56.990> color<00:01:57.020> i

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
color that I used for my base color i

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.279 
color that I used for my base color i
originally<00:01:58.189> wanted<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.729> use<00:01:59.030> for<00:01:59.959> the<00:02:00.079> water

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
originally wanted to use for the water

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.649 
originally wanted to use for the water
marble<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.340> also<00:02:01.520> from<00:02:01.849> china<00:02:02.090> glaze<00:02:02.359> it

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
marble and it's also from china glaze it

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.800 
marble and it's also from china glaze it
took<00:02:02.780> all<00:02:02.929> turned<00:02:03.349> up<00:02:03.560> tour<00:02:03.859> Coy's<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.479> I

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
took all turned up tour Coy's so I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.779 
took all turned up tour Coy's so I
decided<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:06.829> use<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.189> as<00:02:07.459> the<00:02:07.609> base

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
decided to just use that as the base

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.359 
decided to just use that as the base
color<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.410> I'm<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:09.649> going<00:02:09.769> to<00:02:09.830> be<00:02:09.920> dipping<00:02:10.250> it

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
color so I'm just going to be dipping it

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.680 
color so I'm just going to be dipping it
in<00:02:10.549> right<00:02:10.940> in<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.120> middle<00:02:16.329> I'm<00:02:17.329> gonna<00:02:17.540> take<00:02:17.629> a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
in right in the middle I'm gonna take a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:36.860 
in right in the middle I'm gonna take a
q-tip<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.349> clean<00:02:18.560> everything<00:02:18.739> up

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.170 

and<00:02:37.440> there<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.629> water<00:02:39.629> marble
