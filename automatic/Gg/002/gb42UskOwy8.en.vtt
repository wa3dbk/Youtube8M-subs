soft dough you don't want it too hard

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.170 
soft dough you don't want it too hard
you<00:01:19.740> don't<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> too<00:01:20.700> soft

just<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.780> consistency<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:23.490> requires

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
just the right consistency this requires

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.999 
just the right consistency this requires
a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.390> bit<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> practice<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.229> once<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
a little bit of practice but once you

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.160 
a little bit of practice but once you
get<00:01:26.220> used<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.640> making<00:01:26.820> dough<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.479> becomes<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
get used to making dough this becomes a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.399 
get used to making dough this becomes a
fairly<00:01:28.680> easy<00:01:28.950> task<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> once<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.140> have

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
fairly easy task so once we have

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.190 
fairly easy task so once we have
combined<00:01:32.189> our<00:01:32.520> flour<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.360> water<00:01:33.390> our<00:01:33.930> dough

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
combined our flour with water our dough

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.010 
combined our flour with water our dough
is<00:01:34.439> formed<00:01:34.770> we'll<00:01:35.759> set<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.060> aside<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.540> an<00:01:36.869> hour

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is formed we'll set it aside for an hour

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.130 
is formed we'll set it aside for an hour
and<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.490> will<00:01:38.670> notice<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.210> has<00:01:39.390> risen<00:01:39.630> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and then you will notice it has risen in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.520 
and then you will notice it has risen in
amount<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.400> has<00:01:41.460> doubled<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.240> quantity<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
amount it has doubled in quantity you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.920 
amount it has doubled in quantity you
will<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:44.009> take<00:01:44.280> small<00:01:44.549> portions<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> time

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
will just take small portions at a time

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.340 
will just take small portions at a time
