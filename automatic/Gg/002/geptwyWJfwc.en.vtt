00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 two parried first round 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.619
 National Prize of the Centenary in 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.619
 Germany came across 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.420
 with the nine-year-old cornet thus 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.420
 combine 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 the Olympic champion 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.730
 the world cup winner 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.410
 from las vegas 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.710
 won with nino lab big prize 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.530
 St gallen with nino nations price was 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.040
 In second place they got that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.040
 mostly 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.610
 but it's easy for me 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.920
 behind the boxer rod and thus 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.920
 also for him the mistake for Steve Gerta 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.250
 they then fit without problems on the water 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.759
 feedback of the audi also ideal steve 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.840
 gadd the four dots cells like four 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.840
 counting points 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.399
 after the offender stones with the eight 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.869
 Penalties strike result there was 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.180
 So it would have been a bit like that myself 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.310
 about it annoyed about the combine 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.110
 very slight errors there after 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.110
 Points are with it 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.340
 for switzerland as a whole 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.300
 We have a penalty point after that 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.300
 for the whole night like 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.610
 when it comes 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.950
 and then ireland but no 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:37.610
 play more the air burns in the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.930
 mvv riding stadium that has not just what 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.930
 just to do with the temperatures 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.640
 the m 12 points the swiss 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.780
 8 had at least from the first round 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.120
 then 0 4 and 8 that's claudia gisler 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.340
 is counted with the painting result 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.610
 the four points of nadja peter steiner 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.880
 like increased with Korbinian than statements 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.880
 continue 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.900
 The Olympic champion of the World Cup winner 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:09.730
 comes in with the grain with korbinian 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.379
 goal and ultimately, and that 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.019
 fits well if the cdu still 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:19.180
 early points added but just 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:22.229
 things the stocks here and 12.20 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.020
 I have a total of that 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.710
 I hope my bookkeeping is right 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.710
 now wants 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.600
 shell 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.600
 see 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.420
 as 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.210
 8 points to the americans
