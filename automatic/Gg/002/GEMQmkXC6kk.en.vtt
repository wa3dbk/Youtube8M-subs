maybe<00:01:53.850> three<00:01:54.270> months<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.899> most<00:01:55.680> definitely

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
maybe three months or most definitely

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.459

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
like that so I just sprayed every now

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.550 
like that so I just sprayed every now
and<00:04:57.060> again<00:04:57.090> whenever<00:04:57.510> I'm<00:04:58.080> pretty<00:04:58.380> sure<00:04:58.500> you

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
and again whenever I'm pretty sure you

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.159 
and again whenever I'm pretty sure you
can<00:04:58.710> mix<00:04:58.949> this<00:04:59.280> with<00:04:59.340> some<00:05:00.270> distilled<00:05:00.870> water

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
can mix this with some distilled water

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.730 
can mix this with some distilled water
this<00:05:02.160> water<00:05:02.430> is<00:05:02.639> purified<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.720> this<00:05:04.169> goes<00:05:04.470> bad

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
this water is purified so this goes bad

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.650 
this water is purified so this goes bad
but<00:05:05.039> distilled<00:05:05.430> water<00:05:05.580> doesn't<00:05:06.060> go<00:05:06.120> bad<00:05:06.330> so

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
but distilled water doesn't go bad so

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.719 
but distilled water doesn't go bad so
you'll<00:05:06.840> might<00:05:07.199> be<00:05:07.380> able<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.860> get<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.400> couple

you'll might be able to get a couple

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.360 
you'll might be able to get a couple
