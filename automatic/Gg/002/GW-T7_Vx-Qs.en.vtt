to<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> color<00:02:37.560> scheme<00:02:37.890> yeah<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:38.940> there<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.720> go

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to the color scheme yeah so there you go

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.800 
to the color scheme yeah so there you go
but<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.350> little<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.860> little<00:02:41.340> toy<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.450> go

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
but a little a little toy there you go

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.330 
but a little a little toy there you go
right<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.590> have<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.860> charge<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.280> up

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
right so you have to charge it up

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.710 
right so you have to charge it up
obviously<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.850> charge<00:02:45.090> up<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> battery

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
obviously you charge up the battery

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.860 
obviously you charge up the battery
before<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.110> start<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.830> then<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:48.300> can<00:02:48.600> take

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
before you start and then you can take

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.520 
before you start and then you can take
it<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.380> how<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.739> flies<00:02:51.530> rather

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
it and see how it flies rather

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.160 
it and see how it flies rather
interestingly<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.690> battery<00:02:54.690> holder<00:02:55.050> is

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
interestingly the battery holder is

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.840 
interestingly the battery holder is
under<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> camera<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.610> nicely

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
under the camera so it's nicely

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.870 
under the camera so it's nicely
concealed<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.750> two-in-one<00:02:58.140> job<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.250> get<00:02:59.640> the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
concealed a two-in-one job so to get the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.699 
concealed a two-in-one job so to get the
battery<00:03:00.510> out<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.810> charging<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.590> to

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
battery out for charging you have to

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.900 
battery out for charging you have to
undo<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:02.820> camera<00:03:03.630> mount<00:03:03.840> turn<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.730> as

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
undo this camera mount turn it on and as

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.280 
undo this camera mount turn it on and as
you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.090> see<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.450> got<00:03:06.630> even<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.110> nice

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
you can see it's got even the nice

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.810 
you can see it's got even the nice
little<00:03:08.510> LEDs<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.200> get<00:03:10.580> it's<00:03:11.580> showing

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
little LEDs that you get it's showing

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.509 
little LEDs that you get it's showing
you<00:03:11.970> how<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.269> how<00:03:12.780> its<00:03:12.959> operating<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.680> like<00:03:14.250> it

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
you how it's how its operating I like it

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.949 
you how it's how its operating I like it
dinky<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.610> interestingly<00:03:17.940> enough<00:03:18.480> most<00:03:18.750> of

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
dinky so interestingly enough most of

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.949 
dinky so interestingly enough most of
these<00:03:19.080> bits<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.590> pieces<00:03:19.830> here<00:03:20.100> are<00:03:20.310> fake

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
these bits and pieces here are fake

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.960 
these bits and pieces here are fake
it's<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.049> real<00:03:22.200> L<00:03:22.620> LCD<00:03:23.220> though<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> rest<00:03:23.880> of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
it's a real L LCD though but the rest of

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.180 
it's a real L LCD though but the rest of
it<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.180> kind<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.510> down<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.110> doesn't<00:03:25.680> buy

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
it is kind of down here is doesn't buy

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.330 
it is kind of down here is doesn't buy
the<00:03:26.250> early<00:03:26.580> as<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.390> say<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.959> little<00:03:28.860> little

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
the early as I say it's a little little

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.890 
the early as I say it's a little little
thing<00:03:29.640> these<00:03:29.790> buttons<00:03:30.420> work<00:03:30.660> you're<00:03:30.870> not

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
thing these buttons work you're not

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.259 
thing these buttons work you're not
quite<00:03:31.200> sure<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.560> probably<00:03:31.890> for<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
quite sure what probably for the

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.140 
quite sure what probably for the
acrobatics<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:35.430> things<00:03:35.640> work<00:03:35.850> as<00:03:36.060> you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
acrobatics so this things work as you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.610 
acrobatics so this things work as you
can<00:03:36.269> see<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.660> little<00:03:36.780> indication<00:03:37.350> of

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
can see you have a little indication of

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.710 
can see you have a little indication of
battery<00:03:38.070> life<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.580> props<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.150> all<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.450> kind

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
battery life and props and all that kind

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.650 
battery life and props and all that kind
of<00:03:39.840> stuff<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.200> attitude<00:03:40.620> switch<00:03:41.489> on<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.910> quad

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
of stuff and attitude switch on the quad

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
of stuff and attitude switch on the quad
itself<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.430> do<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.459> quick<00:03:45.230> calibration<00:03:46.230> and

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
itself and do a quick calibration and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.430 
itself and do a quick calibration and
that's<00:03:46.830> done

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.530 

it's<00:03:50.830> very<00:03:51.100> responsive<00:03:51.730> you're<00:03:52.450> gonna

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
it's very responsive you're gonna

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.710 
it's very responsive you're gonna
straight<00:03:53.110> off<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.350> deck<00:03:54.450> I've<00:03:55.450> known<00:03:55.660> a

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
straight off the deck I've known a

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.630 
straight off the deck I've known a
flight<00:03:55.900> here<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.200> light<00:03:56.380> later<00:03:56.680> with<00:03:57.460> a<00:03:57.490> bit

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
flight here of light later with a bit

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.190 
flight here of light later with a bit
more<00:03:57.760> room<00:03:58.000> but<00:03:58.360> anyway<00:03:58.600> just<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.840> show<00:03:59.020> that

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
more room but anyway just to show that

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.930 
more room but anyway just to show that
it<00:03:59.290> works<00:03:59.440> pretty<00:04:00.250> well<00:04:00.370> out<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.790> box

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
it works pretty well out of the box

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.990 
it works pretty well out of the box
let's<00:04:01.270> see<00:04:01.450> how<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.630> works<00:04:01.810> when<00:04:02.050> it's<00:04:02.200> under

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
let's see how it works when it's under

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.700 
let's see how it works when it's under
proper<00:04:04.000> attention<00:04:07.170> so<00:04:08.170> there's<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.410> couple<00:04:08.590> of

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
proper attention so there's a couple of

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.140 
proper attention so there's a couple of
things<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.950> really<00:04:09.220> like<00:04:09.430> about<00:04:09.460> to<00:04:09.970> this

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
things I really like about to this

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.780 
things I really like about to this
little<00:04:10.930> quadcopter<00:04:11.830> first<00:04:12.100> off<00:04:12.310> one<00:04:12.550> is<00:04:12.670> it

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
little quadcopter first off one is it

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.110 
little quadcopter first off one is it
comes<00:04:13.060> with<00:04:13.300> nice<00:04:13.960> propeller<00:04:14.710> protectors<00:04:15.490> in

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
comes with nice propeller protectors in

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.820 
comes with nice propeller protectors in
the<00:04:16.180> box<00:04:16.630> which<00:04:16.959> is<00:04:16.989> always<00:04:17.230> handy<00:04:17.500> especially

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
if you're a novice flyer and it's a

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.280 
if you're a novice flyer and it's a
great<00:04:20.290> little<00:04:20.530> addition<00:04:20.709> for<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:22.020> copter<00:04:23.020> this

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
great little addition for a copter this

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.060 
great little addition for a copter this
kind<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.770> price<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:25.210> second<00:04:25.570> thing<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:26.440> like

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.970 
the fact there is an on/off switch I
find<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:29.920> little<00:04:29.980> bit<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:31.320> bit<00:04:32.320> embarrassing

copters<00:04:37.540> even<00:04:37.750> those<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:37.990> costing<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.410> few

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
copters even those is costing a few

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.020 
copters even those is costing a few
hundred<00:04:38.800> dollars<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.130> get<00:04:39.340> them<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.610> run<00:04:39.790> you

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
hundred dollars to get them to run you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.970 
hundred dollars to get them to run you
know<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.750> Phantom<00:04:41.140> is<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.290> exception<00:04:41.770> which

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
know the Phantom is the exception which

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.370 
know the Phantom is the exception which
allows<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.700> use<00:04:43.180> this<00:04:43.360> turn<00:04:43.840> turn<00:04:44.050> on<00:04:44.260> and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
allows you to use this turn turn on and

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.920 
allows you to use this turn turn on and
off<00:04:44.440> with<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.680> switch<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.490> think<00:04:45.760> all<00:04:46.450> quad

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
off with a switch and I think all quad

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.320 
off with a switch and I think all quad
copters<00:04:47.290> of<00:04:47.380> any<00:04:47.530> size<00:04:48.040> budget<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.850> stuff

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
copters of any size budget and stuff

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.210 
copters of any size budget and stuff
should<00:04:49.570> have<00:04:49.780> an<00:04:50.170> on/off<00:04:50.530> switch<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:51.070> just

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
should have an on/off switch it just

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.160 
should have an on/off switch it just
makes<00:04:51.370> life<00:04:51.430> easier

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
makes life easier

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.630 
makes life easier
the<00:04:53.170> other<00:04:53.290> thing<00:04:53.440> is<00:04:53.560> really<00:04:53.770> cool<00:04:54.160> is<00:04:54.460> the

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
the other thing is really cool is the

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.240 
the other thing is really cool is the
battery<00:04:55.830> compartment

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
battery compartment

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.440 
battery compartment
which<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.580> just<00:04:57.730> this<00:04:57.880> little<00:04:58.030> thing<00:04:58.270> here

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
which is just this little thing here

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.270 
which is just this little thing here
again<00:04:58.540> very<00:04:59.050> easy<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.530> get<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.860> battery<00:05:00.250> out

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
again very easy to get the battery out

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.830 
again very easy to get the battery out
you<00:05:01.180> just<00:05:01.600> unplug<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:02.320> little<00:05:02.800> plug<00:05:03.040> there

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
you just unplug that little plug there

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.530 
you just unplug that little plug there
show<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:07.170> just<00:05:08.880> like<00:05:09.880> that<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:10.390> you're<00:05:10.480> done

uncle
pretty<00:05:15.550> cool<00:05:16.810> not<00:05:17.230> a<00:05:17.260> huge<00:05:17.530> battery<00:05:17.770> but<00:05:17.980> it's

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
pretty cool not a huge battery but it's

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.790 
pretty cool not a huge battery but it's
good<00:05:18.220> enough<00:05:18.400> for<00:05:18.660> a<00:05:19.660> bit<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.230> flight<00:05:20.500> time<00:05:20.740> a

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
good enough for a bit of flight time a

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.110 
good enough for a bit of flight time a
good<00:05:21.100> bit<00:05:21.220> of<00:05:21.250> flight<00:05:21.490> time<00:05:21.670> your<00:05:21.850> 7<00:05:22.090> minutes

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
good bit of flight time your 7 minutes

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.730 
good bit of flight time your 7 minutes
or<00:05:22.500> so<00:05:23.500> so<00:05:23.740> yeah<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:25.150> like<00:05:25.480> this<00:05:25.690> it's<00:05:26.200> it's

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
or so so yeah I like this it's it's

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.500 
or so so yeah I like this it's it's
pretty<00:05:27.010> cool<00:05:27.250> it's<00:05:27.490> it's<00:05:27.790> nicely<00:05:28.030> designed

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
pretty cool it's it's nicely designed

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.600 
pretty cool it's it's nicely designed
and<00:05:29.080> that's<00:05:29.230> a<00:05:29.290> little<00:05:29.500> camera<00:05:30.160> housing<00:05:30.520> on

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
and that's a little camera housing on

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.790 
and that's a little camera housing on
the<00:05:30.700> top<00:05:30.880> there<00:05:31.090> so<00:05:31.750> let's<00:05:31.930> go<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.200> take<00:05:32.410> it<00:05:32.620> on

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
the top there so let's go and take it on

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.330 
the top there so let's go and take it on
a<00:05:33.100> little<00:05:33.490> flight<00:05:33.990> so<00:05:34.990> as<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.560> can<00:05:35.650> see<00:05:35.710> very

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
a little flight so as you can see very

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.930 
a little flight so as you can see very
stable

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
stable

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.200 
stable
but<00:05:38.180> with<00:05:38.330> hands<00:05:38.540> up<00:05:38.980> it's<00:05:39.980> very<00:05:40.880> stable

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
but with hands up it's very stable

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.800 
but with hands up it's very stable
indeed<00:05:41.630> this<00:05:41.750> is<00:05:41.900> brilliant<00:05:43.420> very<00:05:44.420> easy<00:05:44.630> to

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
indeed this is brilliant very easy to

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.550 
indeed this is brilliant very easy to
fly<00:05:45.820> probably<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:47.480> easiest<00:05:47.840> next<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.410> the

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
fly probably the easiest next to the

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.900 
fly probably the easiest next to the
Phantom<00:05:49.370> visioned<00:05:50.090> I've<00:05:50.360> tested<00:05:51.230> so<00:05:51.410> far<00:05:51.910> the

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
Phantom visioned I've tested so far the

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.629 
Phantom visioned I've tested so far the
gyroscope<00:05:53.420> to<00:05:53.570> really<00:05:53.870> do<00:05:53.990> well<00:05:54.170> on<00:05:54.320> it

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
gyroscope to really do well on it

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.110 
gyroscope to really do well on it
yeah<00:05:56.500> very<00:05:57.500> impressed<00:05:57.919> with<00:05:58.129> Cristian

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
yeah very impressed with Cristian

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.610 
yeah very impressed with Cristian
dollars<00:05:59.659> got<00:06:00.530> to<00:06:00.620> be<00:06:00.740> a

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
dollars got to be a

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.000 
dollars got to be a
a<00:06:01.740> really<00:06:02.550> good<00:06:02.729> option<00:06:03.360> for<00:06:03.830> especially<00:06:04.830> for

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
a really good option for especially for

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
a really good option for especially for
newcomers<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.580> quadcopters

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
newcomers to quadcopters

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.640 
newcomers to quadcopters
yeah

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
yeah

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.490 
yeah
