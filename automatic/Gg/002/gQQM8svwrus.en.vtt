00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.860
 two 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.710
 deuce is already an even number that gives 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.349
 she has a lot of feminine softness 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 attentiveness and the possibility of being 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:24.390
 taking the opportunity to be deep 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.179
 aware of what's going on who 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.720
 is from the outside 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:32.670
 that is, the symbol of the two, then this mother 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.770
 energy that loves accepts and 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.800
 able to totally focus his 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.560
 attention your awareness 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.690
 on who is outside or on 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.000
 some object which may be 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.280
 is inside but originally two 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.240
 perceive yourself as a partner and this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.030
 key her. self identification ie 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.430
 not if not like that one 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.220
 completely fixed in its 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.829
 inspiration of his enthusiasm in his heat 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.789
 explore this life deuce same exactly 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:11.380
 also looks at 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:16.270
 other people 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.680
 and this is a completely different way to see 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.770
 perceive the world rather than 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.899
 one who has a hot-tempered intuitive 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:31.450
 and lives enthusiastic deuce lives 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:34.710
 soft care and warmth 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.829
 but it is worth referring to what you 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.130
 deuce can get on several 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.959
 means in the first place if you do there 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.020
 add up all the numbers you can 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:51.090
 get for example 38 you can 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.830
 get 29 you can get 20 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.950
 if you get 38 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.479
 it's more independent charismatic 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:08.170
 and creative energy if it turns 29 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.459
 here there is a quality let's say so 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.180
 more spirituality and more 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.640
 Attentiveness 38 in this sense is more 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.100
 creative actor people here if 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.310
 It turns out 20 this is the quality of softness 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.690
 caring and very deep intuitive 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.290
 motherhood attitude of people around 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.700
 at the same time if you lay out 38 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.989
 29 further adding 3 plus 8 will be 11 also 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.920
 like 29 and these 11 they drastically change 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:45.040
 the essence if the deuce is soft 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.780
 empathy supporting the other 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.629
 and deuce it as a personification 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.489
 Swadhisthana is very soft loving 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:56.439
 caring empathizing energy and if 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.069
 you look at the drawing of the chakras here 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:03.099
 Swadhisthana and anahata are highlighted 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.819
 This is the most comfortable in principle for 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.530
 twos of energy but 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.079
 11 which will then be reduced to 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.859
 two but 11 has in itself two ones in 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.379
 In this sense, we will have the same 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.540
 characteristics which 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.620
 are broadcast through one it's bright 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.889
 intuitive leadership insight 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.599
 consciousness that lives intuitive 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:38.010
 flashes and lives on the verge of the spiritual 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:42.569
 breakthrough in more but let's say so high 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.569
 spiritual layers which lives on the brink 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.840
 soul shower soul soul soul soulfully 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.530
 sincerity of searching for spiritual truth and 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:01.590
 there are a lot of powerful speakers here 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 units will be and people who possess 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.870
 Here is this combination for example there 38 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.790
 then it is further formed at 11 then 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.700
 stack up milking they can go like 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.030
 by twos very gently loving care 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.919
 they can go the way this one 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.919
 master number is bright spiritual 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.320
 energy they can go by 38 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:33.600
 it is bright charismatic and proper 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.789
 manifestation itself with a big assiduously 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.930
 connected with great works hard but in 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:41.699
 some creative team for example 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.169
 Well, the picture here is still highlighted 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.169
 Anahata is actually 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.210
 love is great heartiness which 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.770
 comes from these people combined with 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.550
 a certain courage which gives 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.770
 exactly go 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.770
 two ones as the number 11
