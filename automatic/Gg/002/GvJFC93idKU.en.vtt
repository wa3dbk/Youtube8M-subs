this<00:00:24.060> performance<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:24.869> actually

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
this performance is that we're actually

this performance is that we're actually
going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.560> these<00:00:26.220> widescreen<00:00:26.699> NASA

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
going to have these widescreen NASA

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.310 
going to have these widescreen NASA
images<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:27.810> projected<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
images that are projected in the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.060 
images that are projected in the
background<00:00:29.750> this<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.990> piece<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.710> seven

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
background this is a piece and seven

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.370 
background this is a piece and seven
movements<00:00:32.279> related<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.540> seven<00:00:33.780> planets<00:00:33.899> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
movements related to the seven planets I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.920 
movements related to the seven planets I
guess<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.890> knew<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.160> at<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> time

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
guess that they knew about at that time

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.229 
guess that they knew about at that time
excluding<00:00:36.930> earth<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.280> each<00:00:38.430> movement<00:00:38.700> has

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
excluding earth and so each movement has

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.299 
excluding earth and so each movement has
its<00:00:39.750> own<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.230> characteristics<00:00:40.980> often

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
its own kind of characteristics often

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.299 
its own kind of characteristics often
related<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.510> gods<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.739> historical

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
related to the gods or historical

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.369 
related to the gods or historical
mythological<00:00:44.489> ideas<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.809> ancients<00:00:46.260> had

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
mythological ideas the ancients had

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.110 
mythological ideas the ancients had
about<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.800> planets<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.730> each<00:00:47.879> movement

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
about these planets and so each movement

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.959 
about these planets and so each movement
comes<00:00:48.420> across<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> very<00:00:49.110> unique<00:00:49.649> way

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
comes across in a very unique way

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.130 
comes across in a very unique way
typically<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.210> classical<00:00:51.600> music<00:00:51.719> there's<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
typically with classical music there's a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.810 
typically with classical music there's a
little<00:00:52.410> bit<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.770> dichotomy<00:00:53.219> between

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
little bit of a dichotomy between

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
little bit of a dichotomy between
tradition<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.750> innovation<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
tradition and innovation you know you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
tradition and innovation you know you
want<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> honor<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.270> composer<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
want to honor the composer and the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
want to honor the composer and the
composers<00:00:58.440> vision<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> piece<00:00:59.340> but

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
composers vision for the piece but

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.189 
composers vision for the piece but
there's<00:01:00.180> also<00:01:00.300> been<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> lot<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> time<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.109> has

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
there's also been a lot of time that has

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.599 
there's also been a lot of time that has
passed<00:01:01.230> since<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> want<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
passed since then and so you want the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.979 
passed since then and so you want the
piece<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.000> applicable<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> present

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
piece to be applicable to the present

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.210 
piece to be applicable to the present
day<00:01:04.080> audience

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
day audience

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.450 
day audience
this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> experiment<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.830> many

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
this is one of the experiment and many

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.930 
this is one of the experiment and many
officers<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.270> trying<00:01:10.230> is<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.250> symphonic

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
officers are trying is to make symphonic

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.790 
officers are trying is to make symphonic
music<00:01:12.060> become<00:01:12.990> multi<00:01:13.500> media<00:01:14.010> event<00:01:15.800> it's

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
music become multi media event it's

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.740 
music become multi media event it's
definitely<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> different<00:01:17.700> experience<00:01:17.750> most

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
definitely a different experience most

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
definitely a different experience most
pieces<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> try<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.340> something

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
pieces if you try to do something

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.240 
pieces if you try to do something
audio-visual<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.720> them<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.980> doesn't

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
audio-visual with them it it doesn't

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580 
audio-visual with them it it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:24.150> add<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> music<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.230> think<00:01:25.320> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
necessarily add to the music I think in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.650 
necessarily add to the music I think in
this<00:01:25.710> case<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.160> really<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.270> sort<00:01:27.510> of<00:01:27.540> an

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
this case it really can it's sort of an

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.240 
this case it really can it's sort of an
exception<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.200> almost<00:01:28.440> like<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.830> music

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
exception it's almost like this music

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.310 
exception it's almost like this music
was<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.790> meant<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.330> capture<00:01:30.990> your
