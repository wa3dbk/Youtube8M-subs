00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.530
 player liebherr his fast 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.330
 deployment plan 26 degrees point one of this 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.880
 crane combines the advantages of a 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.980
 hydraulically folding jib with 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.170
 those of a telescope are their bars 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.310
 tower with different hook heights 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.130
 as a feature, the 26.1 offers the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:37.219
 innovative 40 degree boom superstaat 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.590
 position with 37 meters height of 26 k1 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.800
 is our smallest kagran down the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.190
 Series down from the car series 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.829
 now ranges from 26 meters to 50 meters 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.690
 unloading on the market are in this crane 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.280
 Size really only hydraulic 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.469
 is currently available 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.890
 These we lie with our harbok 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.680
 row off the crane as such has the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.210
 enormous advantage that several hooks heights 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.310
 available at the 6 20 k 114 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.710
 meters and 23 meters 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.659
 this allows the contractor to 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.820
 used in a new building area with 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.700
 several other cranes one over - or 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.040
 the colleague just falls short of that 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.509
 simplicity can not and that was one 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.810
 the reasons why we in classical 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.229
 Guitar wise the 26 km the market 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.229
 brought 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.439
 In the development of the 26 km you had to 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.270
 We attach importance to several aspects 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.150
 on the one hand wanted the contractor 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.280
 a little very flexible ill then 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.950
 because this was not available on the market 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.210
 on the other hand we put great value on 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.070
 energy efficiency 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.299
 because the electricity bill at a 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.960
 huge construction site for the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.840
 contractor a fixed size is the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.990
 26 k1 has two meter swivel rat are 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.789
 3.8 meters support width and can therefore also 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.369
 perfect in confined spaces 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.630
 be used 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.239
 his compact ones are also unprecedented 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.060
 Transport dimensions depending on the highest condition 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.060
 the crane is only 15 meters attached 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.340
 For a long time we think that with the 26 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.870
 k1 at the moment the most flexible crane in 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.870
 these have size on the market 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.420
