00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.350 
active the day before each goose egg and
um<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.990> added<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.350> third<00:01:49.560> protein<00:01:50.090> because<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
um and I added a third protein because I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.389 
um and I added a third protein because I
was<00:01:51.540> outside<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.290> hot<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> was<00:01:52.890> sweating<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
was outside it was hot I was sweating I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.950 
was outside it was hot I was sweating I
was<00:01:53.520> doing<00:01:53.729> gardening<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.329> shoveling<00:01:54.780> I'm

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
was doing gardening and shoveling I'm

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380 
was doing gardening and shoveling I'm
not<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> ton<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> did<00:01:56.520> enough<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> felt

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
not a ton but I did enough that I felt

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.850 
not a ton but I did enough that I felt
like<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.780> should<00:01:58.020> probably<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> third

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
like I should probably have a third

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
like I should probably have a third
protein<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.490> had<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> form<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
protein and I had it in the form of a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
protein and I had it in the form of a
cottage<00:02:01.170> cheese<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.820> um<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.180> maybe

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
cottage cheese and um you know maybe

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.030 
cottage cheese and um you know maybe
that<00:02:03.570> wasn't<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.960> smart<00:02:04.229> idea<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.920> know

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that wasn't a smart idea I don't know

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.700 
that wasn't a smart idea I don't know
the<00:02:05.549> other<00:02:05.759> thing<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.570> had<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.380> sugar-free

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the other thing is I had some sugar-free

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.559 
the other thing is I had some sugar-free
jell-o<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.429> actually<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> days<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.420> had

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
jell-o I actually one of the days I had

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.600 
jell-o I actually one of the days I had
three<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:09.989> them

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
three of them

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.770 
three of them
and<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.940> know<00:02:11.350> it's<00:02:12.350> definitely<00:02:12.530> not<00:02:12.830> ideal

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and I know it's definitely not ideal

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.330 
and I know it's definitely not ideal
there's<00:02:14.780> Noth<00:02:15.110> aspartame<00:02:15.680> which<00:02:15.710> is<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.220> know

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
there's Noth aspartame which is I know

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.760 
there's Noth aspartame which is I know
not<00:02:16.700> healthy<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:17.360> I've<00:02:17.900> never<00:02:18.350> actually<00:02:18.500> had

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
not healthy but I've never actually had

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.040 
not healthy but I've never actually had
a<00:02:18.800> problem<00:02:18.980> losing<00:02:19.490> weight<00:02:19.820> using<00:02:20.810> that

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
a problem losing weight using that

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.430 
a problem losing weight using that
sweetener<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:22.010> HCG<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:22.940> um<00:02:23.210> but<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.110> don't<00:02:24.350> know

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
sweetener on HCG so um but I don't know

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.750 
sweetener on HCG so um but I don't know
I<00:02:24.470> mean<00:02:24.800> in<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> jell-o<00:02:25.220> form<00:02:25.550> that's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
I mean in the jell-o form that's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.640 
I mean in the jell-o form that's
different<00:02:26.150> than<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.900> coke<00:02:27.140> form<00:02:27.410> because

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
different than the coke form because

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.310 
different than the coke form because
they<00:02:27.770> do<00:02:27.830> have<00:02:28.100> ten<00:02:28.340> calories<00:02:28.580> each<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.050> did

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
they do have ten calories each so I did

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.320 
they do have ten calories each so I did
have<00:02:30.560> higher<00:02:30.920> calories<00:02:31.580> those<00:02:31.820> days<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:33.170> um<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
have higher calories those days but um I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.430 
have higher calories those days but um I
don't<00:02:35.330> know<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:36.020> guess<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.260> didn't

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
don't know I just I guess I didn't

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.570 
don't know I just I guess I didn't
really<00:02:36.590> think<00:02:36.710> it<00:02:36.830> would<00:02:36.920> be<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.070> problem<00:02:37.340> but

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
really think it would be a problem but

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.200 
really think it would be a problem but
maybe<00:02:38.210> it<00:02:38.360> was<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.410> or<00:02:40.310> maybe<00:02:40.520> that's<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:40.970> you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
maybe it was so or maybe that's just you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.430 
maybe it was so or maybe that's just you
know<00:02:41.330> maybe<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.660> weight<00:02:41.930> would<00:02:42.110> have<00:02:42.200> slowed

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
know maybe a weight would have slowed

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.020 
know maybe a weight would have slowed
down<00:02:42.470> anyway<00:02:43.010> I'm<00:02:43.220> not<00:02:43.250> really<00:02:43.400> sure<00:02:43.790> but

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
down anyway I'm not really sure but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.010 
down anyway I'm not really sure but
anyway<00:02:44.810> um<00:02:45.670> that's<00:02:46.670> what's<00:02:47.090> going<00:02:47.330> on<00:02:47.450> with<00:02:47.510> me

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
anyway um that's what's going on with me

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.130 
anyway um that's what's going on with me
and<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:49.370> am<00:02:49.880> having<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.330> little<00:02:50.480> bit<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.930> rough

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
and I am having a little bit of a rough

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.020 
and I am having a little bit of a rough
patch<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.770> diet<00:02:52.160> which<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.640> probably

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
patch with the diet which is probably

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.070 
patch with the diet which is probably
why<00:02:53.330> I've<00:02:53.750> been<00:02:54.110> eating<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.650> little<00:02:54.890> more<00:02:55.100> and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
why I've been eating a little more and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.510 
why I've been eating a little more and
trying<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.230> sneak<00:02:57.470> those<00:02:57.650> jell-o's<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:58.340> and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
trying to sneak those jell-o's in and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.940 
trying to sneak those jell-o's in and
stuff<00:02:58.760> because<00:02:59.000> I'm<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.350> having<00:03:00.620> cravings

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
stuff because I'm just having cravings

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.970 
stuff because I'm just having cravings
not<00:03:01.459> necessarily<00:03:02.030> for<00:03:02.209> bad<00:03:02.390> food<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.350> just

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
not necessarily for bad food but I just

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.960 
not necessarily for bad food but I just
I<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:05.750> want<00:03:06.020> I'm<00:03:06.290> craving<00:03:06.920> volume<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:07.880> I'm

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
I just want I'm craving volume and I'm

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.960 
I just want I'm craving volume and I'm
craving<00:03:08.270> frequency<00:03:09.020> of<00:03:09.260> food<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.920> just<00:03:10.580> wish<00:03:10.790> I

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
craving frequency of food I just wish I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.850 
craving frequency of food I just wish I
could<00:03:11.180> eat<00:03:11.300> more<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.170> more<00:03:12.380> often

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
could eat more and more often

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.610 
could eat more and more often
um<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.700> it's<00:03:14.300> hard<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:15.019> I'm<00:03:15.170> just<00:03:15.350> trying<00:03:15.590> to

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
um and it's hard so I'm just trying to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.410 
um and it's hard so I'm just trying to
distract<00:03:15.830> my<00:03:16.190> mind<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.790> hoping<00:03:17.060> it'll<00:03:17.209> pass

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
distract my mind and hoping it'll pass

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.180 
distract my mind and hoping it'll pass
because<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.110> same<00:03:18.350> thing<00:03:18.620> happened<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.010> me

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
because the same thing happened to me

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.830 
because the same thing happened to me
last<00:03:19.220> around<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.480> it's<00:03:20.600> not<00:03:20.750> unfamiliar<00:03:21.340> um

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
last around so it's not unfamiliar um

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.900 
last around so it's not unfamiliar um
but<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:24.019> know<00:03:24.110> hopefully<00:03:24.650> it'll<00:03:24.739> pass<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.580> I'm

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
but I know hopefully it'll pass so I'm

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.990 
but I know hopefully it'll pass so I'm
just<00:03:26.090> kind<00:03:26.300> of<00:03:26.360> trying<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.690> stick<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:26.989> out<00:03:27.110> and

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
just kind of trying to stick it out and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.370 
just kind of trying to stick it out and
just<00:03:29.000> wait<00:03:29.150> for<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.510> pass<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.140> hopefully

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
just wait for it to pass and hopefully

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.500 
just wait for it to pass and hopefully
I'll<00:03:30.470> wake<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.980> another<00:03:31.010> loss<00:03:31.880> soo<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.450> I'm

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
I'll wake up to another loss soo and I'm
