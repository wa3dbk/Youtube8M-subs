00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
had an issue with it at all so a few

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.450 
had an issue with it at all so a few
tips<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.710> these<00:01:08.119> apply<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.360> kind<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
tips with these apply them kind of in a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
tips with these apply them kind of in a
triangular<00:01:11.460> shape<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:12.210> under<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> eye<00:01:13.010> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
triangular shape here under the eye and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
triangular shape here under the eye and
anywhere<00:01:14.369> else<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.640> need<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.689> find

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
anywhere else you need it and I find

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.450 
anywhere else you need it and I find
that<00:01:16.080> when<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.350> let<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.650> sit<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that when you let it sit for just a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
that when you let it sit for just a
couple<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.820> minutes<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.360> consistency

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
couple of minutes the consistency

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
couple of minutes the consistency
changes<00:01:19.740> slightly<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.850> blend<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> out

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
changes slightly when you blend it out

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.380 
changes slightly when you blend it out
it's<00:01:21.720> not<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.049> completely<00:01:22.530> move<00:01:22.890> away

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's not going to completely move away

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
it's not going to completely move away
so<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.540> started<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.960> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> settle<00:01:25.799> into<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
so it started to kind of settle into the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.730 
so it started to kind of settle into the
skin<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.880> guess<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.210> could<00:01:27.240> say<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.619> then

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
skin I guess you could say and so then

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.929 
skin I guess you could say and so then
when<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> blend<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.700> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
when you going to blend it out you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.399 
when you going to blend it out you
actually<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> better<00:01:30.540> coverage<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
actually get a better coverage with it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.230 
actually get a better coverage with it
and<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:32.070> found<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> best<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and I found that this is the best way to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
and I found that this is the best way to
use<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.049> use<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.680> finger<00:01:35.040> sometimes<00:01:35.340> too

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
use it I do use my finger sometimes too

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.569 
use it I do use my finger sometimes too
kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.970> tap<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.509> blend<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.200> also<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.340> like

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
kind of tap and blend I also really like

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.999 
kind of tap and blend I also really like
using<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> soft<00:01:40.470> concealer

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
using a little kind of soft concealer

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.310 
using a little kind of soft concealer
brush<00:01:41.310> I've<00:01:41.820> seen<00:01:41.970> other<00:01:42.119> people<00:01:42.360> use<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.899> tip

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
brush I've seen other people use the tip

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
brush I've seen other people use the tip
of<00:01:43.500> their<00:01:43.740> beauty<00:01:44.130> blender<00:01:44.540> any<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.750> those

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
of their beauty blender any of those

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
of their beauty blender any of those
methods<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.649> would<00:01:46.770> work<00:01:46.979> great<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.670> has

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
methods I think would work great it has

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.490 
methods I think would work great it has
a<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.210> good<00:01:48.420> coverage<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.320> not

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
a really good coverage and it's not
