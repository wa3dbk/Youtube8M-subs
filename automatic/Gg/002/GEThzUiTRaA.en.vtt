okay<00:00:01.050> so<00:00:01.110> we<00:00:01.319> here<00:00:01.560> at<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.680> shop<00:00:02.210> here<00:00:03.210> in<00:00:03.240> bath

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
okay so we here at the shop here in bath

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.470 
okay so we here at the shop here in bath
2012<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:05.130> we're<00:00:05.400> gonna<00:00:05.490> check<00:00:05.730> out<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:05.940> XO

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
2012 and we're gonna check out the XO

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.280 
2012 and we're gonna check out the XO
screen<00:00:06.839> which<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.799> new<00:00:08.610> TFT<00:00:09.360> technology<00:00:09.960> so

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
screen which is new TFT technology so

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.220 
screen which is new TFT technology so
this<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.190> EMA<00:00:11.490> for<00:00:11.700> silicon<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.420> previous

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
this is the EMA for silicon the previous

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.650 
this is the EMA for silicon the previous
technology<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.219> looks<00:00:14.400> like<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.089> there

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
technology it looks like this and there

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.189 
technology it looks like this and there
was<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:16.650> bezel<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.820> more<00:00:18.630> bezel<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
was more bezel so more bezel on the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.120 
was more bezel so more bezel on the
sides<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:20.369> power<00:00:20.580> consumption<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.130> less

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
sides more power consumption and less

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.240 
sides more power consumption and less
brightness<00:00:23.640> less<00:00:24.330> resolution<00:00:25.130> lots<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
brightness less resolution lots of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
brightness less resolution lots of
differences<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.539> new<00:00:27.689> XO

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
differences this is the new XO

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.339 
differences this is the new XO
technology<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.599> we<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.750> see<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:31.289> can

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
technology and we can see that they can

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.889 
technology and we can see that they can
actually<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:32.160> used<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.759> devices<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.690> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
actually be used in devices like this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.880 
actually be used in devices like this
this<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> high<00:00:35.700> resolution<00:00:36.030> XO<00:00:36.690> display<00:00:37.110> on

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this is a high resolution XO display on

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
this is a high resolution XO display on

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.350 
recognition and they have a high grade
high-definition<00:00:44.700> monitor<00:00:45.350> high<00:00:46.350> definition

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.380 

this<00:00:51.360> side<00:00:51.570> over<00:00:51.660> here

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.210 

so<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.260> see<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> power<00:00:55.770> consumption

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
so here we see the power consumption

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.920 
so here we see the power consumption

power<00:01:25.410> consumption<00:01:25.950> compared<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> America<00:01:27.440> so

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
power consumption compared to America so

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.140 
power consumption compared to America so
what<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:30.690> a<00:01:30.750> maybe<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.800> 5<00:01:32.190> MLS<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.970> looks

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
what is a maybe it's 5 MLS but it looks

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.560 
what is a maybe it's 5 MLS but it looks
like<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.390> half<00:01:34.100> maybe<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.850> don't<00:01:36.509> know

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
like a half maybe it's more I don't know

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.469 
like a half maybe it's more I don't know
if<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.720> calculate<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.270> also

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
if I calculate it right and it has also

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.180 
if I calculate it right and it has also
to<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> refresh<00:01:40.350> rate<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.860> far<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.160> I

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
to do the refresh rate as far as I

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.520 
to do the refresh rate as far as I
understand<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.479> refresh<00:01:42.840> rate<00:01:42.960> might<00:01:43.350> go

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
understand it the refresh rate might go

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260 
understand it the refresh rate might go
down<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> panel<00:01:44.759> screen

maybe it's 20 maybe it's one hurt I
don't<00:01:59.010> know

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.400 

we're<00:02:02.760> gonna<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.060> through<00:02:03.300> here<00:02:03.510> in<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.140> second

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
Hertz refresh rate and here it's a much

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.390 
Hertz refresh rate and here it's a much
less<00:02:12.750> refresh<00:02:13.410> rate<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.950> more<00:02:14.130> stable

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
less refresh rate it's more stable

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.440 
less refresh rate it's more stable
there's<00:02:15.210> less<00:02:15.390> interference<00:02:19.310> ten<00:02:20.310> touch<00:02:20.550> much

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
there's less interference ten touch much

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.140 
there's less interference ten touch much
less<00:02:21.720> power<00:02:21.990> consumption<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:22.860> touchscreen

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
less power consumption for touchscreen

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.820 
less power consumption for touchscreen
so<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> touch<00:02:24.810> touch<00:02:25.260> demo<00:02:25.680> it's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
so this is a touch touch demo it's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.320 
so this is a touch touch demo it's
really<00:02:26.100> about<00:02:26.280> tablets

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
really about tablets

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.100 
really about tablets
it's<00:02:27.750> about<00:02:27.990> tablet<00:02:28.740> it's<00:02:29.610> about<00:02:29.850> phones<00:02:30.209> when

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
it's about tablet it's about phones when

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.170 
it's about tablet it's about phones when
you<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.410> touchscreen<00:02:32.010> capacitive<00:02:32.910> touch

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you have touchscreen capacitive touch

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.920 
you have touchscreen capacitive touch
but<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> much<00:02:35.070> lower<00:02:35.400> rate<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.540> one

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
but with a much lower rate so this one

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.070 
but with a much lower rate so this one
it<00:02:37.200> reflects<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.280> touch<00:02:38.820> panel<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
it reflects the the touch panel the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.820 
it reflects the the touch panel the
touch<00:02:40.320> driver<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.900> display<00:02:42.900> refreshes

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
touch driver and the display refreshes

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.280 
touch driver and the display refreshes
60<00:02:44.250> times<00:02:44.459> per<00:02:44.610> second<00:02:45.390> because<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.110> be

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
60 times per second because the be

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.260 
60 times per second because the be
refreshing<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:47.310> much<00:02:47.580> different<00:02:47.790> it's

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
refreshing it's much different it's

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.070 
refreshing it's much different it's
lower<00:02:49.080> refresh<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:50.430> refreshes<00:02:51.090> only<00:02:51.420> if<00:02:51.900> you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
lower refresh it refreshes only if you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.750 
lower refresh it refreshes only if you
need<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.350> refresh<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.890> there's<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.130> video<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:53.640> we

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
need to refresh it there's a video if we

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.910 
need to refresh it there's a video if we
refresh<00:02:54.030> full<00:02:54.360> speed<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.170> if<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.440> text<00:02:55.680> if

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
refresh full speed but if it's text if

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.370 
refresh full speed but if it's text if
it's<00:02:56.070> picture<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.120> pure<00:02:57.270> flesh<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.290> a

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
it's picture in a pure flesh it's just a

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.650 
it's picture in a pure flesh it's just a
picture<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.040> maybe<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.850> will<00:02:59.970> go<00:03:00.120> down<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.450> 1

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
picture so maybe it will go down to 1

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.229 
picture so maybe it will go down to 1
Hertz<00:03:00.870> maybe<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.770> few<00:03:01.980> Hertz<00:03:02.160> maybe<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
Hertz maybe it's a few Hertz maybe a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.580 
Hertz maybe it's a few Hertz maybe a
piston<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:03.780> Hertz<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.080> don't<00:03:04.230> know<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.470> it's

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
piston one Hertz I don't know but it's

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.430 
piston one Hertz I don't know but it's
lower<00:03:04.830> refresh<00:03:05.700> rate<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.510> here<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:07.049> is<00:03:07.230> one

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
lower refresh rate and here this is one

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.420 
lower refresh rate and here this is one
of<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.650> cool<00:03:07.860> new<00:03:07.980> things<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.400> are

understand is thanks to the Ixil and
it's<00:03:25.620> possible<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:27.209> can<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.630> quad<00:03:28.080> HD

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it's possible to you can do quad HD

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.650 
it's possible to you can do quad HD
without<00:03:28.709> EXO<00:03:29.070> but<00:03:29.310> EXO<00:03:29.670> makes<00:03:29.940> its<00:03:30.150> may<00:03:30.600> be

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
without EXO but EXO makes its may be

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.210 
without EXO but EXO makes its may be
easier<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.709> do<00:03:32.130> cottage

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
easier to do cottage

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.170 
easier to do cottage
and<00:03:33.760> here's<00:03:34.060> another<00:03:34.180> demonstration<00:03:34.690> of

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
and here's another demonstration of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.760 
and here's another demonstration of
super-high<00:03:37.180> resolution<00:03:37.210> you<00:03:37.870> can<00:03:37.900> see<00:03:38.140> 6.1

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
super-high resolution you can see 6.1

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.120 
super-high resolution you can see 6.1
inch<00:03:39.720> three<00:03:40.720> megapixel<00:03:41.470> over<00:03:41.650> some<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:41.950> huge

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
inch three megapixel over some the huge

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.510 
inch three megapixel over some the huge
resolution<00:03:42.730> here<00:03:43.770> very<00:03:44.770> high<00:03:45.010> pixel

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
resolution here very high pixel

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.950 
resolution here very high pixel
densities<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.270> higher<00:03:46.480> pixel<00:03:46.750> density

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
densities so it's higher pixel density

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.220 
densities so it's higher pixel density
than<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.560> iPad<00:03:48.100> 3<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:50.800> always<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.220> new<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
than the iPad 3 so it's always a new the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.160 
than the iPad 3 so it's always a new the
new<00:03:54.180> component<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.300> new<00:03:55.450> component<00:03:55.960> for<00:03:56.110> the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
new component the new component for the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.570 
new component the new component for the
TFT<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.220> it's<00:03:57.340> much<00:03:57.580> smaller<00:03:57.970> TFT<00:03:58.660> yes<00:03:59.340> it<00:04:00.340> has

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
TFT so it's much smaller TFT yes it has

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.820 
TFT so it's much smaller TFT yes it has
a<00:04:00.610> whole<00:04:00.940> bunch<00:04:00.970> of<00:04:01.270> advantages<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.440> it's

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
a whole bunch of advantages and it's

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.370 
a whole bunch of advantages and it's
arriving<00:04:03.520> at<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.700> market<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.300> year<00:04:04.360> so<00:04:05.350> I

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
arriving at the market this year so I

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.830 
arriving at the market this year so I
can<00:04:05.530> guess<00:04:05.920> we<00:04:06.220> might<00:04:06.490> use<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.390> might<00:04:07.630> be<00:04:07.750> in

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
can guess we might use it it might be in

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.780 
can guess we might use it it might be in
the<00:04:07.900> Kindle<00:04:08.200> Fire<00:04:08.230> -<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:09.160> might<00:04:09.340> be<00:04:09.520> in<00:04:09.640> the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
the Kindle Fire - it might be in the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.350 
the Kindle Fire - it might be in the
iPhone<00:04:10.180> 5<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.990> might<00:04:11.290> be<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.860> iPad<00:04:12.550> 4<00:04:12.850> it

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
iPhone 5 it might be in the iPad 4 it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.520 
iPhone 5 it might be in the iPad 4 it
might<00:04:13.570> be<00:04:13.750> in<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> whole<00:04:14.020> bunch<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.320> device

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
might be in a whole bunch of device

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.520 
might be in a whole bunch of device
maybe<00:04:14.770> not<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.400> think<00:04:16.359> Apple<00:04:16.690> wanted<00:04:17.170> it<00:04:17.350> for

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
maybe not I think Apple wanted it for

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.800 
maybe not I think Apple wanted it for
iPad<00:04:17.830> 3<00:04:18.070> but<00:04:18.220> it<00:04:18.310> was<00:04:18.489> not<00:04:18.640> ready<00:04:18.880> but<00:04:19.450> now<00:04:19.600> it's

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
iPad 3 but it was not ready but now it's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.790 
iPad 3 but it was not ready but now it's
ready<00:04:20.230> so<00:04:20.739> now<00:04:21.010> chef<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.580> doing<00:04:21.730> Axl<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.800> it's

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
ready so now chef is doing Axl and it's
