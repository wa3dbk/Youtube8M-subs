00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 this month 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.790
 we have already been counting 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.080
 statistically for example the system 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.450
 of procurement and delivery of justice 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.330

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.120
 for example homicides this only 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.320
 three advance a little bit the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.120
 research to reach the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.910
 courts of those three a quantity still 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.580
 minor it is found that the person 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.550
 likely responsible is the culprit and it 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.010
 punish we are talking about a 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.140
 97 percent of cases 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.120
 unresolved of all about 10,000 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.380
 homicides are more that have been registered 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.380
 in the last four years 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.230
