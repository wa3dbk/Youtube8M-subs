Daisy<00:00:06.629> Viking<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.350> Joule<00:00:07.529> today<00:00:08.340> I'd<00:00:08.550> like<00:00:08.610> to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
Daisy Viking in Joule today I'd like to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.060 
Daisy Viking in Joule today I'd like to
share<00:00:09.179> with<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.510> several<00:00:10.170> techniques<00:00:10.650> for

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
share with you several techniques for

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.509 
share with you several techniques for
finishing<00:00:11.670> your<00:00:11.820> Viking<00:00:12.210> net<00:00:12.360> wave<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:14.280> first

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
finishing your Viking net wave the first

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.519 
finishing your Viking net wave the first
technique<00:00:15.000> I'll<00:00:15.269> show<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.900> very<00:00:16.080> simple

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
technique I'll show you is very simple

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:26.179 
technique I'll show you is very simple
we<00:00:17.220> will<00:00:17.430> cut<00:00:17.670> off<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.150> draw<00:00:18.330> handles<00:00:24.859> and<00:00:25.859> you

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
we will cut off the draw handles and you

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.660 
we will cut off the draw handles and you
want<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> clean<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:26.789> any<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.750> raw<00:00:28.670> cut

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
want to clean up any of the raw cut

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.279 
want to clean up any of the raw cut
particles<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.300> might<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> end<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
particles that might be on the end of it

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.549 
particles that might be on the end of it
and<00:00:32.160> we'll<00:00:32.910> also<00:00:33.239> trim<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.780> end<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.320> well

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
and we'll also trim this end as well

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.740 
and we'll also trim this end as well
okay<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.040> there's<00:00:38.250> our<00:00:38.370> raw<00:00:38.579> Viking<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.390> on

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
okay so there's our raw Viking it so on

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.049 
okay so there's our raw Viking it so on
this<00:00:40.260> particular<00:00:40.800> finishing<00:00:41.489> technique<00:00:41.879> I'm

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
this particular finishing technique I'm

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.020 
this particular finishing technique I'm
going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> insert<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.290> 20<00:00:44.160> gauge<00:00:44.340> wire<00:00:44.370> through

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
going to insert a 20 gauge wire through

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.930 
going to insert a 20 gauge wire through
the<00:00:45.180> entire<00:00:45.660> weave<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.820> I'm

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the entire weave and to do that I'm

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
the entire weave and to do that I'm
going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> start<00:00:48.480> by<00:00:48.829> making<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.100> wire<00:00:50.340> wrap

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
going to start by making a wire wrap

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.170 
going to start by making a wire wrap
loop<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.660> end<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> wire<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.940> I'm<00:00:53.940> going

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
loop on one end of the wire so I'm going

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.200 
loop on one end of the wire so I'm going
to<00:00:54.300> add<00:00:54.649> my<00:00:55.649> end<00:00:55.860> cap<00:00:57.109> onto<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> wire<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.210> then

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
to add my end cap onto the wire and then

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
to add my end cap onto the wire and then
each<00:01:00.480> end<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.079> Viking<00:01:01.829> net<00:01:02.010> weave<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.460> just

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
each end of my Viking net weave I'm just

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.679 
each end of my Viking net weave I'm just
going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> gently<00:01:03.059> press<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:05.390> just<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> make

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
going to gently press it just to make

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.210 
going to gently press it just to make
sure<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:07.890> my<00:01:08.010> end

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
sure that it's going to go into my end

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
sure that it's going to go into my end
cap<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.750> I'm<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> insert

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
cap and then I'm just going to insert

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.749 
cap and then I'm just going to insert
the<00:01:10.799> 20<00:01:11.070> gauge<00:01:11.220> wire<00:01:14.900> into<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> weave<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
the 20 gauge wire into the weave and

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.950 
the 20 gauge wire into the weave and
sometimes<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.939> best<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.299> twist<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
sometimes it's best to just twist the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.539 
sometimes it's best to just twist the
weave<00:01:19.110> gently<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> wire<00:01:20.310> through

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
weave gently to get that wire through

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
weave gently to get that wire through
there<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> that's<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there and there we go so that's going to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.700 
there and there we go so that's going to
be<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.070> end<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:27.140> then<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.590> need

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
be on one end and then all we will need

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.490 
be on one end and then all we will need
to<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> add<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.610> additional<00:01:30.000> end<00:01:30.240> cap<00:01:30.500> it's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
to do is add the additional end cap it's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.870 
to do is add the additional end cap it's
gone<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> other<00:01:32.040> side<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:35.280> snug<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> up

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
gone to the other side and snug it up

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.060 
gone to the other side and snug it up
and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.530> finish<00:01:37.710> by<00:01:38.040> putting

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and then we will just finish by putting

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.780 
and then we will just finish by putting
a<00:01:38.460> wire<00:01:38.640> wrap<00:01:38.880> loop<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.750> second<00:01:40.140> end<00:01:40.790> this

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
a wire wrap loop on the second end this

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.450 
a wire wrap loop on the second end this
gives<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.240> stability<00:01:42.479> especially<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> in

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
gives it stability especially in the in

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
gives it stability especially in the in
the<00:01:44.549> case<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.360> want<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> bracelet<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the case of if you want a bracelet to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.649 
the case of if you want a bracelet to
stay<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.770> bit<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.490> strength<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.450> there

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
stay a little bit more strength in there

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.389 
stay a little bit more strength in there
and<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> also<00:01:49.259> allows<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> wanted<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
and it also allows you if you wanted to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.609 
and it also allows you if you wanted to
form<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:52.140> point<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.470> could

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
form this at some point you could

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.289 
form this at some point you could
actually<00:01:52.829> form<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
actually form it because you have that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.690 
actually form it because you have that
20<00:01:54.479> gauge<00:01:54.720> wire<00:01:54.750> inside<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.280> second

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
20 gauge wire inside the second

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.160 
20 gauge wire inside the second
finishing<00:01:57.119> technique<00:01:57.509> I'd<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> share

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
finishing technique I'd like to share

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.940 
finishing technique I'd like to share
with<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.619> is<00:02:00.170> basically<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> same<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:01.829> we're

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
with you is basically the same but we're

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.230 
with you is basically the same but we're
not<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> run<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> wire<00:02:02.820> through<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
not going to run a wire through the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.600 
not going to run a wire through the
entire<00:02:03.540> Viking<00:02:03.990> knit<00:02:04.100> we're<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.430> leave

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
entire Viking knit we're going to leave

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.180 
entire Viking knit we're going to leave
it<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.149> flexible<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.039> end

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
it so it's flexible and just put the end

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.059 
it so it's flexible and just put the end
caps<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.700> each<00:02:09.209> side<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.530> we're<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.190> use

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
caps on each side and we're going to use

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.460 
caps on each side and we're going to use
some<00:02:12.760> little<00:02:12.939> wire<00:02:13.269> wrapped<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.750> caps<00:02:14.049> that<00:02:14.319> we

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
some little wire wrapped in caps that we

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.699 
some little wire wrapped in caps that we
made<00:02:14.709> with<00:02:14.980> our<00:02:15.010> little<00:02:15.370> coiling<00:02:15.790> tool<00:02:16.000> if

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
made with our little coiling tool if

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.690 
made with our little coiling tool if
you're<00:02:17.709> not<00:02:17.860> familiar<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.459> coiling

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
you're not familiar with the coiling

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.720 
you're not familiar with the coiling
tool<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.989> our<00:02:20.110> coiling<00:02:20.530> tool<00:02:20.739> it's<00:02:21.400> just

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
tool this is our coiling tool it's just

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.170 
tool this is our coiling tool it's just
basically<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.599> crank<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:24.099> all<00:02:24.730> we're<00:02:24.879> going<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
basically a crank and all we're going to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.839 
basically a crank and all we're going to
do<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.599> we're<00:02:25.750> going<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.900> take<00:02:26.110> some<00:02:26.349> wire<00:02:26.560> and

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.319 

you'll<00:02:30.849> attach<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.480> wire<00:02:31.690> at<00:02:32.230> one<00:02:32.530> end<00:02:32.829> just

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
you'll attach the wire at one end just

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.210 
you'll attach the wire at one end just
like<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:35.019> then<00:02:35.860> you're<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.010> going<00:02:36.159> to

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
like that and then you're just going to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.920 
like that and then you're just going to
hold<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.519> in<00:02:36.640> your<00:02:36.700> hand<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.180> start<00:02:37.420> cranking

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
hold it in your hand and start cranking

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.220 
hold it in your hand and start cranking
it<00:02:38.019> around<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.090> very<00:02:40.359> simple<00:02:40.690> technique

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
it around it's a very simple technique

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.170 
it around it's a very simple technique
and<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.769> have<00:02:41.950> one<00:02:42.129> here<00:02:42.310> that's<00:02:42.370> finished<00:02:42.939> so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and I have one here that's finished so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.349 
and I have one here that's finished so
this<00:02:43.359> is<00:02:43.480> our<00:02:43.599> little<00:02:43.750> finished<00:02:44.170> coil<00:02:45.359> we're

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
this is our little finished coil we're

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.300 
this is our little finished coil we're
going<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.569> take<00:02:46.840> our<00:02:47.290> quarter<00:02:47.709> inch<00:02:47.799> lazy

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
going to take our quarter inch lazy

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.649 
going to take our quarter inch lazy
Daisy<00:02:48.640> tool<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.829> at<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:50.950> end<00:02:51.099> of<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> tool

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
Daisy tool and at the end of the tool

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.559 
Daisy tool and at the end of the tool
there's<00:02:52.659> a<00:02:52.989> hole<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.889> bottom<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.569> that's

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
there's a hole in the bottom and that's

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.059 
there's a hole in the bottom and that's
where<00:02:55.780> we're<00:02:55.930> going<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.109> insert<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.500> 20<00:02:56.950> gauge

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
where we're going to insert a 20 gauge

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.580 
where we're going to insert a 20 gauge
wire<00:02:59.609> and<00:03:00.609> just<00:03:00.760> insert<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.690> wire<00:03:02.700> oops

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
wire and just insert that wire oops

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.199 
wire and just insert that wire oops
into<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.680> weave<00:03:05.859> it<00:03:06.159> just<00:03:06.340> sticks<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:06.909> maybe

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
into the weave it just sticks out maybe

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.910 
into the weave it just sticks out maybe
an<00:03:07.359> inch<00:03:07.540> or<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.049> then<00:03:08.560> we're<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.680> going

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
an inch or so and then we're just going

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.369 
an inch or so and then we're just going
to<00:03:08.950> start<00:03:09.190> cranking<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.819> around<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.540> it

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
to start cranking it around and it

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.199 
to start cranking it around and it
doesn't<00:03:11.709> matter<00:03:11.799> how<00:03:12.010> many<00:03:12.069> times<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.609> turn<00:03:12.909> I

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
doesn't matter how many times you turn I

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.530 
doesn't matter how many times you turn I
usually<00:03:13.420> go<00:03:13.720> four<00:03:13.989> or<00:03:14.079> five<00:03:14.230> times<00:03:15.359> then<00:03:16.359> I'm

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
usually go four or five times then I'm

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.449 
usually go four or five times then I'm
going<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.900> add<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.349> coil<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.919> I<00:03:18.040> made<00:03:18.480> and

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
going to add that coil that I made and

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.069 
going to add that coil that I made and
then<00:03:21.459> I'm<00:03:21.609> just<00:03:21.639> going<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.090> continue<00:03:22.599> to<00:03:22.900> twist

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
then I'm just going to continue to twist

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.949 
then I'm just going to continue to twist
it<00:03:23.290> around<00:03:23.379> and<00:03:24.150> then<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:25.239> have<00:03:25.389> a<00:03:25.419> coiled<00:03:25.780> end

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
it around and then we have a coiled end

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.360 
it around and then we have a coiled end
cap<00:03:26.169> and<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.470> can<00:03:26.650> add<00:03:26.799> an<00:03:26.949> embellishment

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
cap and you can add an embellishment

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.879 
cap and you can add an embellishment
here<00:03:27.849> or<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.120> can<00:03:28.299> just<00:03:28.480> make<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.319> curl<00:03:29.650> there

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
here or you can just make a curl there

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.220 
here or you can just make a curl there
to<00:03:30.069> close<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.430> off<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:31.599> now<00:03:31.780> what<00:03:31.959> I'm<00:03:32.049> going<00:03:32.199> to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
to close it off so now what I'm going to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.250 
to close it off so now what I'm going to
do<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.709> I'm<00:03:32.919> going<00:03:32.949> to<00:03:33.099> take<00:03:33.280> 20<00:03:33.879> gauge<00:03:34.060> wire

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
do is I'm going to take 20 gauge wire

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.479 
do is I'm going to take 20 gauge wire
it's<00:03:35.260> about<00:03:35.410> six<00:03:35.709> inches<00:03:35.949> of<00:03:36.069> 20<00:03:36.310> gauge<00:03:36.459> wire

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
it's about six inches of 20 gauge wire

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.330 
it's about six inches of 20 gauge wire
and<00:03:37.030> I'm<00:03:37.870> only<00:03:38.139> going<00:03:38.379> to<00:03:38.410> insert<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:38.980> into<00:03:39.129> the

last quarter inch of the Viking net as
opposed<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.609> other<00:03:42.730> method<00:03:43.120> where<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.299> went

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
opposed to the other method where I went

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.330 
opposed to the other method where I went
through<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.810> entire<00:03:43.900> thing<00:03:44.470> now<00:03:44.709> I'm<00:03:45.190> just

through the entire thing now I'm just

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.369 
through the entire thing now I'm just
going<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.519> put<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.849> in<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.120> last<00:03:46.389> quarter<00:03:47.139> inch

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
going to put it in the last quarter inch

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.490 
going to put it in the last quarter inch
of<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.829> of<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.220> weave<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:49.780> going<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.139> bend<00:03:50.319> it

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
of the of the weave I'm going to bend it

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.300 
of the of the weave I'm going to bend it
up<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:52.319> I'm<00:03:53.319> just<00:03:53.349> going<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.650> make<00:03:53.799> one<00:03:53.859> little

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
up and I'm just going to make one little

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.110 
up and I'm just going to make one little
wrap<00:03:55.980> just<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.340> hold<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.150> place<00:03:59.190> and<00:04:00.190> then

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
wrap just to hold it in place and then

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.210 
wrap just to hold it in place and then
we'll<00:04:01.239> trim<00:04:01.540> that

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.340 

then<00:04:05.060> we'll<00:04:05.330> just<00:04:05.450> be<00:04:05.600> putting<00:04:05.840> our<00:04:06.140> Viking

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
then we'll just be putting our Viking

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.380 
then we'll just be putting our Viking
knit<00:04:06.590> our<00:04:08.380> coiled<00:04:09.380> end<00:04:09.590> cap<00:04:09.800> over<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.340> end<00:04:11.150> of
