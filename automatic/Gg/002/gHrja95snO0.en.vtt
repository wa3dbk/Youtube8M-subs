00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
quarters close quarters a map um there's

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.569 
quarters close quarters a map um there's
a<00:00:51.480> lot<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.710> there's<00:00:52.710> quite<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> few<00:00:53.190> buildings

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
a lot of there's quite a few buildings

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.920 
a lot of there's quite a few buildings
in<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:55.350> doesn't<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.660> yeah<00:00:57.660> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
in here so it doesn't like yeah it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.099 
in here so it doesn't like yeah it
doesn't<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:59.539> you<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.840> it's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
doesn't have that you know it's it's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
doesn't have that you know it's it's
just<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.500> lot<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> close<00:01:01.980> quarters<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:02.609> what

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
just a lot of close quarters that's what

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.359 
just a lot of close quarters that's what
I'm<00:01:03.210> gonna<00:01:03.329> say<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.040> use<00:01:05.220> an

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
I'm gonna say right now you can use an

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.880 
I'm gonna say right now you can use an
assault<00:01:05.729> rifle<00:01:05.869> very<00:01:06.869> well<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.530> here

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
assault rifle very well like I do here

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.660 
assault rifle very well like I do here
in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> beginning<00:01:09.110> but<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> find<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
in the beginning but you know I find it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
in the beginning but you know I find it
easier<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> use<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> spec<00:01:12.960> series<00:01:13.110> rapid<00:01:13.439> fire

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
easier to use the spec series rapid fire

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
easier to use the spec series rapid fire
silencer<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.939> know<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> get

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
silencer just because you know you get

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.130 
silencer just because you know you get
that<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.680> faster<00:01:16.680> um<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.630> get

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that little faster um you get you get

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
that little faster um you get you get
faster<00:01:19.770> bullet<00:01:20.040> sound<00:01:20.189> range<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.909> everything

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
faster bullet sound range and everything

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.749 
faster bullet sound range and everything
like<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.290> don't<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
like that so I don't know it's it's a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.170 
like that so I don't know it's it's a
peripheral<00:01:24.090> preference<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> anyways

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180

any<00:02:28.290> upper<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.730> okay<00:02:30.000> i<00:02:30.030> mean<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.540> a

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
any upper but it's okay i mean it is a

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.110

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
guess it makes sense and that there's my

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.780 
guess it makes sense and that there's my
only<00:02:35.639> death<00:02:35.909> and<00:02:36.209> i<00:02:36.329> switched<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.719> the<00:02:37.790> spectre

ii with silencer rapid fire and such but

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.750 
ii with silencer rapid fire and such but
yeah<00:02:42.450> um<00:02:42.659> that's<00:02:43.139> i<00:02:43.620> mean<00:02:43.920> i<00:02:43.950> would<00:02:44.189> like<00:02:44.489> to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
yeah um that's i mean i would like to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.909 
yeah um that's i mean i would like to
see<00:02:44.969> another<00:02:45.209> map<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.349> that's<00:02:46.769> not

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
see another map like that but that's not

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.530 
see another map like that but that's not
the<00:02:47.099> case<00:02:47.250> because<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.730> last<00:02:47.909> map<00:02:48.120> pack<00:02:48.329> is

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
the case because the last map pack is

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.229 
the case because the last map pack is
resurrection<00:02:49.169> with<00:02:50.010> four<00:02:50.400> world<00:02:50.909> at<00:02:51.030> war
