00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 teaches you that light makes 300 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.700
 thousand kilometers a second is that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:18.510
 this speed can not be exceeded 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:23.039
 in the universe that is simple is 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.199
 defined by einstein so the light does not 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.380
 may not exceed 3 108 kilometers at the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.380
 second 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.510
 the mayor on stage tells us that they 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.910
 ie the energy equals me mc carey 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.450
 that is the speed of the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:48.719
 light stop if the speed and can 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:51.719
 not be exceeded in the universe we do not 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:58.039
 do not beat a little match these squares 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.989
 ie it's xc it's a maximum 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.890
 then it's the square it's a maximum of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:10.890
 maxime x maximum what is maximum x 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.350
 a maximum do you want to tell me well 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.259
 this maximum rate what can we 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.110
 not to exceed a maximum then it is necessary 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.939
 to choose or maybe it's over 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:30.150
 where it can not be, that is, or 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 well them equaled these squares it takes or 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.009
 it is admissible and in this case it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.479
 can be an ultra light at the same 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:43.380
 title even if we do not see it at the same 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.740
 title that you hear sounds I 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.570
 did not expect ultrasound modes 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.409
 dog hears him sounds over ultra 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.579
 fast than what you hear the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.649
 proof is that you can 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.360
 buy a whistle to buy your 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.219
 dog urge to ultrasound him will not hear 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.290
 and you will not hear them like the 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.770
 whale and our place the ultrasound 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.770
 and you do not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.520
 you have an author you can not 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.819
 challenge the genius in the 19th century you 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.209
 says that you are saying two things that are 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.209
 contradictory 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.830
 well it's very simple there is a 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.950
 struggle without light as there are 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.950
 ultrasound seti
