00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.150
 stretch 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.889
 I'm all from New Jersey of Thalia and every year and 7,990 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.160
 also better known 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.970
 as LG Optimus Speed ​​has been on the must 2x 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.710
 the whole pack more in this video but before that a few technical ones 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.079
 Data has her nanny the counter is a gigahertz dual-core processor with it 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.370
 Full HD possible 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.240
 «They can play it and also record Miami changes second 2 4 8 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.010
 megapixel camera as I said here with also full-hd record below 4 inches 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.480
 Display with a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.790
 so here we already have that women 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.790
 what they give to the boxes 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.150
 and what is striking is around 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.290
 that is beautiful bloom in any case 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.470
 looks pretty good in the hand and is not too difficult 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.680
 while looking into the camera like that, Aloysius plans to get a bit out of it 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.659
 also bad 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.299
 the chances of her later films we watch that there is something in the box 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.900
 so first in Baku and are dead 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320
 how much capacity first 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.810
 therefore, a thousand 500 mAh mAh is how long the battery lasts 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.710
 both Dulko and bounce around it if we communicate that then send 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.990
 through life 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 like the included headphone in-ear headphones 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.780
 Pedersen usb cable to sync and charge so by standards micro it 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.050
 goes to the normal USB 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.240
 he is running for the Northern Lights 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.830
 the manual 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.299
 which most of you probably will not need 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.500
 and it's supposed to get worse 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.940
 Scharners so now the smartphone to the first on that I now 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.930
 write down 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.650
 So I'm definitely not a friend of Karstadt 1 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.680
 We then ask for the front camera 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.600
 Bush in office was a sensor 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.280
 we have not been here for ten years 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.869
 on the bottom then the speaker 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.359
 and the micro usb port 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.749
 on the right side we have the volume keys 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.739
 and above the power button 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.260
 and a micro Halimis loudly so the riskier television can shoot 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.869
 and he has the airport 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.869
 on the back then the 8-megapixel camera with double-led flash 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.549
 the man then can see the Full HD videos 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.659
 in the back you enter the whole 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.659
 because you want to change your battery or the sim card or Nico 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.169
 sd cards 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.069
 it started a colored picture 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.129
 yes with the space for those with USB cards 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.889
 and for this the sim cards are standard 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.889
 and here comes here comes 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.280
 and after the turn on and set up you can see that the whole front 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.119
 is super fast 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.409
 Paleokostas company Dietz start Bayern they are open 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:05.430
 and the camera for a very short time as an example this really 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.179
 sitting tensed 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:12.159
 There will also be Amon testing pictures and videos and videos 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.649
 Income do not worry 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:18.079
 and here's the new testament to boxing hands-on video as I said earlier 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.039
 will be upgraded a few test images and the items and then some 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.279
 Test videos on my youtube channel for the whole country 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:29.429
 of course in Full HD so definitely my Jesus never seem to and 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:31.889
 a religion to the smartphone then follows of course
