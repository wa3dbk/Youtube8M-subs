subtle changes for example modifying the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469 
subtle changes for example modifying the

spacing adding some color and it really

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.060 
spacing adding some color and it really
makes<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.810> big<00:01:42.840> difference<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.560> looks<00:01:43.740> fresher

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
makes a big difference it looks fresher

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
and looks cleaner and just a little bit

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.450 
and looks cleaner and just a little bit
less<00:01:46.140> clunky<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> I've<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.070> say<00:01:47.250> I'm

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
less clunky and I've got to say I'm

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
less clunky and I've got to say I'm
really<00:01:47.610> liking<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.990> also<00:01:49.140> see

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
really liking it and you can also see

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.780 
really liking it and you can also see
how<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.740> design<00:01:50.040> philosophy<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.700> be

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
how this design philosophy can be

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.730 
how this design philosophy can be

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
that could be turned off though so we'll

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.970 
that could be turned off though so we'll
have<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.450> wait<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.599> see<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.440> reasons<00:02:29.830> have

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
have to wait and see the reasons have

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.770 
have to wait and see the reasons have
been<00:02:30.160> redesigned<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.880> reworked<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.480> looks<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
been redesigned and reworked it looks a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.660 
been redesigned and reworked it looks a
lot<00:02:31.959> more<00:02:32.020> like<00:02:32.350> google<00:02:32.739> chrome<00:02:32.980> tabs<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:33.550> it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
lot more like google chrome tabs but it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.220 
lot more like google chrome tabs but it
allows<00:02:33.910> more<00:02:34.150> instances<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.959> what<00:02:35.110> you've

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
allows more instances of what you've

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.260 
allows more instances of what you've
been<00:02:35.380> doing<00:02:35.770> ie<00:02:36.010> chrome<00:02:36.459> tabs<00:02:36.790> when<00:02:36.940> we<00:02:37.030> placed

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
been doing ie chrome tabs when we placed

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.970 
been doing ie chrome tabs when we placed
in<00:02:37.450> recents<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.050> sounds<00:02:38.530> interesting<00:02:38.950> but

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
in recents it sounds interesting but

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.350 
in recents it sounds interesting but
there<00:02:39.220> could<00:02:39.340> be<00:02:39.400> an<00:02:39.580> issue<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.970> having<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.239> lot

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
there could be an issue in having a lot

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.880 
there could be an issue in having a lot
of<00:02:40.390> tabs<00:02:40.660> open<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.170> we'll<00:02:41.290> have<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.530> see<00:02:41.709> how<00:02:41.739> it

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
of tabs open so we'll have to see how it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.440 
of tabs open so we'll have to see how it
handles<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.430> when<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.730> gets<00:02:42.849> released<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
handles that when it gets released and

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.809 
handles that when it gets released and
yet<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.170> default<00:02:44.530> run<00:02:44.680> time<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.100> now<00:02:45.250> art<00:02:45.519> or

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
yet the default run time is now art or

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.460 
yet the default run time is now art or
Android<00:02:46.209> runtime<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.750> don't<00:02:46.930> think<00:02:47.110> del<00:02:47.319> vic

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
will be included at all they made a lot

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.120 
will be included at all they made a lot
of<00:02:49.269> graph<00:02:49.540> showing<00:02:49.840> how<00:02:50.019> art<00:02:50.290> was<00:02:50.470> faster<00:02:50.950> more

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
of graph showing how art was faster more

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.680 
of graph showing how art was faster more
efficient<00:02:51.549> in<00:02:51.670> garbage<00:02:51.970> collection<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.569> what

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
efficient in garbage collection and what

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.059 
efficient in garbage collection and what
all<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:52.930> adds<00:02:53.140> up<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.350> for<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.709> average<00:02:53.890> user

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
all that adds up to for the average user

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.400 
all that adds up to for the average user
is<00:02:54.519> less<00:02:54.850> pauses<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.450> apps<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:55.900> less<00:02:56.140> lag

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
is less pauses and apps so less lag

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.229 
is less pauses and apps so less lag
faster<00:02:57.190> load<00:02:57.370> times<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.940> could<00:02:58.090> also

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
faster load times and it could also

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.390 
faster load times and it could also
possibly<00:02:58.569> help<00:02:58.989> out<00:02:59.140> with<00:02:59.260> battery<00:02:59.709> too<00:02:59.980> they

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
possibly help out with battery too they

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.309 
possibly help out with battery too they

as<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.069> entire<00:03:03.430> Android<00:03:03.940> L<00:03:04.120> platform<00:03:04.720> so

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
as is the entire Android L platform so

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.479 
as is the entire Android L platform so
we<00:03:05.260> now<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.650> need<00:03:05.739> hardware<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.340> take

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
we now just need hardware to take

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.220 
we now just need hardware to take
advantage<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.600> we<00:03:07.630> had<00:03:07.870> project

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
advantage of that so we had project

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.509 
advantage of that so we had project
butter<00:03:08.440> before<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:09.040> smoothness<00:03:09.280> and

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
butter before for smoothness and

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.550 
butter before for smoothness and
fluidity<00:03:09.730> we<00:03:10.180> now<00:03:10.330> have<00:03:10.569> projects<00:03:10.989> Volta<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
fluidity we now have projects Volta and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.229 
fluidity we now have projects Volta and
this<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.799> proper<00:03:12.280> initiative<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.910> help<00:03:12.940> with

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
this is a proper initiative to help with

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.479 
this is a proper initiative to help with
battery<00:03:13.569> consumption<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.230> saving<00:03:14.560> power<00:03:14.590> yep

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
battery consumption and saving power yep

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.710 
battery consumption and saving power yep
the<00:03:15.670> crowd<00:03:15.880> goes<00:03:16.090> wild<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.569> should

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the crowd goes wild it should

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.479 
the crowd goes wild it should
dramatically<00:03:17.290> decrease<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.890> consumption<00:03:18.370> of

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
you really need it it decreases CPU

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.910 
you really need it it decreases CPU
