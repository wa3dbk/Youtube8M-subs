a<00:02:18.239> little<00:02:18.569> awkward<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.379> that's<00:02:19.709> exactly<00:02:19.950> what

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
a little awkward and that's exactly what

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:24.949 
a little awkward and that's exactly what
it<00:02:20.310> was<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.969> host<00:02:22.909> can<00:02:23.909> tell<00:02:24.299> by<00:02:24.510> looking<00:02:24.810> at

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
