00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.960
 night then they know a red carpet and 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.289
 of course I have to look glamorous 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.570
 so good now let's prepare 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.510
 Jessica quickly show you that 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.489
 you are there in the house as you can say more 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.559
 radiant what you are but not matter 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.660
 five minutes because they're going to go through 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.800
 you have to go the folder starts 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.129
 of the mind begins and you have to be 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.320
 precious now let's start with the 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.120
 top section the only thing we have 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.289
 what to do is here if we are going to give a 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.670
 little volume 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:11.189
 nothing else you tomb the part 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 of what is to plant from your head we go 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.450
 to get a little bit of hair from this 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.149
 way section by section you occupy both 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 nothing else are two three sections what can 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.979
 be super fast this at home and stickers 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.200
 and for those times those that leave you 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.979
 planted that the stylist did not arrive or that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.850
 If I say that you had to go or whatever 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.860
 it tells me a little volume 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:43.610
 or a little sweater is made and here it is 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.009
 all the hair tries to grab a 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.220
 little bit of the laterals because 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:53.229
 I'm going to tell you that you're going to be with the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:58.789
 from the sides with the top 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:02.020
 you already have that volume and now sugar for 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:07.670
 delimit anything else you're going to put here 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:11.900
 we will be able to make a pointer but mom 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.550
 is so close to your head you have to 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.100
 notice 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.830
 since there is a space to carry 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.170
 so now what you are going to do is 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:30.020
 inside that rolling space of this 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:33.200
 invent way down then 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.500
 It is important that you notice how it is 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.230
 putting the league with the police below 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.540
 your own hair our tenth tris not 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.550
 I'm putting no padding is your 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:51.140
 own that we would see more intentions by 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:57.790
 nothing the step back is super simple 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:59.570
 called fixed again security 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.510
 Security depends on the application 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:10.269
 also if that's what you want to do 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:15.019
 your own and in the back 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:20.530
 only those held in this way is 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:23.989
 super fast but they did not lose anything 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:32.540
 only matters been French like 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:36.170
 we call and there we start to fix the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.110
 hair like pins want to give you a 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:51.799
 more special touch we have the soloist of 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:59.870
 metal that you can accommodate in that 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:04:02.090
 depending on this list and for 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.129
 finish of course the accessories and 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.069
 like today I'm inducing a dress 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.650
 black completely so I'm going to give you a 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.990
 little bit of color itself as it is an event of 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.190
 red carpet 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.200
 look nothing else these areas is pink 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:23.200
 pink sapphires from the charly collection 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:26.980
 laser and the right ring that coexist with 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.100
 the earrings as we use as I am 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.080
 wearing pink colors in accessories 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.840
 in the earrings and the ring what I'm going to 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.910
 use is going to be a pink lipstick does not have 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.440
 a lot of color is a little pale what 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.720
 can get in any store 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:51.270
 from the line in baby link and they are very 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:51.270
 practical then I simply remove
