00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
actually the first one we genuinely have

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.480

I really have to question what's going
on<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.830> club<00:02:42.040> when<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:43.000> sort<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.300> things

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
on the club when that sort of things

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.000 
on the club when that sort of things
happening<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:43.870> terms<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.470> us<00:02:44.620> bring<00:02:44.860> your

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
happening in terms of us bring your

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.380 
happening in terms of us bring your
mother<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.489> what<00:02:45.580> we<00:02:45.670> would<00:02:45.940> offer<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
mother in and what we would offer to the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.420 
mother in and what we would offer to the
team<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.810> think<00:02:47.170> he'd<00:02:47.350> be<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> phenomenal<00:02:47.830> sign

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
team I think he'd be a phenomenal sign

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.479 
team I think he'd be a phenomenal sign
in<00:02:48.640> yeah<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:49.920> we're<00:02:50.920> back<00:02:51.040> up<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> wrong<00:02:51.430> tree

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
in yeah but we're back up the wrong tree

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.010 
in yeah but we're back up the wrong tree
on<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.940> think<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:52.270> like<00:02:52.420> chasing<00:02:52.720> bail

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
on it I think it's like chasing bail

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.340 
on it I think it's like chasing bail
again<00:02:53.790> maybe<00:02:54.790> maybe<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:55.930> worse<00:02:56.170> than

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
again maybe maybe it's worse than

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.350 
again maybe maybe it's worse than
tracing<00:02:56.860> bail<00:02:57.010> because<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.280> think<00:02:57.459> bales<00:02:57.700> far

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
tracing bail because I think bales far

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.840 
tracing bail because I think bales far
more<00:02:58.510> likely<00:02:58.780> than<00:02:58.989> more<00:02:59.230> yeah<00:02:59.950> did<00:03:00.520> you<00:03:00.670> being

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
more likely than more yeah did you being

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.030 
more likely than more yeah did you being
unsettled<00:03:01.150> there<00:03:01.420> yeah<00:03:02.140> absolutely<00:03:02.530> ditches

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040

well<00:05:28.120> which<00:05:28.690> i<00:05:28.840> think<00:05:28.900> is<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.140> reason<00:05:29.350> why

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
well which i think is the reason why

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.560 
well which i think is the reason why
ever<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:29.890> are<00:05:29.980> able<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.550> stall<00:05:30.850> on<00:05:31.150> selling

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
ever and are able to stall on selling

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.150 
ever and are able to stall on selling
stones<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:32.050> either<00:05:32.170> rose<00:05:32.350> or<00:05:32.500> Chelsea<00:05:32.890> it<00:05:32.980> does

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
stones to either rose or Chelsea it does

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.590 
stones to either rose or Chelsea it does
seem<00:05:33.310> that<00:05:33.340> our<00:05:33.460> interest<00:05:34.120> seems<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.420> be<00:05:34.540> in

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
seem that our interest seems to be in

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.320 
seem that our interest seems to be in
genuine<00:05:34.900> in<00:05:35.050> him<00:05:35.140> yeah<00:05:35.410> and<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:35.680> think<00:05:35.740> that

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
genuine in him yeah and I think that

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.550 
genuine in him yeah and I think that
