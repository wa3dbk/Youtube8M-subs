well<00:00:07.319> we're<00:00:07.529> at<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.710> Morton<00:00:08.069> Arboretum<00:00:08.280> this

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
well we're at the Morton Arboretum this

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
measurements on trees and I said hey if

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.479 
measurements on trees and I said hey if
you<00:00:31.230> give<00:00:31.470> me<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.980> white<00:00:32.070> paint<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.460> a

cameras the fancy term is
stereophotogrammetry<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:49.260> means<00:00:49.950> we're

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
stereophotogrammetry that means we're

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.510 
stereophotogrammetry that means we're

been using a lot of other things

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.460 
been using a lot of other things
specifically<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:29.939> developed<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:31.140> NASA

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
specifically it was developed with NASA

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.469 
specifically it was developed with NASA
for<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> space<00:01:32.189> shuttle<00:01:32.460> program<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:33.180> look<00:01:33.329> at

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
for the space shuttle program to look at

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.510 
for the space shuttle program to look at
the<00:01:33.630> deformation<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> surfaces<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
space shuttle if it gets hit by an

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
space shuttle if it gets hit by an
object<00:01:37.200> which<00:01:37.650> did<00:01:37.950> cause<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> serious<00:01:38.909> problem

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
object which did cause a serious problem

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
object which did cause a serious problem
for<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.689> obviously<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.740> experiment<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
for it obviously this experiment is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
for it obviously this experiment is
destructive<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.659> trees<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.470> were<00:01:43.890> able<00:01:44.250> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
destructive of trees but we were able to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.460 
destructive of trees but we were able to
choose<00:01:44.759> ash<00:01:45.149> trees<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> study<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
choose ash trees for the study and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
choose ash trees for the study and
they're<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.280> gone<00:01:47.460> soon<00:01:47.790> anyway<00:01:48.299> so

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
they're going to be gone soon anyway so

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.270 
they're going to be gone soon anyway so
we're<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.200> harming<00:01:49.680> good<00:01:49.950> useful

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
we're really not harming good useful

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
we're really not harming good useful
