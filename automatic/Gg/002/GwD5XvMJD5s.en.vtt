downstream injector as you can see this

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.120 
downstream injector as you can see this
is<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.790> brand<00:00:06.000> new<00:00:06.150> injector<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:07.440> got<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> little

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
is a brand new injector I got a little

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.299 
is a brand new injector I got a little
o-ring<00:00:08.340> leak<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.030> there<00:00:09.240> as<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.660> can<00:00:09.690> see<00:00:10.309> you

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
o-ring leak in there as you can see you

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.650 
o-ring leak in there as you can see you
got<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.550> keep<00:00:11.670> these<00:00:11.880> fittings<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:12.509> some

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
got to keep these fittings with some

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.460 
got to keep these fittings with some
wd-40<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.559> them<00:00:14.210> when<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.330> try<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.570> quick

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
wd-40 on them when you try to quick

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.590 
wd-40 on them when you try to quick
couple<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.490> fitting<00:00:17.880> after<00:00:18.150> you've<00:00:18.240> had<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.480> on

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
couple of fitting after you've had it on

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.590 
couple of fitting after you've had it on
quite<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> while<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.710> sticky<00:00:20.600> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
quite a while it's kind of sticky and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.200 
quite a while it's kind of sticky and
then<00:00:22.080> old<00:00:22.260> rings<00:00:22.500> go<00:00:22.680> bad<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.910> here

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
then old rings go bad on you but here

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.730 
then old rings go bad on you but here
you<00:00:24.390> got<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> downstream<00:00:25.080> injector<00:00:25.560> you've

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you got the downstream injector you've

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.830 
you got the downstream injector you've
got<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.180> adjustment<00:00:27.180> right<00:00:27.330> therefore<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
got the adjustment right therefore the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.670 
got the adjustment right therefore the
chemical<00:00:27.990> flow

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
chemical flow

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.710 
chemical flow

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
you got a poly braided clear tube so

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.959 
you got a poly braided clear tube so
that<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.260> your<00:00:31.439> chemical<00:00:31.859> flow<00:00:32.070> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
that you can see your chemical flow we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.180 
that you can see your chemical flow we
just<00:00:33.210> use<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> bucket<00:00:33.800> right<00:00:34.800> there's<00:00:35.100> your

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
just use a bucket right there's your

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.420 
just use a bucket right there's your
soap<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.870> put<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> chemical

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
soap you can put these into a chemical

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.880 
soap you can put these into a chemical
tank<00:00:38.760> direct<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.170> them<00:00:40.379> feed<00:00:40.649> off<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
tank direct and have them feed off a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.440 
tank direct and have them feed off a
chemical<00:00:41.190> tank<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.030> permanently

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
chemical tank that you have permanently

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.720 
chemical tank that you have permanently
mounted<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.809> your<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.440> rig<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:44.520> just

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
mounted on your on your rig we just

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.279 
mounted on your on your rig we just
choose<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.390> way<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.840> way<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.140> can

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
choose to do it this way that way we can

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.680 
choose to do it this way that way we can
mix<00:00:46.469> our<00:00:46.590> chemicals<00:00:47.039> as<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.730> believe

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
mix our chemicals as we need to believe

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.660 
mix our chemicals as we need to believe
me<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:49.170> streaming<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.739> five-gallon<00:00:50.370> bucket

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
me down streaming a five-gallon bucket

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.810 
me down streaming a five-gallon bucket
is<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> lot<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.270> chemical<00:00:52.010> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.309> go<00:00:53.579> through

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
is a lot of chemical you can go through

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.760 
is a lot of chemical you can go through
it<00:00:53.910> quickly<00:00:53.940> though<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.320> don't<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.680> your

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
it quickly though if you don't have your

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.729 
it quickly though if you don't have your
adjustment<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.809> we<00:00:57.809> use<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> variable

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
adjustment right we use the variable

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
adjustment right we use the variable
pressure<00:00:59.250> wand<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> reason<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.539> use<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
pressure wand and the reason we use a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.660 
pressure wand and the reason we use a
variable<00:01:00.989> pressure<00:01:01.230> want<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
variable pressure want is is when you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.609 
variable pressure want is is when you
turn<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.120> handle<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.049> brings<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
turn this handle here it brings on the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.710 
turn this handle here it brings on the
chemicals<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> does<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.270> lowers<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
chemicals what it does is it lowers the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.149 
chemicals what it does is it lowers the
pressure<00:01:06.960> increases<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> volume<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.979> water

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
pressure increases the volume of water

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.570 
pressure increases the volume of water
thus<00:01:08.549> creates<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.720> injector<00:01:10.350> ball<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
thus creates that injector ball to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
thus creates that injector ball to
create<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.330> suction<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.990> sucks<00:01:13.560> right<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
create a suction and sucks right out of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.460 
create a suction and sucks right out of
that<00:01:14.189> bucket<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that bucket there there we go and it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.980 
that bucket there there we go and it
feeds<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.850> feeds<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.479> chemicals

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
feeds it actually feeds the chemicals

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.590 
feeds it actually feeds the chemicals
which<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.920> passed<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.490> pump<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.390> got<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
which is passed the pump you got to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.060 
which is passed the pump you got to
remember<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.350> past<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.830> pump

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
remember that this is all past the pump

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550 
remember that this is all past the pump
this<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.939> hose<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.540> goes<00:01:24.780> directly<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
this this hose here goes directly to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
this this hose here goes directly to
your<00:01:25.740> wand<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.640> you're<00:01:26.790> seeing<00:01:27.030> right

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
your wand is what you're seeing right

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.350 
your wand is what you're seeing right
there<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> everything<00:01:28.890> comes<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.520> beyond<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
there so everything comes in beyond the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
there so everything comes in beyond the
machine<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.530> coil<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> pump<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.630 
machine the coil and the pump which is
good<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.799> your<00:01:34.890> pump<00:01:35.220> you're<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.490> running

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
good for your pump you're not running

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.469 
good for your pump you're not running

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.760 
fire her up and I'm going to try to let
you<00:01:44.040> guys<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> flow<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.149> water<00:01:45.869> let's<00:01:46.590> see

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
you guys see the flow of water let's see

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.280 
you guys see the flow of water let's see
if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.060> don't<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.170> this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
if you can see it I don't know with this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.260 
if you can see it I don't know with this
camera<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.950> possibility<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.850> won't<00:01:51.060> be

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
camera it's possibility you won't be

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.929 
camera it's possibility you won't be
able<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.079> thus<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.729> what's

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
able to but thus this is this is what's

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.249 
able to but thus this is this is what's
supposed<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.240> happen<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> chemicals

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
supposed to happen is the chemicals

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.010 
supposed to happen is the chemicals
going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> come<00:01:55.649> through<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.990> make<00:01:57.990> sure

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
going to come through there make sure

00:01:58.020 --> 00:03:52.759 
going to come through there make sure
that<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.130> off

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.890 

and<00:03:53.769> that's<00:03:53.950> approximately<00:03:54.159> how<00:03:54.519> you're<00:03:54.700> down

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
and that's approximately how you're down

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.110 
and that's approximately how you're down
downstream<00:03:55.900> chemical<00:03:56.379> injector<00:03:56.709> works<00:03:57.120> of

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
downstream chemical injector works of

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.479 
downstream chemical injector works of
course<00:03:58.480> it's<00:03:58.659> a<00:03:58.720> matter<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.049> preference<00:03:59.489> how

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
course it's a matter of preference how

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.479 
course it's a matter of preference how
how<00:04:00.909> much<00:04:01.060> chemical<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.890> how<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:02.950> mix<00:04:03.310> the

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
how much chemical and how you mix the

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.039 
how much chemical and how you mix the
chemical<00:04:03.909> as<00:04:04.030> far<00:04:04.209> as<00:04:04.329> what<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.689> rate<00:04:04.870> you

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
chemical as far as what the rate you

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.770 
chemical as far as what the rate you
want<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.349> draw<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.560> chemical<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:06.250> whatnot

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
want to draw the chemical and whatnot

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.140 
want to draw the chemical and whatnot
but<00:04:07.780> that's<00:04:07.930> it
