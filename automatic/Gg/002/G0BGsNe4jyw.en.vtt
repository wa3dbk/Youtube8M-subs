into<00:00:26.099> when<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> think<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.630> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
into when I think that will see some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.550 
into when I think that will see some
fallout<00:00:28.050> 4<00:00:29.510> okay<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.810> obviously<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.410> this

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
fallout 4 okay so obviously on this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.139 
fallout 4 okay so obviously on this
channel<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.250> want<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.520> see<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:32.940> type<00:00:33.120> of

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
channel we all want to see some type of

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.670 
channel we all want to see some type of
thought<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.989> biggest<00:00:34.230> question<00:00:34.590> is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
thought for the biggest question is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
thought for the biggest question is
obviously<00:00:35.070> when<00:00:35.670> we'll<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.360> some<00:00:36.630> form<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.930> an

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
obviously when we'll see some form of an

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.560 
obviously when we'll see some form of an
announcement<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.860> when<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.520> release<00:00:38.910> so

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
announcement and when it will release so

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.910 
announcement and when it will release so
I<00:00:39.600> came<00:00:39.840> over<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.110> few<00:00:40.290> theories<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:40.770> own

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I came over the few theories of my own

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
I came over the few theories of my own
and<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.190> don't<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.820> delve<00:00:42.090> too

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and I don't think I can really delve too

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
and I don't think I can really delve too
deep<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:42.870> those<00:00:43.110> ideas<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> apologize<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
deep into those ideas so I apologize to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
deep into those ideas so I apologize to
this<00:00:44.399> video<00:00:44.670> ends<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:45.000> being<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.510> short

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
this video ends up being a little short

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
this video ends up being a little short
but<00:00:46.379> anyways<00:00:46.680> let's<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.039> into<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.309> so

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
but anyways let's get into it so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.700 
but anyways let's get into it so
basically<00:00:48.360> obviously<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:48.960> first<00:00:49.140> theory<00:00:49.559> is

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
basically obviously my first theory is

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.700 
basically obviously my first theory is
that<00:00:49.789> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> survivor<00:00:51.329> 2299<00:00:51.750> website<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.620> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
now it has in very very small text 1227

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.500 
now it has in very very small text 1227
13<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.190> tab<00:00:59.399> change<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> vault

boy<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.719> know<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.170> picture<00:01:01.500> next<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
boy you know a little picture next to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
boy you know a little picture next to
the<00:01:02.100> tab<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.850> your<00:01:02.879> browser<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:04.140> also

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the tab on your browser and then also

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
the tab on your browser and then also
there's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.129> new<00:01:05.250> song<00:01:05.460> playing<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there's a new song playing in the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
there's a new song playing in the
background<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.900> people<00:01:07.110> think<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> that's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
background so people think that that's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
background so people think that that's
just<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> CGI<00:01:08.939> trailer<00:01:09.360> by<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
just going to be the CGI trailer by the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
just going to be the CGI trailer by the
creator<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.320> website<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> always

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
creator of that website but I always

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.649 
creator of that website but I always
thought<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.299> there<00:01:12.450> might<00:01:12.600> be

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
thought you know that there might be

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.820 
thought you know that there might be
some<00:01:12.990> type<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> correlation<00:01:13.770> between

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
some type of correlation between

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
some type of correlation between
Bethesda<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.880> website<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
Bethesda and this website because the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.520 
Bethesda and this website because the
guy<00:01:15.750> script<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.950> he<00:01:17.130> wrote<00:01:17.340> adds<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.970> or

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
guy script that he wrote adds up or

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
guy script that he wrote adds up or
compares<00:01:19.530> well<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> script<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.060> kotaku

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
compares well to the script that kotaku

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
compares well to the script that kotaku
week<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.680> always<00:01:22.830> possible<00:01:23.100> that

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
week so it's always possible that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.429 
week so it's always possible that
something<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.990> behind

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
something really is going on behind

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
something really is going on behind
Bethesda<00:01:25.920> store<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.400> made<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> little

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
Bethesda store I made a little

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.300 
Bethesda store I made a little
commentary<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.869> earlier<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:29.009> ahead<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
commentary about it earlier go ahead and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.840 
commentary about it earlier go ahead and
check<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.750> anyways<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:32.340> feel<00:01:32.700> like

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
check it out but anyways I I feel like

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.069 
check it out but anyways I I feel like
that<00:01:33.030> might<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.479> some<00:01:33.689> form<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> an

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that might be some form of an

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.200 
that might be some form of an
announcement<00:01:34.560> trailer<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.430> CG<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
announcement trailer if the CG if the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140 
announcement trailer if the CG if the
survivor<00:01:36.930> 2299<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.009> Bethesda<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.700> actually

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
survivor 2299 and Bethesda are actually

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
survivor 2299 and Bethesda are actually
working<00:01:39.390> together<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.650> part<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
working together and this is all part of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
working together and this is all part of
their<00:01:41.040> plan<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:42.570> when

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
their plan I think that that's when

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
their plan I think that that's when
we'll<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.140> an<00:01:43.229> announcement<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.890> obviously

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
we'll see an announcement and obviously

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.240 
we'll see an announcement and obviously
I'm<00:01:44.579> going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> take<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> simple<00:01:45.540> route<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
I'm going to take the simple route and

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.109 
I'm going to take the simple route and
another<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> think<00:01:47.640> we're<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> see

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
another way I think we're going to see

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.929 
another way I think we're going to see
this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> an<00:01:48.960> e3<00:01:49.140> because<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> feel<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.490> we're

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
this is an e3 because I feel that we're

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.880 
this is an e3 because I feel that we're
not<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.659> fall<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:52.470> soon<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.770> we

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
not going to see fall for as soon as we

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.069 
not going to see fall for as soon as we
want<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.790> honestly<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.780> if

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
want to see it I honestly think that if

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.749 
want to see it I honestly think that if
you<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.680> look<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.219> Skyrim<00:01:56.610> came

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you really look back at it Skyrim came

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.389 
you really look back at it Skyrim came
out<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:56.969> 2011<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.590> years<00:01:58.860> from<00:01:59.130> now<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
out in 2011 so for years from now you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.580 
out in 2011 so for years from now you
know<00:01:59.790> 2015<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> when<00:02:00.960> we'll<00:02:01.110> probably<00:02:01.320> see

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
know 2015 is when we'll probably see

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
know 2015 is when we'll probably see
fallout<00:02:01.920> 4<00:02:02.219> that's<00:02:02.759> my<00:02:02.939> honest<00:02:03.240> opinion

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
fallout 4 that's my honest opinion

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.030 
fallout 4 that's my honest opinion
because<00:02:03.840> obviously<00:02:04.200> they're<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.770> gonna<00:02:04.890> have

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
because obviously they're not gonna have

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.980 
because obviously they're not gonna have
their<00:02:05.159> whole<00:02:05.460> team<00:02:05.670> working<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.180> DLC<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.210 
their whole team working on DLC for a
year<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> mean<00:02:07.560> they're<00:02:07.710> gonna<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> little

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
year I mean they're gonna have a little

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.559 
year I mean they're gonna have a little
bit<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> their<00:02:08.610> team<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.060> not<00:02:09.179> their<00:02:09.390> whole

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
bit of their team but not their whole

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.780 
bit of their team but not their whole
focus<00:02:10.140> team<00:02:10.379> working<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.310> DLC<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:11.910> their<00:02:12.180> game

know<00:02:30.189> announcement<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.180> then<00:02:32.049> we're<00:02:32.200> going

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
know announcement and then we're going

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.190 
know announcement and then we're going
to<00:02:32.349> see<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.620> around<00:02:32.799> spring<00:02:33.810> 2015<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:35.140> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
to see it around spring 2015 now the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.619 
to see it around spring 2015 now the
reason<00:02:35.409> I<00:02:35.590> say<00:02:35.620> spring<00:02:36.159> is<00:02:36.400> because<00:02:37.180> I

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
reason I say spring is because I

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.539 
reason I say spring is because I
realized<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.409> Bethesda<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.040> all<00:02:39.400> these

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
realized that Bethesda and all these

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.860 
realized that Bethesda and all these
Elder<00:02:39.939> Scrolls<00:02:40.239> games<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.599> stuff<00:02:40.720> have

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
Elder Scrolls games and stuff have

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.869 
Elder Scrolls games and stuff have
started<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> release<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.530> know<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.099> 11<00:02:42.459> 11<00:02:42.790> 11

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
started a release you know the 11 11 11

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.390 
started a release you know the 11 11 11
for<00:02:43.750> Skyrim<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.469> then<00:02:44.709> for<00:02:45.159> for<00:02:45.459> 14<00:02:46.030> for<00:02:47.400> ESO

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
for Skyrim and then for for 14 for ESO

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.830 
for Skyrim and then for for 14 for ESO
and<00:02:48.700> now<00:02:48.909> i'm<00:02:49.060> assuming<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.569> we're<00:02:49.689> going<00:02:49.780> to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
and now i'm assuming that we're going to

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.429 
and now i'm assuming that we're going to
see<00:02:50.049> something<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.500> 5<00:02:51.129> 515<00:02:51.939> for<00:02:52.659> Fallout<00:02:53.139> 4<00:02:53.409> I

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
see something like 5 515 for Fallout 4 I

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.240 
see something like 5 515 for Fallout 4 I
feel<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:53.919> would<00:02:53.980> be<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.099> little

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
feel like that would be a little

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.860 
feel like that would be a little
interesting<00:02:54.609> trend<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.269> they'd<00:02:55.450> run<00:02:55.689> with

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
interesting trend that they'd run with

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.539 
interesting trend that they'd run with
it<00:02:56.019> that's<00:02:56.290> my<00:02:56.500> prediction<00:02:56.769> I'm<00:02:57.189> not<00:02:57.340> saying

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
it that's my prediction I'm not saying

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.030 
it that's my prediction I'm not saying
that's<00:02:57.730> anything<00:02:58.169> accurate<00:02:59.169> or<00:02:59.379> correct<00:02:59.799> or

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
that's anything accurate or correct or

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.649 
that's anything accurate or correct or
something<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.489> should<00:03:00.639> definitely<00:03:00.849> bank<00:03:01.419> on

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
something you should definitely bank on

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.300 
something you should definitely bank on
but<00:03:02.169> I<00:03:02.230> feel<00:03:02.409> like<00:03:02.439> that<00:03:02.680> would<00:03:02.769> be<00:03:02.829> something

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
but I feel like that would be something

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.099 
but I feel like that would be something
that<00:03:03.459> makes<00:03:03.700> sense<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.239> know<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.840> Bethesda

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
that makes sense I know that Bethesda

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.720 
that makes sense I know that Bethesda
games<00:03:05.560> are<00:03:05.709> known<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:06.069> release<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.579> fall

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
games are known to release in the fall

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.940 
games are known to release in the fall
so<00:03:07.720> that's<00:03:07.930> why<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:08.109> was<00:03:08.290> assuming<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.859> know

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
so that's why I was assuming you know

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.890 
so that's why I was assuming you know
they<00:03:09.129> announced<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:09.639> at<00:03:09.730> VGX<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.540> then<00:03:10.659> one

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
they announced it at VGX and then one

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.580 
they announced it at VGX and then one
year<00:03:11.109> later<00:03:11.319> in<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.069> fall<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.720> 2014<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:14.319> see

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
year later in the fall of 2014 we see

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.670 
year later in the fall of 2014 we see
fallout<00:03:15.250> 4<00:03:15.959> obviously<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.079> wasn't<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.470> case

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
fallout 4 obviously that wasn't the case

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.039 
fallout 4 obviously that wasn't the case
and<00:03:17.949> we<00:03:18.040> were<00:03:18.159> all<00:03:18.280> wrong<00:03:18.549> unfortunately<00:03:19.049> but

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
and we were all wrong unfortunately but

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.899 
and we were all wrong unfortunately but
maybe<00:03:20.349> you<00:03:20.470> will<00:03:20.590> see<00:03:20.769> as<00:03:21.099> soon<00:03:21.430> as<00:03:21.609> packs

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
maybe you will see as soon as packs

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.420 
maybe you will see as soon as packs
