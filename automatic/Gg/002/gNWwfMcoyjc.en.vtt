 is looking forward to a good try on Wednesday 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
 good to know better than nothing 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.539
 because this website 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.849
 Â«I want, I want, I want, I want 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.849
 for the current year profile 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.839
 why not earlier 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.219
 whether we are sorry for us at these moments 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.959
 stored 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.850
 No that is 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.239

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.499
 Sorrow used 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.819
 I decided to do it myself. You just have to spend more on my own 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.529
 own 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.369
 how to do it all without music it could be done without any music 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.970
 opinion 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.970
 ultimately believe 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.499
 well friends so i want you to go zel for the way out of the crisis 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:11.630

 Analyst Philipp Leipold was also this year on site 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.139
 but that's not really the case so it's serious 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.469
 a long and arduous way behind me 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.589
 arrived by train but it takes a long time 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:28.069
 and then that's an outrage and I was prompt 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.009
 the person in charge threatens less promise immediately as long as he sits 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.869
 on the back left outside 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.549
 left Wing 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.009
 otherwise if not 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.009
 I prefer to stay friendly alone 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.939
 Roland Willeke from Haiti 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.269

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.519
 the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.959

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.109
 Mars and moon got stuck 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.509
 ca 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.769

 Federer starts again with the SPD 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.769

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.900
 the virus is 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.259
 that should be first 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.259
 he fared he knows he's going to leave 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.009
 just is 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:44.669
 I finally got the city 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.229

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.229
 the foreign minister he threw them then introduced 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.870
 more 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.360
 be dispensable 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.550
 We are going away for the first time
