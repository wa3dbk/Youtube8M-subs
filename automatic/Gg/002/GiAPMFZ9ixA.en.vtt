00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
script and we are actually doing what we

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.580 
script and we are actually doing what we
say<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> tin<00:00:27.109> so<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.560> I

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
say on the tin so as you can see I

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.710 
say on the tin so as you can see I
pulled<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.250> Maria<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.880> think<00:00:30.359> he<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
pulled the Maria I think he was in a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.160 
pulled the Maria I think he was in a
reasonable<00:00:31.109> formation<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:31.800> well<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> yeah

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
reasonable formation as well so yeah

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.160 
reasonable formation as well so yeah
last<00:00:34.890> time<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> checked<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.790> 12<00:00:36.059> 12<00:00:36.420> he<00:00:37.020> was

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
last time I checked for 12 12 he was

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.560 
last time I checked for 12 12 he was
selling<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:37.469> around<00:00:37.680> 11<00:00:38.280> k<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.030> he<00:00:39.300> still<00:00:39.480> had

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
selling for around 11 k and he still had

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.010 
selling for around 11 k and he still had
20<00:00:39.840> minutes<00:00:39.870> left<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> bad<00:00:41.520> pack<00:00:42.020> but

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
20 minutes left so not a bad pack but

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
20 minutes left so not a bad pack but
certainly<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.590> great<00:00:44.489> when<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> consider

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
certainly not great when you consider

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180 
certainly not great when you consider
that<00:00:45.239> Cristiano<00:00:45.780> Ronaldo<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> informs

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that Cristiano Ronaldo is in the informs

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.299 
that Cristiano Ronaldo is in the informs
this<00:00:47.370> week<00:00:47.899> as<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.989> said<00:00:49.170> before<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.920> pull<00:00:50.190> an

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
this week as I said before we do pull an

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.090 
this week as I said before we do pull an
in-form<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.590> you'd<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> wait<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.010> see

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
in-form but you'd have to wait and see

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.830 
in-form but you'd have to wait and see
whether<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> good<00:00:54.059> ones<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.660> one

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
whether it's one of the good ones or one

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020 
whether it's one of the good ones or one
of<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> average<00:00:55.289> ones<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.430> reason<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.760> didn't

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
of the average ones the reason I didn't

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.369
