00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
because I might have been scarred for

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.660 
because I might have been scarred for
life<00:03:09.900> because<00:03:10.320> my<00:03:10.590> mom<00:03:10.800> used<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.280> make<00:03:11.310> me

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
life because my mom used to make me

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.180 
life because my mom used to make me
reach<00:03:11.940> into<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> pumpkin<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.410> pull<00:03:14.070> out
