from<00:02:14.500> Rochelle<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:16.299> you<00:02:17.299> can<00:02:17.510> see<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
from Rochelle here you can see on the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.310 
from Rochelle here you can see on the
back<00:02:18.560> side<00:02:18.829> here<00:02:18.890> how<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> have<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:20.019> curbed<00:02:21.019> a

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
back side here how I have it curbed a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.870 
back side here how I have it curbed a
little<00:02:21.560> bit<00:02:21.709> if<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.400> see<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.610> curvature

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
little bit if you can see the curvature

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
little bit if you can see the curvature
of<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.280> let's<00:02:25.430> curb<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.910> little<00:02:26.150> bit<00:02:26.299> this

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
of it so let's curb a little bit this

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.920 
of it so let's curb a little bit this
point<00:02:27.739> right<00:02:27.950> here<00:02:28.060> will<00:02:29.060> be<00:02:29.209> where<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.600> model

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
point right here will be where the model

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.880 
point right here will be where the model
portion<00:02:30.410> starts<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:33.049> it's<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> double

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
portion starts and then it's a double

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.030 
portion starts and then it's a double
crossover

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.190 

and<00:02:39.040> then<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.340> do<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.300> Mississippi

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
and then we do have the Mississippi

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.370 
and then we do have the Mississippi
River<00:02:41.230> Bridge<00:02:41.680> in<00:02:41.950> finally<00:02:42.570> with<00:02:43.570> tracks<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
River Bridge in finally with tracks and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.920 
River Bridge in finally with tracks and
it<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.620> operational<00:02:48.360> good<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.480> see<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.780> up

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
it is operational good to see it up

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.220 
it is operational good to see it up
again<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:52.210> you<00:02:52.330> put<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.250> backdrop<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.790> u.s.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
again and you put the backdrop of a u.s.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.790 
again and you put the backdrop of a u.s.
30<00:02:56.230> bridge<00:02:56.620> up<00:02:56.890> behind<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.910> also<00:02:58.590> still<00:02:59.590> need

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
30 bridge up behind it also still need

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.010 
30 bridge up behind it also still need

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
Bridge then I did put in a little bit of

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.490 
Bridge then I did put in a little bit of
bench<00:03:14.740> work<00:03:14.980> here<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.640> join<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.960> Mississippi

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500

River to what is Franklin Grove this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.510 
River to what is Franklin Grove this
also<00:03:23.740> was<00:03:24.070> moved<00:03:24.400> from<00:03:24.690> Rochelle<00:03:25.690> as<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:27.370> can

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
also was moved from Rochelle as you can

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.160 
also was moved from Rochelle as you can
tell<00:03:27.730> did<00:03:28.630> not<00:03:28.840> have<00:03:29.140> room<00:03:29.380> for<00:03:29.650> fulton<00:03:30.570> but<00:03:31.570> we

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
tell did not have room for fulton but we

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.400 
tell did not have room for fulton but we
do<00:03:32.860> have<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.580> going<00:03:34.060> from<00:03:35.010> mississippi<00:03:36.010> river

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
do have it going from mississippi river

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.490 
do have it going from mississippi river
there's<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.440> little<00:03:38.590> bit<00:03:38.800> of<00:03:39.900> countryside<00:03:40.900> and

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
there's a little bit of countryside and

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.640 
there's a little bit of countryside and
then<00:03:41.800> into<00:03:42.160> franklin<00:03:42.520> grove<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:44.140> it's<00:03:44.260> kind<00:03:44.620> of

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
then into franklin grove so it's kind of

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.750 
then into franklin grove so it's kind of
a<00:03:44.770> shortcut<00:03:45.250> across<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.600> state<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.840> Illinois

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
a shortcut across the state of Illinois

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.640 
a shortcut across the state of Illinois
but<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:49.690> do<00:03:49.870> have<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.760> nice<00:03:51.760> long<00:03:52.450> stretch<00:03:53.290> of

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
but you do have a nice long stretch of

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.940 
but you do have a nice long stretch of
straightaway<00:03:54.370> here<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:55.050> think<00:03:56.050> this<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.710> going

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
straightaway here I think this is going

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.500 
straightaway here I think this is going
to<00:03:57.010> turn<00:03:57.130> out<00:03:57.280> really<00:03:57.430> nice<00:03:57.760> once<00:03:58.090> we<00:03:58.270> get<00:03:58.390> it

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
to turn out really nice once we get it

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.280 
to turn out really nice once we get it
all<00:03:59.730> scenic<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.090> forth<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.960> pretty
