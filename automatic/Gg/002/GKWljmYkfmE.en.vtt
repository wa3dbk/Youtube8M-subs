00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 try so all the record went let's 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.920
 tell me what you came up with then 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.900
 already realized and tell me your experience yes not 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.710
 then to come up with just say as 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.560
 came to this was very expensive 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.020
 the initial cost of 2 million was waiting 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.350
 drop in price drop to 50 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.619
 percent there is somewhere a million two hundred heap 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.449
 scrap metal patches broken machines 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.360
 railroad tank cars there 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.340
 bulldozer and any such noodle like how 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.219
 would take and clever it happened and found 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.040
 investor went see in the end these 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.300
 cistern there still were separate lot fats 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.390
 the rest went to watch 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.370
 I look at the state as they give but there is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 what to take as I just understand 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 because there are wheelsets for example 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.579
 need to straighten so easy on 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.219
 scrap will pass and it will be more expensive than 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.270
 metal pass but you looked what those 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:04.260
 cisterns purchased by a man of Moscow 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.100
 before this one bought doroguschy that's what their 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.210
 you can not pass for scrap to pass 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.430
 much more expensive to sell that is immediately 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 set something on metal something 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.350
 sell more but you come to the conclusion that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.110
 need to find contacts of this person and we 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.909
 offer him my help 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:26.009
 sales of this lot as he would have passed 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.140
 then clearly on the metal I can it turns out that 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.939
 I rescued him more money 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.310
 but also accordingly get it 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.400
 some percentage well how would it be for 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.670
 novices who do not have much experience author 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.380
 proud 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.659
 seed capital who has no 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.460
 In principle, I think a good option for 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.950
 third and your region in your city 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.320
 even desirable some lots which 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.899
 recently deals were attempted 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.159
 somehow find contacts 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.439
 data on the name of the middle name 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.420
 registration it is possible to see the protocol 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.189
 if registered on the site these 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.469
 data, respectively, you will see 20 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.689
 phone already have will be more difficult 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.850
 somehow have a competitive knock out well or 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.950
 some connections were connected opera so 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.420
 to return 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.630
 phone to phone well and there already 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.120
 as your power of conviction or 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.040
 that's how much you want to earn there they are 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.160
 know to negotiate as because i 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.730
 I think that the person who is in 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.950
 Moscow 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.870
 and yak sibiri am him if he 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.510
 there is no one who would help me date for 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.520
 him this is a good option if i go out 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.440
 himself to him on the link and offered his 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.650
 help not for a certain percent of this 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.690
 deal well here is one to the initial 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.060
 capital I consider it as very 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.370
 not a bad way to try to start like this 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.790
 for 1 and out spelled malenkov bidding somewhere 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.100
 something 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.870
 ask around there with the same person 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.630
 which has acquired experience 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.890
 get your life in your city 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.680
 as at ease 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.350
 you know you know where that in saffron how would 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.140
 sell there resell someone I think 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.140
 it is easier than selling to Moscow 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.620
 actual you suggest 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.420
 intermediary services for investors 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.700
 who invest she already 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.950
 fact you take the protocol look 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.940
 the investor who won and offer 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.750
 his mediation services are in place 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:22.770
 I did this in principle, I was looking for these 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.300
 people was to communicate through contact either 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.790
 through social networks there they are not 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.010
 hiding not hiding under 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.490
 pseudonyms in principle I found them 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.270
 communicated 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.710
 you still have one house there without giving 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.260
 I 'll tell you now in order not to be 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.410
 there is also one intermediary deal of it 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.320
 from our club is obtained from found 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.310
 chateau man asked me to be 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.120
 intermediary in the sale 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.180
 armored car there vkontakte there are photos 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.849
 with perhaps an armored car and left six months is necessary 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.380
 it was trite to know 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.480
 intermediary services I also received 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.540
 percent so unexpectedly it drove its 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.550
 to make a piece of ice basically and made 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.220
 and at the same time helped him find clients on 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.640
 this holiday deal with him now 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.380
 the armored car is already sold already goes 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.150
 sometimes there we have money for honest just 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.380
 agreed in installments well the nuances were 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.790
 probably will be in a separate video messenger 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.470
 speak so that I do not even have a sense of 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.290
 he is just unexpected mediating 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.169
 services and it turns out there is a standard 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.300
 percentage laid rough 10 percent over 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.160
 mediation about me 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.430
 even more because we agreed 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.350
 mate a certain amount he owes 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.800
 pick up and everything gets too i will turn off 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.889
 above 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.340
 I take it away from me 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:48.820
 this year's fun to fuck myself 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.060
 anticipated something a little gripping principle 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.160
 while all and tell you still know 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.169
 differently they are still doing today 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.940
 It looks like another year has sold too 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.560
 intermediary tell 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.250
 weight and now interesting frame for you 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.210

 Hyper send want to pick up 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.940

 appeared there we sell it in a 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.300
 you help me to understand what 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.120
 In order to have an example of this he 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.039
 alignment you probably for those who will 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.860
 watch the video will need to mention 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.380
 so that they leave their contacts 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.850
 in a certain place on the interest giving 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.500
 I'll throw off and then my son will move 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.960
 where would they leave contacts where you 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.190
 collected all the contacts in order to 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.289
 mediate for 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.440
 photographing lots to go to the place 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.300

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.090
 for sales assistance be an intermediary on 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.930
 the place probably will and you will 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.900
 add yes it seems, in principle, more 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.670
 nothing yet 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.550
 interesting video unexpectedly even for 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.800
 how can i make money myself 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.930
 the question is just not having started the capital and 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.960
 digital signature rector and by the way 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.840
 nehilo earned help that mutu already 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.810
 in the lenses 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.810
 Then, all come to regard
