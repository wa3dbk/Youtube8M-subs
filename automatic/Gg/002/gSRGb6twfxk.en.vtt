00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hello, did you ever imagine hearing your 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.370
 calopsita singing imitating the sound 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.290
 similar to your favorite song or hymn 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.099
 of your team or even a simple 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.520
 I whistled that I would leave your friends and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.800
 family members is not really 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.109
 so stay with me until the end of this 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.720
 video where I'll teach you the four 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.460
 steps to succeed in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.170
 corner training of your calopsita 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 Let me introduce myself. I'm Fabian. 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.329
 physician 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.290
 in birds and as much as you and I adore 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 calopsitas calopsitas are creatures 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.180
 which naturally emit sounds and some 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.210
 use their singing skills 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 not all the songs are 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.219
 natural singers but many club quotes 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.469
 are able to learn how to sing 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.750
 mainly males 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.590
 so let's start the step by step the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.820
 first step is to trust 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.270
 First I would like to tell a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.150
 story for you I get several 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.189
 customers every day asking how 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.189
 take that pool in your hand without being 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.860
 chopped or almost all my 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.409
 clients take their hand on top of the bird as 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.070
 if you were to take an object and it is not well 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.439
 like this 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.930
 no human being so much animal 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.049
 likes to do something by extreme pressure 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.150
 it's not good the calopsitas are not 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.549
 many different 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.369
 this image shows the correct way 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.829
 to pick up a small calopsita approaching the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.829
 finger next to her chest leaving her 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.180
 climbing alone on your finger is not expensive 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.939
 that you will be able to make a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.320
 she has to be at the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:53.299
 she needs to gain confidence and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.770
 how to gain confidence from your calopsita 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.450
 first of all its calopsita has to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.140
 to be comfortable in the environment in which 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.210
 lives 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.880
 It seems strange that I'm going to talk but the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.520
 she has to be well fed 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.710
 in other words, with health in 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.050
 watch what she likes best 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.979
 to eat such as seeds of 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.610
 sunflower 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.350
 if this food was preferred 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.420
 I started to walk smoothly 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.370
 controlled from time to time 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.960
 only when you've been wanting to win 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.390
 your confidence 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.280
 understood first we won the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.130
 confidence of our bird through the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.350
 tummy or better of the chat 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.450
 from there soft foods with 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.960
 sunflower at any time you wish and 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.290
 train her to deliver grain to grain with 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.240
 a form of reward 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.700
 ready from there she will be your best 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.990
 companion is the key point to make 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.730
 various drills and games with soft 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.140
 so let's go to the second step 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.720
 the environment is good when you go to study 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.120
 or focus for a test or something 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.010
 the kind you do 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.400
 if your answer was to look for a 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.570
 Calm quiet environment with none or 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.510
 few people 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.700
 you will understand this step with the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.910
 your calopsita is no different 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.130
 she needs to be in a calm environment 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.440
 without shouting television noise 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.130
 child or even hitting noise 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.900
 pan mixer and blender 60 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.049
 preference in trained in the place where 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.580
 she likes to stay with where she usually 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.769
 stay fit 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.590
 an example if your cage is in your 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.950
 room and birds feel at ease 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.860
 then that is where you should train there there 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.120
 an important point when we talk 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.910
 of environment, right? 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.570
 we must also remember the safety of the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.640
 life is nothing of cats or dogs 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.790
 next to av in training time and 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.380
 animals can bring insecurity to 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.299
 leaving them inhibited and with fear beauty 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.320
 So we're going to the third party 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:05.299
 step that is the frequency frequency 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.120
 is related to the number of training 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.019
 and daily time of each workout that you 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.019
 will have to teach 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.459
 I recommend starting with training with a 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.430
 small sounds like here the whistle 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.340
 to feel only copy you will have to learn with 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.250
 ease to learn step to sound 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.270
 more extensive as your team's anthem 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.879
 a part of your favor music 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.199
 the initially recommended time is 10 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.360
 minutes to class 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.180
 separated in two periods or 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.310
 morning training for ten minutes and 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.099
 late for another 10 minutes do this 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.150
 every day repeating the sound 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.120
 wanted 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.460
 not seen by repeating she learns 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.449
 Repeat several songs at the same time. 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.099
 time 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:57.469
 teach one first and then another one 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.509
 good option is to buy a cd corner 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:02.080
 Specialized To Teach Dating Club 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.610
 this cd is bought at pet shops 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.580
 so be let 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.500
 repeating only makes the desired track 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.050
 for 10 minutes 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.430
 you can increase class time with the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.120
 good time we go to the fourth and last 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.430
 step the reward 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.400
 Let's start with an example, just imagine. 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.889
 It's very rewarding to win something later. 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.860
 of a very difficult task is not really 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.589
 get a good grade after several 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.719
 study hours or win a trophy after 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:37.120
 a competition where you trained a lot 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.610
 Is not it 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.110
 so like I said in the first step 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.069
 reward for the effort of the 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.580
 learning 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:49.520
 this is always always after each workout 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.139
 offer your favorite food and 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.969
 much affection 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:58.279
 the bird recognizes this gratification 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.860
 good guys let's recap then 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:05.180
 step by step you must first win 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:10.129
 the second gentle confidence is to train her 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.199
 in a comfortable third environment make the 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:16.099
 frequency of learning 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:18.770
 that is, there are two periods with 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:23.120
 ten minutes each period and the fourth 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:26.539
 always gentle reward with these 45 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.289
 space you will have a friendly friend 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:33.319
 and mainly professional singer 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.209
