it we were using 40 and 50 pound and
still<00:01:49.560> having<00:01:49.890> trouble<00:01:50.250> keeping<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.640> fish

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
still having trouble keeping the fish

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.210 
still having trouble keeping the fish
off<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> rocks<00:01:51.360> another<00:01:52.350> outfit<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.040> use

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
off the rocks another outfit you can use

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.639 
off the rocks another outfit you can use
is<00:01:53.430> something<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.170> again<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.500> go

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
is something like this again you can go

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.429 
is something like this again you can go
ahead<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> put<00:01:56.310> some<00:01:56.340> spectra<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.630> 60

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
ahead and put some spectra on it like 60

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.289 
ahead and put some spectra on it like 60
or<00:01:58.590> 80<00:01:58.619> pound<00:01:59.100> probably<00:01:59.549> 80<00:01:59.729> pounds<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.270> I

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
or 80 pound probably 80 pounds what I

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
or 80 pound probably 80 pounds what I
would<00:02:00.540> put<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.500> 30<00:02:01.860> pound<00:02:02.159> monofilament

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
would put and then 30 pound monofilament

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.609 
would put and then 30 pound monofilament
on<00:02:02.909> top<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.810> would<00:02:03.899> work<00:02:04.049> perfect<00:02:04.560> for

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
on top and it would work perfect for

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
on top and it would work perfect for
this<00:02:04.799> type<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> fishing<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.450> how<00:02:06.570> you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
this type of fishing and that's how you

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.570 
this type of fishing and that's how you
need<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.079> now<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.560> far<00:02:07.770> as<00:02:07.829> hooks<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.459> need

on for the shallower water you really
don't<00:02:28.500> need<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> sinker<00:02:29.099> but<00:02:29.280> if<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.549> a

will work well too if you don't know how

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.309 
will work well too if you don't know how

out<00:03:00.540> really<00:03:00.720> good<00:03:01.040> now<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.670> last<00:03:02.909> way<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.299> would

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
out really good now the last way I would

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.899 
out really good now the last way I would
suggest<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.349> fish<00:03:04.560> for<00:03:04.739> yellows<00:03:05.069> would<00:03:05.760> be

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
suggest you fish for yellows would be

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:06.979 
suggest you fish for yellows would be
with<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.209> metal<00:03:06.480> jig

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
with the metal jig

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.289 
with the metal jig
now<00:03:07.470> I've<00:03:07.620> here<00:03:07.799> at<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.069> local<00:03:08.579> areas<00:03:08.970> here<00:03:09.209> in

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
now I've here at the local areas here in

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.630 
now I've here at the local areas here in
Long<00:03:09.450> Beach<00:03:09.690> area<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.379> 150<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.430> would

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
Long Beach area like the 150 this would

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.069 
Long Beach area like the 150 this would
probably<00:03:11.819> be<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.269> number<00:03:12.540> one<00:03:12.690> method

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
probably be the number one method

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.649 
probably be the number one method
because<00:03:13.709> you're<00:03:14.159> going<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.489> be<00:03:15.030> chasing<00:03:15.359> these

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
because you're going to be chasing these

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.390 
because you're going to be chasing these
fish<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.049> are<00:03:16.349> running<00:03:16.680> all<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.920> time

fish that are running all the time

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.670 
fish that are running all the time
the<00:03:17.790> boats<00:03:18.000> going<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.269> stop<00:03:18.510> over<00:03:18.930> them<00:03:19.079> you're

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the boats going to stop over them you're

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.500 
the boats going to stop over them you're
going<00:03:19.799> throw<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> jig<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.549> let<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:20.849> sink<00:03:21.269> deep

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
going throw the jig out let it sink deep

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.449 
going throw the jig out let it sink deep

metals<00:03:29.970> mm<00:03:30.299> twos<00:03:30.569> they<00:03:30.810> work<00:03:30.989> really<00:03:31.319> good<00:03:31.620> for

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
metals mm twos they work really good for

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.680 
metals mm twos they work really good for
yellows<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:32.879> during<00:03:33.060> tendencies<00:03:33.569> and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
yellows and then during tendencies and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.539 
yellows and then during tendencies and
they<00:03:33.780> were<00:03:33.900> great<00:03:34.109> for<00:03:34.260> tuna<00:03:34.530> -<00:03:34.709> these<00:03:35.370> are

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
they were great for tuna - these are

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.150 
they were great for tuna - these are
heavier<00:03:35.849> jigs<00:03:36.209> thin<00:03:36.720> profiles<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.919> they're

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
heavier jigs thin profiles so they're

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.819 
heavier jigs thin profiles so they're
designed<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.519> work<00:03:38.609> really<00:03:38.879> fast<00:03:39.799> again<00:03:40.799> I

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
designed to work really fast again I
