00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.160
 Hello everyone, I hold my hands one more 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.660
 the package that came to me on ebay 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.510
 I ordered relatively recently but 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.680
 it came to me somehow unexpectedly quickly 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.200
 In theory, this should be a karaoke microphone 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.750
 on ebay he costs 15 dollars but he me 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.610
 cost absolutely free because 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.830
 paid it with a coupon which was handed out on 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.540
 ebay before the New Year holidays well 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:45.170
 lan give i'll hide envelope look at 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:47.600
 contents surprising box was 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.370
 wrapped only cellophane package but 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.320
 he does nâ€™t even mean anything to me 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.600
 1 time really nobody is on this package 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.580
 turned gray and did not play and our football 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.350
 mail is somehow not well and the box 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.659
 made of regular cardboard which 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.920
 lined with some plastic is very 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.780
 what the chinese wanted to do is packing 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.269
 cool sky of some expensive 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.530
 branded microphone for this they do not 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.600
 It turned out very special 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.340
 pathetic well mean boxes should 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.110
 be a karaoke microphone which 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.580
 has both a wireless connection 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.740
 as well as a standard connection through 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.539
 ordinary wire the first thing that comes into 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.729
 eyes is a radio for 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.289
 wireless in plastic 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.579
 It seems cheap is not very reliable as 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.049
 it all looks on the back side 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.240
 there is a compartment for the usual finger 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.189
 battery cover closure also 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.630
 seems some flimsy of organs 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.149
 the receiver board has a button 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.890
 on and near there is a diode 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.840
 the indicator that shows it works 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.520
 or not special interest of course 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.320
 causes and here it is the radio antenna 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.090
 which made see the wound taken out 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.799
 wires could somehow make someone 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.539
 more elegant for example 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.579
 retractable or plastic which thread 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.079
 the antenna farther we go cord for 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.240
 microphone connection standard 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.679
 way I do not know how long 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 I believe that two and a half meters or 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.490
 there are three in it for microphones 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.719
 turns off via standard and xlr connector 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.060
 and on the other end she has 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.579
 standard 6mm jack cable 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.380
 also looks pretty cheap but although 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.329
 it would be safer to break nothing special 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.429
 so here we still have a plastic antenna 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.810
 also sex with a plug to connect to 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.550
 microphone true to pretty 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.590
 impressive size and increases 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.210
 the length of the microphone is about twice as much here 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.220
 still a penlight battery in some kind 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.750
 Chinese company is good that I put them 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.970
 did not expect that they will be bundled 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.220
 but that they are crap and shit 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.629
 as they say it is not a pity so here still 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.489
 some piece of paper is visible from some 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.270
 microphone and technical information 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.620
 data 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.210
 Incidentally it is not any and tualetka 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.860
 so nice glossy apparently 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.260
 the manufacturer hints us to the whole 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.910
 their seriousness of their mood well, so sort of 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.470
 all that was in the box I took out 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.460
 give all gutted 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.320
 well then aside but such 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.940
 ordinary microphone is amazing by the way that 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.080
 She has a metal body, I generally soul 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.330
 this is a plastic aboard microphone yet 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.740
 three-way slider button which 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.840
 along the course is responsible for switching between 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.720
 wired wireless modes 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.310
 and also for its complete shutdown itself 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.840
 her body is debunked and inside 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.800
 there is a compartment for one finger 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.780
 batteries 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.670
 but of course the inside does not look already 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.160
 not so neat it spoils the experience 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.470
 from you its appearance now try 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.810
 connect the antenna while she enters 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.870
 pretty tight but if i shove often 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.920
 I think you do it all hanging out and 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.610
 similarly to the microphone can 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.110
 connect the bundled cord well 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.970
 ok, come on now, I will quickly check 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.770
 how does it work 1 1 1 well that's shorter 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.240
 something happens like that and a microphone 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.080
 karaoke this dynamic 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.580
 if you connect directly to zvukovuhi then 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.430
 the volume is very loud 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.310
 weak and this microphone is just 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.910
 a preamplifier is therefore needed directly 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.670
 zvukovuhi 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.450
 sense in general there is no connection here 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.010
 came here and so appeal 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.350
 connected after nine not to him 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.360
 have karaoke 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.620
 it supports therefore here connected 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.390
 the receiver is at 9 and here is 9 here using this 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.410
 garbage 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.410
 connected to computer sound card 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.230
 Well , here I show only wireless 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.020
 connection because it's more interesting 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.940
 wire and everything works so I can calmly 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.940
 move around the room 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.690
 now mind the other end of the room but how 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.180
 so it turns out that I touched the antenna 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.940
 Antenna main touch because 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.420
 it turns out the noise is not going around the apartment 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.310
 I will for the time being think for karaoke 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.410
 microphone and it is absolutely not required a 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:39.200
 within the room he is absolutely good 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.420
 works well, like this 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.220
 In fact, the microphone is made more or less well. 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.020
 sure that he is almost entirely 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.790
 metallic and outwardly it seems pretty 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.800
 strong unless of course we look 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.720
 inside the computer of course connect it 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.560
 there is no point because built 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.450
 sound card 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.490
 Naturally it does not pull him 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.290
 preamp is needed but as for 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.060
 equipment with karaoke function then in it 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.130
 it works ok well shorter for 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.110
 Beds, he will come down well, like put everything 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.860
 fingers top comment and of course 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.610
 subscribe 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.610
 all all bye
