tonight<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.410> think<00:00:08.250> they<00:00:08.670> played<00:00:08.910> for<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.179> draw

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
tonight I think they played for a draw

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.509 
tonight I think they played for a draw
but<00:00:09.809> Lena<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.769> thought<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.160> was<00:00:11.250> always<00:00:11.429> going

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
but Lena I thought it was always going

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.330 
but Lena I thought it was always going
to<00:00:11.730> kill<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.090> game<00:00:12.269> off<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:13.070> think<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.190> could

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
to kill the game off I think we could

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.400 
to kill the game off I think we could
have<00:00:14.400> done<00:00:14.610> there<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.969> think<00:00:15.199> was<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
have done there I think was it the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.550 
have done there I think was it the
conditions<00:00:16.949> than<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.940> us<00:00:18.560> luck

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
conditions than I or is it just us luck

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
conditions than I or is it just us luck
