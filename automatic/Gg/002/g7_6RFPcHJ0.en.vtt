00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
every couple of months there are new

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
versions with a lot of updates so it is

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.219 
versions with a lot of updates so it is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
percent how to use it because you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.090 
percent how to use it because you
actually<00:01:51.720> only<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.409> how<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.710> something

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
actually only know how to use something

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.819 
actually only know how to use something
when<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> need<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> use<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.659> desperately<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
when you need to use it desperately and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.069 
when you need to use it desperately and
you<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.549> work<00:01:56.820> your<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:57.329> through<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
you have to work your way through it and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.770 
you have to work your way through it and
then<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.590> learn<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.880> because<00:02:00.000> there

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
then you learn it you know because there

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.170 
then you learn it you know because there
is<00:02:00.840> no<00:02:00.960> other<00:02:01.140> way<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> came<00:02:02.159> up<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.729> this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
is no other way so I came up with this

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.719 
is no other way so I came up with this
notion<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:04.170> you're<00:02:04.890> actually<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:05.610> an

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
notion that you're actually not an

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.100 
notion that you're actually not an
expert<00:02:06.119> when<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.540> everything<00:02:07.020> about

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
expert when you know everything about

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.589 
expert when you know everything about
something<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.369> an<00:02:08.459> expert<00:02:08.729> when<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
something but you are an expert when you

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.540 
something but you are an expert when you
feel<00:02:09.840> comfortable<00:02:09.869> enough<00:02:10.739> with<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.009> subject

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
feel comfortable enough with a subject

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.440 
feel comfortable enough with a subject
so<00:02:12.150> even<00:02:12.660> if<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> don't<00:02:13.140> know

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
so even if you don't know

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.920 
so even if you don't know
had<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.780> something<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.410> know<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.810> you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
had to do something you know that you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.410 
had to do something you know that you
will<00:02:17.080> be<00:02:17.110> able<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.620> find<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.010> way<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:19.000> solve<00:02:19.239> that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
will be able to find a way to solve that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.540 
will be able to find a way to solve that
problem<00:02:19.720> for<00:02:20.050> example<00:02:20.379> in<00:02:20.500> 3d<00:02:20.800> if<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.340> know<00:02:21.519> a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
problem for example in 3d if you know a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.970 
problem for example in 3d if you know a
lot<00:02:21.760> about<00:02:21.819> 3d<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.930> may<00:02:22.959> not<00:02:23.319> exactly<00:02:23.680> know

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
lot about 3d you may not exactly know

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.369 
lot about 3d you may not exactly know
how<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.220> model<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.879> don't<00:02:25.150> know<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.480> tree<00:02:26.019> but<00:02:26.290> if

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
how to model I don't know a tree but if

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.440 
how to model I don't know a tree but if
you<00:02:26.560> have<00:02:26.709> modeled<00:02:27.069> enough<00:02:27.489> things<00:02:27.849> in<00:02:28.239> your

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
you have modeled enough things in your

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.020 
you have modeled enough things in your
life<00:02:28.510> when<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.349> have<00:02:29.379> spent<00:02:29.890> hours<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.910> hours

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
life when you have spent hours and hours

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.180 
life when you have spent hours and hours
modeling<00:02:31.599> stuff<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.470> probably<00:02:32.620> never

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
modeling stuff you probably never

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.490 
modeling stuff you probably never
modeled<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.120> tree<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.569> probably<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.349> don't

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
modeled the tree and probably you don't

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.100 
modeled the tree and probably you don't
know<00:02:35.709> how<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.890> model<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.180> know<00:02:37.420> that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
know how to model it but you know that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.370 
know how to model it but you know that
if<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.620> have<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.519> model<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.880> tree<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.540> would

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
if you have to model a tree it would

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.360 
if you have to model a tree it would
just<00:02:41.410> take<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.830> little<00:02:42.040> bit<00:02:42.310> of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
just take a little bit of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.130 
just take a little bit of
experimentation<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.569> spending<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.989> few

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
experimentation and spending a few

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.110 
experimentation and spending a few
minutes<00:02:44.290> or<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> couple<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.190> hours<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.700> you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
minutes or a couple of hours and you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.550 
minutes or a couple of hours and you
would<00:02:46.269> know<00:02:46.450> already<00:02:46.720> how<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:46.989> model<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.349> tree

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
would know already how to model a tree

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.320 
would know already how to model a tree
alright<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.280> what<00:02:48.640> I'm<00:02:48.760> thinking<00:02:49.269> about

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
alright this is what I'm thinking about

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.210 
alright this is what I'm thinking about
that<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.870> are<00:02:50.019> an<00:02:50.349> expert<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.860> become<00:02:51.099> an

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
that you are an expert you become an

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.699 
that you are an expert you become an
esper<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.790> stop<00:02:52.420> being<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:52.750> new<00:02:52.930> lead<00:02:53.170> when

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
esper and you stop being a new lead when

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.460 
esper and you stop being a new lead when
you<00:02:53.739> are<00:02:53.980> confident<00:02:54.489> enough<00:02:54.819> on<00:02:55.470> your

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
you are confident enough on your

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.009 
you are confident enough on your
profession<00:02:57.220> when<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.579> are<00:02:58.180> confident<00:02:58.810> that

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
profession when you are confident that

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.559 
profession when you are confident that
even<00:02:59.500> if<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.709> find<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.040> problem<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:01.060> specific

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
even if you find a problem in a specific

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.720 
even if you find a problem in a specific
project<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:02.440> will<00:03:02.560> be<00:03:02.709> able<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:03.069> solve<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.459> one

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
project you will be able to solve it one

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.670 
project you will be able to solve it one
way<00:03:03.940> or<00:03:04.180> another<00:03:04.269> this<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.110> my<00:03:05.230> opinion<00:03:05.470> about
