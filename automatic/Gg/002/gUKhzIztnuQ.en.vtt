unmounted rubber stamp I particularly

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.209 
unmounted rubber stamp I particularly
like<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.859> kind<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:30.140> some<00:00:31.219> abstract

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
like this kind they are some abstract

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.540 
like this kind they are some abstract
patterns<00:00:32.880> they<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.329> very<00:00:33.690> deep<00:00:34.200> they're<00:00:34.980> done

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
patterns they are very deep they're done

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.479 
patterns they are very deep they're done
by<00:00:35.940> Judy<00:00:36.540> Kaufman<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.420> stamps<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.649> too

by Judy Kaufman and the stamps are too
trying<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.239> locate<00:00:42.629> them<00:00:42.899> somewhere<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
trying to locate them somewhere on the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.790 
trying to locate them somewhere on the
Internet<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:45.050> Judy<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.500> an<00:00:46.739> i<00:00:47.059> ey<00:00:48.059> e<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.410> if

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
Internet it's Judy with an i ey e so if

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.369 
Internet it's Judy with an i ey e so if
you<00:00:50.190> do<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.969> look<00:00:51.090> those<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.840> that's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you do want to look those up so that's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.850 
you do want to look those up so that's
another<00:00:52.770> kind<00:00:53.660> then<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.930> rubber<00:00:55.199> stamps

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
another kind then we have rubber stamps

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.319 
another kind then we have rubber stamps
that<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.070> mounts<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> little

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that have mounts they have a little

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.200 
that have mounts they have a little
sponge<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.760> put<00:00:59.910> them<00:01:00.059> on

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
sponge on them and you can put them on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.349 
sponge on them and you can put them on
an<00:01:00.420> acrylic<00:01:00.750> block<00:01:01.129> like<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.760> there

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
an acrylic block like this and there

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.780 
an acrylic block like this and there
were<00:01:03.449> also<00:01:03.690> clear<00:01:04.320> stamps<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.430> put

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
were also clear stamps that you can put

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.200 
were also clear stamps that you can put
on<00:01:05.909> an<00:01:06.000> acrylic<00:01:06.240> block<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.530> those<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.490> think

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
on an acrylic block so those are I think

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.530 
on an acrylic block so those are I think
cover<00:01:10.080> every<00:01:11.040> single<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.909> rubber<00:01:12.180> stamp

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
cover every single kind of rubber stamp

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.410 
cover every single kind of rubber stamp
that<00:01:13.220> exists<00:01:14.280> maybe<00:01:14.640> there's<00:01:15.180> something

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that exists maybe there's something

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.590 
that exists maybe there's something
different<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.590> great<00:01:16.920> thing<00:01:17.159> about

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
different the one great thing about

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.289 
different the one great thing about
stamping<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.900> clay<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.650> opposed<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.580> paper<00:01:20.939> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
stamping on clay as opposed to paper is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.830 
stamping on clay as opposed to paper is
that<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.200> clay<00:01:22.560> comes<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.670> meet<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
that the clay comes up to meet the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.410 
that the clay comes up to meet the
rubber<00:01:25.080> stamp<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.950> usually<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:27.030> very

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
rubber stamp and you usually get a very

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
rubber stamp and you usually get a very
nice<00:01:27.659> impression<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:29.159> wanted<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.490> show

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
making a bunch of them to give away you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.540 
making a bunch of them to give away you
could<00:02:20.120> either<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.720> on<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.440> skin<00:02:21.800> or<00:02:21.830> blend<00:02:22.220> or

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
could either do it on a skin or blend or

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.900 
could either do it on a skin or blend or
just<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.880> mix<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.570> colors<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.260> then<00:02:24.830> stamp<00:02:25.610> it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
just a mix of colors and then stamp it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.670 
just a mix of colors and then stamp it
and<00:02:26.090> put<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:28.480> finding<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:30.050> think<00:02:30.620> it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
and put it in the finding and I think it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.980 
and put it in the finding and I think it
makes<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.890> really<00:02:31.070> nice<00:02:31.310> impression<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.480> that's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
makes a really nice impression so that's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.810 
makes a really nice impression so that's
something<00:02:33.770> else<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.310> can<00:02:34.400> do<00:02:34.520> I'm<00:02:34.640> also

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
something else that you can do I'm also

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.199 
something else that you can do I'm also
wearing<00:02:35.600> one<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.370> right<00:02:37.370> now<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.940> have<00:02:38.180> a

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
wearing one so right now I have a

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.050 
wearing one so right now I have a
skinner<00:02:38.570> blend<00:02:39.250> funky<00:02:40.250> skinner<00:02:40.520> blend<00:02:40.730> of

skinner blend funky skinner blend of
Souffle<00:02:41.959> clay<00:02:42.260> souffle<00:02:43.100> is<00:02:43.310> particularly

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
Souffle clay souffle is particularly

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.110 
Souffle clay souffle is particularly
good<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.660> rubber-stamp<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.280> I'm<00:02:46.880> going<00:02:47.090> to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
good to rubber-stamp on and I'm going to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.400 
good to rubber-stamp on and I'm going to
be<00:02:47.239> using<00:02:47.720> this<00:02:48.020> rubber<00:02:48.739> stamp<00:02:49.160> right<00:02:49.489> here<00:02:49.550> I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
be using this rubber stamp right here I

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.949 
be using this rubber stamp right here I
always<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.680> stays<00:02:52.100> on<00:02:52.520> ink<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.510> reason<00:02:53.870> I

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
always you stays on ink and the reason I

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.780 
always you stays on ink and the reason I
use<00:02:53.989> stays<00:02:54.440> on<00:02:54.739> ink<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:56.180> dries<00:02:56.630> almost

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
use stays on ink is it dries almost

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.040 
use stays on ink is it dries almost
immediately<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.180> then<00:02:59.300> you<00:02:59.420> could<00:02:59.600> proceed

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
immediately and then you could proceed

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.280 
immediately and then you could proceed
on<00:03:00.260> any<00:03:00.500> other<00:03:01.600> procedures<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:02.959> want<00:03:03.170> to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
on any other procedures that you want to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.260 
on any other procedures that you want to
do<00:03:03.440> with<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.830> clay<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.370> always<00:03:04.610> use<00:03:04.760> stays

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
do with the clay so I always use stays

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.740 
do with the clay so I always use stays
on<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:07.400> know<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.880> could<00:03:08.060> use<00:03:08.209> any<00:03:08.510> other

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
on you know you could use any other

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.800 
on you know you could use any other
brand<00:03:09.110> because<00:03:09.590> when<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.370> use<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.970> stamp<00:03:11.510> on

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
brand because when you use a stamp on

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.449 
brand because when you use a stamp on
the<00:03:11.959> raw<00:03:12.140> clay<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.560> then<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.769> bake<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
the raw clay and then you bake it the

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.229 
the raw clay and then you bake it the
heat<00:03:13.640> sets<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:14.959> what<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.290> do<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.670> put<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
heat sets it so what I do is I put the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.420 
heat sets it so what I do is I put the
rubber<00:03:17.450> stamp<00:03:17.810> down<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:20.709> put<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.890> ink<00:03:22.190> on

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
rubber stamp down and I put the ink on

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.350 
rubber stamp down and I put the ink on
it<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:22.820> way<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.440> can<00:03:24.590> usually<00:03:24.799> tell

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
it this way and you can usually tell

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.449 
it this way and you can usually tell
that<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.630> ink<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.709> enough<00:03:27.950> ink<00:03:28.280> on

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
that the ink you have enough ink on

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.250 
that the ink you have enough ink on
there<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:28.940> because<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.420> gets<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.720> little<00:03:29.870> sheen

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
there is because it gets a little sheen

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.759 
there is because it gets a little sheen
on<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.780> here<00:03:33.350> we<00:03:33.470> go<00:03:33.680> with<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:35.650> try<00:03:36.650> and

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
on it so here we go with that I try and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.940 
on it so here we go with that I try and
cover<00:03:36.920> these<00:03:37.190> up<00:03:37.519> right<00:03:37.820> away<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:39.709> just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
cover these up right away and I just

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.520 
cover these up right away and I just
flip<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.340> over<00:03:40.579> and<00:03:41.060> try<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.930> put<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.230> in<00:03:42.380> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
flip it over and try and put it in the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.550 
flip it over and try and put it in the
part<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.870> blend<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:47.750> really<00:03:48.290> don't

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
part of the blend and you really don't

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.270 
part of the blend and you really don't
have<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:49.130> press<00:03:49.489> hard<00:03:50.049> if<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.829> want<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.160> use

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
have to press hard if you want to use

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.430 
have to press hard if you want to use
rubber<00:03:52.549> stamps<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.450> make<00:03:53.600> an<00:03:53.750> impression<00:03:54.110> in

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
rubber stamps to make an impression in

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.560 
rubber stamps to make an impression in
the<00:03:54.530> clay<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:55.400> obviously<00:03:55.970> have<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.180> press<00:03:56.540> a

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
the clay you obviously have to press a

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.729 
the clay you obviously have to press a
little<00:03:56.840> harder<00:03:57.320> but<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.579> it<00:03:58.670> usually<00:03:59.739> gets

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
little harder but and it usually gets

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.120 
little harder but and it usually gets
all<00:04:01.100> of<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.450> design<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.350> if<00:04:03.769> you<00:04:03.860> don't<00:04:04.040> get

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
all of the design and if you don't get

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.500 
all of the design and if you don't get
the<00:04:04.280> design<00:04:04.579> you<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:04.850> just<00:04:05.000> flip<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.329> clay

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
the design you can just flip the clay

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.759 
the design you can just flip the clay
over<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:05.959> do<00:04:06.049> it<00:04:06.140> on<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.350> other<00:04:06.410> side<00:04:06.730> yay

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
over and do it on the other side yay

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.199 
over and do it on the other side yay
okay<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:12.230> here's<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.620> design<00:04:13.090> fantastic<00:04:14.090> you

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
okay so here's the design fantastic you

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.830 
okay so here's the design fantastic you
could<00:04:14.420> cut<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.170> out<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.799> can<00:04:16.039> use<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.669> just<00:04:17.030> as

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
could cut it out you can use it just as

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.060 
could cut it out you can use it just as
an<00:04:17.959> embellishment<00:04:18.260> on<00:04:18.770> something<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:19.700> could

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
an embellishment on something you could

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.670 
an embellishment on something you could
make<00:04:20.280> little<00:04:21.150> tiles<00:04:21.840> out<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.290> it<00:04:22.410> for<00:04:22.620> a

make little tiles out of it for a
bracelet<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.280> know<00:04:23.400> what<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.670> do<00:04:23.760> with<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
bracelet you know what to do with the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.760 
bracelet you know what to do with the
clay<00:04:24.150> once<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.510> do<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:24.900> it's<00:04:25.110> really<00:04:25.380> easy
