hi<00:00:00.539> everybody<00:00:00.750> today<00:00:01.110> I'm<00:00:01.380> working<00:00:01.530> on<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.829> 1995

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hi everybody today I'm working on a 1995

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.749 
hi everybody today I'm working on a 1995
Volkswagen<00:00:03.449> Jetta<00:00:04.130> this<00:00:05.130> car<00:00:05.339> has<00:00:05.490> an<00:00:05.609> oil

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
Volkswagen Jetta this car has an oil

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.419 
Volkswagen Jetta this car has an oil
leak<00:00:06.000> coming<00:00:06.330> from<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.629> oil<00:00:06.779> filter<00:00:07.109> housing

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
leak coming from the oil filter housing

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.270 
leak coming from the oil filter housing
it's<00:00:08.429> got<00:00:08.610> about<00:00:09.139> 170,000<00:00:10.139> miles<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.740> it

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
it's got about 170,000 miles and it

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.520 
it's got about 170,000 miles and it
never<00:00:11.610> leaked<00:00:11.910> oil<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.300> all<00:00:12.480> until<00:00:13.110> just

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
never leaked oil at all until just

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.980 
never leaked oil at all until just
recently<00:00:13.710> when<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:15.000> started<00:00:15.509> leaving<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.839> few

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
recently when it started leaving a few

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.910 
recently when it started leaving a few
drops<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.680> there<00:00:18.260> so<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.410> car<00:00:19.619> has<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
drops here and there so this car has the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.990 
drops here and there so this car has the
2.0<00:00:20.550> liter<00:00:21.230> ABA<00:00:22.230> engine<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.279> engine<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.789> in

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
2.0 liter ABA engine this engine was in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.980 
2.0 liter ABA engine this engine was in
the<00:00:24.840> Volkswagen<00:00:25.350> Golf<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.039> Volkswagen<00:00:26.580> Jetta

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
the Volkswagen Golf in Volkswagen Jetta

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.650 
the Volkswagen Golf in Volkswagen Jetta
for<00:00:27.990> quite<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> few<00:00:28.650> years<00:00:29.150> it's<00:00:30.150> recently

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
for quite a few years it's recently

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.620 
for quite a few years it's recently
started<00:00:31.109> marking<00:00:31.529> its<00:00:31.679> territory<00:00:31.740> from<00:00:32.630> this

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
started marking its territory from this

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.520 
started marking its territory from this
general<00:00:34.050> area<00:00:34.489> underneath<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.790> engine<00:00:36.530> and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
general area underneath the engine and

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.090 
general area underneath the engine and
when<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> crawl<00:00:37.980> under<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> look

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
when I crawl under here to have a look

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.530 
when I crawl under here to have a look
we<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.550> wet<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.059> backside<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
we can see it's wet on the backside of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.020 
we can see it's wet on the backside of
the<00:00:42.750> oil<00:00:42.960> filter<00:00:43.200> housing<00:00:43.640> at<00:00:44.640> first<00:00:44.879> I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the oil filter housing at first I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.200 
the oil filter housing at first I
thought<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.239> had<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> bad<00:00:45.660> oil<00:00:45.960> filter<00:00:46.879> but<00:00:47.879> even

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
thought I had a bad oil filter but even

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.170 
thought I had a bad oil filter but even
when<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> replaced<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.410> still<00:00:49.649> leaking

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
when I replaced it it's still leaking

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.580 
when I replaced it it's still leaking
and<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.510> able<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> track<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.170> down<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and so I was able to track it down that

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.549 
and so I was able to track it down that
the<00:00:52.739> leaking<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.699> coming<00:00:54.030> from<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.559> oil

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the leaking is coming from the oil

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.400 
the leaking is coming from the oil
cooler<00:00:55.860> interchange<00:00:56.809> which<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.199> above

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
cooler interchange which is just above

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.069 
cooler interchange which is just above
the<00:00:58.559> oil<00:00:58.710> filter<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.359> right<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.690> there's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the oil filter and right here there's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.310 
the oil filter and right here there's
actually<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> ring<00:01:02.390> between<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.780> part<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
actually a ring between this part and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.440 
actually a ring between this part and
this<00:01:04.559> part<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.040> that's<00:01:05.760> what's<00:01:06.000> causing<00:01:06.270> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
this part and that's what's causing it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.560 
this part and that's what's causing it
to<00:01:06.570> leak<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.530> what<00:01:07.680> we're<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
to leak so what we're going to do is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.210 
to leak so what we're going to do is
take<00:01:09.570> off<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> oil<00:01:09.960> filter<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:11.100> we're

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
take off the oil filter and then we're

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
take off the oil filter and then we're
going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> separate<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.030> part<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.110> part

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
going to separate this part in this part

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
going to separate this part in this part
and<00:01:13.590> replace<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> o-ring<00:01:14.630> what<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> part

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and replace the o-ring what this part

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.690 
and replace the o-ring what this part
does<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> heat<00:01:17.220> exchange

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
does it's actually a heat exchange

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.600 
does it's actually a heat exchange
between<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.500> water<00:01:19.500> cooling<00:01:19.799> system<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
between the water cooling system and the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.969 
between the water cooling system and the
oil<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.869> does<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> oil<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
oil what this does is if the oil is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.760 
oil what this does is if the oil is
getting<00:01:23.340> hot<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:25.080> will<00:01:25.200> pull<00:01:25.439> down<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
getting hot it will pull down the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
getting hot it will pull down the
temperature<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.369> same<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> engine

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
temperature to the same as the engine

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050 
temperature to the same as the engine
coolant<00:01:27.780> temperature<00:01:28.520> which<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
coolant temperature which has got a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.140 
coolant temperature which has got a
larger<00:01:30.450> cooling<00:01:30.869> capacity<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:32.640> part<00:01:32.909> just

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
larger cooling capacity this part just

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.840 
larger cooling capacity this part just
started<00:01:33.509> recently<00:01:33.860> dripping<00:01:34.860> maybe<00:01:35.400> only<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
started recently dripping maybe only a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.030 
started recently dripping maybe only a
couple<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> weeks<00:01:36.780> ago<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> since<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
couple of weeks ago and since then the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
couple of weeks ago and since then the
leak<00:01:38.189> has<00:01:38.369> gotten<00:01:38.640> steadily<00:01:38.820> worse<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.020> once

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
leak has gotten steadily worse so once

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.020 
leak has gotten steadily worse so once
you<00:01:40.740> start<00:01:40.829> noticing<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.579> leaking<00:01:41.909> it's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you start noticing it leaking it's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
you start noticing it leaking it's
probably<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> good<00:01:42.810> idea<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.259> take<00:01:43.409> care<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
probably a good idea to take care of it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.969 
probably a good idea to take care of it
as<00:01:43.890> quickly<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.310> can

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
as quickly as you can

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.670 
as quickly as you can
all<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.310> we'll<00:01:47.549> crawl<00:01:47.790> under<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
all right so we'll crawl under here and

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.469 
all right so we'll crawl under here and
start<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> replacement<00:01:50.490> work<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.360> will

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
start the replacement work we will

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.499 
start the replacement work we will
loosen<00:01:51.659> up<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.110> take<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> oil<00:01:52.530> filter<00:01:52.710> off

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
loosen up and take the oil filter off

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.359 
loosen up and take the oil filter off
I'll<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.540> turn<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> few<00:01:55.290> times<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.829> let<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
I'll just turn it a few times and let it

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.789 
I'll just turn it a few times and let it
drain<00:01:56.610> out<00:01:56.810> before<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> take<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.229> off<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.619> avoid

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
drain out before I take it off to avoid

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
drain out before I take it off to avoid
making<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.250> bigger<00:01:59.430> mess<00:02:02.509> okay<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.600> looks<00:02:03.750> like

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
making a bigger mess okay it looks like

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.840 
making a bigger mess okay it looks like
it's<00:02:03.930> mostly<00:02:04.439> stopped<00:02:04.710> draining<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.369> we'll<00:02:05.579> go

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it's mostly stopped draining so we'll go

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's mostly stopped draining so we'll go
ahead<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.030> pull<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> off<00:02:07.640> all<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:08.789> next<00:02:09.060> is

we<00:02:09.629> need<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> remove<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.349> knot<00:02:11.160> right<00:02:11.400> here

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
we need to remove this knot right here

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.490 
we need to remove this knot right here
which<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.060> holding<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.930> oil

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
which is holding the oil

changeup<00:02:13.920> against<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> housing<00:02:15.350> this<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.560> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
changeup against the housing this is a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.640 
changeup against the housing this is a
27<00:02:17.190> millimeter<00:02:17.550> nut<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:19.050> I've<00:02:19.170> got<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> giant

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
27 millimeter nut so I've got a giant

socket<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.470> angles<00:02:22.860> are<00:02:22.980> kind<00:02:23.190> of

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
socket here the angles are kind of

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.970 
socket here the angles are kind of
awkward<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.990> bolts<00:02:28.260> not<00:02:28.350> on<00:02:28.620> they're<00:02:28.800> too

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
awkward the bolts not on they're too

the housing I'm going to go back up on

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.170 
the housing I'm going to go back up on
top<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.650> inspect<00:02:47.190> things<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.670> see<00:02:47.820> how<00:02:47.940> well

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
top and inspect things and see how well

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
I can pull it down without putting too

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.750 
I can pull it down without putting too
much<00:02:50.070> stress<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.760> coolant

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
much stress on the on the coolant

passages<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.760> little<00:02:57.030> bit<00:02:57.150> tight<00:02:57.420> if<00:02:58.200> you

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
passages it's a little bit tight if you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.620 
passages it's a little bit tight if you
force<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.830> it'll<00:02:59.070> go<00:02:59.280> it's<00:03:00.060> probably<00:03:00.450> good<00:03:00.600> to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
force it it'll go it's probably good to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.270 
force it it'll go it's probably good to
have<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> car<00:03:01.110> heated<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.680> little<00:03:01.860> bit<00:03:02.040> so

say<00:04:09.630> they<00:04:09.810> look<00:04:09.840> pretty<00:04:10.140> close<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.920> one's<00:04:11.130> a

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
say they look pretty close this one's a

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.949 
say they look pretty close this one's a
tad<00:04:11.459> thicker<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.329> should<00:04:12.510> crush<00:04:12.750> down

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
tad thicker but it should crush down

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.710 
tad thicker but it should crush down
pretty<00:04:13.230> good

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.680 

so<00:04:17.320> let's<00:04:17.530> let's<00:04:18.040> give<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.430> try<00:04:21.210> so<00:04:22.210> we<00:04:22.420> slip

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
so let's let's give it a try so we slip

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.040 
so let's let's give it a try so we slip
the<00:04:22.980> seal<00:04:23.980> it<00:04:24.190> back<00:04:24.370> into<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.790> space<00:04:25.060> here<00:04:25.420> and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
the seal it back into the space here and

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.070 
the seal it back into the space here and
then<00:04:26.500> get<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.860> back<00:04:27.070> on<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.580> center<00:04:28.080> Center

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
then get it back on to the center Center

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.400 
then get it back on to the center Center
spline<00:04:30.480> make<00:04:31.480> sure<00:04:31.630> everything's<00:04:31.930> lined<00:04:32.170> back

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
spline make sure everything's lined back

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:41.040 
spline make sure everything's lined back
up<00:04:32.650> before<00:04:32.860> pushing<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.460> up<00:04:33.580> all<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.880> way<00:04:40.050> now

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
up before pushing it up all the way now

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.840 
up before pushing it up all the way now
we'll<00:04:41.200> go<00:04:41.320> back<00:04:41.350> up<00:04:41.530> back<00:04:42.100> underneath<00:04:42.460> and

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
we'll go back up back underneath and

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.490 
we'll go back up back underneath and
tighten<00:04:43.000> up<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.360> nut<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:46.170> we<00:04:47.170> want<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.410> make

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
tighten up that nut and we want to make

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.140 
tighten up that nut and we want to make
sure<00:04:47.530> this<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:47.920> good<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.250> snug

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.400 

I've<00:04:52.150> tighten<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.540> by<00:04:52.690> hand<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:53.170> I'll<00:04:53.230> just

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
I've tighten it by hand and I'll just

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:02.670 
I've tighten it by hand and I'll just
make<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.160> snug<00:04:54.550> with<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:54.910> socket<00:04:55.150> tool

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.670

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
okay and before finishing up I'll put

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.050 
okay and before finishing up I'll put
back<00:05:06.800> on<00:05:06.950> top<00:05:07.160> just<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.520> make<00:05:07.700> sure<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:07.970> all

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
back on top just to make sure it all

looks<00:05:08.090> okay<00:05:08.600> I<00:05:08.630> don't<00:05:08.840> have<00:05:09.110> any<00:05:09.820> bits<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:11.090> seal

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
looks okay I don't have any bits of seal

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.170 
looks okay I don't have any bits of seal
sticking<00:05:12.230> out<00:05:12.380> or<00:05:12.500> anything<00:05:12.820> now<00:05:13.820> we<00:05:13.880> can<00:05:14.060> go

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
sticking out or anything now we can go

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.490 
sticking out or anything now we can go
and<00:05:14.300> put<00:05:14.480> the<00:05:14.630> oil<00:05:15.100> filter<00:05:16.100> back<00:05:16.370> on<00:05:16.400> and<00:05:16.820> then

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
and put the oil filter back on and then

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.000 
and put the oil filter back on and then
start<00:05:18.500> up<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.800> car<00:05:18.980> and<00:05:19.010> test<00:05:19.460> for<00:05:19.640> leaks

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
start up the car and test for leaks

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.380 
start up the car and test for leaks
we'll<00:05:22.010> just<00:05:22.220> clean<00:05:22.430> up<00:05:22.460> under<00:05:22.940> here<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.150> little

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
we'll just clean up under here a little

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.080 
we'll just clean up under here a little
bit<00:05:23.570> so<00:05:23.840> that<00:05:24.280> we<00:05:25.280> can<00:05:25.460> tell<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.670> difference

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
bit so that we can tell the difference

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.890 
bit so that we can tell the difference
between<00:05:26.270> new<00:05:27.140> oil<00:05:27.380> drips<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:27.950> old<00:05:28.100> oil<00:05:28.310> drips

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
between new oil drips and old oil drips

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.180 
between new oil drips and old oil drips
okay<00:05:29.900> we'll<00:05:30.080> start<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.470> car<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:30.680> test<00:05:31.010> for

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
okay we'll start the car and test for

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:39.030 
okay we'll start the car and test for
leaks

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.640 

I<00:05:39.130> don't<00:05:39.940> see<00:05:40.060> any<00:05:40.210> new<00:05:40.420> signs<00:05:40.750> of<00:05:40.960> leakage<00:05:41.350> so

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
I don't see any new signs of leakage so

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.610 
I don't see any new signs of leakage so
I<00:05:41.680> think<00:05:41.950> we're<00:05:42.130> good<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.930> that<00:05:44.110> was<00:05:44.200> a<00:05:44.230> super

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
I think we're good and that was a super

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.740 
I think we're good and that was a super
easy<00:05:44.740> repair<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.670> only<00:05:45.880> took<00:05:46.000> maybe<00:05:46.240> 15<00:05:46.480> or

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
easy repair that only took maybe 15 or

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.370 
easy repair that only took maybe 15 or
20<00:05:47.260> minutes<00:05:47.590> and<00:05:48.900> you<00:05:49.900> know<00:05:49.930> what<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.230> best

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
20 minutes and you know what the best

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.290 
20 minutes and you know what the best
thing<00:05:50.530> is<00:05:50.800> is<00:05:50.980> it<00:05:51.310> didn't<00:05:51.610> cost<00:05:51.760> me<00:05:51.910> any<00:05:52.120> money

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
thing is is it didn't cost me any money

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.180 
thing is is it didn't cost me any money
because<00:05:52.780> I<00:05:52.930> just<00:05:53.140> reuse<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.650> seal<00:05:53.860> from<00:05:54.040> an

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
because I just reuse the seal from an

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.460 
because I just reuse the seal from an
old<00:05:54.310> oil<00:05:54.550> filter<00:05:54.700> housing<00:05:55.140> so<00:05:56.140> that's<00:05:56.290> all

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
old oil filter housing so that's all

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.710 
old oil filter housing so that's all
