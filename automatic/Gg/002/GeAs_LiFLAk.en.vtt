00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
check out his tanks too he's rock and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.420 
check out his tanks too he's rock and
rollin<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.590> getting<00:00:43.980> into<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> fish

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
rollin on that getting into the fish

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.029 
rollin on that getting into the fish
scene<00:00:44.930> it's<00:00:45.930> always<00:00:46.170> good<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.590> new<00:00:46.710> people

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
scene it's always good to see new people

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.160 
scene it's always good to see new people
coming<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.789> let<00:00:48.510> me<00:00:48.629> talk<00:00:48.809> about<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.110> couple

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
coming in so let me talk about a couple

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.619 
coming in so let me talk about a couple
things<00:00:49.620> when<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.730> first<00:00:50.760> set<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.360> tank

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
things when you first set up a tank

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.850 
things when you first set up a tank
you're<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> need<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> cycle<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.860> bro

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
you're going to need to cycle it and bro

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.110 
you're going to need to cycle it and bro
I<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> know<00:00:56.699> about<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
I don't know if you know about the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.849 
I don't know if you know about the
nitrogen<00:00:57.570> cycle<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.960> anything<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.530> let<00:00:58.739> me

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
nitrogen cycle or anything but let me

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.869 
nitrogen cycle or anything but let me
explain<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.210> case<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.600> don't<00:01:01.879> when

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
explain it to you in case it don't when

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
explain it to you in case it don't when
you<00:01:03.000> first<00:01:03.270> set<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.780> tank<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.379> needs<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
you first set up a tank it needs to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.770 
you first set up a tank it needs to
cycle<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.210> doing<00:01:06.390> during<00:01:06.689> that

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
cycle and what it's doing during that

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.960 
cycle and what it's doing during that
period<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.470> developing<00:01:08.250> beneficial<00:01:08.820> bacteria

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
period as developing beneficial bacteria

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.660 
period as developing beneficial bacteria
and<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> substrate<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> water<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> in

your filters the nitrifying bacteria is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.050 
your filters the nitrifying bacteria is
called<00:01:15.960> autotrophic<00:01:16.740> bacteria<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.670> located

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the gravel is your heterotrophic

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.130 
the gravel is your heterotrophic

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
bacteria they are a lot of people think

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
bacteria they are a lot of people think
they're<00:01:34.259> nitrifiers<00:01:34.770> they're<00:01:35.189> technically

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
they're nitrifiers they're technically

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
they're nitrifiers they're technically

not they break down organic waste he set

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.840 
not they break down organic waste he set
up<00:01:40.920> his<00:01:41.040> tank<00:01:41.250> everything's<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:42.000> good<00:01:42.320> and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
up his tank everything's going good and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.410 
up his tank everything's going good and
he's<00:01:44.850> having<00:01:45.060> some<00:01:45.270> cloudy<00:01:45.540> water<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.240> dude

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
he's having some cloudy water the dude

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.730 
he's having some cloudy water the dude
that's<00:01:48.600> perfectly<00:01:49.020> normal<00:01:49.200> he<00:01:49.470> said<00:01:49.619> it's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that's perfectly normal he said it's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.380 
that's perfectly normal he said it's
like<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.890> milky<00:01:50.310> color<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:50.970> perfectly

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
like a milky color that's perfectly

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.160 
like a milky color that's perfectly
normal

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
normal

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.039 
normal
what<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.009> heterotrophs<00:01:53.579> are

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
what it is is your heterotrophs are

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.810 
what it is is your heterotrophs are
fatter<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.380> multiplied<00:01:56.250> quicker<00:01:56.490> than<00:01:56.729> your

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
fatter and multiplied quicker than your

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.850 
fatter and multiplied quicker than your
autotrophs<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:57.869> multiply<00:01:58.680> so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860

when<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.489> look<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:11.969> at<00:02:12.379> how<00:02:13.579> the

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
when you actually look at at how the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
changes will do nothing because they

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.140 
changes will do nothing because they
would<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.010> multiply<00:02:20.250> faster<00:02:20.969> you<00:02:21.060> would

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
would just multiply faster you would

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640 
would just multiply faster you would
actually<00:02:21.269> have<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.689> a<00:02:21.719> 50%<00:02:22.349> water<00:02:22.469> change

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
actually have to do a 50% water change

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.399 
actually have to do a 50% water change
every<00:02:23.250> 15<00:02:24.209> minutes<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.719> to<00:02:24.900> stop<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.140> bloom

from<00:02:25.590> getting<00:02:25.829> bigger<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.250> there's<00:02:26.430> not<00:02:26.519> much

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
from getting bigger so there's not much

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.670 
from getting bigger so there's not much
you<00:02:26.819> can<00:02:26.969> do<00:02:27.060> though<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.810> thing<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:28.379> is<00:02:28.409> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you can do though the thing to do is to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.479 
you can do though the thing to do is to
just<00:02:28.829> hold<00:02:29.040> off<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:30.709> in<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.950> few<00:02:32.129> days<00:02:32.280> it'll

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
just hold off and in a few days it'll

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.059 
just hold off and in a few days it'll
clear<00:02:32.700> itself<00:02:32.909> up<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.379> bacteria<00:02:34.590> doesn't

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
clear itself up but the bacteria doesn't

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.009 
clear itself up but the bacteria doesn't
harm<00:02:35.489> fish<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:35.969> you<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.299> bacterial<00:02:36.810> bloom

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
harm fish if you have a bacterial bloom

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.390 
harm fish if you have a bacterial bloom
where<00:02:37.170> your<00:02:37.290> fishes<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.709> there<00:02:37.829> doesn't<00:02:38.159> harm

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
where your fishes in there doesn't harm

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.800 
where your fishes in there doesn't harm
them<00:02:38.609> but<00:02:39.329> what<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.719> does<00:02:40.079> is<00:02:40.439> the<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
them but what it does is the the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.899 
them but what it does is the the
bacteria<00:02:43.019> require<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> lot<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.220> oxygen<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
bacteria require a lot of oxygen and

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.940 
bacteria require a lot of oxygen and
take<00:02:45.389> up<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.599> lot<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:45.900> deoxygenated<00:02:46.590> water

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
take up a lot of your deoxygenated water

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.949 
take up a lot of your deoxygenated water
within<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> tank<00:02:47.609> so<00:02:47.939> they<00:02:48.090> your<00:02:48.510> fish<00:02:48.689> can

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
within the tank so they your fish can

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.479 
within the tank so they your fish can
become<00:02:49.230> oxygen<00:02:49.709> deprived<00:02:50.040> you'll<00:02:50.220> start<00:02:50.430> to

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
become oxygen deprived you'll start to

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.360 
become oxygen deprived you'll start to
see<00:02:50.519> them<00:02:50.700> hanging<00:02:50.939> at<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.090> top<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:51.599> whatnot

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
goldfish it's not that they don't get

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.210 
goldfish it's not that they don't get
along<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.229> the<00:03:55.349> goldfish<00:03:55.709> are<00:03:55.829> so<00:03:55.949> dirty

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
along it's the goldfish are so dirty

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.300 
along it's the goldfish are so dirty
that<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:57.209> waste<00:03:57.479> Willa<00:03:57.840> will<00:03:58.799> kill<00:03:58.979> them<00:03:59.159> so

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
that the waste Willa will kill them so

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.020 
that the waste Willa will kill them so
I'll<00:03:59.400> use<00:03:59.549> snails<00:04:01.009> you<00:04:02.009> just<00:04:02.220> need<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.879> know

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
I'll use snails you just need you know

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.449 
I'll use snails you just need you know
three<00:04:03.780> four<00:04:04.319> five<00:04:04.620> depending<00:04:04.949> on<00:04:05.129> how<00:04:05.280> big

your<00:04:05.549> tank<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.479> then<00:04:06.750> my<00:04:06.840> dude<00:04:07.079> that<00:04:07.290> I'm

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
your tank is and then my dude that I'm

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.640 
your tank is and then my dude that I'm
sending<00:04:07.680> this<00:04:07.769> out<00:04:07.949> for<00:04:08.310> has<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.209> 55<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:10.139> few

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
snails and a few fish will be more than

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.610 
snails and a few fish will be more than

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
plenty to cycle that tank man and yet

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.749 
plenty to cycle that tank man and yet
just<00:04:16.769> wait<00:04:16.889> to<00:04:17.070> put<00:04:17.220> them<00:04:17.340> in<00:04:17.400> there<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.639> your

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
just wait to put them in there to your

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.039 
just wait to put them in there to your
water<00:04:17.940> clears<00:04:18.209> up<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.479> should<00:04:18.630> clear<00:04:18.840> up<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:19.019> a

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
water clears up it should clear up in a

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.719 
water clears up it should clear up in a
few<00:04:19.109> days<00:04:19.409> I<00:04:19.620> know<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.159> were<00:04:20.250> talking<00:04:20.549> about<00:04:20.579> a

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
few days I know you were talking about a

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.850 
few days I know you were talking about a
small<00:04:20.940> dude<00:04:21.389> it's<00:04:21.599> perfectly<00:04:21.989> normal

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
small dude it's perfectly normal

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.260 
small dude it's perfectly normal
especially<00:04:23.280> when<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.550> nitrogen<00:04:24.240> cycle

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
especially when the nitrogen cycle

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.119 
especially when the nitrogen cycle
starts<00:04:24.930> when<00:04:25.080> we<00:04:25.110> first<00:04:25.409> put<00:04:25.620> fish<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.860> there

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
starts when we first put fish in there

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.330 
starts when we first put fish in there
there's<00:04:26.310> not<00:04:26.460> bacteria<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:28.139> break<00:04:28.889> down<00:04:29.099> their

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
there's not bacteria to break down their

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.399 
there's not bacteria to break down their
waste<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:30.300> your<00:04:30.479> ammonia<00:04:30.810> levels<00:04:31.080> will<00:04:31.169> start

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
waste so your ammonia levels will start

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.619 
waste so your ammonia levels will start
to<00:04:31.530> rise<00:04:31.770> that's<00:04:32.460> where<00:04:32.669> test<00:04:32.969> kits<00:04:33.270> come<00:04:33.509> in

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
to rise that's where test kits come in

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.249 
to rise that's where test kits come in
and<00:04:33.780> stuff<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.379> let<00:04:34.680> me<00:04:34.740> show<00:04:34.979> you<00:04:35.039> one

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
and stuff like that let me show you one

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:42.110 
and stuff like that let me show you one
this<00:04:37.259> is<00:04:37.439> the<00:04:37.560> time<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:37.949> I<00:04:38.069> use<00:04:39.080> it's<00:04:40.550> well<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
this is the time to I use it's well the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.270 
this is the time to I use it's well the
labels<00:04:42.479> guard<00:04:42.750> but<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.889> what<00:04:44.039> it<00:04:44.129> looks

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
labels guard but this is what it looks

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.219 
labels guard but this is what it looks
like<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:45.120> can<00:04:45.270> buy<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.479> it<00:04:45.659> pretty<00:04:45.840> much<00:04:46.020> any

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
like you can buy it it pretty much any

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:52.129 
like you can buy it it pretty much any
pest<00:04:46.469> or<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:46.979> API<00:04:47.370> master<00:04:48.060> test<00:04:48.300> kit<00:04:51.139> you

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
pest or it's the API master test kit you

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.559 
pest or it's the API master test kit you
testimonia<00:04:52.889> nitrite<00:04:53.280> nitrate<00:04:53.310> pH<00:04:54.120> all<00:04:54.389> that

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
testimonia nitrite nitrate pH all that

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.100 
testimonia nitrite nitrate pH all that
stuff<00:04:56.060> nitrate<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.830> not<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.860> bad<00:04:59.129> thing<00:04:59.430> okay

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
stuff nitrate is not a bad thing okay

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.390 
stuff nitrate is not a bad thing okay
but<00:05:01.110> okay<00:05:01.349> well<00:05:01.620> let<00:05:01.710> me<00:05:01.740> just<00:05:01.830> explain<00:05:02.189> like

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
but okay well let me just explain like

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.800 
but okay well let me just explain like
this<00:05:02.550> so<00:05:03.000> when<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.180> put<00:05:03.300> your<00:05:03.330> freshener

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
this so when you put your freshener

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.300 
this so when you put your freshener
they'll<00:05:03.990> start<00:05:04.229> to<00:05:04.319> give<00:05:04.590> off<00:05:04.710> waste<00:05:05.039> stuff

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
they'll start to give off waste stuff

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.580 
they'll start to give off waste stuff
turns<00:05:05.849> into<00:05:06.029> ammonia<00:05:06.419> well<00:05:07.139> then<00:05:07.289> as<00:05:07.439> your

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
turns into ammonia well then as your

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.589 
turns into ammonia well then as your
back<00:05:07.770> as<00:05:08.039> your<00:05:08.219> tank<00:05:08.490> ages<00:05:08.909> and<00:05:09.060> cycles<00:05:09.479> the

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
back as your tank ages and cycles the

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.140 
back as your tank ages and cycles the
bacteria<00:05:10.080> will<00:05:10.229> start<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.800> break<00:05:11.789> down<00:05:11.819> the

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
bacteria will start to break down the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.860 
bacteria will start to break down the
ammonia<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:12.840> turn<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.169> into<00:05:13.289> nitrite<00:05:13.830> nitrate

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
ammonia and turn it into nitrite nitrate

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.050 
ammonia and turn it into nitrite nitrate
is<00:05:15.870> still<00:05:16.199> very<00:05:16.469> dangerous<00:05:17.009> to<00:05:17.189> fish<00:05:17.460> so

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
is still very dangerous to fish so

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.939 
is still very dangerous to fish so
you're<00:05:18.180> not<00:05:18.330> ammonia<00:05:18.870> will<00:05:18.990> spike<00:05:19.229> then<00:05:19.800> your

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
you're not ammonia will spike then your

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.159 
you're not ammonia will spike then your
nitrite<00:05:20.430> will<00:05:20.610> spike<00:05:20.879> and<00:05:21.180> then<00:05:21.750> both<00:05:21.960> of<00:05:21.990> them

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
nitrite will spike and then both of them

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.709 
nitrite will spike and then both of them
will<00:05:22.229> drop<00:05:22.529> off<00:05:23.060> when<00:05:24.060> they<00:05:24.210> start<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.569> drop

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:24.719 
will drop off when they start to drop

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.300 
will drop off when they start to drop
off<00:05:24.900> you'll<00:05:25.110> see<00:05:25.169> your<00:05:25.409> nitrate<00:05:25.889> start<00:05:26.189> to

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
off you'll see your nitrate start to

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.219 
off you'll see your nitrate start to
rise<00:05:26.520> nitrate<00:05:27.060> is<00:05:27.210> not<00:05:27.389> nearly<00:05:27.629> as<00:05:27.779> harmful<00:05:28.080> to

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
rise nitrate is not nearly as harmful to

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.279 
rise nitrate is not nearly as harmful to
fish<00:05:28.500> as<00:05:28.770> ammonia<00:05:29.759> and<00:05:29.909> nitrite<00:05:30.389> during<00:05:31.199> the

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
fish as ammonia and nitrite during the

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.450 
fish as ammonia and nitrite during the
course<00:05:31.529> of<00:05:31.650> all<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:31.889> it's<00:05:32.099> going<00:05:32.219> to<00:05:32.279> take

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
course of all this it's going to take

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.980 
course of all this it's going to take
about<00:05:32.580> 4<00:05:32.909> to<00:05:32.969> 6<00:05:33.210> weeks<00:05:33.270> you're<00:05:33.629> going<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.810> want

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
about 4 to 6 weeks you're going to want

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.439 
about 4 to 6 weeks you're going to want
to<00:05:34.020> avoid<00:05:34.379> doing<00:05:34.440> water<00:05:34.889> changes<00:05:34.979> and<00:05:35.610> whatnot

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
to avoid doing water changes and whatnot

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.180 
to avoid doing water changes and whatnot
because<00:05:37.199> that's<00:05:37.379> just<00:05:37.529> going<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.770> prolong<00:05:38.069> the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
because that's just going to prolong the

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.920 
because that's just going to prolong the
cycling<00:05:38.669> period<00:05:40.129> so<00:05:41.129> when<00:05:41.759> your<00:05:42.089> ammonia<00:05:42.719> and

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
cycling period so when your ammonia and

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
natural smell that's just water that's

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.379 
natural smell that's just water that's
been<00:06:10.589> sitting<00:06:10.919> for<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:11.099> while<00:06:11.159> dude<00:06:11.580> just<00:06:11.759> you

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
filters working fine you don't need to

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.649 
filters working fine you don't need to
change<00:06:16.259> any<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:16.589> that<00:06:16.770> stuff<00:06:18.289> um<00:06:19.879> so<00:06:20.879> after<00:06:21.360> you

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
change any of that stuff um so after you

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.050 
change any of that stuff um so after you
tank<00:06:21.930> cycles<00:06:22.469> you<00:06:23.189> can<00:06:23.219> start<00:06:23.580> adding<00:06:23.699> fish

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
tank cycles you can start adding fish

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.320 
tank cycles you can start adding fish
you<00:06:24.270> don't<00:06:24.300> want<00:06:24.659> to<00:06:24.810> add<00:06:24.990> fish<00:06:25.939> like<00:06:26.939> all<00:06:27.180> at

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
you don't want to add fish like all at

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.350 
you don't want to add fish like all at
once<00:06:27.509> I<00:06:27.629> mean<00:06:27.779> two<00:06:27.930> or<00:06:27.960> three<00:06:28.199> at<00:06:28.289> a<00:06:28.349> time

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
once I mean two or three at a time

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.540 
once I mean two or three at a time
and<00:06:29.479> you'll<00:06:30.020> be<00:06:30.199> good<00:06:30.889> to<00:06:31.039> go<00:06:31.159> if<00:06:31.280> you<00:06:31.370> add<00:06:31.520> a

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
and you'll be good to go if you add a

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.320 
and you'll be good to go if you add a
whole<00:06:31.729> bunch

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
whole bunch

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.189 
whole bunch
you<00:06:32.900> can<00:06:33.169> overstock<00:06:34.159> the<00:06:34.310> tank<00:06:34.610> and<00:06:35.360> because

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
you can overstock the tank and because

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:37.719 
you can overstock the tank and because
it's<00:06:36.349> still<00:06:36.560> relatively<00:06:36.979> new<00:06:37.099> things<00:06:37.460> can<00:06:37.639> be

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
it's still relatively new things can be

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.100 
it's still relatively new things can be
kind<00:06:37.940> of<00:06:38.030> bumpy<00:06:38.270> for<00:06:38.449> the<00:06:38.509> first<00:06:38.720> two<00:06:38.930> or<00:06:39.080> three

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
kind of bumpy for the first two or three

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.749 
kind of bumpy for the first two or three
months<00:06:39.650> until<00:06:39.800> the<00:06:39.979> tank<00:06:40.190> is<00:06:40.310> like<00:06:40.490> fully

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
months until the tank is like fully

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.640 
months until the tank is like fully
established<00:06:41.360> then<00:06:42.050> in<00:06:42.139> the<00:06:42.229> course<00:06:42.440> of<00:06:42.560> the

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
established then in the course of the

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.260 
established then in the course of the
cycling<00:06:43.069> don't<00:06:43.280> be<00:06:43.370> surprised<00:06:43.819> if<00:06:44.000> you<00:06:44.090> get<00:06:44.210> a

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
cycling don't be surprised if you get a

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.939 
cycling don't be surprised if you get a
brown<00:06:44.599> algae<00:06:44.990> that<00:06:45.379> grows<00:06:45.650> all<00:06:45.919> over

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
brown algae that grows all over

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.249

over your decorations it's going to look
like<00:06:50.000> crap<00:06:50.300> you<00:06:50.629> can<00:06:50.870> go<00:06:51.110> in<00:06:51.259> and<00:06:51.409> clean<00:06:51.650> it<00:06:51.680> if

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
like crap you can go in and clean it if

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.520 
like crap you can go in and clean it if
you<00:06:52.039> want<00:06:52.250> when<00:06:53.060> you<00:06:53.150> do<00:06:53.360> expect<00:06:54.020> to<00:06:54.080> stir<00:06:54.349> up<00:06:54.379> a

you want when you do expect to stir up a

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.200 
you want when you do expect to stir up a
bacterial<00:06:54.979> bloom<00:06:55.250> but<00:06:55.580> whatever<00:06:55.879> you<00:06:55.970> do<00:06:56.090> do

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
bacterial bloom but whatever you do do

bacterial bloom but whatever you do do
not<00:06:56.240> do<00:06:56.659> water<00:06:56.900> changes<00:06:58.270> it's<00:06:59.270> just<00:06:59.629> part<00:07:00.289> of

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
not do water changes it's just part of

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.219 
not do water changes it's just part of
what<00:07:00.409> happens<00:07:00.919> man<00:07:01.300> so<00:07:02.300> that's<00:07:02.930> what<00:07:03.110> to
