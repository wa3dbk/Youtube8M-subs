needle<00:01:46.189> put<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> end<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> needle<00:01:48.030> into

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
needle put the end of the needle into

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.370 
needle put the end of the needle into
the<00:01:48.450> loop<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.850> pull<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.720> clip<00:01:51.960> down

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the loop and then pull the clip down

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
the loop and then pull the clip down
onto<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> leader<00:01:55.219> then<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.340> take<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> tail

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
onto the leader then you take the tail

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.170 
onto the leader then you take the tail
rubber<00:01:57.530> again<00:01:58.530> push<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> tail<00:01:59.610> rubber<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
rubber again push the tail rubber on to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.289 
rubber again push the tail rubber on to
the<00:02:00.299> needle<00:02:01.369> take<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> loop<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> end<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the needle take the loop at the end of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.330 
the needle take the loop at the end of
the<00:02:03.390> leader<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.469> where<00:02:04.770> your<00:02:04.920> real<00:02:05.070> line

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the leader the one where your real line

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.979 
the leader the one where your real line
is<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:07.170> then<00:02:08.629> pull<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> tail

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
is going to go and then pull the tail

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.140 
is going to go and then pull the tail
rubber<00:02:10.259> down<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> same

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
rubber down just the same

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.860 
rubber down just the same
slide<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.930> down<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.069> business<00:02:14.459> end

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
slide that down to the business end

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
slide that down to the business end
there<00:02:15.870> we've<00:02:15.959> got<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.110> little<00:02:16.349> bit<00:02:16.500> more<00:02:16.680> work

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
there we've got a little bit more work

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.520 
there we've got a little bit more work
to<00:02:17.099> do<00:02:17.280> yet<00:02:17.870> obviously<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.959> need<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.319> show<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
to do yet obviously I need to show you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.410 
to do yet obviously I need to show you
how<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.770> put<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.160> lid<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:20.760> first<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.270> all

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
how to put the lid on but first of all

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.270 
how to put the lid on but first of all
let's<00:02:21.989> look<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.290> how<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.500> connect<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.069> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
let's look at how you connect this to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.490 
let's look at how you connect this to
the<00:02:23.370> mainline<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.090> use<00:02:24.450> what's<00:02:25.110> called<00:02:25.410> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the mainline and I use what's called a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.770 
the mainline and I use what's called a
loop<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.950> loop<00:02:25.980> connection<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.540> very

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
loop to loop connection this is very

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.890 
loop to loop connection this is very
simple<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:28.670> take<00:02:29.670> about<00:02:29.910> 10<00:02:30.209> inches<00:02:30.390> align

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
simple to do take about 10 inches align

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.559 
simple to do take about 10 inches align
and<00:02:31.200> double<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.800> over<00:02:31.980> forming<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.000> big<00:02:33.180> open

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
and double it over forming a big open

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.430 
and double it over forming a big open
loop<00:02:34.880> close<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> loop<00:02:36.209> up<00:02:36.450> by<00:02:36.630> holding<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.260> so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
loop close the loop up by holding it so

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.620 
loop close the loop up by holding it so
that<00:02:37.560> it's<00:02:37.680> doubled<00:02:38.099> like<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.880> then

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that it's doubled like this and then

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.699 
that it's doubled like this and then
form<00:02:39.930> another<00:02:40.200> loop<00:02:41.540> passing<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:43.290> loop<00:02:43.500> in

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
form another loop passing the loop in

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.920 
form another loop passing the loop in
the<00:02:43.830> end<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> doubled<00:02:44.730> section<00:02:45.239> through

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the end of the doubled section through

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.150 
the end of the doubled section through
the<00:02:45.959> new<00:02:46.260> loop<00:02:46.530> twice<00:02:47.720> then<00:02:48.769> moisten<00:02:49.769> they're

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
the new loop twice then moisten they're

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.009 
the new loop twice then moisten they're
not<00:02:50.310> always<00:02:50.519> moisten<00:02:51.060> your<00:02:51.299> fishing<00:02:51.810> knots

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
not always moisten your fishing knots

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.600 
not always moisten your fishing knots
and<00:02:52.549> pull<00:02:54.260> everything<00:02:55.260> tight<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.280> you've<00:02:56.430> now

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
and pull everything tight so you've now

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.610 
and pull everything tight so you've now
got<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.849> loop<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.299> end<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.630> your<00:02:57.750> line<00:02:57.930> you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
got a loop in the end of your line you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.960 
got a loop in the end of your line you
trim<00:02:58.950> off<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.220> tag<00:03:01.400> either<00:03:02.400> with<00:03:02.760> some

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
trim off this tag either with some

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.640 
trim off this tag either with some
scissors<00:03:03.360> or<00:03:03.510> if<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.750> got<00:03:03.900> sharp<00:03:04.200> teeth<00:03:04.500> you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
scissors or if you got sharp teeth you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.870 
scissors or if you got sharp teeth you
can<00:03:04.769> do<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:05.040> your<00:03:05.160> teeth<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.700> want

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
can do it with your teeth if you want

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.089 
can do it with your teeth if you want
but<00:03:06.599> anyway<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.019> point<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.410> you've<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.799> got<00:03:08.069> a

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
but anyway the point is you've now got a

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.390 
but anyway the point is you've now got a
loop<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.790> end<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.209> your<00:03:09.269> mainline<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:11.250> way

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
loop in the end of your mainline the way

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.830 
loop in the end of your mainline the way
you<00:03:11.459> connect<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.180> leader<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.599> very

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
you connect it to the leader is very

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.839 
you connect it to the leader is very
simple<00:03:13.319> take<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.069> loop<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.489> end<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
simple take the loop in the end of the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.599 
simple take the loop in the end of the
mainline<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.709> look<00:03:16.890> at<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.100> loop<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.579> end

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
mainline and look at the loop in the end

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.590 
mainline and look at the loop in the end
of<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.940> leader<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.570> real<00:03:19.350> end<00:03:19.620> one<00:03:20.150> push<00:03:21.150> the

of the leader the real end one push the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.720 
of the leader the real end one push the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
mainline loop through the heat welded

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.630 
mainline loop through the heat welded
loop<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.720> then<00:03:27.829> take<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.980> clip<00:03:29.220> end<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.549> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
loop and then take the clip end of the

loop and then take the clip end of the
leader<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.209> pass<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.109> through<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.769> loop<00:03:32.730> in

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
the end of the mainline and then draw

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.059 
the end of the mainline and then draw
the<00:03:35.880> whole<00:03:36.120> thing<00:03:36.390> up<00:03:36.569> tight<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.799> what<00:03:37.950> you

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
the whole thing up tight and what you

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.280 
the whole thing up tight and what you
end<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.370> with<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.120> very<00:03:39.299> good<00:03:39.780> loop<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.260> loop

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
end up with is a very good loop to loop

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.400 
end up with is a very good loop to loop
connection<00:03:41.239> now<00:03:42.239> I've<00:03:42.389> never<00:03:42.630> had<00:03:42.989> this<00:03:43.170> let

me down and the beauty of it is is that
if<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.709> just<00:03:46.889> push<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.400> open<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.470> then<00:03:49.470> feed

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
if you just push this open and then feed

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.500 
if you just push this open and then feed
the<00:03:50.100> leader<00:03:50.310> back<00:03:50.639> through<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.150> loop<00:03:51.299> in<00:03:51.480> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
the leader back through the loop in the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.690 
the leader back through the loop in the
mainline<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.440> whole<00:03:52.650> thing<00:03:52.920> disconnects<00:03:53.609> so

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
mainline the whole thing disconnects so

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.340 
mainline the whole thing disconnects so
you<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.880> change<00:03:54.150> leaders<00:03:54.540> instantly<00:03:55.170> it's

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
you can change leaders instantly it's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.539 
you can change leaders instantly it's
very<00:03:55.560> very<00:03:55.799> easy<00:03:57.829> we<00:03:58.829> won't<00:03:59.010> do<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.190> now

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
very very easy we won't do that now

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.280 
very very easy we won't do that now
though<00:03:59.790> because<00:04:00.359> what<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:00.810> want<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.079> do<00:04:01.200> at

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
though because what we want to do at

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.580 
though because what we want to do at
this<00:04:01.410> stage<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.130> connect<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.700> LED<00:04:02.850> on

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
this stage is to connect the LED on

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.789 
this stage is to connect the LED on
that's<00:04:04.590> really<00:04:04.799> very<00:04:05.069> simple<00:04:06.470> let's<00:04:07.470> go<00:04:07.590> back

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
that's really very simple let's go back

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.250 
that's really very simple let's go back
down<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.250> clip<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:08.700> rubber<00:04:09.260> you'll

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
down to the clip and the rubber you'll

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.750 
down to the clip and the rubber you'll
find<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.620> there's<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.799> little<00:04:10.980> lug<00:04:11.310> here<00:04:11.579> on

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
find that there's a little lug here on

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.910 
find that there's a little lug here on
the<00:04:11.910> clip<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.139> just<00:04:13.350> open<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:13.680> up

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
the clip if you just open that up

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.750 
the clip if you just open that up
slightly<00:04:14.780> take<00:04:15.780> your<00:04:15.959> lead<00:04:16.280> push<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.430> onto<00:04:17.579> the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
slightly take your lead push it onto the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.870 
slightly take your lead push it onto the
lug<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.359> sits<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:20.220> little<00:04:20.430> recess

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
lug so it sits on the little recess

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.870 
lug so it sits on the little recess
below<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.539> then<00:04:22.109> push<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:23.070> tail<00:04:23.310> rubber<00:04:23.550> just

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
below and then push the tail rubber just

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.840 
below and then push the tail rubber just
feed<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.330> onto<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.810> clip

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
feed it onto the clip

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.620 
feed it onto the clip
like<00:04:26.850> this<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:28.020> your<00:04:28.199> legs<00:04:28.380> now<00:04:28.590> connected

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
like this and your legs now connected

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.830 
like this and your legs now connected
then<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:31.290> pull<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.620> ring<00:04:31.800> swivel<00:04:32.610> up<00:04:33.090> inside

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
then you pull the ring swivel up inside

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.500 
then you pull the ring swivel up inside
the<00:04:34.050> clip<00:04:34.290> like<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.910> what<00:04:36.090> you've<00:04:36.240> got

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
the clip like this and what you've got

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.969 
the clip like this and what you've got
is<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.500> nice<00:04:37.800> heavy<00:04:38.070> bolt<00:04:38.430> rig<00:04:38.639> effect<00:04:39.830> so<00:04:40.830> why

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
is a nice heavy bolt rig effect so why

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.560 
is a nice heavy bolt rig effect so why
do<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.190> use<00:04:41.280> this<00:04:41.669> leader<00:04:41.940> well<00:04:42.180> it's<00:04:42.330> twofold

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
do you use this leader well it's twofold

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.080 
do you use this leader well it's twofold
really<00:04:43.290> first<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.800> all<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.610> fact<00:04:44.850> that<00:04:44.910> it's

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
really first of all the fact that it's

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.640 
really first of all the fact that it's
thicker<00:04:45.360> than<00:04:45.600> your<00:04:45.720> mainline<00:04:45.900> prevents

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
thicker than your mainline prevents

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.460 
thicker than your mainline prevents
tangles<00:04:47.130> when<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.400> cast<00:04:47.960> secondly<00:04:48.960> because

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
tangles when you cast secondly because

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.800 
tangles when you cast secondly because
the<00:04:49.770> leaders<00:04:50.100> impregnated<00:04:50.880> with<00:04:51.030> tungsten<00:04:51.330> it

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
the leaders impregnated with tungsten it

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.110 
the leaders impregnated with tungsten it
sinks<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.860> pings<00:04:53.160> down<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.610> line<00:04:53.820> behind

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
sinks and it pings down the line behind

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.780 
sinks and it pings down the line behind
the<00:04:54.600> lead<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.380> if<00:04:55.500> any<00:04:55.680> fish<00:04:56.010> feed<00:04:56.639> around

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
the lead so that if any fish feed around

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.250 
the lead so that if any fish feed around
your<00:04:57.180> hook<00:04:57.270> bait<00:04:57.540> they're<00:04:57.750> not<00:04:57.870> going<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.020> swim

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
your hook bait they're not going to swim

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.110 
your hook bait they're not going to swim
into<00:04:58.440> your<00:04:58.680> line<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.250> become<00:04:59.580> alarmed<00:05:00.000> or

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
into your line and become alarmed or

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.960 
into your line and become alarmed or
spook<00:05:00.510> out<00:05:00.720> of<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:00.990> area<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.460> helps<00:05:02.910> to

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
spook out of the area so it helps to

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.719 
spook out of the area so it helps to
prevent<00:05:03.300> spooking<00:05:03.930> fish<00:05:04.199> this<00:05:04.949> stuff<00:05:05.220> is<00:05:05.400> much

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
prevent spooking fish this stuff is much

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.420 
prevent spooking fish this stuff is much

which is very rough and can catch under
the<00:05:10.380> fish's<00:05:10.740> scales<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.669> is<00:05:11.850> slippery<00:05:12.150> and

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
the fish's scales this is slippery and

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.629 
the fish's scales this is slippery and
won't<00:05:12.630> damage<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.199> fish's<00:05:13.350> scales<00:05:13.650> but<00:05:14.550> it

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
won't damage the fish's scales but it

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.790 
won't damage the fish's scales but it
will<00:05:14.699> still<00:05:14.970> pin<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.360> down<00:05:15.600> now<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.560> other

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800

will still pin it down now the other
important<00:05:17.400> point<00:05:17.550> about<00:05:17.910> this<00:05:18.120> leader<00:05:18.449> is

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
important point about this leader is

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.900 
important point about this leader is
that<00:05:18.720> it's<00:05:19.020> very<00:05:19.229> very<00:05:19.440> carp<00:05:19.830> safe<00:05:20.220> let's

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
that it's very very carp safe let's

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.700 
that it's very very carp safe let's
imagine<00:05:21.240> that<00:05:21.600> you<00:05:21.780> crack<00:05:22.110> this<00:05:22.289> rig<00:05:22.530> off

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
imagine that you crack this rig off

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.469 
imagine that you crack this rig off
maybe<00:05:23.039> you<00:05:23.190> cast<00:05:23.460> out<00:05:23.699> into<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.150> lake<00:05:24.270> with

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
maybe you cast out into the lake with

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.779 
maybe you cast out into the lake with
you<00:05:24.600> baited<00:05:24.990> rig<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.710> line<00:05:25.919> cracks<00:05:26.280> off<00:05:26.520> and

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
you baited rig the line cracks off and

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.340 
you baited rig the line cracks off and
you've<00:05:26.970> left<00:05:27.180> a<00:05:27.330> rig<00:05:27.510> out<00:05:27.690> there<00:05:27.900> with<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.110> bait

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.650 
you've left a rig out there with a bait
attached<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.979> it<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.669> danger<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.120> if<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.419> carp

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
attached to it the danger is if the carp

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.779 
attached to it the danger is if the carp
comes<00:05:30.930> along<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.380> sucks<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.770> your<00:05:31.919> bait<00:05:32.099> it's

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
comes along and sucks in your bait it's

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.760

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.560 
going to have to tow around all of this
leader<00:05:35.099> and<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.550> great<00:05:35.669> big<00:05:35.940> heavy<00:05:36.120> lead<00:05:36.389> we

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
leader and a great big heavy lead we

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.000 
leader and a great big heavy lead we
obviously<00:05:36.690> don't<00:05:37.080> want<00:05:37.229> that<00:05:37.560> because<00:05:37.830> the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
obviously don't want that because the

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.490 
obviously don't want that because the
carp<00:05:38.639> might<00:05:38.849> become<00:05:39.180> tethered<00:05:39.570> up<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.380> it

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
carp might become tethered up and and it

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.710 
carp might become tethered up and and it
might<00:05:40.650> injure<00:05:40.860> itself<00:05:41.370> so<00:05:41.760> what<00:05:42.419> we're<00:05:42.570> after

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
might injure itself so what we're after

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.950 
might injure itself so what we're after
is<00:05:43.139> a<00:05:43.740> bolt<00:05:44.610> rig<00:05:44.849> type<00:05:45.120> setup<00:05:45.660> that<00:05:45.870> will

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
is a bolt rig type setup that will

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.930 
is a bolt rig type setup that will
actually<00:05:46.139> disengage<00:05:46.860> in<00:05:47.099> disconnect<00:05:47.669> so<00:05:47.789> what

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
actually disengage in disconnect so what

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.790 
actually disengage in disconnect so what
happens<00:05:48.270> in<00:05:48.389> this<00:05:48.510> case<00:05:48.750> is<00:05:48.810> that<00:05:49.530> under

happens in this case is that under

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.680 
happens in this case is that under
moderate<00:05:50.190> pressure<00:05:50.490> should<00:05:51.270> this<00:05:51.419> lead<00:05:51.660> a

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
end it will slide all the way up the

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.330 
end it will slide all the way up the
leader<00:05:59.280> and<00:06:00.440> when<00:06:01.440> it's<00:06:01.590> wet<00:06:01.830> it's<00:06:02.070> very

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
leader and when it's wet it's very

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.700 
leader and when it's wet it's very
slippery<00:06:02.789> it<00:06:03.270> will<00:06:03.449> just<00:06:03.690> pull<00:06:03.960> off<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.289> loop

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
slippery it will just pull off the loop

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.529 
slippery it will just pull off the loop
at<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:04.949> top<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.400> hole<00:06:05.610> lead<00:06:05.910> system<00:06:06.389> will

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
at the top the hole lead system will

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.920 
at the top the hole lead system will
fall<00:06:06.780> off<00:06:07.220> the<00:06:08.220> other<00:06:08.400> alternative<00:06:09.389> is<00:06:09.630> that

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
fall off the other alternative is that

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.839 
fall off the other alternative is that
under<00:06:10.199> certain<00:06:10.590> amount<00:06:10.919> of<00:06:10.979> pressure<00:06:11.220> the

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
under certain amount of pressure the

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.760 
under certain amount of pressure the
tail<00:06:12.150> rubber<00:06:12.419> will<00:06:13.020> literally<00:06:13.320> pull<00:06:13.650> away

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
tail rubber will literally pull away

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.830 
tail rubber will literally pull away
from<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.250> clip<00:06:14.490> and<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.120> led<00:06:15.270> will<00:06:15.419> fall<00:06:15.630> off

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
from the clip and the led will fall off

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.589 
from the clip and the led will fall off
there<00:06:16.110> so<00:06:16.590> it's<00:06:16.740> a<00:06:16.830> very<00:06:17.220> very<00:06:17.520> carp<00:06:17.970> safe<00:06:18.300> way

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
there so it's a very very carp safe way

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.830 
there so it's a very very carp safe way
of<00:06:19.460> connecting<00:06:20.460> up<00:06:20.849> your<00:06:21.090> lead<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.720> the

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
of connecting up your lead to the

of connecting up your lead to the
mainline<00:06:23.240> all<00:06:24.240> you've<00:06:24.510> got<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:24.870> do<00:06:25.050> once

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
mainline all you've got to do once

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.420 
mainline all you've got to do once
you've<00:06:25.530> got<00:06:25.770> this<00:06:25.949> set<00:06:26.010> up<00:06:26.430> it's<00:06:26.910> quite<00:06:27.240> simply

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
you've got this set up it's quite simply

rig that's ready to go I'd particularly

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.050 
rig that's ready to go I'd particularly
recommend<00:06:37.680> using<00:06:37.979> this

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
recommend using this

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.379 
recommend using this
click<00:06:39.660> type<00:06:39.960> setup<00:06:40.500> for<00:06:41.220> use<00:06:41.370> with<00:06:41.580> PVA<00:06:41.970> bags

I'll<00:06:43.080> show<00:06:43.410> you<00:06:43.530> another<00:06:43.620> type<00:06:44.070> a<00:06:44.250> leader<00:06:44.460> now

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
I'll show you another type a leader now

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.150 
I'll show you another type a leader now
a<00:06:45.060> helicopter<00:06:45.780> rig<00:06:45.960> which<00:06:46.440> is<00:06:46.590> very<00:06:46.830> good<00:06:47.040> in

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
a helicopter rig which is very good in

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.520 
a helicopter rig which is very good in
weed<00:06:47.370> and<00:06:47.610> silt<00:06:47.910> but<00:06:48.480> is<00:06:48.600> not<00:06:48.840> so<00:06:49.020> good<00:06:49.139> for<00:06:49.200> bag

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
weed and silt but is not so good for bag

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.920 
weed and silt but is not so good for bag
work<00:06:49.800> but<00:06:50.520> the<00:06:50.730> principle<00:06:51.240> will<00:06:51.419> be<00:06:51.660> pretty

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
work but the principle will be pretty

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.959 
work but the principle will be pretty
much<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.169> same

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:56.969 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.029
