let's see you have five speeds the

in<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.600> case<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.079> radiators<00:02:50.560> get<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.739> bit<00:02:50.890> the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
in the case the radiators get a bit the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.000 
in the case the radiators get a bit the
mountain<00:02:51.400> mounted<00:02:52.380> internally<00:02:53.380> on<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.769> top

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
mountain mounted internally on the top

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.759 
mountain mounted internally on the top
so<00:02:54.640> if<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:55.030> was<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.269> case<00:02:55.480> over<00:02:55.840> here<00:02:56.110> we

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
so if this was the case over here we

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.199 
so if this was the case over here we
mounted<00:02:57.070> right<00:02:57.280> here<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.700> will<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:57.910> fans

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
mounted right here it will have fans

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.310 
mounted right here it will have fans
underneath<00:02:58.750> blowing<00:02:59.200> air<00:02:59.560> this<00:03:00.100> way<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320
