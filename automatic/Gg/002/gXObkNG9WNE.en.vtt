00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.890
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.869
 video today we are here with the unboxing the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.500
 review of the predator hicks record 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.090
 x3 white edition as you can see 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.669
 during the video, that was removed 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.559
 because I had problems with 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.669
 registration with the machine 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:35.399
 photographic and therefore had to 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 record the video while I was 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.250
 inserting the components inside the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.899
 crisis 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.090
 having said that I wish you good vision 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.270
 let's start then on the front 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.960
 we can find the two USB 3.0 ports 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.380
 the microphone output and the output of the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.090
 holes then laterally we have two LEDs 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.860
 here and here in white and the two fans 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.890
 controller that allows you to control 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.960
 three fans each up here 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.589
 we have the power button e 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.509
 shutdown 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.509
 now we're hearing the sound too 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:17.549
 very nice sturdy as a button of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.040
 ignition and at the top instead we find it 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.729
 door to insert the hard disks from 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.760
 2.5 inches this is a rubber compartment 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.479
 non-slip fitting for storage I do n't know 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.390
 pennette and stuff varies and in the part 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.490
 higher precisely we find one of the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.220
 much more things 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 most interesting of this series lx 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.540
 predator that these species are 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.210
 of flap wings I do n't know how you want 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.409
 call them that you can lower or 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.820
 raise through this lever and that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.340
 allow more precisely than the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.369
 air recirculation 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.810
 speaking of air we have a fan 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:08.700
 back 140 mm pre installed and one 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.920
 in front of 200 with regard to 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.980
 fans can be installed in general behind 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.000
 we have support for a fan from 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.850
 140 which would already be pre-installed or for 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.489
 one of 120 we find here all the more 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.549
 small on the top instead 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.959
 here we can predict we have the 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:36.060
 possibility to install one and 200 to 2 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.319
 from the 142 to 120 on the lower part 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.010
 instead we have the possibility 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.870
 install one and a 140 one from 120 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.049
 while frontally where we already have 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.530
 that to 200 it is possible to remove it for 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:54.380
 install them to install and from 120 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:58.950
 while on the side panel at 32 both 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.840
 from 120 to 140 and let's move on to the others 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.970
 features this is the panel 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.680
 side that made you see we have 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.829
 this plastic note panel 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.930
 very sturdy that allows precisely the 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.760
 vision of components inside i 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:21.889
 materials are I believe metal and metal 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.609
 also beautiful it is often resistant and 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:29.269
 the inside we can find the room for 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.450
 for the power supply I've already dealt with 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.180
 these are the masks to be removed 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.680
 for expansion slots 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.780
 the compartment for the motherboard e 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.340
 laterally we find the rubbers 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.120
 for the passage of cables of the 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.850
 liquid cooling here and here 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.520
 very beautiful the rubber is beautiful resistant 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.090
 so even if we stress it back to 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.280
 his place does not fold very well 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.020
 on the other hand we find how you can 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.300
 already see the cables that are threaded 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.840
 precisely in other rubbers for the cable 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:14.220
 management and that we have all along 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.989
 this side is also below and am 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.260
 really very comfortable i 'm there 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:23.130
 really trying very well 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:26.490
 instead we have the positive ni for 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.960
 the readers I have already taken care of 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.280
 then entrust it to a thread 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.199
 al is called for easy closure 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.120
 so you have to press and do this 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:44.639
 click is instead at the bottom we have the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.400
 I also had these hard drive slots 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.280
 already begun to insert these too 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.449
 it was for an easy entry because 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.569
 that's enough 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:05:00.919
 let's say pincha re and pull out e 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.919
 these come out and we put it back inside 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:13.800
 let's start that it's perfect framed 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:16.800
 let's move on to the cables we say it is at 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.349
 various things supplied with this 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.090
 black box that you will find threaded 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:28.740
 water I believe we find straight wires 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.569
 bari and vines but above all very much 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.650
 important 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:37.560
 we find this adapter here that 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.570
 allows to use the two 3.0 ports in the 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.440
 case that he did not have the possibility as 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.580
 two ports and 2.0 and this is my case 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.590
 because I still haven't received the 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.440
 our mother then in the old one 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.719
 I don't have the support of 3.0 and therefore 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.219
 this accessory comes back to me very much 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.199
 helpful 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:59.570
 revenue space as you can 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:02.789
 seeing a yarn the finger is enough 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.360
 also according to this part of the hard 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.360
 disk is really so beautiful centimeters 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.370
 can not even I would not like inclined 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.639
 so even an inch and a half is there 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.099
 the space that runs the cables is 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:21.750
 it is not enough of the major but it is 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:26.639
 enough in my opinion then that tell you 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.949
 this was obviously not the keys 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.539
 you will see that all nice open 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.830
 clean but for this there are images 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:37.349
 of the official website e 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:41.069
 noda di b there is nothing else then I greet you 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:43.550
 with the former predator x3 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.550
 hello everyone
