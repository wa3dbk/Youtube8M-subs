 it is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.070
 in a flash 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.290
 Berlin

 there 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.839
 in the web 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.239
 and 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.799
 I used to think that I myself was worse 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.099
 it is not foreseeable 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 Lucia it's a normal Aris dump 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.929

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.620
 that he is now from a time when it was not the event that he showed here 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.620

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.539
 like 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.539

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.590
 Why 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.770

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.349
