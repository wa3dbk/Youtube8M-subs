00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.920
 d 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.300
 the subway service to the connational gentlemen 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.360
 is informing them about the presence 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.480
 from this since it's front number 43 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.460
 system following its progress towards 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.289
 southeast is located in southeastern Mexico 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.970
 and on the Yucatan peninsula and that 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.850
 It is associated with the entry of moisture 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.320
 that comes from the pacific therefore 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.510
 rainfall if indeed in the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.149
 center in the south in the east in the 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.500
 Southeast and the Yucatan Peninsula 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.480
 rainfall that goes from strong to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.250
 Intense be very very aware of 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.640
 this because they will also be accompanied 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.440
 of electrical activity and very hail 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.240
 very up-slope the cold air mass 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.550
 covers the north and center of the republic 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.410
 mexicana do not say all the east and 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.270
 that is offering us not only 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.950
 significantly lower temperatures but 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.530
 also the event 'north' that 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.960
 violent wind in the Gulf of Mexico 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.450
 60 to 70 kilos per hour and that can 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.520
 exceed 100 kilometers in it and 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.040
 gulf of tehuantepec must be 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.899
 attentive to this situation as long as 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.460
 the temperatures thousands of temperatures 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.890
 that are reaching 42 degrees in 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.620
 hermosillo a very very warm atmosphere 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.020
 there is a slight up 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.160
 It is not enough to generate negotiated 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.430
 this is an almost clear sky 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.740
 totally sunny with anger and precisely 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.200
 well in those neighborhoods of very temperature 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.300
 but very high towards the states of 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.250
 northeast and north where the system 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.410
 of cold air continues to dominate the mornings 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.210
 they are still cold very cold 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.490
 maximum temperatures then only from 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.250
 warm to warm reach these 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.840
 sensors in this region the sky has 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.700
 a cloudy medium and very very 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.100
 occasional some rainfall the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.870
 the west also receives all this great 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.640
 zone the humidity that comes from the 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.740
 peaceful a half cloudy sky to 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.630
 some rainfall of course 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.940
 they are generalizing towards the center and 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.010
 the east of the Mexican republic with 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.470
 temperatures can reach only 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.300
 that on a tempered scale in the biggest 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.180
 part of this region the state of 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.890
 warrior still also giving rise to a 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.130
 temperature condition really very 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.110
 nice from 32 to 34 very sunny sky 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.910
 some rainfall just in the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.250
 saw and that we're from a table the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.830
 center towards its southern region that also 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.930
 you see some cloudy with 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.150
 precipitation temperatures 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.220
 let's say nice between 25 and 28 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.160
 the maximum temperature in a good part of 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.769
 the south of the southeast center table 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.569
 on this very humid very well stable 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.160
 on the part of what is the front and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.989
 We certainly expect rainfall of 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.150
 strong to intense in our region and 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.250
 very strong in the yucatan peninsula 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.010
 that is completely covered by this 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.830
 frontal system the 43 and that also 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.150
 there will be abundant rainfall in the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.980
 capital of the Mexican Republic to 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.519
 the next few days we are still waiting 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.590
 2006 temperatures in the morning quite 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.319
 Fresh the morning in the city ​​of mexico 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.630
 the maxims look like quito go to 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.519
 die recovering of 25 26 and the sky 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.870
 the sky partly cloudy a good part of the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.760
 day in the afternoon increase the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.720
 cloudiness and are also expected here in 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.920
 the capital of the country some 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.920
 precipitations that can become 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.049
 from moderate to occasionally strong 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.910
 with electrical activity and hail there 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.319
 that is also very, very 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.860
 pending is the most important thing that 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.670
 we have you from the service 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.670
 or national 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.819
 and 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 with water
