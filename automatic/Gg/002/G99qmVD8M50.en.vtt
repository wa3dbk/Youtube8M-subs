00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
even though it is a spinning they also

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
even though it is a spinning they also
offer<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.450> spin<00:01:13.200> casting<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.240> for<00:01:15.240> being<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.540> one

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

ball<00:01:15.990> bearing<00:01:16.290> system<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:16.890> pretty

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
ball bearing system it's actually pretty

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.969 
ball bearing system it's actually pretty
smooth<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.150> got<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> very<00:01:18.570> smooth<00:01:19.470> drag

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
smooth and it's got a very smooth drag

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.929 
smooth and it's got a very smooth drag
so<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.030> got<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.650> this<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.100> believe<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> star

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so it's got a this I believe the star

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:24.999 
so it's got a this I believe the star
drag

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
drag

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.910 
drag
I'd<00:01:26.009> say<00:01:26.340> rearward<00:01:26.939> drag<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.710> pretty<00:01:28.710> obsolete

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
I'd say rearward drag is pretty obsolete

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.060 
I'd say rearward drag is pretty obsolete
even<00:01:29.790> though<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.240> still<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:31.200> favorite<00:01:31.619> kind

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
even though it's still my favorite kind

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.179 
even though it's still my favorite kind
of<00:01:32.130> drag<00:01:32.400> system<00:01:33.290> as<00:01:34.290> far<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.740> eyelets

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
of drag system as far as these eyelets

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.740 
of drag system as far as these eyelets
and<00:01:35.430> overall<00:01:36.000> flexibility<00:01:36.630> its<00:01:37.350> net<00:01:38.540> it's<00:01:39.540> not

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and overall flexibility its net it's not

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.340 
and overall flexibility its net it's not
like<00:01:39.960> too<00:01:40.710> soft<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.549> too<00:01:41.640> sensitive<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.780> where

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
like too soft or too sensitive to where

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.550 
like too soft or too sensitive to where
you<00:01:43.439> can't<00:01:43.680> even<00:01:44.329> set<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.360> hook<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.350> got

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you can't even set the hook but it's got

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.100 
you can't even set the hook but it's got
some<00:01:46.799> rigidity<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.869> take<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
some rigidity to it so we can can take a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.880 
some rigidity to it so we can can take a
nice<00:01:49.409> smack<00:01:50.840> how's<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.990> hitting<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> tripod

so<00:02:32.160> also<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.210> can<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.630> used<00:02:33.750> for<00:02:33.960> ice<00:02:34.650> fishing

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
so also this can be used for ice fishing

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.350 
so also this can be used for ice fishing
so<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.330> would<00:02:36.810> say<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:38.060> light<00:02:39.060> to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so I would say this is like a light to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.410 
so I would say this is like a light to
medium<00:02:39.570> light<00:02:40.020> action<00:02:40.320> if<00:02:40.860> you're<00:02:41.300> looking<00:02:42.300> in

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
medium light action if you're looking in

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.600 
medium light action if you're looking in
terms<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.840> ice<00:02:43.020> fishing<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.280> attach<00:02:44.580> your

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
terms of ice fishing you can attach your

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.510 
terms of ice fishing you can attach your
spring<00:02:45.480> bobber<00:02:45.690> right<00:02:46.440> here<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.890> know<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.370> is

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
spring bobber right here I know this is

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.540 
spring bobber right here I know this is
a<00:02:48.140> dangling<00:02:49.140> fishing<00:02:49.590> line<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.190> can't<00:02:50.400> even

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
a dangling fishing line you can't even

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.710 
a dangling fishing line you can't even
see<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:53.340> also<00:02:53.550> be<00:02:53.880> used<00:02:54.030> for<00:02:54.300> if<00:02:54.480> you're

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
see that can also be used for if you're

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.330 
see that can also be used for if you're
out<00:02:55.640> doing<00:02:56.640> survival<00:02:57.980> hiking<00:02:58.980> or<00:02:59.100> something

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
to just go with live bait anyways so I'd

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.480 
to just go with live bait anyways so I'd
say<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:27.270> ten<00:03:27.450> dollars<00:03:27.900> almost<00:03:28.830> ready<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.250> fish

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
say for ten dollars almost ready to fish

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.670 
say for ten dollars almost ready to fish
and<00:03:29.790> that's<00:03:29.880> another<00:03:30.210> thing<00:03:30.330> ditch<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.530> line

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
and that's another thing ditch the line

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.970 
and that's another thing ditch the line
that<00:03:31.890> they<00:03:31.980> come<00:03:32.280> with<00:03:32.630> spool<00:03:33.630> your<00:03:33.870> own<00:03:33.990> for

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.550 
that they come with spool your own for
pond<00:03:35.160> test<00:03:35.400> because<00:03:36.360> uh<00:03:36.390> right<00:03:37.110> off<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.380> bat

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
pond test because uh right off the bat

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.000 
pond test because uh right off the bat
because<00:03:37.860> it's<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.340> basically<00:03:38.760> fished<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:40.010> ready

to fish or pond ready or whatever right

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.510 
to fish or pond ready or whatever right
off<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.080> bed<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> seven<00:03:46.620> uh<00:03:46.880> some<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.780> dreaded

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.050 
off the bed a seven uh some the dreaded
loops<00:03:50.520> and<00:03:51.260> backlash<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.730> once<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.820> spool

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
loops and backlash so once you spool

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.790 
loops and backlash so once you spool
your<00:03:54.210> own<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.510> should<00:03:54.540> have<00:03:54.960> a<00:03:54.990> you<00:03:55.620> should
