00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
s-corp anak tail you tax it to the blade

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.430 
s-corp anak tail you tax it to the blade
weapon<00:02:59.660> here<00:03:01.599> fortunately<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.840> guns<00:03:03.080> don't

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
weapon here fortunately the guns don't

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.309 
weapon here fortunately the guns don't
move<00:03:04.480> back<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.660> forth<00:03:05.900> like<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.200> do<00:03:06.290> on

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
move back and forth like to do on

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.860 
move back and forth like to do on
scorpion<00:03:06.830> on<00:03:06.920> but<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.670> put<00:03:08.390> them<00:03:08.510> back<00:03:08.660> if

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
scorpion on but you can put them back if

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.759 
scorpion on but you can put them back if
you<00:03:08.989> want<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.380> don't<00:03:09.530> like<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.769> there's

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
you want but I don't like to so there's

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.650 
you want but I don't like to so there's
that<00:03:13.160> very<00:03:13.790> cool<00:03:15.910> now<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.030> turret<00:03:17.269> cannons

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
that very cool now the turret cannons

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.729 
that very cool now the turret cannons
were<00:03:17.780> also<00:03:18.049> modified<00:03:19.780> some<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:21.109> think<00:03:21.680> they

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
were also modified some I think they

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.180 
were also modified some I think they
should<00:03:21.859> have<00:03:21.890> been<00:03:22.070> like<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.370> before<00:03:24.190> very

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
should have been like that before very

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.059 
should have been like that before very
cool<00:03:28.959> he<00:03:29.959> put<00:03:30.109> a<00:03:30.140> lot<00:03:30.319> of<00:03:30.350> detail<00:03:30.829> in<00:03:30.980> this

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
cool he put a lot of detail in this

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.580 
cool he put a lot of detail in this
figure<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.609> just<00:03:32.109> that's<00:03:33.109> what<00:03:33.260> makes<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.530> so

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
figure and just that's what makes it so

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.130 
figure and just that's what makes it so
much<00:03:33.739> more<00:03:33.799> better<00:03:34.130> he<00:03:34.489> really<00:03:35.000> took<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:36.019> time

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
much more better he really took the time

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.479 
much more better he really took the time
just<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.510> know<00:03:38.510> an<00:03:38.720> amazing<00:03:39.170> figure<00:03:39.350> here

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:55.160 

let's<00:03:43.489> get<00:03:43.700> some<00:03:43.880> close-ups

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.600 

so<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:58.500> still<00:03:59.500> has<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.830> onslaught<00:04:00.159> sounds

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
so this still has the onslaught sounds

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.520 
so this still has the onslaught sounds
I'll<00:04:01.569> probably<00:04:01.720> take<00:04:01.930> out<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.230> batteries

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
I'll probably take out the batteries

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.289 
I'll probably take out the batteries
later<00:04:02.739> because<00:04:03.159> I<00:04:03.190> really<00:04:03.879> don't<00:04:04.030> like<00:04:04.120> the

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
later because I really don't like the

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.610 
later because I really don't like the
sounds<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:09.069> guess<00:04:09.610> it's<00:04:09.790> pretty<00:04:09.910> much<00:04:10.060> it

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
sounds so I guess it's pretty much it

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.830 
sounds so I guess it's pretty much it
everything<00:04:11.620> still<00:04:11.890> works<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:13.420> same<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:15.010> know

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
everything still works the same you know

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.390 
everything still works the same you know
as<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.139> ax<00:04:17.169> mind<00:04:17.500> grabber<00:04:17.829> things<00:04:18.190> wherever

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
as the ax mind grabber things wherever

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.760 
as the ax mind grabber things wherever
they<00:04:18.609> are<00:04:19.949> but<00:04:21.810> now<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.840> shall<00:04:23.139> show<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.410> his

detail<00:04:28.600> on<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.080> like<00:04:29.289> with<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.100> head<00:04:30.250> and

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
detail on to it like with the head and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.150

the fallen in robot mode take a look at

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.550 
the fallen in robot mode take a look at
the<00:04:36.100> biggest<00:04:36.550> difference<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.229> robot

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
the biggest difference of this robot

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.189 
the biggest difference of this robot
mode<00:04:38.740> his<00:04:39.310> head<00:04:40.949> be<00:04:41.949> very<00:04:42.310> cool<00:04:42.669> very

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.350 

menacing-looking<00:04:48.120> unfortunately<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.210> did

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
the mohawk here was a bit too high I

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.279 
the mohawk here was a bit too high I
could<00:04:54.160> get<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.400> chest<00:04:54.669> over<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:55.570> I<00:04:55.630> to<00:04:55.690> clip

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
could get the chest over it so I to clip

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.290 
could get the chest over it so I to clip
it<00:04:56.410> off<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.530> bit<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:58.090> no<00:04:58.300> big<00:04:58.450> deal<00:05:00.150> still<00:05:01.150> looks

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
it off a bit but no big deal still looks

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.330 
it off a bit but no big deal still looks
pretty<00:05:01.330> good<00:05:01.630> at<00:05:01.750> first<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.380> didn't<00:05:03.160> like<00:05:03.190> the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
pretty good at first I didn't like the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.710 
pretty good at first I didn't like the
head<00:05:03.639> because<00:05:03.880> it<00:05:04.150> wasn't<00:05:04.419> what<00:05:04.539> i<00:05:04.570> was

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
head because it wasn't what i was

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.589 
head because it wasn't what i was
getting<00:05:04.930> but<00:05:05.410> then<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.680> grew<00:05:05.860> on<00:05:05.889> me<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:07.150> I'm

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
getting but then it grew on me and I'm

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.339 
getting but then it grew on me and I'm
okay<00:05:08.020> with<00:05:08.169> it<00:05:08.289> now<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.770> looks<00:05:08.889> pretty<00:05:09.070> good

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
okay with it now it looks pretty good

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.800 
okay with it now it looks pretty good
take<00:05:11.349> a<00:05:11.410> look<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:11.729> another<00:05:12.729> detail<00:05:13.599> right

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
take a look to the another detail right

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.629 
take a look to the another detail right
here<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.490> Fallen<00:05:15.510> symbol<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:17.430> think<00:05:18.430> that<00:05:18.550> was

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
here the Fallen symbol I think that was

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.350 
here the Fallen symbol I think that was
on<00:05:18.789> the<00:05:18.940> titanium<00:05:20.490> fallen<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.789> stand<00:05:22.120> I

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
on the titanium fallen like the stand I

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.300 
on the titanium fallen like the stand I
submit<00:05:22.750> I<00:05:22.780> think<00:05:23.200> that's<00:05:23.349> what<00:05:23.470> it<00:05:23.560> was<00:05:23.590> I'd

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
submit I think that's what it was I'd

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.620 
submit I think that's what it was I'd
love<00:05:24.610> to<00:05:24.729> know<00:05:24.760> how<00:05:25.000> he<00:05:25.060> got<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:25.360> on<00:05:25.510> there

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
love to know how he got that on there

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.170 
love to know how he got that on there
that's<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.930> nice<00:05:26.139> touch<00:05:26.380> that's<00:05:27.039> very<00:05:27.280> cool<00:05:30.180> had

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
him he has the same articulation taught

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.190 
him he has the same articulation taught
as<00:05:33.310> onslaught<00:05:33.760> obviously<00:05:34.389> so<00:05:34.750> let's<00:05:34.930> just<00:05:35.110> do

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
a 360 here very cool and this gun steel

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
a 360 here very cool and this gun steel
pops<00:05:41.500> forward<00:05:42.960> but<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.200> think<00:05:44.889> he<00:05:44.950> took<00:05:45.099> the

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
pops forward but I think he took the

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.189 
pops forward but I think he took the
spring<00:05:45.520> out<00:05:45.690> so<00:05:46.979> which<00:05:47.979> no<00:05:48.880> no<00:05:49.060> I<00:05:49.300> guess<00:05:50.020> it's

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
spring out so which no no I guess it's

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.879 
spring out so which no no I guess it's
okay<00:05:50.470> because<00:05:50.650> on<00:05:51.039> mine<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:52.560> gun<00:05:53.560> kind<00:05:53.800> of

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
okay because on mine the gun kind of

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.730 
okay because on mine the gun kind of
like<00:05:54.130> just<00:05:54.160> dangles<00:05:55.150> there<00:05:55.330> so<00:05:55.690> I<00:05:55.990> guess<00:05:56.590> that

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
like just dangles there so I guess that

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.310 
like just dangles there so I guess that
makes<00:05:56.889> it<00:05:57.010> look<00:05:57.130> better<00:05:59.280> but<00:06:00.280> yes

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
makes it look better but yes

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.540 
makes it look better but yes
now<00:06:03.320> is<00:06:03.500> melee<00:06:03.950> weapon<00:06:04.900> see<00:06:05.900> how<00:06:05.960> big<00:06:06.140> it<00:06:06.260> is

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
now is melee weapon see how big it is

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.610 
now is melee weapon see how big it is
it's<00:06:07.550> good<00:06:08.210> when<00:06:08.600> you<00:06:08.720> stand<00:06:09.020> up<00:06:09.170> it<00:06:09.320> goes<00:06:09.440> up

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
it's good when you stand up it goes up

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.190 
it's good when you stand up it goes up
to<00:06:09.710> his<00:06:09.830> chest<00:06:10.040> its<00:06:10.250> pretty<00:06:10.430> long<00:06:11.020> you<00:06:12.020> just

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
to his chest its pretty long you just

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.000 
to his chest its pretty long you just
flip<00:06:12.350> down<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.610> peg<00:06:13.610> there<00:06:15.820> and<00:06:16.820> you<00:06:17.890> get<00:06:18.890> it

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
flip down the peg there and you get it

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.270 
flip down the peg there and you get it
in<00:06:19.220> there<00:06:20.770> there<00:06:21.770> you<00:06:21.890> go<00:06:22.120> fits<00:06:23.120> pretty<00:06:23.330> nicely

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
in there there you go fits pretty nicely

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.670 
in there there you go fits pretty nicely
it<00:06:25.280> was<00:06:25.490> made<00:06:25.700> from<00:06:25.850> the<00:06:26.030> shield<00:06:26.300> I<00:06:26.620> think<00:06:27.620> you

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
it was made from the shield I think you

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.960 
it was made from the shield I think you
just<00:06:27.800> cut<00:06:27.950> a<00:06:28.010> piece<00:06:28.220> of<00:06:28.280> the<00:06:28.430> shield<00:06:28.670> out<00:06:28.820> and

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
just cut a piece of the shield out and

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.640 
just cut a piece of the shield out and
then<00:06:29.060> put<00:06:29.210> the<00:06:29.300> blade<00:06:29.510> on<00:06:29.660> that's<00:06:30.380> pretty<00:06:30.500> much

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
then put the blade on that's pretty much

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:37.240 
then put the blade on that's pretty much
what<00:06:30.830> he<00:06:30.890> did<00:06:32.560> but<00:06:34.300> that's<00:06:35.300> so<00:06:35.810> big<00:06:36.250> that's

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:46.590 
what he did but that's so big that's
pretty<00:06:37.550> scary<00:06:37.700> looking<00:06:42.790> very<00:06:43.790> cool<00:06:44.740> so<00:06:45.740> I
