time it gets frustrating but gotta deal

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.960 
time it gets frustrating but gotta deal
with<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.460> store<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:03.320> ratio<00:04:03.710> between<00:04:03.980> chillin

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
with it store the ratio between chillin

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.500 
with it store the ratio between chillin
and<00:04:05.150> skating<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:05.990> would<00:04:06.170> say<00:04:06.820> chillin<00:04:07.820> ends<00:04:08.390> up

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
and skating I would say chillin ends up

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.120 
and skating I would say chillin ends up
about<00:04:08.780> seventy<00:04:09.440> percent<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:09.950> then<00:04:10.040> the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
about seventy percent and then the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.810 
about seventy percent and then the
skating<00:04:10.430> instead<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.730> about<00:04:10.880> thirty<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.450> could

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
skating instead of about thirty I could

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.670 
skating instead of about thirty I could
sixty<00:04:13.820> percent<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.390> time<00:04:14.600> chillin<00:04:15.440> I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
sixty percent of the time chillin I

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.890 
sixty percent of the time chillin I
don't<00:04:16.040> know<00:04:16.130> seventy<00:04:16.640> thirty<00:04:16.820> thirty<00:04:17.510> percent

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
don't know seventy thirty thirty percent

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.490 
don't know seventy thirty thirty percent
skating<00:04:18.350> seventy<00:04:18.770> percent<00:04:19.060> hassle<00:04:20.060> I'd<00:04:20.870> like

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
skating seventy percent hassle I'd like

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.550 
skating seventy percent hassle I'd like
to<00:04:21.650> say<00:04:21.799> 5050<00:04:22.310> but<00:04:22.700> it's<00:04:22.910> probably<00:04:23.660> like<00:04:23.900> 6040

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560
