00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.460
 the genre of survival games is 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.450
 meanwhile as extensive as 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.490
 confusing 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.410
 we are allowed to play in numerous games 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.509
 voluntarily zombie apocalypse now set 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.700
 us from marauding players were 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.920
 be abused or plane crashes 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
 survive with so much choices 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.090
 Fehlgriffe almost preprogrammed 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.710
 to handle the desperate fight 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.779
 survive have as much fun 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.240
 tell you our author tobias knight 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.279
 his personal top 5 of the best 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.280
 survival games number 5 at gymnastics or 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.780
 but rather to without the big genre 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.520
 names that of a Canadian 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 teens developed the game truly 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.780
 not sure it is free has 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.969
 plenty of content and this 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.280
 distinctive minecraft graphic style 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.140
 most fun makes the blocky 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.899
 zombie hasz cooperated with some 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.000
 there are also players and pvp 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 Thanks to the versace system, this is also possible 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.010
 fair to the point and should 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.960
 So you can try out ixia 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 free we have already said that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.189
 Both years are marked by zombie 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.780
 apocalypse and airplane crashes there 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.299
 comes to us a fresh of the middle ages 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.680
 Scenario just live is wings 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.780
 but not only in the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 also the complexity of the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 Simulation convinces thanks to the complex 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.710
 We make our own little ones 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.119
 huts or a complete before 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.220
 and who play with others 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.659
 for even it concludes one 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.369
 medieval settlement velvet 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.100
 Stadtmauer only a matter of time 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.110
 and willing to patience and to work for 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.909
 such building measures are missing but can 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 also just good old survival 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.299
 to fall back on tradition and others 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.689
 play the sword over his head 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.790
 pull 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.780
 until all the features are in play 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.000
 but a little bit more 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 that is limited to 64 players alive 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.890
 jude law is already in the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.970
 early access the final version should 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.970
 but only later 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.799
 Daisy has been in the past for 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.280
 so many controversial discussions 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.320
 provided 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.119
 be it through sadistic players the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.500
 like to put foul fruit on your with 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.750
 forcibly feeding to survivors or 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.159
 through cannibalism and explicit 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.350
 suicide animations 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.030
 but that does not change that 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.220
 daisy on the way to one 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.590
 excellent zombie survival simulator 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.700
 is the third place but is also one 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.380
 trust an advance 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.060
 After the development of the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.620
 standalone version for quite some time 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.260
 only ahead in tripple steps 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.760
 should finally move again in 2015 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.160
 bigger jumps follow 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.570
 competitors like h1 z1 are lurking 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.160
 has long been in second place and 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.019
 Although much gentler than ours 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.550
 Breakpiper alter ego in the game 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.900
 that brings about with his 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.750
 Machine in the inhospitable environment 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.580
 northern canada crashes cold hunger 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.860
 and wolves are his from then on 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.510
 antagonist sophisticated gameplay 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.790
 Although we are looking for elements and players 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.280
 in vain does the atmosphere fit 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.080
 just perfect the impressionistic 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.230
 Graphics and the professional speakers 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.130
 contribute significantly to this 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.989
 we are curious how it is with the 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.880
 development continues, especially in the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.260
 upcoming episodes story mode is likely 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:13.010
 the game its strengths 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.360
 and play ok project song board 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.269
 is somehow the ugly duckling 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.370
 among the survival but to play as much 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.590
 Realism and complexity also have it 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.569
 no other genre representative to offer 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.569
 and therefore has project wombat 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.120
 Place 1 honestly earned since november 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.980
 2013 is the isometric survival title 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.569
 now in the early access phase and 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.549
 Do it once a month 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.769
 version jump who due to the 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.180
 admittedly getting used to 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.370
 Graphics is not sure if he is 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.109
 would like to strike the free demo 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.099
 version certainly helps with that 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.840
 decision making 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.120
 maybe just enough 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.250
 Note on a local koop mode for 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.870
 up to four players of the common 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.190
 walking dead experience stands with it 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.190
 nothing in the way
