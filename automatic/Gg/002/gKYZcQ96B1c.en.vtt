00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 warm and welcome to one 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.450
 new minecraft video and it works 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.510
 This time around something I now you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.190
 want to ask and indeed everyone know 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.599
 these names everyone will be him 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.230
 probably hate or maybe 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.650
 knows it works as everybody knows about 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 over here and slowly it goes with it 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 animal on the bag 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 exists now has or exists 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.160
 not everyone here any more now or so 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.609
 Yesterday, the 1.5 is finally out 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.700
 come 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:38.100
 We are all happy but slowly puking 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.440
 me of these sentences in each new one 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.320
 version of 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:50.300
 are you 1.4 1.51 point 4.4 is it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.300
 not as prophet point 23 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:11.210
 1.3.1 minutes at 1,243 1.0 remote animals 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:23.479
 31.8 remove 21.7 remove 21.6 point 6 and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.490
 there was or has started 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.320
 starting from this version still has 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.810
 harder to many negative comments 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.050
 because love 's purity 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.600
 that's right in this 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.700
 version first off 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.410
 Now the legend says that at one time 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.670
 hero reintegrates itself and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.979
 that's why every new version is available 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.890
 remove a remote europe 1 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.159
 But I ask, although there is the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.270
 is real and does not mean it is called too 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.530
 So I could do that somewhere 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.640
 I do not remember exactly where he is from 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.780
 1.1 so the full version was start 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.979
 here again inserted by personally 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.750
 I do not know which one could do that 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.920
 Comments write if he's around now 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.690
 does that exist there and there it is without 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.459
 stroke as rest asterisks and here is 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.849
 Only one - so that say it all 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.849
 somehow 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.610
 I still want to find that sick 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.200
 somehow somewhere you stand when I 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.790
 Now that knows nothing is understood here 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.750
 well that's it with the video I hope 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.260
 very much you can help me and then up 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.260

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.459
