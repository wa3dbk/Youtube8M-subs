this<00:00:08.880> before<00:00:09.389> mainly<00:00:09.780> due<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> fact<00:00:10.410> that

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
this before mainly due to the fact that

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.299 
this before mainly due to the fact that
she<00:00:11.040> did<00:00:11.940> not<00:00:11.969> give<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.660> any<00:00:12.870> loot<00:00:13.679> before<00:00:13.920> but

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
done as fast as possible because

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.430 
done as fast as possible because
otherwise<00:00:38.160> area<00:00:38.910> would<00:00:39.149> start<00:00:39.450> her<00:00:39.660> Liturgy

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
otherwise area would start her Liturgy

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.549 
otherwise area would start her Liturgy
of<00:00:40.469> ruin<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:42.390> will<00:00:42.510> wipe<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> team<00:00:43.350> in

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
of ruin and it will wipe out the team in

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.160 
of ruin and it will wipe out the team in
30<00:00:43.950> seconds<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.760> that's<00:00:45.719> kind<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
30 seconds so that's kind of like a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.720 
30 seconds so that's kind of like a
timer<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> run<00:00:47.280> through<00:00:47.399> her

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
timer that you have to run through her

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.869 
timer that you have to run through her
and<00:00:48.020> she<00:00:49.020> starts<00:00:49.320> her<00:00:49.379> liturgy<00:00:49.879> approximately

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
and she starts her liturgy approximately

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.330 
and she starts her liturgy approximately
three<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> half<00:00:51.719> minutes<00:00:52.500> after<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
three and a half minutes after you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
three and a half minutes after you
actually<00:00:53.850> enter<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.829> too

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and just shoot it once and it will die

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.050 
and just shoot it once and it will die
once<00:01:12.510> both<00:01:12.840> Shriekers<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.369> gates

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
enter the center where uh her you would

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.940 
enter the center where uh her you would
be<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:20.220> rusting<00:01:20.990> now<00:01:21.990> she'll<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.500> circling

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
be just rusting now she'll be circling

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.640 
be just rusting now she'll be circling
around<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.490> stone<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> had<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.439> get<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
around this stone that you had to get to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.230 
around this stone that you had to get to
in<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> activate<00:01:26.430> credit<00:01:26.970> she'll<00:01:27.180> be

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
in a way to activate credit she'll be

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910 
in a way to activate credit she'll be
circling<00:01:27.689> around<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.200> she'll<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.560> really

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
circling around it so she'll be really

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
circling around it so she'll be really
annoying<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> hit<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.900> can

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
likes to do is we just wait there's no

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.640 
likes to do is we just wait there's no
point<00:03:00.970> us<00:03:01.209> for<00:03:01.510> actually<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.230> have<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.410> waste

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
point us for actually I have to waste

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.039 
point us for actually I have to waste
ammo<00:03:03.099> on<00:03:03.280> all<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.640> other<00:03:03.730> enemies<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.720> we<00:03:04.870> just

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
ammo on all the other enemies so we just

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.509 
ammo on all the other enemies so we just
go<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.379> kill<00:03:05.530> ourselves<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.099> we<00:03:06.160> can<00:03:06.310> start

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
go and kill ourselves and we can start

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.339 
go and kill ourselves and we can start
right<00:03:06.790> away<00:03:06.879> we<00:03:07.390> save<00:03:07.629> a<00:03:07.660> lot<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.900> time<00:03:08.019> during

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
right away we save a lot of time during

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.680 
right away we save a lot of time during
that<00:03:08.620> way<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.040> that's<00:03:09.849> our<00:03:10.060> strategy<00:03:10.480> for

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
that way and that's our strategy for

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.720 
that way and that's our strategy for
speedruns<00:03:11.079> also<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:11.739> that's<00:03:12.310> how<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.519> kill

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
speedruns also so that's how you kill

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.580 
speedruns also so that's how you kill
her<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.150> at<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.329> deaths<00:03:13.540> occur<00:03:13.870> uh<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.290> hope
