 well in this part the fifa section 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 I will leave in the description of the video 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.040

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.110
 this page this link now in this 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.350
 link you get a small 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.590
 application that is called ultimate and 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.300
 basically here we can from 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.610
 handle all our ultimate team all 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.400
 our ultimate team team either 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.480
 change the alignment add a 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.680
 undo or delete template from a 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.160
 make all sections auction 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.620
 preselection buying and selling 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.630
 players or our decks too 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.270
 how is the change of equipment 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.350
 personal etcetera etcetera etcetera 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.110
 we can basically do all the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.720
 ultimate team functions of our 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.630
 console except play clear that you have 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.580
 what to do in your videogame console 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.980
 now 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.320
 this application seems to me a good one 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.240
 contribution of law because if you do not 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.210
 keeps stuck all the time in the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.840
 console so you can manage your 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.650
 ultimate and out of it with entering 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.370
 to this page well now what gifts 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.710
 newspapers can receive which ones are good 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.590
 today I just received the 500 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.040
 coins practically if you have a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.320
 super gold team the truth 500 coins 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.330
 it's a trifle but 500 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.020
 ammunition the truth is not bad at all 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.690
 that you have them in favor but this gift 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.000
 it can vary can be spent thousand two 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.700
 a thousand coins can you touch a 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.380
 contract package may it touches you 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.750
 a pack of gold staff can that 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.010
 you get special silver players 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.430
 so to speak 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.200
 then the daily gift really is 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.690
 varied will not always be the same to 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.550
 Sometimes chance may come 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.800
 I will give you the same daily gift but 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.410
 really that would be the performance that you 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.870
 you can get in 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.260
 then my daily gift of today 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.950
 they are fifth coins apart from you did not know 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:16.010
 that so basically is this and now 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.580
 they just saw that already my income 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.710
 have just come up now as he gets another 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.200
 gift to see what is needed 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.790
 to get this daily gift very 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.460
 easy really is very simple 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.160
 acquire it 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.610
 you must first play in a manner 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.210
 line so that you can drop in this 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.590
 this daily gift if you are from xbox 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:45.230
 live is not necessary to have a membership 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.600
 because you can play offline 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.850
 but in ultimate team unlike 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.560
 playstation network that you must have 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.420
 necessarily a membership for 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.730
 to be able to play the ultimate team is 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.880
 unfortunate part of precision without 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.500
 However in xbox it is quite enough 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.780
 good this contribution 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.620
 now 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.480
 We must first visit this 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.830
 portal on a daily basis that's why it's 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.290
 daily gift because we must 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.920
 visit it on a daily basis our 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.290
 ok portal sometimes you will leave already 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.660
 sometimes not when it comes out is because you're 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.280
 fulfilling the requirements when it does not come out 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.330
 the gift Friday because you are not 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.160
 fulfilling 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.290
 means what requirements are that 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.020
 I have to meet the requirements that you 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.950
 you have to put together the following is good 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.200
 way 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.220
 first you must comply so 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.460
 minimum 25 consecutive matches 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.710
 without leaving the game ok then you 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.890
 You must not leave your game to 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.990
 nothing at least 25 games so 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.760
 consecutive 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.220
 ok minimum either by abandonment or by 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.670
 disconnection of xbox live and playstation 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.830
 network because I do not know what 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.130
 that is, if you abandon the game of 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.460
 any type is already lost continuous if 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.450
 you have to start again ok a 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:15.620
 Once you have at least 25 games 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:18.710
 consecutive and the ultimate team without 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.420
 abandoning the game is true if the 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.970
 opponent is the one who abandons for you 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.710
 there are no problems of a master band 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.980
 so if after 25 games already 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.440
 you do this and your multiplier of 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.650
 departure abandonment is at the maximum that 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.040
 it's 1.25 then it's when you're going to start 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.950
 to receive the daily prizes ok 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.990
 so this basically would be all the 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.540
 it is quite simple enough 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.550
 simple and good I hope this video 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.070

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.870
