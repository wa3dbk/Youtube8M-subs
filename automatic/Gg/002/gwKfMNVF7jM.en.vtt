 So now let's look at the new changes in the ios 8 beta 4 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.680
 Was first ui is changed to a control center or in a previous beta version 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:34.520
 ios 7 and the line without the need for each layer without dividing the respective layers into three or four different 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.420
 The layer length, which is well pasted for nine minutes, has a different effect 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.430
 I gave 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.970
 Personally, I was very fond of ui's because it was always fresh. 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.870
 Secondly, the bug report alarm and app that disappeared from the state are gone. 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.920
 Previously iOS 8 spit up to 3, which I could not delete randomly from the status bar 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.730
 Because of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:57.020
 If you have a bug report alarm, you might like it. 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.500
 We got a tip application with third ios Tips app is updated files new 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.260
 It is an application that teaches users the functions that were born. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.880
 Quick reply function inside application 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.630
 Emel Immediately new and easy to work with a new room Voice video delivery e-mail order 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.160
 It also explains the functions of the photo timer and the bug report application 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.060
 But I did not know the number of deleted posts and moving functions to the arms as ios 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.380
 Put it to the description of the picture group in many ways helped a lot, because I would Appliance 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 The same 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.619
 Fourthly, the letters that had previously used brightness and ease in background and brightness 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.820
 The best set of categories that are integrated scaling display light brightness 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.600
 It is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.310
 There was no difference in functionality, but among the easy-to-use categories, 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.240
 The big change that was not a setting is now more accessible. 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:51.920
 But yiraseo still in beta, but, uh grunge font larger power settings 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.920
 The display is also present in the brightness of the light, and it can be used easily. 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 The fifth time you multitask, you can see your recent or favorite contacts at the top. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.450
 I have the ability to hide 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.510
 When you go into your contact's calendar daily in Settings, you 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.110
 Section, which can be set there 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.370
 I personally recent at the top when multitasking with a contact person contact 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.510
 I felt that it was inconvenient to launch, but this update 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.980
 I think it gives you permission to leave it behind 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.110
 Six was first turned a little figure representing emoticons on your keyboard to more 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.030
 I changed the character that laughs loudly. 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.850
 It is not the fact of giving a significant change to the detailed aspects of Apple's ios 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.720
 You can see that you are looking at places 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.860
 It is the seventh of recommended apps in the category were only conventional handoff feature 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.459
 Added 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.050
 If you want to hear about handoffs , 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.130
 Please check 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.950
 Gritty haebomyeon easily explained recommend that your iPhone go to a specific location or place, 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.510
 I think you need a user in that position . 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.530
 Useful apps to give useful apps 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.610
 Function 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:03.140
 It's because it's still in beta, or because of the regional nature of Korea. 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:07.130
 I do not work at all when I use it on my own 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.880
 Please feel free to leave a comment if you are working. 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.610
 The last thing I want to say at the conclusion is that the developer version 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.720
 iOS does not need to raise your arm 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:21.860
 New features added and trends in ui change, but battery performance 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.150
 The bounce in various parts increase is not good to run noticeably the 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.989
 There are many cases 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:31.330
 It may also be momentarily to come up experience trying to downgrade the function rooms 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.330
 It does not appear to be very suitable for use 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.900
 Today , I learned about the new features of the Idol Star 2 Beta 4 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.400
