00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.200
 The government's representative of the ninja school on the sound that it did right now 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.730
 It feels like it reflects that while taking out / birds 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.839
 This stamp Inonami 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.979
 I will fall asleep with Sawada of Gachigachi 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.289
 It feels like it repels that line while absorbing it with an ax 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.870
 I want a certain level of shakri 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.430
 It's 882 ma of 872 yen that I made it in the public of the inside but this 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.510
 In the past, a little cold food okara 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.880
 Arithmetic with strokes 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.840
 That ml of about 878 km says that 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.080
 It is very easy to say how to shave with delight 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.930
 If it is too hard to make 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.229
 The news of that meeting 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.430
 I think it is difficult to see through 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.859
 It's about this kind of person who uses it by hand 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 I think it's more effective 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 try it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 Bad holding 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.750
 Though it is not a burst of gachigachi 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.719
 Mya 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.020
 The first girl is cured 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.399
 But well 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.729
 We feel this work is not different 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.320
 The heading point is pretty rough sea 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.010
 After all it is easy to take some tasks 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.900
 That little Atari 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.910
 In the nano carrier war 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.969
 Even the 27 files do not know the following 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.460
 I used such a punch I do not know well 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.499
 Especially for 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:04.430
 that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.770
 I think it seems to be the best 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.619
 I was the first to go bankrupt 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.989
 I'm angry and I'm going to hit it like this 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.140
 It turned around 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.010
 After all there are many
