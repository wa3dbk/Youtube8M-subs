that show you exactly where to go we
need<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> go<00:00:21.510> up<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.660> way<00:00:21.810> because<00:00:21.840> there's

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
need to go up this way because there's

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.630 
need to go up this way because there's
jump<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> top<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.130> need<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> boost

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
jump up the top that you need to boost

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.080 
jump up the top that you need to boost
off<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> roadway<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.070> then<00:00:26.939> you'll

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
off on to the roadway and then you'll

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.400 
off on to the roadway and then you'll
turn<00:00:27.240> your<00:00:27.359> boost<00:00:27.539> I've<00:00:27.750> correct<00:00:28.080> your<00:00:28.230> car

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
turn your boost I've correct your car

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.230 
turn your boost I've correct your car
and<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.130> again<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> go<00:00:29.670> straight<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and use it again to go straight in a

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.389 
and use it again to go straight in a
line<00:00:30.269> down<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.109> particular<00:00:31.199> roadway<00:00:31.830> drop

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
line down that particular roadway drop

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.490 
line down that particular roadway drop
off<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.969> then<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> next<00:00:33.809> jump<00:00:34.320> which

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
off and then go to the next jump which

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.780 
off and then go to the next jump which
is<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.250> need<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.760> careful

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
is here you need to be really careful

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.280 
is here you need to be really careful
when<00:00:36.210> you're<00:00:36.329> boosting<00:00:36.600> around<00:00:37.140> that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
when you're boosting around that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.040 
when you're boosting around that
particular<00:00:37.380> area<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.129> there's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> lot<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
particular area because there's a lot of

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.700 
particular area because there's a lot of
objects<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> wave<00:00:40.680> of

objects that are in the wave of
obstacles<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> once<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.149> hit<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.540> over

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
obstacles that once you hit it it's over

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
obstacles that once you hit it it's over
at<00:00:43.320> Red<00:00:43.469> Rover<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.399> I'm<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> quickly

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
at Red Rover so I'm going to quickly

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.569 
at Red Rover so I'm going to quickly
show<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.270> race<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:46.010> went<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> boost<00:00:47.340> on

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
show you the race now went to boost on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
show you the race now went to boost on
went<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> boost<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:48.930> you're

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
went to boost off this is when you're

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.650 
went to boost off this is when you're
playing<00:00:49.260> alone<00:00:49.789> if<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:50.969> playing<00:00:51.149> with

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
playing alone if you're playing with

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
playing alone if you're playing with
more<00:00:51.960> people<00:00:52.320> they<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.739> stand<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
more people they can stand on the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.660 
more people they can stand on the
checkpoint<00:00:53.730> areas<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.360> frog<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
checkpoint areas and frog them and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.389 
checkpoint areas and frog them and
that's<00:00:56.670> sneaky<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> way

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that's sneaky way to do it this is a way

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
that's sneaky way to do it this is a way
to<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.879> particular<00:01:00.210> start<00:01:00.660> anyway<00:01:00.930> we

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
to do this particular start anyway we

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.510 
to do this particular start anyway we
don't<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.500> wait<00:01:01.590> till<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.859> says<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.309> we

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
don't have to wait till it says go we

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
don't have to wait till it says go we
can<00:01:02.670> after<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.180> says<00:01:03.390> set<00:01:03.690> bag<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.379> go

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
can after it says set bag you can go

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
can after it says set bag you can go
straight<00:01:04.769> away<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.220> buys<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.610> quite<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> little

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
straight away it buys you quite a little

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510 
straight away it buys you quite a little
bit<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> time<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.010> don't<00:01:08.159> need<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> boost

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
bit of time so we don't need to boost

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.770 
bit of time so we don't need to boost
your<00:01:08.729> until<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.150> around<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.450> corner

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
your until we get around this corner

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270 
your until we get around this corner
because<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.470> boost<00:01:10.770> when<00:01:10.950> I'm<00:01:11.070> going

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
because I like to boost when I'm going

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.440 
because I like to boost when I'm going
in<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> straight<00:01:11.490> line<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:12.210> otherwise

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
in a straight line because otherwise

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.070 
in a straight line because otherwise
you're<00:01:12.720> correcting<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> car<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
you're correcting the car and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.860 
you're correcting the car and
it's<00:01:14.350> just<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.920> waste<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.490> me<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.180> up<00:01:16.330> here<00:01:16.360> we<00:01:16.630> go

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
it's just a waste to me so up here we go

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.450 
it's just a waste to me so up here we go
by<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:17.200> time<00:01:17.380> we're<00:01:18.100> going<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.280> start

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
by this time we're going to start

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.220 
by this time we're going to start
regenerating<00:01:18.790> as<00:01:19.210> we<00:01:19.330> head<00:01:19.750> up<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:19.990> top<00:01:20.170> of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
regenerating as we head up to the top of

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.680 
regenerating as we head up to the top of
the<00:01:20.440> hill<00:01:20.620> right<00:01:21.520> now<00:01:21.580> exactly<00:01:22.300> when<00:01:22.540> you<00:01:22.660> need

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
the hill right now exactly when you need

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.240 
the hill right now exactly when you need

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
out and it's over again so again boost

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.880 
out and it's over again so again boost
in<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.330> straight<00:02:04.630> line<00:02:04.660> by<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.470> time<00:02:05.650> we<00:02:05.740> get<00:02:05.830> up

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
in a straight line by the time we get up

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.109 
in a straight line by the time we get up
the<00:02:06.040> top<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.400> hill<00:02:06.550> for<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:06.820> little<00:02:06.970> bit

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
the top of the hill for a little bit

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.120 
the top of the hill for a little bit
before<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.570> time<00:02:07.840> we're<00:02:08.770> going<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.920> start

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
before this time we're going to start

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.889 
before this time we're going to start
regenerating<00:02:09.429> our<00:02:09.910> energy<00:02:10.300> again<00:02:10.540> there<00:02:10.780> we

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
regenerating our energy again there we

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.310 
regenerating our energy again there we
go<00:02:11.110> arrows<00:02:12.010> everywhere<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.750> jump<00:02:13.990> again

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
go arrows everywhere and the jump again

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.230 
go arrows everywhere and the jump again
now<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.100> guys<00:02:15.310> do<00:02:15.580> come<00:02:15.790> over<00:02:16.090> there<00:02:16.209> with

now it guys do come over there with

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.270 
now it guys do come over there with
their<00:02:16.480> bike<00:02:16.690> things<00:02:17.050> that's<00:02:17.560> why<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:17.950> clean<00:02:18.160> up

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
their bike things that's why so clean up

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.759 
their bike things that's why so clean up
your<00:02:18.340> map<00:02:18.519> first<00:02:19.380> correct<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.560> they're

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
your map first correct it they're

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.199 
your map first correct it they're
straight<00:02:21.550> first<00:02:22.330> again<00:02:23.110> drop<00:02:23.620> off

round edge to the right up this again
got<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.260> energy<00:02:31.620> perfect<00:02:32.099> again<00:02:32.489> boost<00:02:32.940> go

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
got it energy perfect again boost go

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.500 
got it energy perfect again boost go
boost<00:02:34.590> off<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.160> soon<00:02:35.430> as<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.730> your<00:02:36.030> wheels<00:02:36.300> are

a time but boost perfect timing done I

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.589 
a time but boost perfect timing done I
had<00:02:50.160> no<00:02:50.310> boost<00:02:50.550> then<00:02:50.819> would<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.239> been<00:02:51.390> all

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
had no boost then would have been all

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.150 
had no boost then would have been all
over<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.110> done<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:52.709> hopefully<00:02:53.010> that'll
