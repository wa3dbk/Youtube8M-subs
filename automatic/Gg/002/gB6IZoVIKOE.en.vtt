00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.590
 hello how about very good afternoon days 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.850
 nights depending on the time it is 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.129
 when you are watching this podcast of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 digital news I am Luis Cardenas and 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.929
 Well , today I want to talk 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.280
 with you on the subject of pn against 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 internet has caught my attention 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.439
 powerfully the attention that is 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.810
 being trending topic worldwide and good 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.820
 it is a protest against the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 internet censorship could not be over 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 according to this it is evident that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.899
 any attempt at censorship 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.590
 governmental towards a free means towards 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.930
 a medium that is owned by the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.880
 citizens and that is used to disclose 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.560
 the ideas of citizens no matter 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.710
 that these are against the government 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.120
 that a medium like the internet that has thrown 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.010
 totalitarian regimes as in the case 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.230
 from egypt returning to spring 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.579
 Arab or calling protests so 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.520
 great like those made in Spain 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.760
 Well, it should not have 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.470
 restrictions or censures however I 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.390
 I think that in this subject it is very likely 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.610
 that we are seeing the face of fools 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.489
 it is very likely that we are 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.570
 seeing the face of plugs that we 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.510
 want to give atole with your finger 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.880
 be a smoke screen for themes 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.790
 very much more very much more dangerous 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 for citizens to see let's 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.330
 suppose that these laws that have detonated 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.369
 the protest of pm against the internet are from 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.560
 somehow or other eliminated from the 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.420
 telecommunications reform what's going 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.450
 to happen is that in social networks 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.930
 people will say we won is a great 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.450
 triumph we won well and then 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.610
 they will feel that they have triumphed 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.490
 about government power and about 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.250
 censorship and about many things of some 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.080
 way they will be right but I think that at 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.750
 final will be a pyrrhic victory a 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.789
 victory that is going to look like a 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.020
 defeat not because of the fact that 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.520
 withdraw these laws I believe that these 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.259
 laws were born to be withdrawn 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.300
 They were born to be a smokescreen 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.450
 nation to make an atole with your finger 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.789
 because when this victory gives way I think 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.979
 that no one is going to peel the other laws 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.019
 secondary in telecommunications 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.940
 that will benefit televisa the ones that 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.980
 are going to benefit tere azteca those who 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.239
 will benefit Carlos Slim- those who 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.960
 they will continue to benefit the 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.970
 monopolies 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.300
 I think that's where the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.450
 true detail there in that in that 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.240
 look there at those specific points 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.770
 of the secondary laws is where it 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.200
 hide the devil I think all this 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.440
 I insist you can end up being simple 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.170
 and simply a smokescreen for 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.380
 consider that citizens have 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.660
 had a great victory when in the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.460
 reality is not like I'm luis cárdenas
