your<00:02:21.050> iphone<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.580> isn't<00:02:22.910> like<00:02:23.090> red<00:02:23.390> snow

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
your iphone so this isn't like red snow

your iphone so this isn't like red snow
it's<00:02:23.990> quite<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.620> bit<00:02:24.860> different<00:02:24.890> for<00:02:25.550> Windows

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
it's quite a bit different for Windows

users<00:02:26.210> who<00:02:26.450> use<00:02:26.480> snowbreeze<00:02:26.990> when<00:02:27.890> compared

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
users who use snowbreeze when compared

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.670 
users who use snowbreeze when compared
to<00:02:28.580> something<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.570> red<00:02:29.870> snow<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.320> actually

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
to something like red snow this actually

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.280 
to something like red snow this actually
creates<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.340> custom<00:02:31.820> firmware<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.570> then<00:02:33.020> all

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
creates a custom firmware and then all

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.050 
creates a custom firmware and then all
you<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.680> restore<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.340> firmware<00:02:34.610> like<00:02:34.940> you

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
you do is restore that firmware like you

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.140 
you do is restore that firmware like you
would<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.480> normal<00:02:36.070> iphone<00:02:37.070> restore<00:02:37.580> except

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
would a normal iphone restore except

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.050 
would a normal iphone restore except
this<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.510> obviously<00:02:39.080> custom<00:02:39.950> hence<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.940> have

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
this is obviously custom hence you have

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.870 
this is obviously custom hence you have
to<00:02:41.210> put<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.990> Pondi<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.740> using<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.640> i

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
rep tool located in snowbreeze so this

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.710 
rep tool located in snowbreeze so this
is<00:02:48.320> going<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.530> take<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.740> little<00:02:48.890> while<00:02:49.130> as<00:02:49.310> well

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
is going to take a little while as well

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.380 
is going to take a little while as well
I'm<00:02:50.720> going<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.990> speed<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.260> up<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.240> can

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
I'm going to speed this up as you can

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.510 
I'm going to speed this up as you can
see<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:53.810> fed<00:02:54.200> up<00:02:54.230> significantly<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.370> had<00:02:55.460> a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
see is fed up significantly you had a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.900 
see is fed up significantly you had a
little<00:02:55.820> snow<00:02:56.170> icon<00:02:57.170> there<00:02:57.640> indicating<00:02:58.640> that

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
little snow icon there indicating that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.130 
little snow icon there indicating that
the<00:02:59.120> custom<00:02:59.540> firmware<00:02:59.990> is<00:03:00.260> restoring<00:03:02.140> all

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
the custom firmware is restoring all

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.260 
the custom firmware is restoring all
right<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:04.160> little<00:03:04.370> loading<00:03:04.820> bar<00:03:05.030> this

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
right so this little loading bar this

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.440 
right so this little loading bar this
takes<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.660> while<00:03:06.100> probably<00:03:07.100> took<00:03:07.430> me<00:03:07.610> about<00:03:07.940> 10

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
takes a while probably took me about 10

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.650 
takes a while probably took me about 10
or<00:03:08.600> 15<00:03:08.720> minutes<00:03:08.990> at<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:10.220> least<00:03:10.490> so<00:03:11.420> I've

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
or 15 minutes at the least so I've

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.470 
or 15 minutes at the least so I've
definitely<00:03:11.930> sped<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:12.620> up<00:03:12.890> for<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:13.160> guys<00:03:13.480> so

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
now and one more little loading bar to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.250 
now and one more little loading bar to
sit<00:03:50.360> through<00:03:52.240> ok<00:03:53.240> and<00:03:53.510> you<00:03:53.900> should<00:03:54.080> see

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
sit through ok and you should see

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.500 
sit through ok and you should see
restoring<00:03:54.890> iphone<00:03:55.100> firmware<00:03:55.550> on<00:03:55.970> your<00:03:56.060> iTunes

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.060 
restoring iphone firmware on your iTunes
and<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:56.840> should<00:03:57.020> see<00:03:57.170> maybe<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.560> min<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:57.830> pop

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
and you should see maybe a min you pop

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.840 
and you should see maybe a min you pop
up<00:03:58.280> like<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:58.670> it's<00:03:59.390> restored<00:03:59.900> that's<00:04:00.470> cool

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
up like this it's restored that's cool

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.050 
up like this it's restored that's cool
