00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 good to all we are productions 343 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.210
 spark recently I've seen pokemon 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.460
 the origins and the truth has been a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.560
 beautiful experience in what I consider 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 one of the best anime releases in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.689
 this year next to attack the titans and 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.240
 I would like to expose you all 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.310
 my opinion about this series of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.829
 only four episodes that are worth a lot 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.919
 more than a girl of more than 800 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.510
 chapters and 15 seasons this anime is 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.359
 has become one of my animes 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.940
 favorites and in this video I will talk about the 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.309
 bad and good points in that order 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 this anime then do not say more 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.609
 let's start the first bad point is the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.190
 such an exaggeratedly rapid development of 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.989
 this anime a lot of people complain that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.809
 many animes have a development so 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.789
 slow that gets boring well this 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.760
 anime has an exaggerated development 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.980
 fast in 2 minutes they can tell you what 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.960
 that you can calmly count on 5 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.550
 chapters and it would have been enough 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.009
 as to explore everything with more 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.190
 deep I do not say that you get more 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.630
 stuffed that Christmas turkey but 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.090
 or that they had explored more 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.400
 carefully every important moment of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.950
 red orgasm score when seeing sabrina 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.260
 in chapter 3 but it did not come out either 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.210
 it was little enjoyable it would also have been 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.130
 very interesting to see how red the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.680
 He managed to defeat the high 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.750
 command and how not how he managed to 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.780
 capture be the legendary birds 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.670
 all this could have been possible if 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.840
 the series would have lasted for 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.790
 between 12 to 26 episodes as much the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.340
 second bad point is that it has some 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.590
 that another incoherence in the script for 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.780
 example in chapter 2 of this series 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.240
 the one considered by many including me 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.460
 the most emotional chapter of that series the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.830
 soldier who killed mom steals with a 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.870
 electric baton to what I ask 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.820
 how is it possible that the 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.590
 electric baton loves stealing taking in 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.420
 account that marrÃ³ the one that is land type and 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.090
 the electricity supposedly does not 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.620
 affects if it had been with an ax or a 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.270
 knife would have been much more 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.460
 understandable the method of which the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.410
 murdered but fuck of all 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.790
 methods they would have had to murder 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.370
 tied down they had to choose 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.300
 ironically the least effective though 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.700
 looking at it from 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.620
 point of view considering that 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.660
 this series of works is more directed to 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.850
 a children's audience and I do not think it 's 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.410
 very appropriate in these cases kill tied 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.450
 with an ax or a knife 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.150
 I think that is more or less understood 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.100
 small inconsistency these have been more 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.230
 or less the small points against 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.740
 that I saw the series now let's go to the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.720
 points in favor the first point in favor 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.850
 is that they have enough moments 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.350
 emotive like chapter 2 that shows 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.420
 that the writers put a lot 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.220
 emphasis to the meeting mother and son that 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.470
 It made me spill some 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.510
 tear and I admit it I got emotional when 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.500
 that coupon went to cuddle in tears 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.270
 the spirit of his mother the second point 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.160
 in favor is the music 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.470
 this anime version of the soundtrack of 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.290
 red and blue pokemon I loved made 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.060
 up to hum those xtra soundtracks is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.710
 a pity that I could not find 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.510
 several soundtracks that I liked 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.220
 because if I had not left you some 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.410
 how many to be debited from the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.390
 good music that he has although I would have 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.880
 I really liked listening to the main topic 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.860
 of the street victoria of the cif company and 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.660
 from the pokemon mansion to see how it 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.810
 they heard but there are four 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.070
 I do not think so much in so little space x 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.350
 from point 3 is the animation I do not know 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.240
 you but I felt that with the passing of 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.340
 the chapters were improving the design 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.470
 of the characters but in what is 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.300
 referred to colored you feel that you 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.310
 He did a great job even though there was a 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.990
 Sometimes problems with coloring by 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.520
 example the bottom part of the 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.740
 jaw of the back that is colored 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.260
 white there were times that it was blue 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.590
 but good, not very important 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.360
 I say anyone can be wrong, and 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.950
 the movement of the characters the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.720
 truth very fluid and at the time of 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.670
 perform attacks as soon as you reach 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.410
 recycle a movement sequence 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.390
 as it happens in the anime of pokemon and 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.730
 digimon and what's best for me about the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.190
 animation is that the 3d is not abused as 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.230
 they do it in the anime fucking is great 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.180
 because they used the 3d when it was the 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.220
 most opportune moment and they put more 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.260
 emphasis when recreating attacks 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.120
 of the pokemon not like in the anime of 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.070
 pokemon that when making an attack 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.530
 he used a lot the 3d that he felt like 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.570
 a tremendous kick in the eggs here 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.550
 I'm glad to know they did not do that and they 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.270
 they did a lot in the animation of this 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.000
 series 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.330
 point 4 is in my opinion the 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.880
 red protagonist in my opinion I felt it 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.370
 as a better protagonist than the pgou of 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.590
 as mayonnaise I say so is a born loser 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.480
 that is all the time rubbing us in 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.150
 the face that wants to be master pokemon 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.430
 who wants to win x league but in the end my 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.410
 pokemon master nor pokemon league and nor 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.150
 even reached the final of the 5 leagues 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.130
 that he played to date and 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.240
 possibly in Carlos is not the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.950
 exception 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.470
 and without forgetting that it has one of the 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.120
 most childish attitudes that I saw in life 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.520
 watching anime or whatever 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.890
 gilipollez gets so excited he seems 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.930
 that will shoot rockets with iris right 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.300
 he says he's a kid xd 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.300
 while red shows a more attitude 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.040
 mature more affectionate more humble if you 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.780
 thrills on some occasions of the 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.900
 series but not to the point of sparking 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.150
 as in losing th and without counting that to 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.820
 difference of red ace and came to win 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.890
 the singing league without counting that it has a 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.750
 good development when in the beginning 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.120
 of the series we see him committing many 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.280
 hazing but good as always 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.639
 says nobody is born knowing up 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.680
 become the legend 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.110
 that all PokÃ©mon fans know 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.879
 and the more I got better the stronger 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.669
 he made his link with his charme under 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.710
 bar charikar charikar by the way 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.840
 talking about charice art at the time of 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.279
 scream yells as if they were in form 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.279
 of titan and if not today big 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.600
 do not tell me what standard 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.930
 and well this is what I have to say 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.590
 on point 4 now let's move on to the last 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.990
 point to please to try and as last 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.690
 point we have as its not fidelity to 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.880
 game is very very faithful to the game we have 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.010
 the beginning of the game where he tells you what 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.870
 to start the speech of the 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.700
 teacher though the battle against 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.290
 giovanni in the cif company las 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.750
 locations of the birds 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.090
 legendary and minute the high command the 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.250
 champion mom's spirit marro uac 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.380
 etcetera see it I go back to those 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.480
 beautiful days when I played pokemon 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.660
 red and did those things that we both 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.850
 I liked that game x 3 in short a 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.160
 series of works that even with their mistakes 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.170
 it's still a job worth being one 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.150
 of the best anime premieres of this 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.250
 year one of the best animes I saw 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.620
 this year next to attack the titans and 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.500
 Such of symphonia I liked more than efe 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.380
 I liked lcl more than saving online and I 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.180
 he liked much more than ever an anime 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.790
 that as I said at the beginning of the video 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.070
 It has four chapters but they are worth a lot 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.870
 more than 800 episodes of the anime that 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.550
 we all know that there is already 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.680
 moments of the series that are 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.200
 young people like one that I think you already know 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.240
 xd and I hope that the studies or lm 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.280
 production goes on and you can see that they continue 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.260
 making more series of pokemon faithful to 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.630
 the games and with more episodes for more 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.640
 enjoy if you take an anime adaptation 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.680
 of the gold and silver pokÃ©mon I swear by god 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.020
 that will give me a cardiac arrest of the 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.850
 loud emotion and with this now I have 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.610
 entered more desire if it is possible to play 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.470
 pokemon x and this has been everything I hope that 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:48.190
 I liked you very much 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:50.970
 we are productions 343 spark are taken care of 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.970
 a lot and goodbye
