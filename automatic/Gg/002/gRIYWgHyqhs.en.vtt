shoot at f8 I want my exposure to be at
f8<00:02:19.400> I'm<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> shoot<00:02:20.910> at<00:02:21.030> iso<00:02:21.480> 100<00:02:22.140> which

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
f8 I'm going to shoot at iso 100 which

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.620 
f8 I'm going to shoot at iso 100 which
is<00:02:22.440> indicated<00:02:22.770> by<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.250> outer<00:02:23.880> portion<00:02:24.330> of

this dial our goal is at eight and that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.390 
this dial our goal is at eight and that
means<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.320> flash<00:02:28.530> has<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.070> approximately

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
means the flash has to be approximately

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.900 
means the flash has to be approximately

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
number so turning the inside dial I've

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.979 
number so turning the inside dial I've
already<00:02:38.670> set<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:38.970> flash<00:02:39.269> distance

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
already set the flash distance

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.770 
already set the flash distance
approximately<00:02:40.230> five<00:02:41.190> feet<00:02:41.220> away<00:02:41.780> turning

approximately five feet away turning
this<00:02:42.900> inside<00:02:43.320> dow<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:44.040> need<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.340> figure<00:02:44.489> out

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
this inside dow we need to figure out

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.670 
this inside dow we need to figure out
what<00:02:44.850> power<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:45.510> need<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> be<00:02:45.989> going<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.470> get

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
what power we need to be going to get

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.330 
what power we need to be going to get
that<00:02:46.950> f8<00:02:47.600> well<00:02:48.600> if<00:02:49.110> we're<00:02:49.500> at<00:02:49.590> one<00:02:49.830> sixteenth

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
that f8 well if we're at one sixteenth

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.110 
that f8 well if we're at one sixteenth
of<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.610> POW<00:02:51.290> one-sixteenth<00:02:52.290> power<00:02:52.760> f<00:02:53.760> fades

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
of a POW one-sixteenth power f fades

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.610 
of a POW one-sixteenth power f fades
over<00:02:54.450> here<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.870> means<00:02:55.049> we've<00:02:55.200> got<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.590> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
over here that means we've got to have a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.890 
over here that means we've got to have a
really<00:02:56.250> close<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.760> subject<00:02:57.090> well<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.480> can't

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
really close to the subject well I can't

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.240 
really close to the subject well I can't
really<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.440> close<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:58.950> we're<00:02:59.070> going<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
really get that close so we're going to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.430 
really get that close so we're going to
bring<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.640> up<00:02:59.700> just<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.269> little<00:03:00.420> bit<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.290> go

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
bring that up just a little bit if we go

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.530 
bring that up just a little bit if we go
to<00:03:01.530> one<00:03:01.769> fourth<00:03:02.130> power<00:03:02.459> well<00:03:03.030> that's<00:03:03.239> closer

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
to one fourth power well that's closer

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.590 
to one fourth power well that's closer
that<00:03:04.380> puts<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.769> f8<00:03:05.269> approximately<00:03:06.269> five<00:03:06.570> to

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
that puts the f8 approximately five to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.259 
that puts the f8 approximately five to
seven<00:03:07.080> feet<00:03:07.110> well<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.370> use<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> shoot<00:03:09.060> through

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
seven feet well I use a shoot through

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.180 
seven feet well I use a shoot through
umbrella<00:03:09.299> that's<00:03:10.049> taking<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.530> stop<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.799> light

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
umbrella that's taking a stop of light

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.949 
umbrella that's taking a stop of light
what<00:03:11.880> it's<00:03:12.000> really<00:03:12.209> going<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.480> do<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.720> drop

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
what it's really going to do is drop

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.580 
what it's really going to do is drop
that<00:03:13.170> down<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.560> five<00:03:13.769> six<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:15.390> let's<00:03:15.930> go<00:03:16.080> one

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
that down to five six so let's go one

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.460 
that down to five six so let's go one
more<00:03:16.620> stop<00:03:17.280> there<00:03:17.700> one<00:03:18.269> more<00:03:18.480> half<00:03:18.720> power<00:03:19.140> so

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
more stop there one more half power so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.900 
more stop there one more half power so
that's<00:03:19.650> going<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.830> put<00:03:20.040> us<00:03:20.070> at<00:03:20.310> half<00:03:20.610> power

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
that's going to put us at half power

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.910 
that's going to put us at half power
down<00:03:21.269> here<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:24.120> makes<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.510> f11<00:03:24.900> at<00:03:25.530> five

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
down here and that makes it f11 at five

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.220 
down here and that makes it f11 at five
to<00:03:26.130> seven<00:03:26.459> feet<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:26.880> again<00:03:27.120> we<00:03:27.510> got<00:03:27.720> one<00:03:27.959> light

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
to seven feet but again we got one light

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.700 
to seven feet but again we got one light
stop<00:03:28.620> one

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
stop one

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.890 
stop one
why<00:03:30.710> I'll<00:03:31.640> get<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:31.940> right<00:03:32.090> in<00:03:32.210> a<00:03:32.270> minute<00:03:32.360> we've

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
why I'll get it right in a minute we've

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.410 
why I'll get it right in a minute we've
got<00:03:33.170> one<00:03:33.590> stop<00:03:33.980> less<00:03:34.400> light<00:03:34.819> because<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.330> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
got one stop less light because of the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.930 
got one stop less light because of the
shoot<00:03:35.660> through<00:03:35.959> umbrella<00:03:36.140> so<00:03:37.010> that's<00:03:37.700> going

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
shoot through umbrella so that's going

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.740 
shoot through umbrella so that's going
to<00:03:38.060> put<00:03:38.270> us<00:03:38.300> at<00:03:38.660> f8<00:03:39.470> now<00:03:40.459> like<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.819> real<00:03:41.240> easy<00:03:41.540> to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
there are also some auto modes which

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.720 
there are also some auto modes which
this<00:04:02.570> has<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.810> sensor<00:04:03.380> in<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.650> front<00:04:03.980> that

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
this has a sensor in the front that

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.360 
this has a sensor in the front that
points<00:04:05.150> out<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:06.260> also<00:04:06.650> automatically

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
points out to also automatically

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.130 
points out to also automatically
determine<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:07.970> exposure<00:04:08.300> for<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:08.959> kind

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
determine the exposure for you it kind

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.110 
determine the exposure for you it kind
of<00:04:09.170> works<00:04:09.380> like<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:09.980> lot<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.640> older

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
of works like the a lot of the older

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.479 
of works like the a lot of the older
manual<00:04:11.450> flashes<00:04:11.840> actually<00:04:12.200> work<00:04:12.440> on<00:04:12.890> this<00:04:13.160> way

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
manual flashes actually work on this way

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.390 
manual flashes actually work on this way
to<00:04:14.180> get<00:04:14.330> automatic<00:04:14.989> exposure<00:04:15.410> well<00:04:16.040> I<00:04:16.280> don't

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
to get automatic exposure well I don't

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.220 
to get automatic exposure well I don't
usually<00:04:16.700> use<00:04:17.000> those<00:04:17.239> modes<00:04:17.510> very<00:04:17.780> often<00:04:18.169> I

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
usually use those modes very often I

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.199 
usually use those modes very often I
just<00:04:18.260> mainly<00:04:18.650> stick<00:04:19.010> with<00:04:19.190> these<00:04:19.459> numbers

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
just mainly stick with these numbers

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.480 
just mainly stick with these numbers
here<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.930> we're<00:04:21.049> going<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.260> set<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:22.010> one

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
here so we're going to set that to one

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.480 
here so we're going to set that to one
half<00:04:22.970> that's<00:04:23.720> one<00:04:24.050> half<00:04:24.230> power<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.310> rest

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
half that's one half power and the rest

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.820 
half that's one half power and the rest
we<00:04:25.640> just<00:04:25.850> set<00:04:26.000> on<00:04:26.150> our<00:04:26.300> camera<00:04:26.750> basically<00:04:27.320> our

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
we just set on our camera basically our

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.730 
we just set on our camera basically our
shutter<00:04:28.100> speed<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:29.540> can<00:04:29.720> be<00:04:29.870> anything<00:04:30.140> but<00:04:30.590> I'm

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
shutter speed it can be anything but I'm

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.040 
shutter speed it can be anything but I'm
going<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:30.980> do<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.190> at<00:04:31.310> one<00:04:31.490> twenty<00:04:31.730> fifth<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.540> a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
going to do it at one twenty fifth of a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.980 
going to do it at one twenty fifth of a
second<00:04:33.500> one<00:04:33.680> 125th<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.640> second<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.240> of

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
second one 125th of a second and of

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.080 
second one 125th of a second and of
course<00:04:36.020> let's<00:04:36.680> go<00:04:36.800> back<00:04:36.950> over<00:04:36.979> here<00:04:37.370> we're

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
course let's go back over here we're

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.380 
course let's go back over here we're
going<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.300> set<00:04:38.479> that<00:04:39.100> f-stop<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.310> f/8<00:04:40.760> point<00:04:41.180> 0

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
going to set that f-stop to f/8 point 0

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.129 
going to set that f-stop to f/8 point 0
to<00:04:41.450> get<00:04:41.720> our<00:04:41.840> exposure

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.469 

okay<00:04:46.919> let's<00:04:47.159> have<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.340> look<00:04:47.520> at<00:04:47.669> our<00:04:47.699> setup<00:04:48.270> as

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
okay let's have a look at our setup as

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.779 
okay let's have a look at our setup as
you<00:04:48.629> can<00:04:48.780> see<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:48.990> have<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.469> Flash<00:04:49.740> setup<00:04:50.580> and

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
you can see I have the Flash setup and

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.119 
you can see I have the Flash setup and
it<00:04:50.909> actually<00:04:51.360> plays<00:04:51.689> directly<00:04:52.620> behind<00:04:52.860> the

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
it actually plays directly behind the

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.629 
it actually plays directly behind the
camera<00:04:53.639> which<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:55.289> cameras<00:04:55.680> in<00:04:55.919> front<00:04:56.550> of

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
camera which is the cameras in front of

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.879 
camera which is the cameras in front of
our<00:04:56.789> test<00:04:57.029> subject<00:04:57.449> here<00:04:57.659> as<00:04:58.349> you<00:04:58.529> can<00:04:58.590> see

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
to actually stand approximately where

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.080 
to actually stand approximately where
this<00:05:09.810> hot<00:05:10.110> spot<00:05:10.469> is<00:05:10.710> now<00:05:11.400> because<00:05:11.729> of<00:05:11.759> the<00:05:11.909> line

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
this hot spot is now because of the line

this hot spot is now because of the line
so<00:05:12.659> close<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.229> me<00:05:13.409> and<00:05:13.710> it's<00:05:13.889> so<00:05:14.039> soft<00:05:14.430> it's

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
so close to me and it's so soft it's

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.610 
so close to me and it's so soft it's
going<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.150> wrap<00:05:15.389> around<00:05:15.569> me<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.229> I'm<00:05:16.590> not

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
going to wrap around me and I'm not

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.670 
going to wrap around me and I'm not
going<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.919> really<00:05:17.129> affect<00:05:17.669> so<00:05:18.389> much<00:05:18.689> of<00:05:19.469> the

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
going to really affect so much of the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.309 
going to really affect so much of the
exposure<00:05:20.159> around<00:05:20.969> the<00:05:21.270> actual<00:05:21.659> image<00:05:21.930> itself

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
exposure around the actual image itself

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.040 
exposure around the actual image itself
by<00:05:22.979> me<00:05:23.340> being<00:05:23.370> placed<00:05:23.909> in<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.330> middle<00:05:24.810> right

in between the light and the actual

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.719 
in between the light and the actual
subject<00:05:27.569> I'm<00:05:28.259> actually<00:05:28.500> avoiding<00:05:29.310> their<00:05:29.460> hot

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
subject I'm actually avoiding their hot

ok so the shots done everything looks
good<00:06:10.509> on<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:10.870> back<00:06:11.080> here<00:06:11.590> and<00:06:11.830> let's<00:06:12.520> see<00:06:12.639> what

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
good on the back here and let's see what

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.809 
good on the back here and let's see what
that<00:06:12.909> histogram<00:06:13.270> looks<00:06:13.629> like<00:06:14.310> ok<00:06:15.310> now<00:06:15.520> look<00:06:15.669> at

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
that histogram looks like ok now look at

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.300 
that histogram looks like ok now look at
that<00:06:15.969> histogram<00:06:16.330> all<00:06:17.229> the<00:06:17.710> highlights<00:06:17.919> are

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
that histogram all the highlights are

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.119 
that histogram all the highlights are
almost<00:06:18.879> all<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.780> way<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.139> right<00:06:20.169> is<00:06:20.620> not

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:21.129 
almost all the way to the right is not

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.399 
almost all the way to the right is not
quite<00:06:21.460> to<00:06:21.639> the<00:06:21.729> very<00:06:21.939> edge<00:06:22.180> of<00:06:22.569> the<00:06:22.689> LCD<00:06:23.169> so

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
quite to the very edge of the LCD so

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.760 
quite to the very edge of the LCD so
that<00:06:23.590> means<00:06:23.800> we<00:06:23.979> didn't<00:06:24.400> overexpose<00:06:25.090> it<00:06:25.770> this

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
that means we didn't overexpose it this

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.800 
that means we didn't overexpose it this
is<00:06:27.009> a<00:06:27.069> very<00:06:27.370> good<00:06:27.490> high<00:06:27.849> key<00:06:28.150> shot<00:06:28.419> there<00:06:28.719> are

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
is a very good high key shot there are

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.020 
is a very good high key shot there are
almost<00:06:28.930> no<00:06:29.199> shadows<00:06:30.069> of<00:06:30.340> which<00:06:30.550> you'll<00:06:30.759> see<00:06:30.789> on

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
almost no shadows of which you'll see on

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.929 
almost no shadows of which you'll see on
the<00:06:31.150> bottom<00:06:31.360> right<00:06:31.870> in<00:06:32.199> the<00:06:32.650> middle<00:06:32.919> of<00:06:33.189> that

the bottom right in the middle of that

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.820 
the bottom right in the middle of that
histogram<00:06:34.389> I'm<00:06:34.780> sorry<00:06:35.050> on<00:06:35.229> the<00:06:35.289> bottom<00:06:35.560> left

this<00:07:29.590> isn't<00:07:29.980> the<00:07:30.010> only<00:07:30.070> way<00:07:30.670> to<00:07:30.730> do<00:07:31.060> these<00:07:31.450> type

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 
this isn't the only way to do these type

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.050 
this isn't the only way to do these type
of<00:07:31.990> shots<00:07:32.440> there's<00:07:33.040> always<00:07:33.490> more<00:07:33.700> than<00:07:33.760> one

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:34.060 
of shots there's always more than one

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.650 
of shots there's always more than one
way<00:07:34.120> so<00:07:34.530> don't<00:07:35.530> think<00:07:36.520> that<00:07:36.820> my<00:07:37.210> way<00:07:37.420> is<00:07:37.450> the

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:37.660 
way so don't think that my way is the

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.900 
way so don't think that my way is the
only<00:07:37.750> right<00:07:38.200> way<00:07:38.440> there's<00:07:39.010> certainly

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:39.910 
only right way there's certainly

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.110 
only right way there's certainly
millions<00:07:40.450> ways<00:07:40.660> to<00:07:41.050> do<00:07:41.280> one<00:07:42.280> technique<00:07:42.760> or<00:07:43.000> do

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 
millions ways to do one technique or do

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.450 
millions ways to do one technique or do
different<00:07:43.510> technique<00:07:43.930> so<00:07:44.230> but<00:07:44.890> I<00:07:45.130> hope<00:07:45.340> you

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:45.460
