00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.670
 Now I want to make a video that will be 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.600
 lighted up my tonal basics but wanna 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.590
 say in advance 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.730
 I am not with a make-up artist and the more I 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.019
 I am not like those beauty blogger I 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.420
 just a woman who loves makeup 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 who likes to be beautiful and give should 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.949
 cosmetics which should 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 use every woman but i'm so 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.640
 I think women card is another such 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.160
 remarochka 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.890
 I just want to say maybe ask 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.420
 Understanding that some 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.700
 impossible words i know some 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.820
 the words i speak wrong speak 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 spanish manners just recently one 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.470
 the girl said what I say 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.390
 wrong word nakid what is right 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.530
 need to say no capes as I say 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.750
 o correctly said naked at least 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.210
 I beg you to understand my case about that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.930
 I have been practically without any time 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 the best trips in spain and i started 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.600
 very much 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.080
 and sort these moments 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.670
 the linguistic pronunciations of all these 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.800
 foreign words the fact is that in 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.140
 words are not spoken in Spanish 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.409
 original and even words like 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.300
 ayvan is pronounced as such a brand 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:40.550
 BMW like is carried as the fetus of BMW 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.530
 that even the capital of spain itself 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.140
 pronounced not madrid but correct 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.130
 pronounced 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 how madris are the nuances of london 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.960
 londra 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.670
 so well so here and so okay well i 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.890
 I'll tell you about my tones 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.960
 the basics i have at the moment not 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.860
 such a large number but these all 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.930
 tonal framework 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.910
 which i love which i use 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:13.270
 constantly depending on the situation and those 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.930
 foundations that I chose the best for himself 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.520
 there were unsuccessful tonal bases it was 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.640
 stones about aventine 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.519
 she too turned out to be dense for me 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.090
 2 which I absolutely did not like 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.620
 this 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.350
 and three blown photoshop something like this 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.320
 It called I leave a reference name 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.720
 down here are these tonal foundations i'm not 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.130
 I can recommend everything else 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.400
 I use can recommend 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.400
 and much less than pretty and so I will begin with 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.620
 tonal framework estee lauder 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.380
 take channel based on me moistened 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.720
 production not very good impressions i 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.190
 For some time she applied it with her fingers and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.920
 she went to bed 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.440
 like mars to very ugly but from me 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.519
 it is necessary to apply it prilovchilis 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.730
 very thin layer and best 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:13.630
 apply as it turned out the brush here is 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.590
 here's the type there is a brush from Sasha and the house 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.570
 sachet food 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.500
 if properly pronounce the mine is 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.500
 a brush from h &amp; m 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.120
 used a little over a year and I decided 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.349
 to her no longer near 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:34.269
 by the way i am on in room 152 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.040
 but after i got this 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.849
 here's a brush from h &amp; m 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.890
 I absolutely revised again now I 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.209
 I take it with great pleasure 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.970
 I like her and have a very 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.069
 good persistence she is nowhere 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.470
 here I am going away with her in the morning for the whole day 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.959
 wake up very early on our series with 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.560
 am go to bed and very late and to the very 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.450
 evenings 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.690
 very night very good tonal 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.079
 basis I think that I will be returning to 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.890
 she will buy her again next 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.569
 tonal basis is probably bestseller 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.599
 or one of the most popular tonal 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.359
 bases on yu tube is rigum color stands at 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.290
 me for oily and combination skin in 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.410
 number 180 is a very famous tonal 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.240
 Basis Basis, in principle, not bad but 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.240
 again on my skin 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.139
 not even blended fat 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.570
 but in the winter to dryness if applied 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.000
 not a thin layer does not look quite 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.750
 ok but if you apply it correctly 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.919
 I apply like fingers like brushes 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.039
 looks just great 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.010
 I had it for a very long time in 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:57.039
 cornering very persistent tonal again 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:59.200
 until I met a very 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.680
 good base fit for me 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.080
 this is the basis of marc jacobs I already once 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.229
 did her review said she had 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.450
 I'm brewing oh here is this tonal 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.700
 the base is now my immutable 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.250
 favorite put ayuna 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:22.620
 shu with all my brushes that i have 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:28.480
 have it already I showed 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:33.460
 h &amp; m is a brush from sephora flat here 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.320
 such a brush and very, very not 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.460
 I like this 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.470
 have given plus which principle 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.690
 designed for rouge she is very very 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.690
 okay cake on the nose tonal basis not 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:50.140
 leave no divorce anything this here 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:55.720
 tonal framework from marc jacobs is 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:06:01.750
 now for me the best she seems to be 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:06.750
 what is the base gel called base 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.750
 gel fits very well on face 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.650
 she is almost invisible on face 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.320
 good covering ability 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.040
 a very long time but at the same time as 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:25.050
 like day cream and next class 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.900
 tonal basis this basis refers to 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.090
 the categories of budget bases is one of 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:38.410
 new products from max factor 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:41.320
 I heard different in number 67 too 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.570
 reviews about this foundation some 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.750
 girls say that your Samara 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.830
 that at the end of the day is going to fold 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.080
 very beautiful 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.840
 with me this does not happen but I am on 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.950
 our thin layer and apply again 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:03.130
 or a brush from h &amp; m or here such 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:06.280
 brush adele and plus principle absolutely 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.290
 absolutely looks natural 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.490
 why is this the basis really 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:15.130
 backlighting skin becomes healthy 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.230
 color gets healthy only 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.120
 which a little flaw seems to me 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.680
 that this one here it is for me 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.470
 a bit darkish need to pick up 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.600
 any other well here and so 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.370
 a small review on may tonal basis 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.520
 principle girls can calm 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.220
 recommend a tonal framework from estee 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.600
 lauder fuel 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.960
 need to apply a thin layer will 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.870
 just perfektum and i really like 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.120
 tonal framework from marc jacobs later 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:46.419
 it looks so natural on the face 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.240
 what not to carp and childhood only 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:51.850
 then the price if of course for the price of it 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.300
 dreams of all builds you can choose as the 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:58.870
 laughter Well all that, in principle I 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:02.400
 I wanted to say I hope the video turned out 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.400
 useful liked
