modify these ones into something that
works<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.070> bit<00:00:29.250> better<00:00:31.369> one<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
works a little bit better one of the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
works a little bit better one of the
keys<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> good<00:00:33.270> traction<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.050> snowy<00:00:34.380> and

none from the factory now one way to put
some<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.629> cut<00:00:45.840> some

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
some of these in is just to cut some

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.350 
some of these in is just to cut some
real<00:00:46.829> thin<00:00:47.070> slices<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> razor<00:00:48.000> blade<00:00:48.239> in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
real thin slices with a razor blade in

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.410 
real thin slices with a razor blade in
there<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.579> use<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> utility<00:00:51.210> knife

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
there you can just use a utility knife

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
there you can just use a utility knife
for<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.469> taken<00:00:52.710> away<00:00:52.800> too

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
for this but that was taken away too

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.799 
for this but that was taken away too
long<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.850> that's<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> came<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
long so that's when I came up with the I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.590 
long so that's when I came up with the I
for<00:00:55.640> this<00:00:56.640> little<00:00:56.820> beast<00:00:57.149> right<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:59.600> call

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
for this little beast right here I call

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.470 
for this little beast right here I call
that<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.750> wrist<00:01:01.050> slicer<00:01:01.410> 5000<00:01:02.480> it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that the wrist slicer 5000 it's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.760 
that the wrist slicer 5000 it's
basically<00:01:04.019> five<00:01:04.769> razor<00:01:05.129> blades<00:01:06.140> set<00:01:07.140> 3/8<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
basically five razor blades set 3/8 of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.100 
basically five razor blades set 3/8 of
an<00:01:07.920> inch<00:01:08.010> apart<00:01:08.220> from<00:01:08.520> each<00:01:08.670> other<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> can

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
an inch apart from each other so you can

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.710 
an inch apart from each other so you can
do<00:01:10.200> five<00:01:10.409> times<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> work<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.640> each<00:01:11.790> each

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
do five times the work with each each

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.539 
do five times the work with each each
slice<00:01:15.560> now<00:01:16.560> using<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> razor<00:01:17.250> blade

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
slice now using the razor blade

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.870 
slice now using the razor blade
technique<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.979> slits<00:01:20.280> won't<00:01:20.640> show

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
technique like that the slits won't show

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
technique like that the slits won't show
up<00:01:21.060> real<00:01:21.390> visible<00:01:21.750> right<00:01:22.560> after<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> make

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
up real visible right after you make

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.630 
up real visible right after you make
them<00:01:23.340> it'll<00:01:24.330> take<00:01:24.450> quite<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> few<00:01:24.810> miles<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
them it'll take quite a few miles to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.859 
them it'll take quite a few miles to
break<00:01:26.640> them<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.150> you'll<00:01:27.450> start<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> see

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
break them in and you'll start to see

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.319 
break them in and you'll start to see
the<00:01:28.020> lines<00:01:28.320> show<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> see

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the lines show up here like you can see

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.860 
the lines show up here like you can see
there<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:31.200> weren't<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.530> freshly<00:01:31.950> done

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.230 

I'd<00:01:36.800> recommend<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.370> wear<00:01:37.490> some<00:01:37.700> gloves<00:01:37.970> while

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.540 
I'd recommend you wear some gloves while
using<00:01:38.600> something<00:01:38.840> like<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.500> lost<00:01:40.310> quite<00:01:40.460> a

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
using something like this I lost quite a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.890 
using something like this I lost quite a
bit<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.730> blood<00:01:40.910> when<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:41.180> made<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:44.570> basically

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
bit of blood when I made it so basically

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.520 
bit of blood when I made it so basically
just<00:01:45.170> get<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> firm<00:01:46.340> grip<00:01:46.550> on<00:01:46.760> it<00:01:47.200> set<00:01:48.200> up<00:01:48.320> at<00:01:48.440> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
just get a firm grip on it set up at the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.000 
just get a firm grip on it set up at the
angle<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:48.950> want<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.690> just<00:01:50.690> give<00:01:50.840> her<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:51.020> slice

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.100 

and<00:01:55.010> that<00:01:55.160> will<00:01:55.340> give<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.520> five<00:01:55.790> even<00:01:56.180> slits

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
and that will give you five even slits

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.930 
and that will give you five even slits
right<00:01:57.320> across<00:01:57.530> your<00:01:57.770> tread<00:01:58.010> block<00:01:58.280> there<00:01:58.610> and

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
right across your tread block there and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:09.880 
right across your tread block there and
just<00:01:59.870> repeat<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.380> each<00:02:00.440> one

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.040 

and<00:02:10.550> repeat<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.150> about<00:02:11.300> 400<00:02:11.690> times<00:02:14.050> after

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and repeat that about 400 times after

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.350 
and repeat that about 400 times after
doing<00:02:15.290> all<00:02:15.380> four<00:02:15.410> tires<00:02:15.920> your<00:02:16.850> risk<00:02:17.060> might<00:02:17.240> be

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
doing all four tires your risk might be

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.900 
doing all four tires your risk might be
a<00:02:17.390> bit<00:02:17.660> sore<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.220> probably<00:02:19.430> won't<00:02:19.670> be<00:02:19.730> much

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
a bit sore but it probably won't be much

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.100 
a bit sore but it probably won't be much
worse<00:02:20.150> than<00:02:20.270> if<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.570> watching<00:02:20.990> movies

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
worse than if you just watching movies

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.580 
worse than if you just watching movies
on<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.440> internet<00:02:21.800> all<00:02:21.890> day<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.560> course

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
on the internet all day and of course

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.200 
on the internet all day and of course
there's<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.160> other<00:02:25.190> method<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.790> using<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
there's the other method of using the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:03:09.460 
there's the other method of using the
sawzall

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.470 

now<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> method<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.980> using<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.310> sawzall<00:03:11.850> puts

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
now the method of using the sawzall puts

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.450 
now the method of using the sawzall puts
a<00:03:12.570> bit<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> thicker<00:03:13.140> cut<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.800> tread

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
a bit of a thicker cut in the tread

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.000 
a bit of a thicker cut in the tread
block<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.380> think<00:03:16.560> that'll<00:03:16.830> work<00:03:16.890> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
block there and I think that'll work a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.140 
block there and I think that'll work a
little<00:03:17.100> bit<00:03:17.280> better<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.610> snowy<00:03:17.940> conditions

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
little bit better in snowy conditions

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.610 
little bit better in snowy conditions
because<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.720> will<00:03:18.810> help<00:03:18.900> hold<00:03:19.230> some<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
because it will help hold some of the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.370 
because it will help hold some of the
snow<00:03:19.920> in<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:20.310> like<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.630> know<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.050> regular

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
snow in there like you know the regular

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.270 
snow in there like you know the regular
winter<00:03:22.620> tread<00:03:23.220> tires<00:03:23.490> you<00:03:23.760> see<00:03:23.970> have
