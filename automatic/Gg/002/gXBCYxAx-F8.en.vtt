00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.569
 if today someone say that u 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.550
 you pouch then hardly this 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.099
 you will surprise someone like your own 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.740
 saying that you have a trick or astra 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.810
 if you catch a glimpse and scold that you have a coupe 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.540
 most likely you will catch yourself surprised 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.880
 look and question what kind of car dude or 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.950
 the fig you buy from you the same family and how 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.110
 do you plan to carry them in it but 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.270
 as practice shows modern cube 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.060
 and may well be practical and Kia 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.010
 About this confirmation too much 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.010
 as always about everything in order 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.480
 it often turns out that the trunk in the coupe 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.670
 this is not at all the trunk space for 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.190
 storage briefcase or bag with clubs 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.890
 for golf but asks not so much for him 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.989
 there is a full trunk in 380 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.729
 liters like a five-door counterpart at 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.360
 this underground is convenient 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.000
 organizer 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.159
 and under it in turn dokatka well 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.380
 if you wish, you can expand the rear sofa 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.390
 and let him get and not even floor but all 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.190
 same without a step up and space 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.159
 decently added in general terms 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.280
 cargo transportation cube and not inferior 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.280
 five-door hatchback 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.170
 landing on the back row did not cause what 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.140
 whatever the inconvenience in the first place 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.120
 due to the fact that the doors are baggy yes 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.160
 and the chair move well but on 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.590
 long trip as a passenger i 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.750
 with a growth of 180 would hardly have agreed 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.520
 still a space in the legs and 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.080
 over the head the minimum and the sofa 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.270
 harsh especially considering that 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.250
 the suspension here is tougher than usual sitting with 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.200
 other side to someone smaller or 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.330
 the child in the car seat here will be quite 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.400
 ok sorry only there is no central 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.600
 armrest and a separate duct 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.600
 candy would not hurt 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.220
 But on the front seats sit one 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.560
 pleasure firstly by themselves 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.600
 the chair is comfortable enough despite 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.970
 limited number of adjustments and in 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.010
 is more than the range of all compensates so 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.450
 what is convenient in them will be miniature 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.940
 girls and big man 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.250
 and secondly, this is a general sensation of chic from 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.080
 salon yes of course in our case was 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.780
 top grade but even among 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.610
 direct competitors to maximum speed yet 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.120
 seldom you meet on the instrument 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.220
 panels 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.739
 the digital display is usually this 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.390
 the prerogative of more respectable cars 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.160
 yes and multimedia installation with 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.920
 navigation here is quite a decent 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.840
 navigation pasha soberly without tupnyak when 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.910
 removing approximation or laying 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.100
 routes and if you still manage 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.750
 drive right turn then navigation in 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.150
 for a couple of seconds build 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.920
 alternative route salon itself like me 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.019
 already said chic is causing 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.540
 unambiguous wow effect first time 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.400
 especially on the driver here in the manner of BMW 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 center console rotated to the side 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.459
 the driver 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.319
 and of course the wheel is worthy of a separate 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.510
 praise is not enough that he himself 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.220
 nice buttons to use conveniently 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.829
 so it is also heated throughout 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.810
 radius that is rare and only 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.970
 later comes the realization that this 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.610
 wow effect is not achieved the most successful 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.709
 way these are great looking 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.440
 inserts under the piano lacquer of course pleases 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.450
 eye but in fact they are very brand and fast 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.430
 are rubbed off losing their presentation 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.829
 although otherwise I'll repeat the salon 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.690
 pleased here and large glove and where 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.200
 Mobile phone there is something to use 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.200
 everyone is comfortable 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.620
 what is up to the feeling of being behind 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.720
 driving there are certain problems with 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.790
 visibility no side mirrors give 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.800
 great review and saloon too though 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.320
 back and loophole but for its class 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.270
 not bad but forked enough 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.580
 thick front struts in corners 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.140
 somewhat degrades visibility so 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.810
 sometimes you have to turn your head 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.850
 there is no question of dimensions dimensions 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.070
 less from parktronic or rear camera 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.570
 kind of I would not refuse the truth there is 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.140
 One problem in the initial trim levels 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.970
 neither one nor the other but it is in the top 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.890
 it's both for my taste 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.540
 somewhat strange and not logical for 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.140
 one asks for dynamics 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.810
 the only engine is 1 6 liter 129 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.030
 strong gasoline aspirated 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.520
 aggregates and by choice or 6-speed 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.180
 mechanics or in our case 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.370
 six-speed automatic 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.470
 Acceleration to hundreds takes 10 and a half 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.210
 and eleven and a half seconds 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.919
 accordingly in principle for the city 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.020
 this dynamics is abundantly abundant and 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.960
 by the way this is the rare case when 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.630
 declared and real dynamics match 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.680
 nevertheless call her in some kind 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.750
 breathtaking language will not turn 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.790
 expect a car with such appearance 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.830
 far more but alas 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.990
 as for the box, the automaton showed 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.330
 works best yes and well 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.550
 and overtake with him quite comfortably under 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.770
 gas to the floor fun dumped 2 3 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.900
 gears and you get the right acceleration 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.760
 but I will note that at the same time official 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.370
 fuel consumption seemed to me a little 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.860
 I was optimistic about 10 seconds 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.900
 half 11 liters in the city and 7 with 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.120
 half on the track here of course the most 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.710
 attentive remind not about what else 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.000
 there is a turbocharged version of it 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.750
 the motor is an outstanding soot 204 mare and 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.790
 265 newtons of moment already available with 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.890
 1750 revolutions so that in tandem with 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.290
 six-speed mechanics kia pro seed 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.100
 live and is this motor available only 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.620
 Jett versions 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.290
 exchanges the first hundred after only seven 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.300
 as much as 7 tenths of a second 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.160
 Essentially as charged versions of others 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.830
 hatchbacks that is not only different 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.260
 engine but also a different highway setting in 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.030
 principle another car so they we 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.600
 try to talk separately in 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.430
 future for now 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.430
 back to the usual requests 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.980
 and 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.660
 as far as controllability, you should immediately 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.700
 will notice what requests as opposed to 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.280
 the five-door hight got over 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.950
 tough suspension as a result rulitsya cube and 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.570
 great and the highway capacity reserve is clearly 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.940
 more potential engine 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.470
 Yes, and the steering wheel though with electric power 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.150
 no less gives a very clear 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.310
 idea of ​​the clutch wheels 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.410
 dear and in general about what is happening with 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.200
 by car and heap up he has three 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.060
 setting mode comfort rate and sport 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.040
 accordingly in a comfortable steering wheel 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.290
 spinning is quite easy which is very convenient 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.360
 in the parking lot and in the city crush a 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.710
 in sport mode it is poured quite 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.300
 tangible effort 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.300
 for the track it 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.890
 From the safety of Sid, everything is in full 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.500
 order by the method of euro nkap machine 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.330
 received five stars or 89 out of 100 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.520
 possible points with a single 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.980
 complaints in the form of poor rib protection when 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.930
 side impact a table but should be clarified 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.650
 that we are talking about the version in the five-door 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.080
 performance 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.950
 Separately tests precisely 3 doors us 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.690
 failed to find 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.820
 also note that in the initial 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.280
 there are no course kits 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.580
 stabilization and emergency amplifier 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.990
 braking but then without exception 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:19.780
 complete sets there is a full set of pillows 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.780
 security including side and curtain 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.770
 Well, let's summarize, in principle, Kia Pro 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.930
 sid turned out great youth 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.849
 city ​​car with a perky exterior 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.129
 kind and quite appropriate 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:37.930
 inner world but looking closely to 

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.490
 he should understand that this is the first 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.669
 turn comfortable cars 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.780
 buying it you buy exactly comfort 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:46.449
 in a coupe wrapper 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.520
 if you spit on the salon and more on 

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:51.189
 soul dynamics then you should look at 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.500
 competitors say too astra ji si 

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:55.629
 although the office and inside but has 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.969
 more interesting dynamics well let's say 

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:59.590
 golf will be more practical due to more 

00:07:57.969 --> 00:08:02.050
 solid ground clearance 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.419
 And on this I have all put huskies 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:07.379
 subscribe to the channel and to new 

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:07.379
 meeting
