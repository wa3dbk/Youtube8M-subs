00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.090
 to 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.040
 Y 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.840
 For years I've been thinking about 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.410
 that is linked to me is the one that most 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.830
 It was convenient because of the way I play 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.420
 the truth is that it is an important moment 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.369
 in my career because I have a 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.180
 great club like the manchester city 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.160
 It's a dream for me to be here myself 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.800
 I come to put my two cents to 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.440
 help the other classmates and between 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.050
 all then pull this forward and be able 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.050
 lift some title with this club 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.130
 then the city had never never been 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.760
 and well then to begin to know it and 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.760
 to enjoy it 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.820
 of which I follow the most apart from the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.980
 Spanish there are some dry 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.250
 They are such great players 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.890
 has has a very good template 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.990
 you can say a lot more but good 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.870
 as I'm a forward and I like what 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.050
 offensive because I tell you about and some 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.050
 Web 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.950
 yesterday when before 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.200
 it was confirmed and I spoke with Jesus 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.060
 and I spoke with javi garcÃ­a also for the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.789
 morning and good now that they were 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.560
 happy I am too and good 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.310
 so we can share the stadium with 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.379
 them to me is a very big jesus is 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.979
 an incredible child a player 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.979
 spectacular 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.980
 will continue to make goals with their phases 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.980
 here in the caesar 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.599
 Y 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.670
 or not 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.440
 I have played with many game systems 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.870
 front to play with a striker 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.930
 a playmaker the player 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.450
 In addition to the centers, the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.520
 played in many ways there will be what 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.760
 I want is to play everything that can help 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.300
 to the team and be able to respond to what you 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.300
 ask for friendship 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.620
 what is an attack football that colorful 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.530
 he likes very much to have the ball play 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.080
 much much football are two teams 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.550
 who has been in the Spanish league has 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.980
 done things very well and the truth that 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.989
 It's a pleasure to be able to work again 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.450
 his orders he called me he explained me a 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.780
 little how is the project going to be everything 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.660
 I had thought and so on 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.150
 and well it does not take much to 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.010
 convince me to come to a team like 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.030
 but the truth that he had the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.030
 last word 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.650
 good as a corpulent player not in a 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.079
 good aerial game 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.470
 a strong ball hit with the leg 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.140
 left and that I always try to be in 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.060
 the right place when the ball goes by 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.459
 the band in that sense I'm a little 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.650
 superstitious not only dismiss numbers 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.379
 I want to improve and improve the figure of 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.739
 previous years is always to improve in what 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.739
 personal 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.850
 the favorite number is the number even 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.850
 to say that I love them
