00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 they are prepared because the time has come 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:10.710
 another literary marathon for all 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.780
 Welcome to another video of the world. 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.480
 and I'm here to introduce you to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.670
 you what you have asked a lot of this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.859
 24-hour marathon since last year 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.369
 also a literary marathon of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.920
 winter 2015 and he knows how it works 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.689
 This marathon I do her some time 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.189
 who has two years just mistaken the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.560
 a semi-annual marathon 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.690
 always in summer and winter people 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.190
 had last year in December that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.809
 started in the middle of December was 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
 finished half of January was very 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.340
 Nice lot of people participated and enough. 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 interaction was too much of it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.989
 totally different from the marathon 24 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.480
 because it lasts a whole month 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.629
 now all winter literary 2015 will 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.550
 happening on July 6 until day 3 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.129
 August are four weeks there of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.370
 reading and intense but calm calm not 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.770
 are 30 days 24 hours a day the purpose 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.690
 this marathon was always to make you read 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.640
 an amount is more books than you 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 usually for a month and I will never 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.750
 I will not take anything away from you. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 that put book so many books by 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.470
 month is not always full open and I 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.350
 for example I usually read six books per 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.540
 month and in the marathon I always put 12 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 the goal games and every time so far 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.020
 I managed to comply so it was very 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.790
 cool that you will have this question 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.920
 you are free to choose how much you 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.540
 book you want remembering who chooses 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.220
 It's more people who do not care to choose 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 the same amount of books you've read 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.030
 for a month in a marathon but it is a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.530
 only have at the end of this video 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.210

 people is basically a certain 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.319
 a period of time where people combine 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.480
 read along at the end we boot to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.730

 reading how many pages you could read this 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.209

 sprint really spoke like that to us 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.790
 Let's read for 30 minutes together. 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.410

 more draw as the marathon said 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.329
 going to start on July 6 I did not put 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.680
 on the first day of 1 because it has 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.870
 a lot of people who still want to do 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.850
 video will want to do something and if 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.470
 organize with the team so you still 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.910
 have this time too in order to be able to 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.410
 sign up and everything else that 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.750
 It's going to be different this time we 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.370
 Let's face it and I'll go. 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.260
 explain to you that there are several 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.299
 marathons that already do what it is when 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.280
 You will choose the books that you will 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.220
 there are some parameters that you 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.440
 You can follow or not, but they are challenges. 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.959
 of this marathon will be the book with figures 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.600
 or illustrations begin or end a 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.609
 series trilogy dentistry is the book that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.680
 someone chose for you to read the book that 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.870
 already turned over will still become an adaptation 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.880
 book with a cover 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.430
 a book of the genre of 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.160
 you - you read a book last year that you 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.200
 won the book with more than 400 pages 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.790
 all these challenges do not worry if 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.940
 You and then got lost here too. 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.280
 underneath it had only you see think 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.079
 You will want to participate in them more 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.970
 remembering how it will always be half 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.310
 redundant to say that but who does 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.500
 more challenges will earn more points and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.880
 will be competing for more books to stay 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.739
 Calm you do not have to choose 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.599
 Now, what are you going to do to 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.819
 signing up will actually only be at the end 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.859
 of the marathon you will need 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.700
 count which of them you got 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.100
