00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
it I'm just using a just measuring it by

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.460 
it I'm just using a just measuring it by
the<00:01:05.690> end<00:01:06.790> clamping<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:07.880> on<00:01:08.000> there<00:01:08.270> I'll<00:01:09.229> take

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
the end clamping it on there I'll take

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.400 
the end clamping it on there I'll take
the<00:01:09.619> key<00:01:09.860> again<00:01:10.810> cuz<00:01:11.810> not<00:01:11.960> enough<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.320> a

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
the key again cuz not enough of a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:21.179 
the key again cuz not enough of a
shoulder<00:01:12.650> here<00:01:13.010> I'm<00:01:13.729> gonna<00:01:13.850> put<00:01:14.119> this<00:01:14.270> in

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.239 

and<00:01:21.700> then<00:01:21.789> I<00:01:21.850> get<00:01:22.289> and<00:01:23.289> I'll<00:01:23.409> just<00:01:23.619> cut<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.069> now

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
and then I get and I'll just cut it now

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:25.260 
and then I get and I'll just cut it now
you're<00:01:24.399> slow<00:01:24.640> because<00:01:24.819> you<00:01:24.909> don't<00:01:25.060> have<00:01:25.119> much

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
you're slow because you don't have much

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.779 
you're slow because you don't have much
of<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.479> grip<00:01:25.689> here<00:01:25.899> so<00:01:26.679> just<00:01:26.710> take<00:01:27.490> it<00:01:27.640> down<00:01:27.729> a

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
of a grip here so just take it down a

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:38.609 
of a grip here so just take it down a
little<00:01:28.119> bit<00:01:28.479> at<00:01:28.719> a<00:01:28.749> time<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:38.049> think<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:38.409> cut

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
little bit at a time you think that cut

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.089 
little bit at a time you think that cut
kind<00:01:38.799> of<00:01:38.950> nice<00:01:39.100> actually<00:01:40.619> I'll<00:01:41.619> flip<00:01:41.859> it<00:01:42.009> on

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
kind of nice actually I'll flip it on

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:46.219 
kind of nice actually I'll flip it on
the<00:01:42.130> other<00:01:42.219> side

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.490 

can<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.070> measured<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.180> end

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
can I get I measured it from the end

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.240 
can I get I measured it from the end
because<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.829> enough<00:01:50.039> of<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
because I don't have enough of a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.279 
because I don't have enough of a
shoulder<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.450> where<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.110> could

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
shoulder if you see here where you could

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:53.510 
shoulder if you see here where you could
try<00:01:52.469> putting<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.770> whole<00:01:52.920> Kia<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.280> look<00:01:53.430> how

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
try putting the whole Kia but look how

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.010 
try putting the whole Kia but look how
this<00:01:53.670> how<00:01:53.909> worn<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.509> doesn't<00:01:54.780> even<00:01:54.899> have

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this how worn this is doesn't even have

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
this how worn this is doesn't even have
the<00:01:55.110> shoulder<00:01:55.579> but<00:01:56.579> we're<00:01:56.700> lucky<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.060> just

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the shoulder but we're lucky it just

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:14.830 
the shoulder but we're lucky it just
broke<00:01:57.509> off<00:01:57.719> clean<00:01:58.110> right<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.759> deepest<00:01:59.759> cut

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.289 

so<00:02:15.840> there<00:02:15.989> we<00:02:16.080> go<00:02:18.830> bottom<00:02:19.830> line<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.299> we've

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
so there we go bottom line is we've

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.300 
so there we go bottom line is we've
taken<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.840> customers<00:02:22.500> broken<00:02:22.890> key<00:02:23.069> it's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
taken the customers broken key it's

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.479 
taken the customers broken key it's
pretty<00:02:23.610> worn<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.620> one<00:02:25.950> way<00:02:26.190> of

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
pretty worn but this is just one way of

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.550 
pretty worn but this is just one way of
cutting<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.060> key<00:02:27.299> we're<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:27.959> duplicating

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
cutting the key we're just duplicating

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.500 
cutting the key we're just duplicating
it<00:02:28.650> exactly<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.670> other<00:02:29.760> way<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:30.090> doing<00:02:30.239> it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it exactly the other way of doing it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.750 
it exactly the other way of doing it
will<00:02:30.720> measure<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.860> depths<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> key<00:02:32.579> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
will measure the depths of the key and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.970 
will measure the depths of the key and
we'll<00:02:33.060> cut<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.959> code<00:02:34.140> machine<00:02:34.319> so

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
we'll cut it on the code machine so

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.110 
we'll cut it on the code machine so
again<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.459> usually<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> quick<00:02:35.940> and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
again this is usually the quick and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.690 
again this is usually the quick and
dirty<00:02:36.150> way<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.510> doing<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:38.069> usually<00:02:38.459> works

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
dirty way of doing it it usually works

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
dirty way of doing it it usually works
sometimes<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.810> doesn't<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.709> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
sometimes it doesn't and then we have to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.539 
sometimes it doesn't and then we have to
cut<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.099> key<00:02:41.280> by<00:02:41.430> code<00:02:41.670> or<00:02:43.250> decipher<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> key

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
cut it key by code or decipher the key

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.309 
cut it key by code or decipher the key
and<00:02:44.790> figure<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.420> what<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.660> depths<00:02:45.959> are<00:02:46.140> and

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
and figure out what the depths are and

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.440 
and figure out what the depths are and
cut<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.560> by<00:02:46.650> code<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.640> car<00:02:47.849> is<00:02:47.940> too<00:02:48.120> old<00:02:48.299> to

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
cut it by code this car is too old to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.990 
cut it by code this car is too old to
have<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.599> code<00:02:48.840> from<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.739> dealer<00:02:50.010> again<00:02:50.910> the

go to the car I know there's a code on
the<00:02:54.720> car<00:02:54.900> somewhere<00:02:55.319> well<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:56.310> could<00:02:56.459> make<00:02:56.579> a

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
the car somewhere well we could make a

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.009 
the car somewhere well we could make a
key<00:02:56.850> for<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.269> way<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
key for it that way but this is the

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.449 
key for it that way but this is the
quick<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:58.889> easy<00:02:59.280> way<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.880> making<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:01.220> key<00:03:02.220> out
