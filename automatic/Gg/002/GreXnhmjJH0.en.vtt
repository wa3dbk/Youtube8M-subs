web application you fall in love with a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.560 
web application you fall in love with a
pattern<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.130> has<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> lot<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:15.059> little<00:00:15.360> pieces

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
pattern that has a lot of little pieces

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.650 
pattern that has a lot of little pieces
and<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.130> kind<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.460> tricky<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
and it can be kind of tricky to get the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.320 
and it can be kind of tricky to get the
the<00:00:19.199> pieces<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.520> where<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.880> want<00:00:21.119> them

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the pieces just where you want them

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.320 
the pieces just where you want them
before<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.779> fuse<00:00:22.020> them<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.380> place<00:00:22.670> on<00:00:23.670> your

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
before you fuse them in place on your

before you fuse them in place on your

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
works with my pattern came a placement

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.430 
works with my pattern came a placement
diagram<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
diagram that's what this is it's a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.690 
diagram that's what this is it's a
placement<00:00:43.800> diagram<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> shows<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.579> where

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
placement diagram it shows you where

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.139 
placement diagram it shows you where
everybody<00:00:45.180> goes<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.640> what<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> use<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
everybody goes it's not what I use to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
everybody goes it's not what I use to
cut<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.410> patches<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.879> my

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
cut the the patches the all my

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.209 
cut the the patches the all my
applicators<00:00:51.899> we're<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.590> an<00:00:52.739> end<00:00:52.890> another

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
applicators we're from an end another

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.220 
applicators we're from an end another
piece<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.670> paper<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.149> has<00:00:54.390> everything<00:00:54.809> set

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
piece of paper that has everything set

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
piece of paper that has everything set
out<00:00:55.379> individually<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.670> my<00:00:56.820> placement

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
out individually this is my placement

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.540 
out individually this is my placement
page<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> I've<00:00:58.920> put<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.250> top<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.020> my<00:01:01.020> fusible

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
page so I've put on top of it my fusible

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.100 
page so I've put on top of it my fusible
applique<00:01:02.550> has<00:01:02.789> my<00:01:03.000> applique<00:01:03.480> pressing<00:01:03.870> sheet

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
applique has my applique pressing sheet

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.830 
applique has my applique pressing sheet
you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:05.040> use<00:01:05.339> parchment<00:01:05.700> paper<00:01:06.150> making

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you can also use parchment paper making

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560 
you can also use parchment paper making
sure<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.290> put<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> nonstick<00:01:08.280> side<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
sure you put the nonstick side up and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.620 
sure you put the nonstick side up and
and<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.640> experimentation

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and you know do a little experimentation

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
and you know do a little experimentation
with<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.960> before<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> have

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
here than just putting my iron a little

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.609 
here than just putting my iron a little
cooler<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.479> has<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> chance<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> cool<00:01:19.200> off<00:01:19.350> all

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
cooler so has a chance to cool off all

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.859 
cooler so has a chance to cool off all
right<00:01:20.159> what<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> I'm<00:01:21.840> going
