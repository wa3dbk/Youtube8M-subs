00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
there's a divided of the two different

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.920 
there's a divided of the two different
compartments<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.829> turn<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:51.030> nozzle<00:00:51.300> here

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
compartments so you turn the nozzle here

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.889 
compartments so you turn the nozzle here
and<00:00:52.370> adjust<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> exactly<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> heat<00:00:54.719> you
