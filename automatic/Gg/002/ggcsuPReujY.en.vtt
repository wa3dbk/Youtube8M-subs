from the beginning that he's always said

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.940 
from the beginning that he's always said
is<00:02:54.940> from<00:02:55.209> day<00:02:55.480> one<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.959> he<00:02:56.140> walked<00:02:56.380> on<00:02:56.739> the

is from day one that he walked on the
field<00:02:57.190> hearing

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
field hearing

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.640 
field hearing
to<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.880> locker<00:02:59.090> room<00:02:59.390> he<00:02:59.810> felt<00:03:00.140> like<00:03:00.320> he<00:03:00.470> was<00:03:00.590> a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
to the locker room he felt like he was a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.830 
to the locker room he felt like he was a
part<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> team<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:02.060> sometimes

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
part of the team and I think sometimes

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.500 
part of the team and I think sometimes
it<00:03:03.080> takes<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.620> little<00:03:03.830> bit<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.220> time<00:03:04.460> to<00:03:04.940> feel

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
it takes a little bit of time to feel

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.510 
it takes a little bit of time to feel
that<00:03:05.690> way<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.080> some<00:03:06.350> teams<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.980> because<00:03:07.340> you

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
that way on some teams just because you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.430 
that way on some teams just because you
have<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:08.390> know<00:03:08.510> groups<00:03:08.990> that<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.260> been

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
I'm home and from that point on he still

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.370 
I'm home and from that point on he still
comes<00:03:19.520> home<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:19.850> talks<00:03:20.030> about<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.540> can't

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380

you<00:03:22.920> know<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.160> did<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.550> today

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
you know we did this today

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.250 
you know we did this today
and<00:03:24.500> just<00:03:25.159> to<00:03:25.310> see<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.790> light<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.390> again<00:03:26.900> and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
I think that was the most exciting to

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.530 
I think that was the most exciting to
get<00:03:30.079> to<00:03:30.140> be<00:03:30.379> back<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:31.359> you<00:03:32.359> I<00:03:32.569> got<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.019> see<00:03:33.200> Tyler

so in this place

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.309 
so in this place
and<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.950> brings<00:03:39.159> the<00:03:39.370> ball<00:03:39.549> just<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.780> that

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
and it brings the ball just that that

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.560
