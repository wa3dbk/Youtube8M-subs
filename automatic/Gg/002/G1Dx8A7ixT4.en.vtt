ash<00:00:09.230> and<00:00:10.230> spirit<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.860> wonder<00:00:11.070> if<00:00:11.130> that's<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.340> clue

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.070 

maybe<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.059> maybe<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.450> not<00:00:15.599> might<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:15.960> well

maybe it is maybe it's not might as well

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.750 
maybe it is maybe it's not might as well
try<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:18.080> well<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.619> could<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.130> been

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.220 

maybe<00:00:26.360> it<00:00:26.510> was<00:00:26.540> holy<00:00:27.290> crap

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.139 

I<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:32.160> don't<00:00:32.250> know<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.940> too

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
I really don't know that was just too

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.510 
I really don't know that was just too
convenient
