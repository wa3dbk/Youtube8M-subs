00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.820 

so<00:00:01.680> you<00:00:01.740> might<00:00:02.010> get<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.250> question<00:00:02.460> that<00:00:03.060> says

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:03.830 
so you might get a question that says

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:22.530 
so you might get a question that says
show<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.759> hydrogen<00:00:06.299> bonding<00:00:06.720> between<00:00:10.790> two

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:33.010 

so<00:00:23.770> remember<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:25.780> requirements<00:00:26.780> for<00:00:31.780> we<00:00:32.780> need

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
so remember the requirements for we need

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.630 
so remember the requirements for we need
to<00:00:33.440> have<00:00:33.650> an<00:00:34.420> electronegative<00:00:35.420> element

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
to have an electronegative element

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.770 
to have an electronegative element
carbon<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.760> hydrogen<00:00:37.970> are<00:00:38.480> not

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
carbon and hydrogen are not

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.479 
carbon and hydrogen are not
electronegative<00:00:39.620> elements<00:00:40.100> oxygen<00:00:40.700> is<00:00:42.340> so<00:00:43.340> we

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
electronegative elements oxygen is so we

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.420 
electronegative elements oxygen is so we
have<00:00:43.610> one<00:00:43.910> requirement<00:00:44.980> we've<00:00:45.980> got<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.309> have

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
have one requirement we've got to have

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.939 
have one requirement we've got to have
oxygen<00:00:46.910> with<00:00:47.239> an<00:00:47.449> available<00:00:47.750> lone<00:00:48.590> pair<00:00:48.920> of

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
oxygen with an available lone pair of

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.970 
oxygen with an available lone pair of
electrons<00:00:49.520> of<00:00:49.910> course<00:00:50.210> he<00:00:50.330> has<00:00:50.480> two<00:00:51.290> lone

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
electrons of course he has two lone

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.340 
electrons of course he has two lone
pairs<00:00:52.010> of<00:00:52.899> electrons<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:55.930> we<00:00:56.930> must<00:00:57.140> have

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
pairs of electrons and we must have

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.389 
pairs of electrons and we must have
hydrogen<00:00:58.090> attached<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.390> an<00:01:00.399> electronegative

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
hydrogen attached to an electronegative

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:11.249 
hydrogen attached to an electronegative
element<00:01:02.620> so<00:01:03.620> if<00:01:03.829> we<00:01:03.980> have<00:01:05.259> here<00:01:06.259> our<00:01:07.100> ethanol

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.800 

to<00:01:12.259> ethanol<00:01:12.800> molecules<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:13.940> have<00:01:13.970> all<00:01:14.420> the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
to ethanol molecules we have all the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.639 
to ethanol molecules we have all the
requirements<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:16.009> we<00:01:16.190> need<00:01:17.350> Delta<00:01:18.350> minus

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
requirements that we need Delta minus

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.590 
requirements that we need Delta minus
charge<00:01:18.950> also<00:01:19.310> Delta<00:01:19.880> plus<00:01:20.060> charge<00:01:20.360> on<00:01:20.509> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
charge also Delta plus charge on the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.219 
charge also Delta plus charge on the
hydrogen's<00:01:21.910> Delta<00:01:22.910> minus<00:01:23.240> charge<00:01:23.539> on<00:01:23.630> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
hydrogen's Delta minus charge on the

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.980 
hydrogen's Delta minus charge on the
oxygens<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:26.570> notice<00:01:27.049> these<00:01:27.770> hydrogen's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
oxygens and notice these hydrogen's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.219 
oxygens and notice these hydrogen's
cannot<00:01:29.990> hydrogen<00:01:30.770> bond<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:33.200> reason<00:01:33.560> for<00:01:33.710> that

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
cannot hydrogen bond the reason for that

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.170 
cannot hydrogen bond the reason for that
is<00:01:36.229> because<00:01:36.380> they're<00:01:36.860> not<00:01:37.070> attached<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:38.060> an

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
is because they're not attached to an

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.010 
is because they're not attached to an
electronegative<00:01:38.900> element<00:01:40.390> so<00:01:41.390> our<00:01:41.570> hydrogen

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
electronegative element so our hydrogen

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
electronegative element so our hydrogen
bond<00:01:42.409> is<00:01:42.700> going<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.909> be<00:01:44.630> between<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.590> oxygen

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
bond is going to be between the oxygen

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.940 
bond is going to be between the oxygen
with<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> lone<00:01:47.600> pair<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:48.080> electrons<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
with a lone pair of electrons and the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.730 
with a lone pair of electrons and the
hydrogen<00:01:49.909> or<00:01:50.119> another<00:01:50.390> molecule<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
hydrogen or another molecule the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.670 
hydrogen or another molecule the
hydrogen<00:01:52.100> bond<00:01:52.340> goes<00:01:52.939> through<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.080> lone<00:01:54.320> pair

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
hydrogen bond goes through the lone pair

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.580 
hydrogen bond goes through the lone pair
of<00:01:54.710> electrons<00:01:57.580> towards<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.729> hydrogen<00:01:59.590> that's

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
of electrons towards the hydrogen that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.399 
of electrons towards the hydrogen that's
the<00:02:00.830> first<00:02:01.070> thing<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:02.090> other<00:02:02.299> thing<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
the first thing the other thing that the

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.020 
the first thing the other thing that the
oxygen<00:02:03.950> hydrogen<00:02:04.210> covalent<00:02:05.210> bond<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.630> in<00:02:06.200> line

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
oxygen hydrogen covalent bond is in line

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.800 
oxygen hydrogen covalent bond is in line
with<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.450> hydrogen<00:02:08.989> bond<00:02:10.299> notice<00:02:11.299> it<00:02:11.450> makes<00:02:11.690> a

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
with the hydrogen bond notice it makes a
