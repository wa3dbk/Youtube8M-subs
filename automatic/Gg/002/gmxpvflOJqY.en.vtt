00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
obviously you know when you're getting
dogs<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.740> VTOL<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.610> low<00:01:59.790> star

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
dogs and that like VTOL and low star

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.490 
dogs and that like VTOL and low star
you're<00:02:00.659> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.200> kills

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
you're going to get a lot of kills

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.649 
you're going to get a lot of kills
you're<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> get<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> crazy<00:02:03.210> amount<00:02:03.509> of

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you're going to get a crazy amount of

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.980 
you're going to get a crazy amount of
kills<00:02:03.979> but<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.850> about<00:02:06.000> how<00:02:06.270> often<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.869> can

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
kills but it's about how often you can

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
kills but it's about how often you can
actually<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.560> those<00:02:07.799> killstreaks<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:09.060> know

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
actually get those killstreaks you know

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.400 
actually get those killstreaks you know
if<00:02:09.509> you're<00:02:09.660> never<00:02:09.959> getting<00:02:10.289> those

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
if you're never getting those

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.660 
if you're never getting those
killstreaks<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.039> there's<00:02:11.190> no<00:02:11.310> point<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
killstreaks then there's no point to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.120 
killstreaks then there's no point to
even<00:02:11.790> use<00:02:12.030> them

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
even use them

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.920 
even use them
but<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.430> played<00:02:13.730> three<00:02:14.180> or<00:02:14.300> four<00:02:14.450> games<00:02:14.690> today

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
but I played three or four games today

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.040 
but I played three or four games today
the<00:02:15.620> first<00:02:16.250> game<00:02:16.520> I<00:02:16.850> like<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> use<00:02:17.750> my<00:02:17.780> high

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
the first game I like to use my high

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.490 
the first game I like to use my high
killstreaks<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.800> put<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> lodestar<00:02:19.730> VTOL<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.020> I

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
killstreaks I put a lodestar VTOL and I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.780 
killstreaks I put a lodestar VTOL and I
believe<00:02:22.540> either<00:02:23.540> dogs<00:02:23.990> are<00:02:24.290> sworn<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.790> don't

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
believe either dogs are sworn I don't

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.270 
believe either dogs are sworn I don't
really<00:02:25.880> remember<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:27.440> didn't<00:02:27.860> get<00:02:27.950> any<00:02:28.130> of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
really remember and I didn't get any of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.120 
really remember and I didn't get any of
them<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.210> ended<00:02:29.480> up<00:02:29.600> going<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:30.080> 39<00:02:30.500> 220<00:02:31.100> or

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
them so I ended up going like 39 220 or

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.030 
them so I ended up going like 39 220 or
something<00:02:31.550> like<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:32.050> next<00:02:33.050> game<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.470> used<00:02:33.710> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
something like that next game I used the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.120 
something like that next game I used the
hell<00:02:34.940> storm<00:02:35.270> lightning<00:02:35.690> strike<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.440> silent

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
hell storm lightning strike and silent

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.910 
hell storm lightning strike and silent
chopper<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:38.270> went<00:02:38.510> like<00:02:38.600> 57<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.470> 10<00:02:39.740> or

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
chopper and I went like 57 and 10 or

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.460 
chopper and I went like 57 and 10 or
something<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:42.440> know

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
something like that but you know

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.520 
something like that but you know
actually<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:44.420> thought<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.990> myself<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.440> know

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
actually I I thought to myself you know

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.160 
actually I I thought to myself you know
I<00:02:45.620> need<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.280> get<00:02:46.400> better<00:02:46.550> game<00:02:46.820> plays<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.720> i

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
I need to get better game plays so i

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.750 
I need to get better game plays so i
turn<00:02:48.560> on<00:02:48.590> my<00:02:48.740> heart<00:02:49.010> my<00:02:49.850> heart<00:02:50.080> scorestreaks

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
turn on my heart my heart scorestreaks

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.730 
turn on my heart my heart scorestreaks
lodestar<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.030> 1500<00:02:53.600> point<00:02:53.780> streak<00:02:54.050> if<00:02:54.560> i

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
lodestar is a 1500 point streak if i

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.380 
lodestar is a 1500 point streak if i
remember<00:02:54.800> correctly<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.730> that's<00:02:56.000> that's<00:02:56.240> not

remember correctly and that's that's not

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.120 
remember correctly and that's that's not
easy<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.870> get<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.200> know<00:02:57.290> unless<00:02:57.680> you're<00:02:57.980> like

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
easy to get you know unless you're like

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.220 
easy to get you know unless you're like
FearCrads<00:02:58.400> that's<00:02:59.390> not<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.780> easy<00:02:59.960> to<00:03:00.050> get

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
FearCrads that's not that easy to get

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.980

just<00:05:20.750> be<00:05:20.930> sitting<00:05:21.229> there<00:05:21.260> just<00:05:21.560> just<00:05:21.800> head

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
just be sitting there just just head

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.320 
just be sitting there just just head
glitching<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.900> I<00:05:24.580> don't<00:05:25.580> want<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:25.850> do<00:05:25.970> but<00:05:26.270> I

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
glitching and I don't want to do but I

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.570
