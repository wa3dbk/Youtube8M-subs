00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.570 
see that after like every second
Megatron<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.660> killing<00:02:31.380> optimist<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.220> sort<00:02:32.520> of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
Megatron is killing optimist and sort of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.080 
Megatron is killing optimist and sort of
blast<00:02:33.180> him<00:02:33.510> all<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> time<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.940> one<00:02:35.940> nice

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
blast him all the time so it's one nice

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.280 
blast him all the time so it's one nice
thing<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:37.440> be<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:38.100> see<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.459> an<00:02:38.580> episode<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:40.260> see

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
thing to be to see in an episode to see

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.150 
thing to be to see in an episode to see
why<00:02:40.890> Megatron<00:02:41.520> hates<00:02:41.790> optimist<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.450> much<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.860> I

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
why Megatron hates optimist so much so I

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.830 
why Megatron hates optimist so much so I
could<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.120> being<00:02:45.180> quite<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.600> good

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
could see that being quite a good

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.910 
could see that being quite a good
episode<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.350> they<00:02:46.709> did<00:02:46.980> explore<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> like

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
episode of they did explore this so like

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.550 
episode of they did explore this so like
maybe<00:02:50.130> back<00:02:50.520> on<00:02:50.670> Cybertron<00:02:51.110> like<00:02:52.110> their

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
maybe back on Cybertron like their

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.250 
maybe back on Cybertron like their
relations<00:02:53.190> or<00:02:53.670> maybe<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.360> telling<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.989> story

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
relations or maybe like telling a story

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.690 
relations or maybe like telling a story
to<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.370> humans<00:02:56.880> while<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.920> know<00:02:58.920> some<00:02:59.250> storms

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
to the humans while I know some storms

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.110 
to the humans while I know some storms
happening<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.480> would<00:03:00.840> be<00:03:00.870> quite<00:03:01.140> good

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
happening so that would be quite good

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.660 
happening so that would be quite good

Collins doing some movie work maybe like

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.450 
Collins doing some movie work maybe like
he's<00:04:23.910> filming<00:04:24.479> some<00:04:25.410> voiceovers<00:04:25.890> for<00:04:26.130> the

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
movie or something but I hope we get a

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.490 
movie or something but I hope we get a
prime<00:04:29.280> centric<00:04:29.759> episode<00:04:29.880> but<00:04:30.419> I'm<00:04:30.539> sure<00:04:30.840> next

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
prime centric episode but I'm sure next

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.089 
prime centric episode but I'm sure next
episode<00:04:32.039> which<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.340> partners<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.919> hope<00:04:34.919> he

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
episode which is partners I hope he

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.610 
episode which is partners I hope he
shows<00:04:35.340> up<00:04:35.550> then<00:04:35.759> because<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.300> can<00:04:36.620> probably

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
shows up then because I can probably

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.260 
shows up then because I can probably
guess<00:04:37.889> that<00:04:37.919> he<00:04:38.310> will<00:04:38.550> definitely<00:04:39.030> show<00:04:39.210> up

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
guess that he will definitely show up

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.850 
guess that he will definitely show up
and<00:04:40.849> so<00:04:41.849> yeah<00:04:42.030> but<00:04:42.509> if<00:04:42.630> I'm<00:04:43.349> going<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.590> touch<00:04:43.830> a

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
and so yeah but if I'm going to touch a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.120 
and so yeah but if I'm going to touch a
bit<00:04:44.220> on<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.550> next<00:04:44.849> episode<00:04:45.530> unlike<00:04:46.530> why<00:04:46.830> think

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
bit on the next episode unlike why think

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.159 
bit on the next episode unlike why think
is<00:04:47.220> going<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.460> happen<00:04:47.490> so<00:04:48.150> basically<00:04:49.020> what

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
is going to happen so basically what

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.360 
is going to happen so basically what

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
is because they still haven't found out

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.659 
is because they still haven't found out
where<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.800> unless<00:05:37.800> he<00:05:38.039> speaks<00:05:38.370> of<00:05:38.520> them

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
where it is unless he speaks of them

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.499 
where it is unless he speaks of them
like<00:05:38.880> during<00:05:39.270> a<00:05:39.509> battle<00:05:39.810> or<00:05:39.990> something<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:41.509> love

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
what we learn though about Megatron's

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.010 
what we learn though about Megatron's
attitude<00:05:45.000> towards<00:05:45.419> Starscream<00:05:46.050> in<00:05:46.949> g1

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
attitude towards Starscream in g1

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.540 
attitude towards Starscream in g1
Megatron<00:05:49.020> kept<00:05:49.289> Starscream<00:05:49.949> around<00:05:50.340> no

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
Megatron kept Starscream around no

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.870

or<00:05:54.289> plotting<00:05:55.289> against<00:05:55.860> him<00:05:55.979> he<00:05:56.460> always<00:05:56.550> kept

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
or plotting against him he always kept

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.659 
or plotting against him he always kept
around<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:58.789> in<00:05:59.789> animated<00:06:00.630> and<00:06:01.669> Megatron

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
around and and in animated and Megatron

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.390

so<00:06:06.380> this<00:06:07.380> big<00:06:07.590> difference<00:06:08.009> and<00:06:08.280> prime

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
so this big difference and prime

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.909 
so this big difference and prime
megatron<00:06:08.990> didn't<00:06:09.990> immediately<00:06:10.289> kill

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
megatron didn't immediately kill

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.969 
megatron didn't immediately kill
Starscream<00:06:11.520> but<00:06:12.270> watched<00:06:12.659> him<00:06:12.960> evaluate<00:06:13.800> it

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979

and decided how to deal with him after
carefully<00:06:16.800> sort<00:06:17.250> of<00:06:17.310> considering<00:06:17.969> the
