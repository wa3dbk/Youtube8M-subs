00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.940
 what's up we're here for you back 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.620
 of the Canary Islands we are in the second part 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.350
 of the tutorial on how to do our 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.970
 miniatures and well we are here we leave 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.400
 in the previous episode made the 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.750
 letters and what I 've done has been to look 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.550
 the images that I want to put in the 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.859
 video and what we are going to put is going to be 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.289
 this image of ralph let's put this 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.060
 wright map background since 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.460
 it would symbolize that we had played in this 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.169
 map and let's put then a small 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.999
 black frame first of all we go to 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.649
 copy the image of the black frame we 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.140
 let's go to our photoshop we're going to 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.520
 give uve control so that it sticks and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.950
 let's go here on the left that 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.090
 Well, this tool is behind us 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.310
 flame seems so good it will put us 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.530
 quick selection we give the button 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.200
 right and we apply the tool of 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.080
 magic wand give normal click 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.930
 here on top we give you to delete click 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.310
 here normal too and delete let's 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.250
 give him what is normal for him to leave 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.620
 to the magic wand and we give it to 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.140
 now to control to be able to do what 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.300
 I wanted to be turning the frame we're going to 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.100
 give it to rotate 90 degrees and now what 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.620
 let's do it's going to be establish it not 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.170
 let's put a little bit here 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.540
 little bit here we are going to put this 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.870
 here a little more and this here kids and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.060
 we have to put it whole as above 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.370
 and so good so from bottom to top 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.680
 some can you tell me but how ugly 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.540
 how much edge do I have to tell you that 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.100
 when his vice miniatures as this 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.050
 it will be fine since it is all this 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.430
 here will still be cropped enough image 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.530
 since as I said the previous one 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.610
 episode I do not know the exact measurements of 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.350
 the thumbnails that you have to upload in 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.450
 youtube then I put the frame like this 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.130
 wide and then that will not look or not be 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.320
 you will see not half the width will not be seen 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.049
 pretty little since you can see it in 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.240
 the miniatures that I upload to the channel and good 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.299
 now that we have the framework we already have 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.060
 the area of the area bounded to put 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.100
 Well, the images that we want 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.960
 let's go here let's catch white 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.299
 photos the rail map we will go to 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.610
 our photoshop we will give you control 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.590
 see is going to paste the map let's do it and 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.540
 more control you as well I said before 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.070
 let's make the image pretty 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.650
 little girl 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.600
 but here we can do this a 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.479
 little easier 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.090
 this well Dallas and it would be pretty good 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.060
 we give you mind to apply if you want 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.930
 then you give to the button and let's go 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.500
 as we have here 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.480
 we see that the map is layer 2 then 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.819
 we use normal click drag the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.040
 layer down you see and now we 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.080
 it would be the layer is in the background it 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.690
 we give here what we can do is go 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.080
 down here to this button and give it some 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.870
 curves since we can always then you 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.489
 low here a little curve and then 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.989
 then add a little bit here and it would be 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.900
 a light effect the truth enough 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.640
 pimp so would be very very handsome the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.790
 true then I what to do 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.890
 to see how it would be we take away the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.680
 effect of curves this effect of curves 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.060
 we will also remove it since 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.550
 I will teach another way then let's go here 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.260
 we select the layer we give control 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.720
 and then this will not come out all 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.360
 saturation we give coloring and what 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.490
 we can do would be to put a color to 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.350
 no, I do not know if we take it out 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.700
 nuclear and modern warfare 3 or any 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.620
 kind of these things because the truth is 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.180
 that can be quite pretty cool 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.120
 we can raise the saturation as 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.430
 We are seeing this, I am not going to 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.200
 apply in truth I prefer to put 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.000
 Well, as you come, I said some 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.400
 curvitas as there is a light effect 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.010
 very cool we are going to lower this a little bit 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.440
 over here we are going to upload here the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.570
 perfect lighting so I would stay very 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.100
 very cool then now what are we going to 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.810
 do let's catch we 're going to copy 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.280
 image of ras let's go to our 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.920
 photoshop let's give Ã¼ber control 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.380
 to stick it 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.239
 let's put it on top of here then 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.360
 let's give it again to the bar of 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.790
 magic wand tool click 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.830
 normal delete to remove it from the background 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.450
 and we would only ralph this 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.520
 we are also going to remove this here too 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.920
 although what we could do would be 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.780
 hide it not now we have here flush 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.980
 put we will do control of how 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.209
 well I said let's make it a tad 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.340
 smaller and we're going to put it like that 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.319
 So now what I do is make 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.330
 like an outline around ralph 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.040
 we go to fusion options and we put him 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.560
 a tad of stroke and the one that always tends 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.419
 look pretty good and we're going to make a 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.769
 thing to which to have to be 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.400
 very attentive because if you do not go to 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.350
 lose let's give layer a new layer 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.729
 let's give it ok and this new layer what 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.290
 what are we going to do, let's take the 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.970
 pen tool does not and is 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.430
 selected and what we are going to do 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.919
 it would be then let's go to this you have to go 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.860
 clicking normal would have to do 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.500
 as well as an outline around ralph 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.729
 or our image that we want 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.080
 me that I know for example let's go 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.330
 doing it like that 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.470
 we are going to make the outline look like this 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.490
 such and such 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.389
 so very well 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.699
 over here it's worth it and we're going to have the 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.789
 contour done now we give button 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.849
 Right to make selection we give to ok 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.729
 let's go to our brush let's go with the 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.190
 brush then put 5,000 and we paint it 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.349
 everything now well this has happened is not 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.199
 You see weird I do not know what else we give control 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.960
 it does not leave your little things 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.580
 these as well as how the lines are 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.349
 cut off I do not know I will not know how 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.660
 say it then we have here the layer of 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.919
 of the outline here we have the layer of 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.750
 relax what you have to do is put it 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.449
 below the layer ralph and we 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.900
 would this be now we give options 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.849
 of fusion we give to stroke 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.190
 but if the background is black so that 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.849
 You draw a line because now we put a 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.849
 a Gradient Overlay him 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:45.120
 we put to combine this color with 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.860
 the de rne and we put this and the truth 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.780
 is that it would be very very cool 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.389
 then what we can do now 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.370
 we will also go like this the miniature 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.349
 I would be pretty enough now let's see 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.610
 here to the letters if we want then 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.990
 we can make them a tad bigger 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.740
 so that it occupies us more for example 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.330
 put it like that would be very cool and what 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.090
 we can do now is let's give it 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.090
 well also the new layer we will go 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.900
 I have selected brushes 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.060
 you can download for free get 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.920
 on youtube to download brushes or flash 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.930
 or something like that I do not know what it was called of lies 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.910
 line balloons and I do not remember and I'm going to 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.070
 with select if I do not remember anymore I think 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.260
 what was this may be let's try it 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.180
 first of all it would seem like this then 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.310
 let's give z control to remove 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.170
 that we are going to put here behind the 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.040
 layer of ralph and we are going to give you here 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:37.950
 so this is going to put it here and 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.550
 we can put this type as we can 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.410
 put in superimpose and you see the good ones 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.580
 this layer we give you to superpose or what 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.830
 We can put it soft or put strong light 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.750
 and the truth is that it usually stays very 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.090
 that very well I that is a soft light a 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.590
 superimpose the truth is that it would be very 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.010
 very cool then what we can do 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:01.950
 it is also painting it, I think if not 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.570
 I remember badly if we're not going to give it 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.400
 control z whenever we do something and what 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.810
 we want and we want to rectify or return 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.560
 as before we are going to control z and now 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.780
 is 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.310
 so it would be very, very, very 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.870
 cool this effect so lights up 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.520
 behind ralph here we would have the 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.130
 letters here we would have an image 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.960
 we can always put the one we want or 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.180
 do not put anything we would have a black frame 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.010
 and I'll tell you how to save the image 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.110
 or the miniature we already have it all done 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.980
 We are practically going to give it to file 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.930
 we are going to keep it as and we are going to go 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:34.380
 example would have here on desktop let's
