00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.860 

the<00:00:54.980> beef<00:00:55.220> I<00:00:55.460> use<00:00:55.820> were<00:00:56.120> just<00:00:56.390> sort<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:56.720> a

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
the beef I use were just sort of a

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.350 
the beef I use were just sort of a
mishmash<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.920> old<00:00:58.280> stuff<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:58.670> I<00:00:58.880> had<00:00:59.150> in<00:00:59.330> my

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360

mishmash of old stuff that I had in my
craft<00:00:59.780> box<00:00:59.900> but<00:01:00.830> I<00:01:00.860> think<00:01:01.250> all<00:01:01.430> black<00:01:01.670> would

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
craft box but I think all black would

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.890 
craft box but I think all black would
look<00:01:02.210> real<00:01:02.480> nice<00:01:03.250> so<00:01:04.250> just<00:01:04.640> continue<00:01:05.269> on<00:01:05.300> to<00:01:05.750> do

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
look real nice so just continue on to do

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.670 
look real nice so just continue on to do
the<00:01:06.080> rest<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.680> case<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.690> do<00:01:08.690> small<00:01:09.020> areas

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
the rest of the case and do small areas

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.590 
the rest of the case and do small areas
of<00:01:09.860> glue<00:01:10.100> at<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.310> time<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:11.210> your<00:01:11.390> glue

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
of glue at a time just so your glue

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.620 
of glue at a time just so your glue
doesn't<00:01:11.869> dry<00:01:12.050> first<00:01:14.890> if<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.850> miss<00:01:17.119> any<00:01:17.390> spots

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
doesn't dry first if you miss any spots

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.359 
doesn't dry first if you miss any spots

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
on all the corners and the edges once

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.780 
on all the corners and the edges once
you're<00:01:38.650> done<00:01:38.800> you're<00:01:39.010> going<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.220> let<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.490> dry

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
you're done you're going to let it dry

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.110 
you're done you're going to let it dry
overnight<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:45.130> next<00:01:45.460> day<00:01:45.640> you're<00:01:45.880> going<00:01:46.060> to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
overnight the next day you're going to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.600 
overnight the next day you're going to
water<00:01:46.360> down<00:01:46.690> your<00:01:46.750> modge<00:01:47.140> podge<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.400> has

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
water down your modge podge so it has

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.270 
water down your modge podge so it has
this<00:01:48.900> consistency<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.200> then<00:01:50.980> you're<00:01:51.160> going

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
this consistency and then you're going

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.730 
this consistency and then you're going
to<00:01:51.340> go<00:01:51.520> over<00:01:51.910> your<00:01:51.940> entire<00:01:52.270> clutch<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
to go over your entire clutch you

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.400 
to go over your entire clutch you
actually<00:01:57.160> have<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.580> do<00:01:57.760> this<00:01:57.970> process<00:01:58.410> twice

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
actually have to do this process twice

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.130 
actually have to do this process twice
so<00:02:00.160> do<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:00.580> once<00:02:00.820> let<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.480> dry<00:02:01.660> overnight<00:02:01.960> and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
so do it once let it dry overnight and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.719 
so do it once let it dry overnight and
do<00:02:02.500> it<00:02:02.620> again<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.890> next<00:02:03.190> day

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
do it again the next day

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.660 
do it again the next day
you<00:02:04.660> don't<00:02:04.930> want<00:02:05.140> your<00:02:05.290> beads<00:02:05.590> falling<00:02:06.400> all

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
you don't want your beads falling all

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.850 
you don't want your beads falling all
over<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.180> place<00:02:07.450> when<00:02:07.900> you're<00:02:08.080> at<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> party<00:02:08.679> or

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
over the place when you're at a party or

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.460 
over the place when you're at a party or
an<00:02:09.010> event<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.869> have<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.260> make<00:02:11.440> sure

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
an event so you have to make sure

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:24.780 
an event so you have to make sure
they're<00:02:11.890> stuck<00:02:12.190> down<00:02:12.459> really<00:02:12.880> tight

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.630 

so<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.930> finished<00:02:26.349> coat<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:27.069> we're

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
so this is the finished coat and we're

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.870 
so this is the finished coat and we're
just<00:02:27.849> going<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.090> let<00:02:28.299> this<00:02:28.510> dry<00:02:28.840> completely

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.330 

if<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.660> notice<00:02:35.020> any<00:02:35.230> gaps<00:02:35.530> now<00:02:35.980> would<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.190> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
if you notice any gaps now would be a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.309 
if you notice any gaps now would be a
good<00:02:36.580> time<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.910> go<00:02:37.209> in<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.420> add<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> few<00:02:37.959> more

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
good time to go in and add a few more

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.000 
good time to go in and add a few more
