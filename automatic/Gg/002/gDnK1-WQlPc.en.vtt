00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.520
 Hello hello these individuals in the city and as promised the owner 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.540
 so great for painting 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.790
 the detective day at the honesty pay you in easy steps 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.589
 I got along quite well 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.459
 this happens before that 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.810
 a suitable primer in the parsonage in latex driver 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.730
 Maybe you have a very fine grain 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.099
 minded 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.310
 became a piece of canvas 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.710
 a felt-tip pen 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.899
 a breathing mask should 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.019
 so on 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.850
 so one 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.269
 then took over 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.710
 We could see the world of work with a big piece of paper 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.610
 designed 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.070
 that we achieved that by either being in huge TVs or simply 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.440
 via newspapers 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.690
 furthermore, I have been able to work for the Spree Â», said Webber 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.110
 on which so sprayed eggs can be listed 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.500
 so that it can be sprayed evenly from all sides 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.020
 The first step is the surface of the material to the space that they are 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.860
 as fine as sandpaper that is a 400 actors that's almost 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.100
 820 could be overdone by the government 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 and the driveway of Flat over the surface 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.810
 It does not matter that a great idea is just about whether 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 to build up the surface to keep the paint better 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.500
 Prof 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 v 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.909
 if you did that, the co-worker said 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.110
 in the surface in some 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.140
 It is important to make sure that you in her fat remainder or percent 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.070
 Paint remainders depending on what I make times to the pieces has removed and 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.470
 also the whole Starbatty removed from the grinding 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.470
 then with a dry cloth pusher 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.070
 Round is finished for example 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.150
 for the primer namely that his athlete because it is a thin layer up 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 to the material 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.670
 this layer gives the entire area a uniform structure, if so 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.569
 somewhere up to 100 or urban cracking that makes it a little again 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.639
 repair a bit 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.929
 the word, however, more his fancy 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.929
 but he uses every conventional primer 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.480
 dry the whole load steam generator for ten minutes and then kicked one more 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.739
 Shift up 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.980
 after the second coat has applied let it dry for two hours 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.680
 Here you see it has been keeping that talk since that day 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.119
 Chemnitzer waiting loops 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.119
 again the good fourth 23 11 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.560
 So the surface students can finish so it can be the next 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.939
 Step by step the next step is the 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.419
 Crescent on the forehead 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.529
 Percent Black Foxman 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.529
 to that cuts that objection was worth a moon from Germany 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.369
 and beside and black powder 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:55.349
 The powder must be advised before well-known for about three minutes 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.079
 until the ball in the team is good to hear HSC we had already prepared 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.670
 Banks themselves must make sure that the uniform closed and not 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.589
 staying in one place for too long because otherwise it's too much but also one point 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.589
 collect and cause the stains 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.679
 Soldiers with the flag of the United States on 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.769
 so now that the paint is dry they can clear up the murder so looks 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.769
 then it out 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.309
 and now the whole mask could turn red-green 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.309
 Schliemann 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.179
 Let it dry after another ten minutes, it is true on the legs 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.949
 it pulls 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.830
 5 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.760
 4 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.760
 5 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.090
 now time was not exactly determined which pull off the film before the 

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:38.089
 Color is dry 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.069
 we are sailing 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.169
 The next step is to recite clearcoat 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.150
 I made myself for a glass of wine holes just because I think 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.800
 that it fits better with the costume 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.360
 th gone well again and that's what I think and color apply 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.090
 So even slow was 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.090
 tight 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.150
 v 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
 Red 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.949
 1 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.800
 also the Franks at the second league start 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.289
 Not 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.080
 I 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.659
 the r 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.110
 as soon as I get a pretty boring if only another picture then say that 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.759
 Has 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.900
 At the lake it is not too elaborate now they are playing themselves 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.319
 Of course, they need to be aware of these needs 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.469
 be careful to wear gloves and the respiratory mask which did not do both 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.360
 because i am old and make sure that you are really a group with that 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.969
 Name work we see I can do it all well covered but how to 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:30.860
 does not look good 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.770
 m 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.220
 So it really thinks of covering the large area that she can 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.810
 If you are still far away I am usually only Gernot Bauer 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.100
 a questionable that some people have covered everything 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.850
 I'm worried about driving and that's how we come from Israel 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.230
 Queen was that is in the interest of all or young men info at which 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.949
 Offices fall for what the vendors use 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.800
 and parents really mean knives and I'm still in the middle of this place 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.759
 at least three days so fun a 37-year-old Italian said a lot of fun 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.020
 while Lesley de Walle 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.010
 as an optician and on
