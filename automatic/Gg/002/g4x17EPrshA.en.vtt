00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:06.580
 commenting and today with a new topic 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.100
 called the wheat habitat but I do this 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.860
 review because a youtuber has 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.170
 asked to leave in the description of the video 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.869
 your channel please stop by your 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.820
 canaries subscribe if you see that you have and 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.550
 good basically the tri that whistles 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.460
 It serves to cut down a tree a tree 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.890
 hit so that when you break a piece of 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.229
 wood or a block of wood is 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.079
 drop the entire tree including buds 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:35.740
 the leaves followed some apple all 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.940
 good for it let's try one what 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.180
 what we have to do is take an ax 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.140
 of wood and we will go to a tree 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.290
 we will install the bottom part 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.920
 and as you see, the whole tree falls 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.290
 wood and all the buds as you see the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.730
 super useful mote very useful one of the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.520
 monkeys more useful than there is in a mode 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.420
 survival to save a lot of work 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.420
 and above all time 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.000
 You see, it's pretty simple 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.220
 and good kids once explained this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.930
 let's proceed to install it now 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.580
 I come good guys to proceed to 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.170
 install the tri capi hector we only have 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.110
 that download is not the monster vader and 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.270
 obviously the tri capi hector we can 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.550
 use the module of lowell forge mod 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.830
 loader whatever we want in this case I 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.590
 download the ader module we will only give you 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.870
 to this page and we will give you in download 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.660
 direct 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.070
 vision download automatically 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.720
 we admire the other page that will leave them 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.070
 of kristen of the video we will go down to 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.909
 down here where he puts three vice chancellors 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.630
 and click on ml client 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:44.350
 because we will not go to fly we will wait 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.799
 our 5 seconds and we press to jump 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.799
 advertising 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.560
 we press 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.920
 and it is already 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.310
 we are not going to close these two pages 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.180
 well first let's move on these two 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.010
 downloads to the desktop 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.070
 so we can fish so we can 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.500
 handle it more easily and good 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.539
 As you can see here I also have the mini 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.510
 craft forge that good is the same as 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.250
 let's use 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.689
 that simply has to be an Oscar 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.700
 because otherwise it will not work but 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.040
 well as I said before it does not matter which 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.959
 we will use the next step is to go to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.110
 our roaming folder to go to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.170
 execute percent brevity by the way 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.450
 point minecraft bean minecraft dot 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.970
 hard ect the clicked with wii enter 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.350
 file 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.350
 we minimize this 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.969
 the challenge of removing the meta folder and the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.650
 press and we will delete if not 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.829
 we delete this folder does not work 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.829
 remember this and well we will open the minec 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.030
 the force jewel module to der the 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.030
 we will select everything 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.480
 and we'll go to the bottom for 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.550
 that we can not get into any 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.580
 folder and not the functions we are 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.630
 and it is already done to do this we close this 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.850
 also and we will go to the folder 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.040
 minecraft alone and here we create a 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.730
 folder called mods if we do not have it 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.680
 this created 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.349
 we will open 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.390
 and we just copied the tri capi editor and what 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.120
 we paste here 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.770
 and good guys and iniesta this has been 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.610
 everything how he sees the installation is super 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.630
 very easy and simple good we see in 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.700
