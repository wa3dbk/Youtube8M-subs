00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.390
Hi there, welcome to the first in the video
series, “Telescope Basics.”

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.570
My name is David Fuller, host of the “Eyes
on the Sky” weekly stargazing series that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.910
can be found at eyes on the sky dot com.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.380
In this video, I will explain the various
types of telescopes and what you need to know

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.520
about them to either make the best choice
for purchasing one, or how to better use the

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.680
telescope you may have
right now.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.420
So let's get started!

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.870
First, we will look at the three major types
of amateur telescopes.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.750
Refractors, reflectors, and compound – or
catadioptric – telescopes.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.820
When most people think “Telescope” they
probably imagine a

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.450
refractor, like this one.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.510
They have a large glass lens at one end, through
which light passes and refracts – or bends

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.920
– the light to a focal point.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.651
As the light passes the focal point, here,
we

00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:17.050
place an eyepiece, which then focuses the
light into a magnified image we can see.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.360
Though usually a “star diagonal” is placed
here to bounce the light 90

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.300
degrees for more comfortable viewing.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.860
So far so good, right?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.400
A reflector, on the other hand, is often called
a Newtonian telescope.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.360
These can be mounted on equatorial or Dobsonian
mounts.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.370
And yes, this type of telescope was named
after Isaac Newton, who first came up with

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.940
this telescope concept.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.640
As the name implies, light is reflected off
of a mirror in this kind of telescope, usually

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.070
placed at the bottom of a tube.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.240
As
it is reflected, it is towards a focal point

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.060
as well, but note where that happens: Near
the top of the tube!

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.110
That makes it hard to place an eyepiece there,
as both the focuser and your head would

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.190
block incoming light.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.989
So a reflector uses a “Secondary mirror”
- a small, diagonally-shaped flat mirror to

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.360
bounce the light out the side of the tube,
like this, where it enters the focuser and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.710
reaches the eyepiece.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.680
The third type of telescope is a compound
telescope, or catadioptric.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.680
“Cat-a-what?”

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.890
I know, that's a big word: It means, “an
optical system that involves both the reflecting

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.310
and refracting of
light, in order to reduce aberration.”

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.201
So this Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, for
example, utilizes a “Corrector lens” on

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:45.630
the front of the telescope, a strongly curved
primary mirror at the back,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.560
and then another outwardly curved mirror in
the middle of the corrector lens before light

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.090
finally goes through the center of the back
of the telescope to the eyepiece.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.180
It basically can take a very
long focal-length light path, and “fold”

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.220
it into a shorter tube.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.190
There are other versions of catadioptric scopes,
Schmidt-Cassegrains and Maksutov-Cassegrains

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.490
being the most prominent amateur types
available.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:23.260
Let's take a 
quick overview of the strengths and weaknesses

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.910
of each:

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.209
For refractors, here are some advantages:
Unobstructed design and ease of manufacture

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.700
allows for theoretically better optical quality
Eyepiece location is convenient in smaller

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.330
models
Tend to be portable in apertures of 100 mm

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.959
or less and are easy to aim

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.630
Some disadvantages include
Chromatic abberation in achromats, where not

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.340
all wavelenghts of light focus in the same
place

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:00.510
Apochromatic designs, though overcoming chromatic
aberration, are usually 3 to 5 times as expensive

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.630
In longer focal lengths, the long tubes can
sway in wind or on inexpensive mounts

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.420
Larger models place eyepiece uncomfortably
low

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.970
Reflectors have their own set of advantages:
No chromatic aberration

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.859
Easier and less expensive to make in larger
apertures

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.759
Faster focal ratio systems provide wide fields
of view

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:31.749
Light grasp in larger models is excellent
Cost per inch of aperture is best

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:36.400
But they also have their drawbacks:
The optical aberration “coma” occurs in

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.599
faster models, unless specialized eyepieces
or correctors are used

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.279
Light loss due to multiple mirrors is greater
than refractors

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:52.330
Central obstruction due to secondary mirror
can cause diffraction and contrast loss

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.879
Larger models can be bulky and heavy
Eyepiece can be in awkward positions

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.490
Catadioptrics, likewise, have pluses and minuses.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.990
On the plus side, they

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.110
Have reduce optical aberrations to minimal
levels

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.139
Provide good light gathering power
Eyepiece generally in very convenient location

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.210
Offer excellent portability

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.599
On the downsides, cats are
The most expensive per inch of aperture

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.749
Have the greatest light loss due to multiple
lenses and mirrors

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:30.270
Often have the largest central obsctruction
Tube currents due to sealed systems can cause

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.279
poor images before fully cooled to outdoor
temperatures

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:35.279
So that is a quick look at the three major
types of telescopes, and some of their better

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.279
features and downsides.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.740
Now let's look at some other aspects of telescopes;
in part two of this series,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.680
I'll talk about magnification and focal ratio.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.219
Or if you're ready to see what's up in the
night sky, see the weekly night sky videos

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.169
Thanks for watching; I hope that
has provided you with a good overview of the

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.699
types of telescopes used for amateur astronomy.

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.849
Keep your eyes on the sky and your outdoor
lights aimed down, so we can all see, what's

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:02.869
up.
