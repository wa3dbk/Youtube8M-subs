00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.799
 Sabine Spitz first still congratulations for the Olympic victory 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.839
 Today was a German championship think a last race 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.550
 This ultimately came about that we retired 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.230
 The Arge is ultimately to get in the face so immensely so that's true 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.630
 of course, now percent 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.890
 I also Merck have that is a fine so the motivation and the air 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.700
 out is under 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.980
 yes or no also doctors it will come so also to factors to it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 Two rounds but Hey boss I cheers eichi was a big round 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.680
 the other point, which I also consider the percent empty and know to redeem from 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380
 the organization 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.480
 around which, perhaps a bit unfortunate, the start times chosen 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.230
 so has 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.640
 burning mattress he should fall under the championship should again 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.080
 Women also percentages half an hour 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.250
 especially men died with it also because there is no danger 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.430
 the scratching the tip then give it where it mixes with the men then 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.080
 and Percent is maybe NeuchÃ¢tel 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.210
 so we have weird 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.310
 that one simply stops the women against women and not 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.499
 necessarily as the wife to Angola sit with both men in the back 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.940
 happy to say that in this will Brandau and something 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
 Pat may have let go of a teammate 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 has you then the insight now taken the last motivation 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 the closer you get to Nantes, you will surely catch us 9 2% 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.710
 Get harsh, too 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.870
 Roll Barak 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.770
 I know what I do first as a simple trip so you keep food 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.850
 percent 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.410
 for marathon weather bed second cost control race would have been 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.109
 on Wednesday it will be very close to counting for two hours of racing 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.450
 Legacy had no problem with it 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.300
 but we also want to defend the event so Zeger beetle is the same 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.730
 Round again questions 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.300
 I think he just times these points of performance to ten percent 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.000
 the motivation left successes afterwards 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 after the Olympics is almost a percent media marathon and then to 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.519
 almost a double start every weekend 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.040
 Bayern just do not do anything now because even the head empty what you 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.029
 can say 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.569
 Everything achieves what you wanted to achieve this year that was Wagner 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.739
 good try it works right here is not so tragic 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.130
 Well, actually, it's already clear now in the air it's in advance and me 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.989
 I already have the slogan the whole week 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.199
 Okafor manages this one race under a steady or Speier Schorlau 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.249
 Torrent the 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.249
 yes I have so that one has only in 2 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.799
 but these would increase the thesis trip after the race show an animal 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.629
 as against fevered and 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.679
 that's why it's not so tragic for me 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.220
 how nice is different Anja Gradel 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.690
 the junior riders in the Baldham team won the bronze medal today 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.969
 Has 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.409
 on 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.599
 than it was that the year by rather not already today went very well 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.430
 he should be 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.719
 that has won the big one here now 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.339
 I expect that because they rule the last race already 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.489
 has shown 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.110
 at the World Cup Final in Schladming and also last weekend at the 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.180
 bundesliga-finale in Bad Salzdetfurthth that will also have potential and 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.800
 that Dr on the pension so far 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.950
 I think next year, too, a tear down on Yaris can see 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.590
 To see Thomas von Antje rolling it is motivated but a Serb in the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.739
 Mixed AK better 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.920
 I am a very good person as far as you are concerned 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:40.639
 then I say thank you and wish you a relaxing holiday 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.129
 league
