do<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:30.179> look<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.929> lines<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.769> car

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
do just look at the lines on this car

do just look at the lines on this car
this<00:00:32.700> thing<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.149> extremely<00:00:33.570> aerodynamic

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
this thing is extremely aerodynamic

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.560 
this thing is extremely aerodynamic
looking<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> American<00:00:35.940> ones<00:00:36.120> are<00:00:36.300> too

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
looking which the American ones are too

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.750 
looking which the American ones are too
but<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.230> got<00:00:37.380> lines<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.980> creases<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
but it's got lines and creases on it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.600 
but it's got lines and creases on it
that<00:00:39.030> suggests<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.260> lot<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:40.950> speed<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that suggests a lot more speed and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.970 
that suggests a lot more speed and
competition<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.809> car<00:00:43.050> than<00:00:43.559> anything

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
competition in this car than anything

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.970 
competition in this car than anything
that<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.340> stateside<00:00:45.649> what<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> especially

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that we see stateside what I especially

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.090 
that we see stateside what I especially
like<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.820> car<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:49.200> designed<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
like about this car is it's designed to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
look like a coupe even though it's a

look like a coupe even though it's a
five-door<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> hatchback<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.610> what

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
five-door it's a hatchback and what

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.569 
five-door it's a hatchback and what
they've<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:54.780> done<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.860> hide<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
they've really done is is hide the

they've really done is is hide the
second<00:00:56.969> door<00:00:57.149> into<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> styling<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.530> well

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
second door into the styling really well

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.729 
second door into the styling really well
one<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> ways<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.809> door<00:01:01.050> opening

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
one of the ways is that the door opening

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.250 
one of the ways is that the door opening
is<00:01:01.949> hidden<00:01:02.640> real<00:01:02.879> well<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.899> daylight

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
is hidden real well in the daylight

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.289 
is hidden real well in the daylight
opening<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> car<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> then<00:01:06.030> they've<00:01:06.150> done

opening of the car and then they've done

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.990 
opening of the car and then they've done
a<00:01:06.330> great<00:01:06.540> job<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:07.200> hiding<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.860> door<00:01:08.369> handle

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a great job of hiding the door handle

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 
a great job of hiding the door handle
right<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.500> notice

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
