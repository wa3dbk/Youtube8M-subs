00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
that the precipitation will probably be

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.030 
that the precipitation will probably be
rain<00:04:00.510> much<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.989> tuesday<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:02.480> as<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:04.040> gets

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
rain much of tuesday but as that gets

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.039 
rain much of tuesday but as that gets
reinforced<00:04:05.609> we'll<00:04:06.269> probably<00:04:06.599> see<00:04:07.019> a

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
reinforced we'll probably see a

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.449 
reinforced we'll probably see a
changeover<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:09.030> snow<00:04:09.650> Tuesday<00:04:10.650> night<00:04:10.829> or<00:04:11.040> very

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
changeover to snow Tuesday night or very

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.430 
changeover to snow Tuesday night or very

early Wednesday morning but a very brief

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.770 
early Wednesday morning but a very brief
changeover<00:04:14.269> primarily<00:04:15.269> because<00:04:15.479> there's

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
changeover primarily because there's

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.080 
changeover primarily because there's
just<00:04:16.019> not<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.380> much<00:04:16.739> moisture<00:04:17.039> in<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.909> upper

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
just not that much moisture in the upper

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.449 
just not that much moisture in the upper
atmosphere<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.840> Wednesday<00:04:19.289> we<00:04:19.530> stay<00:04:19.829> dry<00:04:20.430> but

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
we stay cold you can see the troughs

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.659 
we stay cold you can see the troughs
still<00:04:22.800> over<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.130> eastern<00:04:23.400> half<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.580> the

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
country and we certainly stay that way

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.980 
country and we certainly stay that way
on<00:04:25.669> Thursday<00:04:26.669> with<00:04:26.700> some<00:04:27.090> reinforcements<00:04:27.870> you

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
can see a trough coming through

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.820 
can see a trough coming through
a<00:04:29.400> little<00:04:30.300> short<00:04:30.720> wave<00:04:30.870> coming<00:04:31.169> through<00:04:31.530> East

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
a little short wave coming through East

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.330 
a little short wave coming through East
Texas<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:34.020> could<00:04:34.440> play<00:04:34.710> some<00:04:35.010> mischief

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
Texas and that could play some mischief

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.740 
Texas and that could play some mischief
in<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.520> Gulf<00:04:35.790> but<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:36.090> looks<00:04:36.240> like<00:04:36.330> it'll<00:04:36.600> be<00:04:36.720> a

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
in the Gulf but it looks like it'll be a

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.439 
in the Gulf but it looks like it'll be a
little<00:04:36.930> too<00:04:37.139> far<00:04:37.380> south<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:38.100> give<00:04:39.090> any

little too far south to give any

mischief to the southeastern US that
zips<00:04:43.080> along<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.710> very<00:04:43.979> fast<00:04:44.370> flow<00:04:44.729> is<00:04:45.030> we<00:04:45.360> have

zips along the very fast flow is we have

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.590 
zips along the very fast flow is we have
here<00:04:45.810> on<00:04:45.930> Friday<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:48.800> with<00:04:49.800> with<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.639> fast

River<00:04:55.470> Valley<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:56.160> will<00:04:56.310> give<00:04:56.460> them<00:04:56.699> some

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
River Valley that will give them some

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
still you you can see the long wave

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.550 
still you you can see the long wave
trough<00:05:06.240> carved<00:05:06.630> out<00:05:06.750> of<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.900> eastern<00:05:07.229> half<00:05:07.470> of

the country and it looks like we should
be<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.780> dry<00:05:10.260> with<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.889> surface<00:05:11.190> high<00:05:11.520> centered

Mississippi by the way I did want to
show<00:05:17.250> one<00:05:17.669> quick<00:05:18.000> thing<00:05:18.030> here<00:05:18.479> this<00:05:18.690> is<00:05:18.870> the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
show one quick thing here this is the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.340 
show one quick thing here this is the
model<00:05:19.650> sounding<00:05:20.130> for<00:05:20.690> Monday<00:05:21.690> afternoon

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
model sounding for Monday afternoon

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.060

around 6pm for Birmingham and certainly

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.550 
around 6pm for Birmingham and certainly
would<00:05:26.490> indicate<00:05:26.789> a<00:05:27.270> small<00:05:27.840> chance<00:05:28.110> for<00:05:28.229> rain

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
would indicate a small chance for rain

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.860 
would indicate a small chance for rain
as<00:05:28.800> well<00:05:29.039> as<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.520> fact<00:05:29.699> that<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.690> atmosphere

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
as well as the fact that the atmosphere

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.520 
as well as the fact that the atmosphere
is<00:05:31.229> just<00:05:31.410> going<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.560> be<00:05:31.620> too<00:05:31.979> warm<00:05:32.880> for

look at this pattern I mean first of all

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.159 
look at this pattern I mean first of all
the<00:05:52.800> big<00:05:53.220> trough<00:05:53.580> remains<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.750> long<00:05:54.930> wave

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
the big trough remains the long wave

the country and then when you go out and

that's the second of februari if you go

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.120 
that's the second of februari if you go

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
out to the sixth of februari you can see

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.890 
out to the sixth of februari you can see
that<00:06:11.400> there's<00:06:11.639> just<00:06:11.849> simply<00:06:12.030> no<00:06:12.389> change<00:06:12.780> to

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
that there's just simply no change to

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.279 
that there's just simply no change to
that<00:06:13.229> overall<00:06:14.039> pattern<00:06:14.610> with<00:06:15.510> this<00:06:15.720> very<00:06:15.900> fast

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
that overall pattern with this very fast

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.290 
that overall pattern with this very fast
flow<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:16.950> short<00:06:17.430> wave<00:06:17.580> troughs<00:06:17.910> moving

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
flow and short wave troughs moving

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.420 
flow and short wave troughs moving
through<00:06:18.479> the<00:06:18.539> flow<00:06:18.870> so<00:06:19.710> it's<00:06:19.889> the<00:06:20.010> timing<00:06:20.340> of

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
through the flow so it's the timing of

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.850 
through the flow so it's the timing of
those<00:06:20.610> that's<00:06:20.940> going<00:06:21.479> to<00:06:21.570> be<00:06:21.720> critical<00:06:22.200> to<00:06:22.500> any

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
those that's going to be critical to any

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.740 
those that's going to be critical to any
kind<00:06:23.160> of<00:06:23.250> forecast<00:06:23.700> but<00:06:23.880> at<00:06:24.030> least<00:06:24.180> i<00:06:24.450> think

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
kind of forecast but at least i think

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.570 
kind of forecast but at least i think
the<00:06:24.990> GFS<00:06:25.380> probably<00:06:25.710> has<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:26.039> right<00:06:26.250> trend

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
the GFS probably has the right trend

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.360 
the GFS probably has the right trend
here<00:06:26.880> and<00:06:27.030> certainly<00:06:27.690> no<00:06:28.229> indication<00:06:29.190> that

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
here and certainly no indication that

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.730 
here and certainly no indication that
the<00:06:29.820> cold<00:06:30.120> is<00:06:30.510> going<00:06:30.810> to<00:06:30.900> be<00:06:30.960> gone<00:06:31.139> anytime

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
the cold is going to be gone anytime

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.529 
the cold is going to be gone anytime
