the<00:01:39.689> only<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.700> bad<00:01:41.700> con<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.720> across

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
in some other videos that it does make

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.230 
in some other videos that it does make
your<00:01:54.420> skin<00:01:54.750> break<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.369> yeah<00:01:56.969> see

like<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:58.049> big<00:01:58.880> sit<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.509> have

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
like I have one big sit right here have

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.609 
like I have one big sit right here have
a<00:02:00.920> couple<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> reason<00:02:04.439> why

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
a couple here but I think the reason why

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.900 
a couple here but I think the reason why
it<00:02:04.979> makes<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.640> works<00:02:05.850> out<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
it makes you works out is because of the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.490 
it makes you works out is because of the
biotin<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.509> I've<00:02:09.690> heard<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:09.959> bounce<00:02:10.319> is

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
biotin because I've heard that bounce is

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.340 
biotin because I've heard that bounce is
like<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> really

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
like a really
