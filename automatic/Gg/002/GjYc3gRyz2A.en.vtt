these I have a tape measure in hand here

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.040 
these I have a tape measure in hand here
they're<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:25.920> gonna<00:00:26.039> be<00:00:26.189> wide<00:00:26.369> enough<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
they're not gonna be wide enough for a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.749 
they're not gonna be wide enough for a
typical<00:00:28.439> wheelchair<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:30.500> one<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> those

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
typical wheelchair but one of those

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
typical wheelchair but one of those
mobile<00:00:32.759> portable<00:00:33.270> ones<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.660> squeeze<00:00:33.899> up<00:00:34.079> or

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
something like that you could probably

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
something like that you could probably
get<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.500> okay<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:39.239> actual<00:00:39.510> doorway<00:00:39.930> has

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
get in there okay the actual doorway has

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.720 
get in there okay the actual doorway has
over<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:41.309> over<00:00:41.629> 24<00:00:42.629> inches<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:43.020> width<00:00:43.730> I'm

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
over just over 24 inches of width I'm

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.690 
over just over 24 inches of width I'm
going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> door<00:00:45.930> jamb<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.950> door<00:00:47.129> lock<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
going to the door jamb the door lock and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:57.780 
going to the door jamb the door lock and
here<00:00:48.149> yeah<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.170> it's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.340 

so<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.910> average<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.810> doors<00:01:00.020> on<00:01:00.230> these

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
so the average the the doors on these

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.470 
so the average the the doors on these
have<00:01:00.770> about<00:01:01.280> twenty<00:01:01.700> four<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.970> half<00:01:02.030> inches

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
of usable width which pretty much

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.770 
of usable width which pretty much
mirrors<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.250> floor<00:01:07.520> opening<00:01:07.940> here<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.390> lower

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
mirrors the floor opening here the lower

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:18.010 
mirrors the floor opening here the lower
pan<00:01:14.680> yeah<00:01:15.680> I'm<00:01:15.800> getting<00:01:16.010> about<00:01:16.100> 25<00:01:16.910> 26<00:01:17.660> inches

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.740 
pan yeah I'm getting about 25 26 inches
here<00:01:18.259> on<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.680> floor<00:01:18.920> width<00:01:19.509> so<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.540> good

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
here on the floor width so the good

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.540 
here on the floor width so the good
thing<00:01:20.930> about<00:01:20.960> these<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.680> they're<00:01:22.220> lower

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
thing about these is the they're lower

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.830 
thing about these is the they're lower
to<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.759> ground<00:01:22.790> than<00:01:23.180> anything<00:01:23.450> else<00:01:23.720> you

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
to the ground than anything else you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.170 
to the ground than anything else you
want<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.500> don't<00:01:25.490> even<00:01:25.670> think<00:01:25.820> that's<00:01:26.030> a

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
want I don't even think that's a

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.120 
want I don't even think that's a
footstep<00:01:26.690> up<00:01:26.900> smack<00:01:27.619> fact<00:01:27.800> what<00:01:27.950> am<00:01:28.040> i

measuring<00:01:32.470> all<00:01:33.470> right<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:34.039> bottom<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
measuring all right the bottom of the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.120 
measuring all right the bottom of the
vehicle<00:01:35.720> is<00:01:36.080> ten<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:36.410> a<00:01:36.470> half<00:01:36.590> inches<00:01:36.770> from

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
vehicle is ten and a half inches from

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.999 
vehicle is ten and a half inches from
the<00:01:37.220> ground<00:01:37.460> at<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> doorway<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.800> step

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
the ground at the doorway and the step

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.430 
the ground at the doorway and the step
up<00:01:40.190> looks<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.460> be<00:01:40.550> about<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:40.729> don't<00:01:41.149> know

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
up looks to be about I don't know

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:50.320 
up looks to be about I don't know
thirteen<00:01:42.440> inches<00:01:45.220> so<00:01:48.940> being<00:01:49.940> close<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.240> the

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
thirteen inches so being close to the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.790 
thirteen inches so being close to the
ground<00:01:50.450> probably<00:01:50.930> makes<00:01:51.080> access<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
ground probably makes access to the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.540 
ground probably makes access to the
doorway<00:01:51.950> easier<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:53.450> door<00:01:53.600> itself<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.080> about

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
doorway easier the door itself is about

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.160 
doorway easier the door itself is about
24<00:01:55.550> inches<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.270> usable<00:01:56.690> space<00:01:56.780> with<00:01:58.840> now<00:01:59.840> there

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
24 inches of usable space with now there

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.170 
24 inches of usable space with now there
is<00:02:00.289> room<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.560> make<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.920> bigger<00:02:01.190> door<00:02:01.400> I<00:02:04.180> don't

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
is room to make a bigger door I don't

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.240 
is room to make a bigger door I don't
know<00:02:05.360> how<00:02:05.900> that<00:02:05.960> would<00:02:06.170> be<00:02:06.200> done<00:02:06.320> but

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
know how that would be done but

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.509 
know how that would be done but
basically<00:02:07.909> take<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.840> old<00:02:09.259> door<00:02:09.470> off<00:02:09.649> cut<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
basically take the old door off cut the

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.610 
basically take the old door off cut the
hole<00:02:10.640> bigger<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.000> put<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> big<00:02:11.480> door<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:11.870> or<00:02:12.590> a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
hole bigger and put a big door on or a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.220 
hole bigger and put a big door on or a
double<00:02:13.040> door<00:02:13.190> or<00:02:13.790> whatever

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
double door or whatever

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.300 
double door or whatever
now<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.380> one's<00:02:15.590> been<00:02:15.769> modified<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> little

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
now this one's been modified a little

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.170 
now this one's been modified a little
bit<00:02:17.320> most<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.530> lisara's<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.130> look<00:02:19.280> at<00:02:19.459> are

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
bit most of the lisara's you look at are

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.630 
bit most of the lisara's you look at are
gonna<00:02:20.390> have<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.660> sink<00:02:21.620> right<00:02:22.100> here<00:02:22.160> by<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.489> door

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
gonna have a sink right here by the door

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.170 
gonna have a sink right here by the door
and<00:02:23.590> it'll<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.680> real<00:02:24.829> narrow<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.519> walk<00:02:25.700> back<00:02:26.000> to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
and it'll be real narrow to walk back to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.300 
and it'll be real narrow to walk back to
the<00:02:26.329> bench

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the bench

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.590 
the bench
this<00:02:28.310> one<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.700> sinks<00:02:28.940> not<00:02:29.060> there<00:02:29.239> anymore<00:02:29.420> is

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
this one the sinks not there anymore is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.670 
this one the sinks not there anymore is
my<00:02:29.630> rack<00:02:29.870> there's<00:02:30.049> really<00:02:30.140> there's<00:02:30.470> nothing

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
my rack there's really there's nothing

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.890 
my rack there's really there's nothing
there<00:02:31.040> that's<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.610> way<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.780> could

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
there that's in the way so you could

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.500 
there that's in the way so you could
easily<00:02:33.019> take<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.680> its<00:02:33.890> box<00:02:34.190> out<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.700> then<00:02:35.420> you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
easily take of its box out and then you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.890 
easily take of its box out and then you
have<00:02:35.540> room<00:02:35.810> inside<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:37.730> move<00:02:37.820> around<00:02:38.000> and

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
have room inside to move around and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.420 
have room inside to move around and
normally<00:02:39.500> there's<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.709> second<00:02:40.040> row<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.160> seats

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
normally there's a second row of seats

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.610 
normally there's a second row of seats
here<00:02:40.640> too<00:02:40.880> these<00:02:41.690> have<00:02:41.840> obviously<00:02:42.140> been<00:02:42.320> taken

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
here too these have obviously been taken

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.340 
here too these have obviously been taken
out<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.239> person<00:02:44.510> wanted<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.019> or<00:02:45.230> needed

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
out and if a person wanted to or needed

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.830 
out and if a person wanted to or needed
to<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:46.250> could<00:02:46.370> also<00:02:46.519> extend<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.239> floor<00:02:47.480> out

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
to you could also extend the floor out

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.699 
to you could also extend the floor out
for<00:02:48.620> instance<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.840> was<00:02:51.019> just<00:02:51.170> kind<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.500> give

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
for instance this was just kind of give

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.690 
for instance this was just kind of give
an<00:02:51.829> example<00:02:52.360> if<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.540> needed<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:55.430> can<00:02:55.579> make

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
an example if you needed to you can make

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.470 
an example if you needed to you can make
the<00:02:55.850> floor<00:02:56.890> make<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.040> into<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> step<00:02:58.700> up<00:02:58.910> to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
the floor make that into a step up to

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.509 
the floor make that into a step up to
the<00:03:00.019> floor<00:03:00.260> which<00:03:00.470> will<00:03:00.650> be<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.890> same<00:03:01.160> all<00:03:01.489> the

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
the floor which will be the same all the

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.340 
the floor which will be the same all the
way<00:03:01.640> throughout<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.850> that's<00:03:05.030> something<00:03:05.350> to

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
way throughout so that's something to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.009 
way throughout so that's something to
ponder<00:03:06.760> or<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:08.120> can<00:03:08.269> even<00:03:08.359> get<00:03:08.720> rid<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
ponder or you can even get rid of the

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.250 
ponder or you can even get rid of the
step

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
step

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.110 
step
now<00:03:10.800> let's<00:03:11.069> just<00:03:11.220> arcing<00:03:11.580> out<00:03:11.670> quite<00:03:11.940> right

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
now let's just arcing out quite right

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.850 
now let's just arcing out quite right
but<00:03:12.360> put<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.110> floor<00:03:13.319> all<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.590> way<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.709> the

don't know if you take that chair out

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.720 
don't know if you take that chair out
it'd<00:03:36.180> be<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.329> tight<00:03:36.569> fit<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.930> get<00:03:37.019> in<00:03:37.170> there<00:03:37.730> and

it'd be a tight fit to get in there and
you<00:03:39.150> also<00:03:39.329> have<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.970> seat<00:03:42.180> belt<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:43.099> parking

probably wouldn't need the seat belts
right<00:04:23.820> or<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:24.930> get<00:04:25.080> seatbelts<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.590> bolt<00:04:25.770> to
