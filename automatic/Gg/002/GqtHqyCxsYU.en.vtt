is this one of the other things you will
have<00:00:16.020> seen<00:00:16.260> with<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.369> light<00:00:17.880> pad<00:00:18.300> kit<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
have seen with the light pad kit is

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720 
have seen with the light pad kit is
these<00:00:19.320> things<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.800> these<00:00:19.980> are<00:00:20.400> called

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
these things and these are called

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.220 
these things and these are called
honeycomb<00:00:21.570> grits

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
honeycomb grits

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.779 
honeycomb grits
what<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.010> put<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.369> light<00:00:23.519> pads

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
what you do is you put on the light pads

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.700 
what you do is you put on the light pads
and<00:00:24.180> they're<00:00:24.539> quite<00:00:24.689> easy<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.170> put<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.500> that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and they're quite easy to put like that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
and they're quite easy to put like that
once<00:00:25.980> you've<00:00:26.130> done<00:00:26.279> what<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.240> help

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
once you've done what it is they help

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.750 
once you've done what it is they help
focus<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> light<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.859> know<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.550> light

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
focus the light so just know the light

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.609 
focus the light so just know the light
all<00:00:29.939> those<00:00:30.090> quite<00:00:30.660> directional<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.380> still

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
all those quite directional is still

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.620 
all those quite directional is still
kind<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.219> all<00:00:32.399> over<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> place<00:00:32.790> once

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
kind of going all over the place once

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.620 
kind of going all over the place once
you<00:00:33.870> put<00:00:34.800> these<00:00:35.070> little<00:00:35.399> bits<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.790> there<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
you put these little bits in there and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.060 
you put these little bits in there and
just<00:00:37.320> slot<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> side<00:00:40.430> like<00:00:41.430> that

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
just slot it in to the side like that

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.430 
just slot it in to the side like that
no<00:00:44.070> much<00:00:44.489> more<00:00:44.899> directional<00:00:45.899> light<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
no much more directional light this is

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.889 
no much more directional light this is
you<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> good<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> back<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you the good for the back here like and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.750 
you the good for the back here like and
obviously<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.800> any<00:00:50.010> spill<00:00:50.489> lights

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
obviously you don't get any spill lights

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.880 
obviously you don't get any spill lights
going<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.930> background<00:00:52.199> over<00:00:52.620> your

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
going on in the background over your

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.459 
going on in the background over your
image<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.699> far<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.480> look<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:54.989> an

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
image here so far if we look at an

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.529 
image here so far if we look at an
example<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.039> tell<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.360> look

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
example we tell that like we just look

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.360 
example we tell that like we just look
at<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.840> example<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> background<00:00:59.160> I'm

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
at this example on the background I'm

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.750 
at this example on the background I'm
going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> take<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> off<00:01:01.520> you'll<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
going to take it off you'll see the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
going to take it off you'll see the
light<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.120> much<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:04.080> dispersed<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
light is much more dispersed and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.730 
light is much more dispersed and
covering<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> much<00:01:05.640> larger<00:01:06.090> area<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:07.320> this

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
covering a much larger area so now this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
covering a much larger area so now this
is<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> gridview<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.360> unless<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
is it with the gridview on unless you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.289 
is it with the gridview on unless you
can<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> length<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:10.799> more

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
can see the length is much more

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
can see the length is much more
concentrated<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.720> after<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.560> great

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
concentrated so after the great

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.230 
concentrated so after the great
honeycomb<00:01:14.400> grid<00:01:14.610> these<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:14.909> pretty<00:01:15.060> common

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
honeycomb grid these are pretty common

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.050 
honeycomb grid these are pretty common
you<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.530> spot<00:01:17.159> light<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:17.610> obviously<00:01:17.909> with

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you get a spot light now obviously with

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
you get a spot light now obviously with
these<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.659> lights<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.470> can't<00:01:19.830> zoom<00:01:20.009> in

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
these these lights you can't zoom in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
these these lights you can't zoom in
like<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.939> flashes<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.140> some<00:01:22.409> kind

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
like you can flashes or with some kind

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.350 
like you can flashes or with some kind
of<00:01:22.619> studio<00:01:22.890> light<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.240> they

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of studio light you get for what they

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
of studio light you get for what they
give<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.560> called<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
give you is this and this is called the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.560 
give you is this and this is called the
fool<00:01:29.820> spot<00:01:30.600> lands<00:01:31.500> he<00:01:32.250> looks<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
fool spot lands he looks it go what is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.390 
fool spot lands he looks it go what is
this<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> looks<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.860> mirror

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
this a looks like just kind of a mirror

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.060 
this a looks like just kind of a mirror
or<00:01:35.729> something<00:01:36.079> very<00:01:37.079> hard<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.500> tell<00:01:37.680> there's<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
or something very hard to tell there's a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.969 
or something very hard to tell there's a
particular<00:01:38.540> side<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> put<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.290> what<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
particular side that you put in what it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
particular side that you put in what it
does<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.520> focuses<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.720> light<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.380> there's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
does is it focuses the light so there's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.200 
does is it focuses the light so there's
no<00:01:43.619> point

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
no point

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.990 
no point
at<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.570> camera<00:01:44.960> just<00:01:45.170> know<00:01:45.290> slide<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:46.400> what

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
at the camera just know slide it in what

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.340 
at the camera just know slide it in what
will<00:01:47.150> happen<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.479> we'll<00:01:47.570> look<00:01:47.630> at<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.140> light

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
will happen is we'll look at the light

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.660 
will happen is we'll look at the light
actually<00:01:48.950> get<00:01:49.100> greater<00:01:51.190> what<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.490> do<00:01:52.610> is

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
actually get greater what you do is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.609 
actually get greater what you do is
let's<00:01:52.909> just<00:01:53.030> focusing<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.020> light<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.530> a

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
let's just focusing the light in a

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.770 
let's just focusing the light in a
particular<00:01:54.920> direction<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.940> again<00:01:56.119> I'll<00:01:56.540> show

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
particular direction so again I'll show

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.170 
particular direction so again I'll show
you<00:01:56.990> against<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.650> wall<00:01:57.830> here<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:58.400> now<00:01:58.790> look<00:01:59.060> at

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
you against the wall here so now look at

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.609 
you against the wall here so now look at
that<00:01:59.360> looks<00:01:59.780> like<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.110> light<00:02:00.380> has<00:02:00.590> been

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
that looks like the light has been

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.820 
that looks like the light has been
focused<00:02:01.460> it's<00:02:01.729> almost<00:02:01.940> like<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.240> been

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
focused it's almost like it's been
