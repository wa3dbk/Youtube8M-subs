when<00:01:31.070> we<00:01:31.160> first<00:01:31.430> bought<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:31.850> house<00:01:32.090> we

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
when we first bought this house we

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.810 
when we first bought this house we

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
wanted to restore it back to the way it

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.180 
wanted to restore it back to the way it
might<00:01:35.180> have<00:01:35.300> looked<00:01:35.450> 200<00:01:35.900> years<00:01:36.110> ago<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.070> my

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
might have looked 200 years ago so my

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.980 
might have looked 200 years ago so my
wife<00:01:37.340> researched<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.210> she<00:01:38.420> had<00:01:38.570> found<00:01:38.810> out

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
wife researched and she had found out

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.170 
wife researched and she had found out
that<00:01:39.020> in<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.530> time<00:01:39.800> period<00:01:40.100> they<00:01:40.820> used<00:01:41.030> to

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
that in that time period they used to

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.080 
that in that time period they used to
use<00:01:41.360> for<00:01:41.390> cloths<00:01:42.080> on<00:01:42.350> floors<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.670> didn't

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.940 
researched and I guess what she said
they<00:01:47.390> were<00:01:47.420> were<00:01:47.840> at<00:01:48.080> that<00:01:48.200> time<00:01:48.259> work<00:01:48.710> on

pattern<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:23.900> probably<00:04:24.350> would<00:04:24.470> have<00:04:24.530> been

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
pattern this probably would have been

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.890 
pattern this probably would have been
found<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:25.100> living<00:04:25.370> rooms<00:04:25.610> in<00:04:26.000> the

seventh late 1700s well but my favorite

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.840 
seventh late 1700s well but my favorite
part<00:04:32.960> of<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.169> is<00:04:33.290> painting<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:34.010> but<00:04:34.550> then<00:04:34.700> it's

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
part of it is painting it but then it's

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.700 
part of it is painting it but then it's
putting<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.210> urethane<00:04:35.510> because<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.290> actually

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
putting the urethane because it actually

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.219 
putting the urethane because it actually
when<00:04:36.890> you<00:04:36.980> paint<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.430> it<00:04:37.610> has<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.850> flat<00:04:38.180> look<00:04:38.419> but

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
when you paint it it has a flat look but

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.230 
when you paint it it has a flat look but
it's<00:04:39.410> really<00:04:40.160> nice<00:04:40.340> when<00:04:40.550> you're<00:04:40.700> putting<00:04:41.120> the

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
it's really nice when you're putting the

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.900 
it's really nice when you're putting the
urethane<00:04:41.479> on<00:04:41.750> all<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.110> sudden<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.440> whole

one was on each wall and I didn't bring
any<00:05:18.490> small<00:05:18.760> ones<00:05:18.970> so<00:05:19.060> people<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.480> them<00:05:19.720> and

that they could carry with them home so

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.510 
that they could carry with them home so
that's<00:05:23.230> when<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.500> decided<00:05:23.920> that<00:05:24.040> we<00:05:24.280> did<00:05:24.430> the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520

two by threes and two by sixes and then

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.740 
two by threes and two by sixes and then
I<00:05:26.500> started<00:05:26.830> doing<00:05:27.040> placemats<00:05:27.640> and<00:05:28.090> things

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750

a<00:05:37.690> house<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.260> we<00:05:38.560> can<00:05:38.680> put<00:05:38.830> these<00:05:38.920> down<00:05:39.130> wall

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
a house and we can put these down wall

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.280 
a house and we can put these down wall
to<00:05:39.550> wall<00:05:39.700> as<00:05:39.940> well<00:05:40.180> so<00:05:40.540> we'll<00:05:40.720> take<00:05:40.900> out<00:05:41.110> the

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
to wall as well so we'll take out the

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.140 
to wall as well so we'll take out the
base<00:05:41.440> moldings<00:05:41.980> and<00:05:42.250> then<00:05:42.760> we'll<00:05:42.910> put<00:05:43.120> down

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
base moldings and then we'll put down

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.510 
base moldings and then we'll put down
the<00:05:43.630> floor<00:05:44.560> cloth<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:45.010> then<00:05:45.100> put<00:05:45.280> the<00:05:45.370> base

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
the floor cloth and then put the base

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.010 
the floor cloth and then put the base
moldings<00:05:45.940> back<00:05:46.180> so<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:46.480> actually<00:05:46.660> will<00:05:46.870> look

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
moldings back so it actually will look

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.650 
moldings back so it actually will look
like<00:05:47.170> linoleum<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:48.270> speaking<00:05:49.270> of<00:05:49.360> linoleum

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660
