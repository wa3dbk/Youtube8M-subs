00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 the tip number 9 is last very simple and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.799
 also very common sense and of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.139
 common sense that it would be when one has 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.110
 that make energy other than asking for a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.790
 delivery that ask for food outside that 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.500
 eat elsewhere our house function 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.690
 what to eat outside of our territory 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.930
 out of our place where they do not have 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.289
 the things that we eat try to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.930
 always eat the healthiest option 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.290
 for example if we have to go yes or yes 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.070
 example a restaurant or a defect or a 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.790
 free fork 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.350
 how to get to argentina 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.230
 and they invite us to that you do not have the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.060
 excuse to pay your portion and tell us 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.110
 why 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.470
 excuses you do not have another more than more than 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.140
 they pay you the entrance fee and you have to go 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.050
 a special reason for friends work 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.840
 Whatever 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.110
 whatever it is always tries to look for the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.640
 healthier option and I laugh here because 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.020
 without a leader, it is very difficult to do that 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.650
 that is, there are many delicious things 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.520
 many rich things and very few things that 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.080
 be healthy but good here nothing here 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.590
 nobody said that things were going to be 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.340
 easy 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.359
 at least at the beginning so I 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.520
 I recommend you do that because I know 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.590
 that is not achieved with the strength of 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.009
 will but you have to look for a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.959
 motivation so that our goal 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.890
 always be visible and we always have 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:41.550
 the strength inside us 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.010
 to cover it then always try to 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.950
 look in the house other than manager 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.830
 controller the healthiest option to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.840
 less most of the time that's 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.330
 very good tip for with a good fat in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.640
 this first 8 we are going to talk to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.350
 regarding the team number 7 that was to avoid 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.540
 go out to eat outside if it is unavoidable 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.259
 go out to eat out and still achieve with 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.340
 a healthy option I think if they go 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:12.350
 to the cinema do not buy pochoclos would be everything 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.350
 put 28 gloss since they do not like
