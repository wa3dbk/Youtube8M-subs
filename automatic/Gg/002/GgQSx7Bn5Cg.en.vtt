just lecture on completely balanced and
of<00:02:16.420> course<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.530> real<00:02:17.709> challenge<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:18.160> me

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
of course it's a real challenge to me

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.130 
of course it's a real challenge to me
quadra<00:02:18.880> percent<00:02:19.209> palette<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.720> one<00:02:19.840> hundred

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
quadra percent palette and one hundred

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.870 
quadra percent palette and one hundred
percent<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.950> know<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.280> subtle<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.670> all

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
percent you know it's subtle and all

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.160 
percent you know it's subtle and all
that<00:02:22.030> kind<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:22.269> stuff<00:02:22.360> but<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.750> guess<00:02:22.780> that's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
that kind of stuff but I guess that's

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.839 
that kind of stuff but I guess that's
that's<00:02:23.769> what<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.040> do<00:02:24.220> as<00:02:24.370> writers<00:02:24.819> we

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
that's what we do as writers we

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.729 
that's what we do as writers we
obviously<00:02:25.120> want<00:02:25.450> our<00:02:25.630> muscles<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.290> best

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
obviously want our muscles to be best

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.100 
obviously want our muscles to be best
horses<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.519> that<00:02:28.030> they<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.330> be<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.930> we

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
horses that we that they can be so we

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.390 
horses that we that they can be so we
need<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.410> put<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.620> time<00:02:29.950> pressure<00:02:30.220> on

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
need to put that time pressure on

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.520 
need to put that time pressure on
ourselves<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:31.030> bed<00:02:31.150> both<00:02:31.330> riders<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:32.049> be<00:02:32.260> for

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
ourselves to bed both riders can be for

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.550 
ourselves to bed both riders can be for
them<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.480> yeah<00:02:34.630> that's<00:02:34.750> probably<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.349> first

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
them so yeah that's probably the first

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.589 
them so yeah that's probably the first
thing<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.730> look<00:02:36.910> at<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.120> feedback<00:02:37.450> from

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
thing and you look at the feedback from

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.509 
thing and you look at the feedback from
your<00:02:37.720> horse<00:02:37.959> rather<00:02:38.260> than<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:39.160> know<00:02:39.190> seeing

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
your horse rather than you know seeing

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.819 
your horse rather than you know seeing
if<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.819> did<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:40.959> okay<00:02:41.230> am<00:02:41.440> i<00:02:41.590> holding

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
if you did go okay am i holding

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.000 
if you did go okay am i holding
somewhere<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.760> always<00:02:43.620> collapsed<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.739> little

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
somewhere so I always collapsed a little

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.809 
somewhere so I always collapsed a little
bit<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.609> the<00:02:45.730> right<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.310> could<00:02:48.310> see<00:02:48.609> it

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
bit to the right and you could see it

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.420 
bit to the right and you could see it
because<00:02:49.510> my<00:02:49.750> shoulders<00:02:50.230> work<00:02:50.380> straight<00:02:50.769> so

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
because my shoulders work straight so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.270 
because my shoulders work straight so
you<00:02:52.000> could<00:02:52.239> say<00:02:52.450> our<00:02:53.170> fix<00:02:53.560> up<00:02:53.709> your<00:02:53.799> shoulders

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
you could say our fix up your shoulders

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.879 
you could say our fix up your shoulders
but<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.329> can<00:02:55.480> see<00:02:55.720> I'm<00:02:55.989> still<00:02:56.170> kept<00:02:56.500> my<00:02:56.620> weight

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
but you can see I'm still kept my weight

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.530 
but you can see I'm still kept my weight
on<00:02:57.250> my<00:02:57.370> left<00:02:57.670> side<00:02:57.790> roads<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.239> wasn't

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
on my left side roads that wasn't

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.420 
on my left side roads that wasn't
actually<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> shoulder<00:02:59.410> issue<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.950> was<00:03:00.069> doing

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
actually a shoulder issue it was doing

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.479 
actually a shoulder issue it was doing
from<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:01.060> hip<00:03:01.480> issue<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.650> really<00:03:03.010> really

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
from a hip issue so it's a really really

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.150 
from a hip issue so it's a really really
important<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.269> get<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.810> core<00:03:05.170> issue<00:03:05.680> of

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
important to get to the core issue of

that's normal and you know old people
couldn't<00:05:00.760> do<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.090> thought<00:05:01.240> oh<00:05:01.479> I'll<00:05:01.840> never

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260

couldn't do it I thought oh I'll never
be<00:05:02.650> one<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.830> them<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.970> then<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.150> woke<00:05:04.300> up<00:05:04.419> one

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600

be one of them and then I woke up one
day<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.810> can't<00:05:05.169> do<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.320> anymore<00:05:05.470> how<00:05:06.250> did<00:05:06.520> that

day I can't do it anymore how did that

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.900 
day I can't do it anymore how did that
happen<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:08.830> think<00:05:08.919> it's<00:05:09.190> really<00:05:09.340> important

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910

not very good with my anatomy it's a can

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.600 
not very good with my anatomy it's a can
stream<00:05:20.020> just<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.380> inside<00:05:20.800> of<00:05:20.830> your<00:05:21.040> legs<00:05:21.310> are

going to be you know propping you out up
above<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.770> saddle<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.760> want<00:05:27.910> to<00:05:27.970> be

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
above the saddle and you want to be

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.120 
above the saddle and you want to be
sitting<00:05:28.210> dig<00:05:28.570> into<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.169> saddle<00:05:29.440> you<00:05:29.919> want<00:05:30.070> to

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
sitting dig into the saddle you want to

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.560 
sitting dig into the saddle you want to
make<00:05:30.250> sure<00:05:30.280> that<00:05:30.580> you<00:05:30.640> can<00:05:30.760> really<00:05:31.000> lengthen

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
make sure that you can really lengthen

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.960 
make sure that you can really lengthen
your<00:05:31.720> leg<00:05:31.960> so<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:32.860> don't<00:05:33.070> have<00:05:33.280> a<00:05:33.310> tight<00:05:33.669> I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
your leg so you don't have a tight I

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:34.700 
your leg so you don't have a tight I
think<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:34.390> is

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
think that is

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.770 
think that is
hamstring<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.310> one<00:05:35.460> at<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.670> back<00:05:35.850> because

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
hamstring the one at the back because

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.060 
hamstring the one at the back because
then<00:05:36.960> that's<00:05:37.140> going<00:05:37.350> to<00:05:37.440> be<00:05:37.500> short<00:05:37.680> in<00:05:37.920> your

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
then that's going to be short in your

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.860 
then that's going to be short in your
legs<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.610> having<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.090> know<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.390> drawing<00:05:39.780> the
