that because you want the back side to
print<00:01:02.280> larger<00:01:02.700> than<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> front<00:01:03.630> sides<00:01:03.930> that

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
print larger than the front sides that

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.570 
print larger than the front sides that
you're<00:01:04.379> guaranteed<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> cover<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> whole

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you're guaranteed to cover the whole

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
you're guaranteed to cover the whole
back<00:01:05.759> side<00:01:05.970> when<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.210> print<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:07.079> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
back side when you print this out it's a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.539 
back side when you print this out it's a
little<00:01:07.499> different<00:01:07.679> than<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> mini<00:01:08.249> albums

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
little different than the mini albums

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.770 
little different than the mini albums
that<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.729> did<00:01:08.880> before<00:01:08.999> where<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.749> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that we did before where there is a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.779 
that we did before where there is a
filler<00:01:10.020> page<00:01:10.289> because<00:01:10.679> those<00:01:11.219> filler<00:01:11.520> pages

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
filler page because those filler pages

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.249 
filler page because those filler pages
were<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> lot<00:01:12.119> larger<00:01:12.270> these<00:01:12.719> ones<00:01:12.929> are<00:01:13.079> just

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
were a lot larger these ones are just

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.929 
were a lot larger these ones are just
slightly<00:01:13.469> bigger<00:01:13.920> they're<00:01:14.609> the<00:01:14.729> same<00:01:14.880> size

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
slightly bigger they're the same size

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.789 
slightly bigger they're the same size
they<00:01:15.359> just<00:01:15.539> print<00:01:15.749> slightly<00:01:16.049> bigger<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.560> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
they just print slightly bigger if you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.069 
they just print slightly bigger if you
print<00:01:17.369> them<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> hundred<00:01:17.939> percent<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.810> don't

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
print them at a hundred percent so don't

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.099 
print them at a hundred percent so don't
forget<00:01:19.170> pattern<00:01:20.009> side<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.700> scale<00:01:21.539> to<00:01:21.689> fit<00:01:21.719> on

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
forget pattern side is scale to fit on

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.859 
forget pattern side is scale to fit on
your<00:01:22.409> printer<00:01:22.590> settings<00:01:22.859> and<00:01:23.249> the<00:01:24.240> journaling

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
your printer settings and the journaling

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.349 
your printer settings and the journaling
side<00:01:25.109> is<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.829> be<00:01:26.060> one<00:01:27.060> hundred<00:01:27.179> percent

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
side is going to be one hundred percent

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.819 
side is going to be one hundred percent
so<00:01:27.929> you're<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.289> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> print<00:01:28.679> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so you're just going to print that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.440 
so you're just going to print that
normally<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.789> that'll<00:01:29.969> print<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.179> little<00:01:30.359> bit

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
normally and that'll print a little bit

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.419 
normally and that'll print a little bit
bigger<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.749> that<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.679> prints<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> way<00:01:32.369> to

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
bigger so that it prints all the way to

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:33.770 
bigger so that it prints all the way to
the<00:01:32.639> edge<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.179> finally<00:01:33.359> cut<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.749> that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the edge when you finally cut out that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.660 
the edge when you finally cut out that
pattern<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:35.009> side<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.609> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
pattern so the side that you're going to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
pattern so the side that you're going to
cut<00:01:35.819> out<00:01:35.969> is<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.299> pattern<00:01:36.509> side<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.139> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
cut out is the pattern side and then the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
cut out is the pattern side and then the
back<00:01:37.439> will<00:01:37.679> just<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.979> completely<00:01:38.189> covered<00:01:38.729> by

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
back will just be completely covered by

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.109 
back will just be completely covered by
the<00:01:39.359> pattern<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.340> there's<00:01:41.789> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the pattern and so there's the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.179 
the pattern and so there's the
double-sided<00:01:42.539> prints<00:01:42.990> there's<00:01:43.560> also<00:01:43.770> pockets

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
double-sided prints there's also pockets
