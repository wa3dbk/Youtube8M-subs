like<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.489> they're<00:00:56.420> not<00:00:56.750> necessarily<00:00:57.879> the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
like that they're not necessarily the

best option for pure Street riding and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.340 
best option for pure Street riding and
I'll<00:01:01.520> tell<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:01.730> why<00:01:01.879> number<00:01:02.149> one<00:01:02.270> any<00:01:03.050> knobby

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
I'll tell you why number one any knobby

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.049 
I'll tell you why number one any knobby
is<00:01:03.649> going<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:03.920> be<00:01:04.009> a<00:01:04.039> little<00:01:04.280> bit<00:01:04.369> more<00:01:04.580> noisy

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
is going to be a little bit more noisy

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.120 
is going to be a little bit more noisy
on<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:05.899> road<00:01:06.080> it's<00:01:06.530> also<00:01:06.710> going<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:06.979> wear<00:01:07.100> out

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
on the road it's also going to wear out

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.070 
on the road it's also going to wear out
quite<00:01:07.789> a<00:01:07.820> bit<00:01:08.000> faster<00:01:08.149> than<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.630> traditional

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
quite a bit faster than a traditional

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.510 
quite a bit faster than a traditional
street<00:01:09.890> tire<00:01:10.130> would<00:01:10.690> having<00:01:11.690> said<00:01:12.110> that

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
street tire would having said that

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.830 
street tire would having said that
Continental<00:01:13.520> puts<00:01:14.000> this<00:01:14.149> in<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.390> category<00:01:14.539> of

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
Continental puts this in the category of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.320 
Continental puts this in the category of
40<00:01:15.259> percent<00:01:15.680> on-road<00:01:16.190> sixty<00:01:16.759> percent<00:01:16.970> off

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
40 percent on-road sixty percent off

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.029 
40 percent on-road sixty percent off
road<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:17.840> that<00:01:18.050> right<00:01:18.440> there<00:01:18.619> gives<00:01:18.800> you<00:01:18.920> an

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
road so that right there gives you an

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.480 
road so that right there gives you an
idea<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:19.690> what<00:01:20.690> they're<00:01:21.170> kind<00:01:21.649> of<00:01:21.770> envisioning

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
idea of what they're kind of envisioning

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.070 
idea of what they're kind of envisioning
when<00:01:22.700> they<00:01:22.850> designed<00:01:23.450> these<00:01:23.630> tires<00:01:23.900> they

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
when they designed these tires they

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.630 
when they designed these tires they
actually<00:01:24.380> originally<00:01:24.920> designed<00:01:25.250> these<00:01:25.400> for

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
actually originally designed these for

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.539 
actually originally designed these for
the<00:01:26.229> BMW<00:01:27.229> GS<00:01:27.409> s<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:27.860> they're<00:01:28.009> designed<00:01:28.280> for<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
the BMW GS s so they're designed for the

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.820 
the BMW GS s so they're designed for the
the<00:01:28.970> big<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.750> know<00:01:29.780> dual<00:01:30.080> sport<00:01:30.350> bikes<00:01:30.619> that

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
the big you know dual sport bikes that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.640 
the big you know dual sport bikes that
are<00:01:30.890> going<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.100> be<00:01:31.220> used<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.659> off<00:01:32.869> road<00:01:33.140> and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
are going to be used on and off road and

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.910 
are going to be used on and off road and
they<00:01:34.369> work<00:01:34.549> well<00:01:34.850> for<00:01:35.329> that<00:01:35.390> application

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
they work well for that application

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.469 
they work well for that application
there's<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.189> lot<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.670> different<00:01:38.000> choices<00:01:38.119> when

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
there's a lot of different choices when

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.480 
there's a lot of different choices when
it<00:01:38.540> comes<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.990> dual<00:01:39.170> sports<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.710> any<00:01:40.130> tires

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
it comes to dual sports and any tires

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.160 
it comes to dual sports and any tires
are<00:01:40.729> compromised<00:01:41.150> but<00:01:41.329> dual<00:01:41.659> sport<00:01:41.900> riding

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
are compromised but dual sport riding

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.990 
are compromised but dual sport riding
dual<00:01:42.979> sport<00:01:43.130> tires<00:01:43.400> are<00:01:43.640> probably<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
dual sport tires are probably the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.850 
dual sport tires are probably the
biggest<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.450> most<00:01:44.540> obvious<00:01:45.079> compromises<00:01:45.710> out

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
biggest and most obvious compromises out

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.620 
biggest and most obvious compromises out
there<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.159> have<00:01:46.310> anything<00:01:46.729> from<00:01:46.939> a<00:01:47.210> very

street oriented tire that can handle you

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.690 
street oriented tire that can handle you
know<00:01:51.229> some<00:01:51.439> light<00:01:51.590> off-road<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.310> maybe<00:01:52.520> some

opinion<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.120> t<00:02:11.239> kcat<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.410> one<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.829> best

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
opinion the t kcat is one of the best

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.550 
opinion the t kcat is one of the best
nabis<00:02:13.820> that<00:02:14.269> you<00:02:14.450> can<00:02:14.630> also<00:02:14.870> take<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
nabis that you can also take on the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.009 
nabis that you can also take on the
street<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.670> lot<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.329> more<00:02:17.630> aggressive

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
street a lot of the more aggressive

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.539 
street a lot of the more aggressive
knobby<00:02:18.410> tires<00:02:18.739> are<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.130> be<00:02:19.250> just

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
knobby tires are going to be just

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.479 
knobby tires are going to be just
obnoxiously<00:02:20.269> loud<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.769> street<00:02:22.040> they

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
obnoxiously loud on the street they

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.670 
obnoxiously loud on the street they
don't<00:02:22.519> really<00:02:23.209> feel<00:02:23.510> too<00:02:23.750> confident<00:02:24.260> expect

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
don't really feel too confident expect

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.120 
don't really feel too confident expect
inspiring<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.459> corners<00:02:25.850> on<00:02:26.090> pavement<00:02:26.900> and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
inspiring in the corners on pavement and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.860 
inspiring in the corners on pavement and
they<00:02:28.130> don't<00:02:28.579> last<00:02:28.760> very<00:02:28.910> long<00:02:29.180> on<00:02:29.329> pavement

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
they don't last very long on pavement

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.199 
they don't last very long on pavement
so<00:02:30.260> however<00:02:31.010> they<00:02:31.370> do<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.670> place<00:02:31.879> if

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
so however they do have a place if

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.140 
so however they do have a place if
you're<00:02:32.390> doing<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.500> know<00:02:33.620> 90%<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.430> your<00:02:34.580> riding

anything like that
you<00:03:06.829> know<00:03:06.920> any<00:03:07.790> tire<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.209> going<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.390> tend<00:03:08.540> to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
you know any tire is going to tend to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.120 
you know any tire is going to tend to
want<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.840> pack<00:03:09.049> up<00:03:09.290> with<00:03:09.500> mud<00:03:09.709> which<00:03:09.890> means

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
want to pack up with mud which means

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.949 
want to pack up with mud which means
it's<00:03:10.310> packing<00:03:10.760> in<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.269> taking<00:03:11.690> away<00:03:11.810> all

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
it's packing in and and taking away all

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.330 
it's packing in and and taking away all
your<00:03:12.049> knobs<00:03:12.260> from<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.620> well<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:12.950> tire<00:03:13.190> is

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
your knobs from you well this tire is

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.490 
your knobs from you well this tire is
designed<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:13.819> that<00:03:13.849> if<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.180> get<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.840> RPMs<00:03:15.260> up

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
designed so that if you get the RPMs up

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.960 
designed so that if you get the RPMs up
and<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:15.920> know<00:03:16.040> it'll<00:03:16.340> start<00:03:16.549> flinging<00:03:16.819> that

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
and you know it'll start flinging that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.970 
and you know it'll start flinging that
mud<00:03:17.150> off<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.720> clearing<00:03:18.410> itself<00:03:18.739> out<00:03:18.950> so

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
mud off and and clearing itself out so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.979 
mud off and and clearing itself out so
that<00:03:19.340> these<00:03:19.640> knobs<00:03:19.879> can<00:03:20.090> actually<00:03:20.450> dig<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:20.840> and

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
that these knobs can actually dig in and

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.339 
that these knobs can actually dig in and
get<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:21.470> some<00:03:21.650> traction<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:23.569> front<00:03:23.810> tire<00:03:24.019> if

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
get you some traction the front tire if

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.830 
get you some traction the front tire if
you'll<00:03:24.650> notice<00:03:24.980> has<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.430> much<00:03:25.879> tighter<00:03:26.299> pattern

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
you'll notice has a much tighter pattern

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.110 
you'll notice has a much tighter pattern
with<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.440> nobbies<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:28.010> there's<00:03:28.849> a<00:03:28.910> couple

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
with the nobbies and there's a couple

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.119 
with the nobbies and there's a couple
reasons<00:03:29.360> for<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.720> number<00:03:30.079> one<00:03:30.349> stability

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
reasons for that number one stability

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.009 
reasons for that number one stability
when<00:03:31.519> you're<00:03:31.640> under<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:31.970> under<00:03:32.420> braking<00:03:32.840> or

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
when you're under the under braking or

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.370 
when you're under the under braking or
in<00:03:33.590> cornering<00:03:34.190> nabis<00:03:35.180> really<00:03:35.930> don't<00:03:36.109> feel

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
in cornering nabis really don't feel

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.780 
in cornering nabis really don't feel
good<00:03:36.560> on<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.829> pavement

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
good on the pavement

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.090 
good on the pavement
they<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.480> know<00:03:38.569> especially<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:39.079> it's<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.380> true

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
they you know especially if it's a true

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.569 
they you know especially if it's a true
off-road<00:03:41.260> knobby<00:03:42.260> tire<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.920> lot<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.370> times

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
off-road knobby tire a lot of times

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.430 
off-road knobby tire a lot of times
those<00:03:43.730> knobs<00:03:43.910> are<00:03:44.120> very<00:03:44.440> interspersed

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
those knobs are very interspersed

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.490 
those knobs are very interspersed
there's<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.709> lot<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.549> area<00:03:46.940> between<00:03:47.180> knobs<00:03:47.720> what

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
there's a lot of area between knobs what

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.839 
there's a lot of area between knobs what
that<00:03:48.680> means<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.099> that<00:03:49.220> there's<00:03:49.400> less<00:03:49.549> rubber

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
that means is that there's less rubber

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.490 
that means is that there's less rubber
contacting<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.630> road<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.049> when<00:03:51.139> you're<00:03:51.260> in<00:03:51.380> a

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
contacting the road and when you're in a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.319 
contacting the road and when you're in a
corner<00:03:51.920> those<00:03:52.370> knobs<00:03:52.609> are<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:53.060> know<00:03:53.150> they're

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
corner those knobs are you know they're

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.509 
corner those knobs are you know they're
it's<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.569> soft<00:03:53.810> rubber<00:03:54.019> on<00:03:54.739> an<00:03:54.950> off-road<00:03:55.220> tire

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
it's a soft rubber on an off-road tire

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.339 
it's a soft rubber on an off-road tire
so<00:03:55.790> it's<00:03:55.970> gonna<00:03:56.120> want<00:03:56.329> to<00:03:56.389> deform<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.989> deflect

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
so it's gonna want to deform and deflect

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.690 
so it's gonna want to deform and deflect
and<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.950> know<00:03:58.040> which<00:03:58.160> works<00:03:58.340> good<00:03:58.579> in

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
and you know which works good in

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.220 
and you know which works good in
off-road<00:03:59.000> conditions<00:03:59.299> but<00:03:59.720> an<00:03:59.810> honor<00:03:59.989> it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
off-road conditions but an honor it

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.039 
off-road conditions but an honor it
makes<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.739> feel<00:04:00.889> really<00:04:01.480> kind<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.540> sketchy<00:04:02.720> not

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
makes it feel really kind of sketchy not

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:03.670 
makes it feel really kind of sketchy not
so<00:04:03.200> great

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
so great

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.970 
so great
so<00:04:04.099> this<00:04:04.430> more<00:04:05.209> dense<00:04:05.660> packing<00:04:06.169> of<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.769> knobs

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
so this more dense packing of the knobs

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.400 
so this more dense packing of the knobs
gives<00:04:07.669> you<00:04:07.849> a<00:04:08.060> more<00:04:08.359> secure<00:04:08.870> feeling<00:04:09.169> when

to handle well you see it obviously it

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.300

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.830 
sides on the shoulder it's a fairly flat
profile<00:04:25.130> but<00:04:25.940> again<00:04:26.120> it's<00:04:26.270> designed<00:04:26.419> more<00:04:26.780> for

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
profile but again it's designed more for

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.830 
profile but again it's designed more for
off-road<00:04:27.470> use<00:04:27.880> 60%<00:04:28.880> off<00:04:28.970> for<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.210> but<00:04:29.660> they<00:04:29.780> do

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
off-road use 60% off for it but they do

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.230
