00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 It was said by the official side is 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.450
 not possible a name sim card itself 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.950
 from the micro sim card or the normal one 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.970
 sim card to cut the whole one 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.429
 I have it in a few minutes 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.660
 now this scissors creates the nose and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 had to do it myself in this video 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.480
 show you how that works and come up 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.750
 to speak the pros and cons 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.180
 Let's go then I'll show you once 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 few shots from the tailor process 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.170
 The goal is the complete plastic order 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.539
 to cut away this golden chip without 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 I cut into this golden chip 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.529
 At first it was slightly surprised how hard 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.510
 how robust this micro sim card job is 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.100
 so that a little muscle use is 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.320
 no problem even with a not so 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.879
 Good scissors like mine get through 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 So now I am cutting one here 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.370
 page away and now comes already 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.719
 decide to put this video 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.430
 if you sim on your micro card 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.950
 Look then you see that on one of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.750
 the four corners so a little something is missing 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 and that's exactly what the nada sim card is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.989
 no matter which one you ask yourself 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.120
 exactly the same as the micro sim 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.090
 card so cuts a little 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.710
 triangle into the corner pure yes the most important 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.079
 It's just that you're a quiet one 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.699
 Hands do not prove to be nervous and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.899
 just focused and right there 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.939
 it should not snow for me then 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.280
 be a problem for some of you 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.619
 The Micro SIM card is a little bit different 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.240
 thicker than the name sim card but it 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.409
 I have not been a problem here 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 I did not grind anything and nothing 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.369
 even the slightly thicker filed 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.729
 homemade a sim card 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.930
 the problem is in the iphone 5 no we 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.369
 look at the results-right now a 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.200
 little bit you had to look like her 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.420
 I pretty much have the plastic 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.729
 outside can cut away here in the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.520
 right corner we see there I have that 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.380
 Triangle slightly trimmed possibly 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.180
 I even have one on the right side 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.310
 little bit of the golden chip 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.329
 get caught but it works anyway 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.380
 very good then quickly before the disadvantages 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.700
 Obviously, of course, you benefit 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.500
 you do not have to run to the store and you 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.100
 Do not have to spend money on new name sim card 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.140
 output 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.329
 At night you can of course at the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.860
 cut this golden process somewhere 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.600
 come chip and ruin the sim card 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.340
 actually not that bad because 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.590
 you want to have new ones 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.020
 then I would have to pick up the only one 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.930
 disadvantage for me is i have myself here 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.549
 so nano sim cards adapter bought the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.590
 Above all, we ate the function 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.119
 name sim card in there and then you can 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.069
 We will use it as a micro sim card for example 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.030
 samsung galaxy s3 or my htc 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.720
 experiment 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.319
 Unfortunately, the sim card did not fit 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.390
 purely 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.610
 that's why i can not use and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.720
 I can now drive my vaneks 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.400
 do not use it so i will 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.660
 probably still a sim card 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.420
 Buy though for the iphone 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.000
 the proof works now too 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.550
 the same that we turn here 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.230
 Look up here, the triangle is just like 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.780
 there I am trying the whole thing 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.489
 handed in there to spark that is the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:51.560
 Just punishment if you have a tripod 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:51.560
 Forget the people you can 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.739
 So now you see this way 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.269
 can not fall out here can 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:07.760
 wobble everything stable then the whole thing 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:11.700
 fumble in the iphone 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.810
 where is the slit is the hole that is 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.810
 worse than the first time 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.630
 Two hands will be very helpful with that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:30.750
 then we do an action page 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:32.430
 all of that there is now a 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.709
 a little bit then I use the time for 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.090
 I am grateful that her car times 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.019
 I watched a video I hope 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.519
 could help you 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.750
 please do not blame me 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.549
 if the whole shift gives you 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.109
 worked for me now in the video 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.769
 happy thumbs up subscribed but main 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.299
 I make cool videos of that 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.820
 iphone 5 the samsung galaxy s3 and the 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.019
 htc vaneks and their like the 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.400
 description box of this video 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.530
 look there are sure then already 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.620
 left to cool videos of which I 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.299
 So you just spoke the mobile phone 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.130
 goes on the same will be up here too 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.690
 appear that I'm Jewish that movies 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.190
 I join in and then I finish it 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.190
 video is all even
