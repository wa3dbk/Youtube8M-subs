00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.719
 let's cut a rectangle that measures 21 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.820
 centimeters wide by 35 centimeters 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.849
 long let's start working 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 then with this rectangle we are going to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.050
 take our rectangle and in the part 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.760
 from above we are going to make a decoration and if 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.560
 you want to work with paintings what 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.599
 they can do I have found a way 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.650
 very easy and it is with these markers 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.580
 permanent landmarks 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.580
 I'm going to do 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 let's say not so a kind of branches 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.850
 I already have there my decorator now I have a 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.739
 circle 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.000
 and that circle I need it like a moon 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.339
 let's say it so red and for that I'm 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.339
 using chalk 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:18.320
 I already have some flowers here and I have the moon 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.119
 let's proceed let's proceed 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.620
 then with the assembly of the geisha 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.300
 about the little box 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.640
 I have my head here 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.830
 comes with a little shoulders we're going to 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.440
 come and we're going to hit it more or less 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.270
 here a little bit not exactly half 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.030
 but a little bit run to the side 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.420
 left we're going to stick it there and over 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.340
 she will start working 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 I will come and I will place the neck 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.740
 of the coat here but I'm going to paste it alone 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.180
 of this little tip and this little tip 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 I need to stay up all 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.890
 because I'm going to work there, I 'm going to 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.970
 paste only and exclusively as to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.730
 have a guide point 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.340
 but only day and a little 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.080
 Now I'm going to come and I'm going to hit just 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.440
 here under the neck that I did not keep 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.860
 seeing what is part of the face here and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.380
 I'm going to paste here the sleeve to hear before 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.170
 paste a piece I should look 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.000
 that matches the alignment of the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.100
 another one I'm going to stick the sleeve and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.410
 took advantage of and hit the dress once 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.900
 all the decorations of the dress what 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.200
 that are shaded and that's why I 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.180
 I use permanent dress marker 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.850
 if you want and are experts with 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.820
 the brushes can use them 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.980
 but for now I'm using 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.810
 permanent markers taking 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.410
 in this part I'm going to come and I'm going to paste 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.410
 So here is this blouse, sorry 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:56.400
 manga that came under this one 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.470
 then I will raise it a little 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.990
 right there when it starts to come out 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.000
 then I'm going to stick the sleeve 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.000
 an edge that is already cropped here 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.270
 so far we are going like this already having 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.160
 finished all this part then now 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.459
 yes we can stick the neck well and 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.190
 flatten it on this and flatten the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.870
 sleeves here not yet on the tip of the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.060
 sleeves because we need to put the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.640
 little hands 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.849
 we are going to place the belt for it 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.630
 let's take the scissors and let's break 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.290
 here on this line 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.480
 because the belt goes well up from 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.879
 the one here 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.770
 should be the bottom tip more or 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.290
 less in the curve of the waist 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.670
 then there 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.840
 I'm going to stick my belt I'm going to highlight 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.840
 a little here 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.650
 the line of the dress 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.900
 I'm going to stick the belt there if you 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.490
 it comes out a little bit here or something 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.490
 you can simply cut it 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.639
 well then here below we're going to 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:23.719
 locate what I would be doing 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.719
 and the ribbon the ribbon that goes there hanging 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.590
 we are going to hit here, it's going well 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.240
 let's do what would be 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:38.279
 like I do not know how about inside the skirt 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.129
 of the dress I do not know there we're going to make it 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:44.459
 a decoration quotes this simply 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.929
 let's come here and let's cut in 

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:47.969
 the same pink we're doing the 

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:51.959
 belt and that 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:54.960
 another little piece guiding us more or less 

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:58.680
 the curves 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.249
 that we already have here well having it 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.969
 clipped we're going to come then 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.969
 to pillar 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.409
 good having the hair well trimmed 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.169
 let's come to square what 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.169
 and we are going to paste it 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.900
 what you want to place your hands 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:28.150
 it really is free I did in a 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.249
 instrument we are almost on the verge of 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.729
 finish let's go now with what would come 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:36.430
 being the decoration of the part of 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.110
 down my dress in the same way 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.110
 then let's make it 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.470
 the flowers that we were doing in 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.390
 all this part good already having 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:52.130
 placed all the details gave him a 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.570
 little lights to the hair with chalk is another 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.750
 another material that I like 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.740
 work and I cut a few strips of 2 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.560
 centimeters 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.360
 and place them in the back that 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.080
 came out more or less than a centimeter and 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.470
 half forward and this comes 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.599
 doing the times then of frame by 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.229
 now my friends then our picture 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:18.000
 it's totally finished remember 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.500

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.500

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.819
