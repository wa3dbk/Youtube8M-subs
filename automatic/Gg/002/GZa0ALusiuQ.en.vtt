00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.409
 we are going to start this fourth video in which we are going to make an approximation to 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.569
 what would be the grand prize with a no 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:33.059
 siec horse that this coach at intermediate level 1 absolutely 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.060
 consolidated 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.620
 i percent that we will also see that exercises as changes to the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.520
 stride between a beginning to pass it we will see also what chance but I would like 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.610
 first understand how the foot should be started from below my point of 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.490
 sight that must be or at hand put 'long reins' let's make a 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.730
 little back inside this hand too 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 there we are incubating it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.550
 now it enters the exact back and with the whip that causes that it loses interior there 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.460
 you are marking perfectly 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.580
 the expal in with the dior dye in the line 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.580
 now from the outside hand there is 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 phenomenal very well we will return again to change hand 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.720
 we go back again 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.150
 to put it little by little start finally forward there is 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.780
 in the cte they want a little bit faster that's 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.510
 that's why that's why 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.060
 caresses oo 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.120
 already 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.490
 phenomenal 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.450
 great if it will seem more like a work session in which 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.350
 we are going to comment on the different agents after descending 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.750
 it was the same name I have to say no what he is doing 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.500
 take the horse for a walk what we do percent this time in all 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.300
 the levels 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.770
 p say also that this horse is right now a level 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.350
 d Intermediate workouts not yet confirmed 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.250
 i are starting 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.100
 with the great prize exercises is a horse that is not yet 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.720
 doing great prize is eight years old that is to say his horse that for great prize 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.699
 would be 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:17.359
 She's very young and she denounced mine after she got a big prize 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:22.139
 probably mid-next year that the horse will have her nine 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.139
 years and be fit confirmed safe in all exercises 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.129
 bush to ask again to do quietly 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 However 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.309
 l will break 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.309
 then we continue our minimum terrain 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.199
 i go now 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.809
 to complicate a little more we will go entering little by little from pro terrain 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.419
 united has joining gathering together until having it start 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.499
 active a little 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.419
 there is 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.769
 iturrate again 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 flowers 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.199
 in correct prepared 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.689
 support for 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.119
 straight 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.359
 change 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.359
 support for 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.799
 straight 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.989
 support change 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.139
 straight 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.219
 the change through relief 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.369
 i are going to do now counting strides that we can do for example every gesture 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.369
 as to how they make big prize 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:45.919
 it's a competition in climbing the horse that there was a second point to a 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:46.969
 percentage 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.939
 important the truth is that I think it was quite good ivoskus 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.219
 I hope that everyone who sees it will enjoy it
