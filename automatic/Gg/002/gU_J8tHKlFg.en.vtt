Forgotten world 3d we tested it up the
lab<00:01:49.469> in<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> work<00:01:49.920> perfectly<00:01:50.570> apparently<00:01:51.570> it's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
lab in to work perfectly apparently it's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.709 
lab in to work perfectly apparently it's
very<00:01:51.899> realistic<00:01:52.670> why<00:01:53.670> would<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.909> create<00:01:54.240> game

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
very realistic why would you create game

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.669

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
that making a simulation game would be a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.529 
that making a simulation game would be a
good<00:02:00.659> idea<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.109> our<00:02:01.469> next<00:02:01.530> project<00:02:02.210> okay<00:02:03.210> I'm
