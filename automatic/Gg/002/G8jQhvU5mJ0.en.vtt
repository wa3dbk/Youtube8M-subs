00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.780
 see how to make a nice makeup 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.060
 day in three stages after having 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.920
 to moisturize the skin it is necessary to apply a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 base mattifying so this mass is going 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.060
 serve the holidays to master the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.350
 shine and fix the makeup more 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.710
 remembered as long as possible in 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 the day 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.160
 so I put a little nutty 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.710
 really small amounts and I 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.430
 will target the bright areas of the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 face it means the nose a world 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.559
 just by touching the forehead and the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.289
 chin as you have a mixed skin that's 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.110
 really this part where we go 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.789
 apply the product 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.500
 the second stage of thyme it's going to be 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.120
 so blurring the small ones 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.090
 imperfections to hide small 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.980
 marks unify the complexion and if the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.449
 color are done with your skin it's 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.580
 that you have found the right car nation 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.710
 we will add just a little bit 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.780
 a veil of powder to fix the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.060
 make up and find the velvety side 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.640
 skin is applied directly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.189
 powder with his brush on the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.900
 different parts of the face and we're going 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.900
 faded sweeping like that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.299
 the bluff application aÃ¯cha you go 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.100
 smile here is a nice smile and in the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.060
 smile bump will be applied as 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.060
 that going back 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 I will first brush the eyebrow of 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:47.240
 this way and then after redesigned and 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.430
 disciplined with the dark brown pencil 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.280
 to be able to sublimate his eyes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.350
 so applied a color for aicha 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.580
 chose a golden strand salary a strand 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.610
 metallized so we apply the color 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.990
 monochrome on the eyelid so 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.010
 the eyelid is delimited by 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.880
 the little hollow 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.670
 if you want a day makeup 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.950
 simple after applying the blush to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.840
 eyelids so brown I advise you 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 to use your foundation or so 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.410
 if you have a concealer for the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.440
 put just below the arcade 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.450
 eyebrow to enlarge the look on 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.850
 going to emphasize the eyes with a kohl pencil 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:30.660
 black for aicha so we will apply it 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.000
 all the way down to the lashes finished the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.160
 eye makeup by applying a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.489
 mascara for aicha so we stay in the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.110
 natural black color for good sheathing 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:47.090
 lashes start at the bottom and 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.090
 ends up inside like that 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.510
 for the lip contour when we have 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.400
 a well drawn lip we will apply 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.890
 the count high inside the lips 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.610
 if we wanted to enlarge the lips of 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.080
 aicha we would go out in this 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.480
 specific case it is not necessary his 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.920
 lips are well drawn 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.200
 after drawing the outline of 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.090
 lips by applying the gloss there he 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.730
 is a double gloss so we 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.600
 starts with the covering part 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.420
 now I'm taking a little bit 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.840
 glossy side texture really for 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.840
 bring shine and glamor
