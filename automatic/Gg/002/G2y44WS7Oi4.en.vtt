makes actually go into my phone also and
so<00:05:07.990> it's<00:05:08.530> fluid<00:05:08.770> how<00:05:09.010> that<00:05:09.220> works<00:05:09.400> however<00:05:09.730> if

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
so it's fluid how that works however if

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.450 
so it's fluid how that works however if
he<00:05:10.900> replies<00:05:11.169> to<00:05:11.440> my<00:05:11.560> phone<00:05:11.830> number<00:05:12.130> on<00:05:12.310> my

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
he replies to my phone number on my

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.220 
he replies to my phone number on my

phone it's not going to come up on here

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.540 
phone it's not going to come up on here
so<00:05:14.919> it's<00:05:15.340> rather<00:05:15.520> confusing<00:05:16.120> in<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.570> sense

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550
