 I'm going to use, we're going to need 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.220
 three big potatoes this we're going to 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.019

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.900
 of ground chicken this is ground so 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:44.020
 we need a pound and we need a 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.050
 goya sachet this is chicken for 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.660
 let's be the chicken 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.410
 we are going to need one and if necessary 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.410
 let's use salt if not with this nothing else 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.690
 and we're going to need two eggs one 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.350
 medium onion this we are going to cut 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.869
 in squares and we also need medium 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.470
 bunch of coriander this we're going to 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.680
 cut into pieces and we need oil 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.630
 enough for us to fry 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.860
 our pancakes so we're going to 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.050
 start 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.140
 the recipe the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.750
 is cooking the potatoes and what is 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.420
 they cook the potatoes we are going to cut in 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.590
 squares the onion and then we go to 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.770
 cut the cilantro bit 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.539
 well, the potatoes have already been cooked and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 I've already mashed them, I'm just 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.729
 waiting for it to cool a little bit to 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.119
 that we can make our pancakes 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.729
 without that we burn good to this I do not 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.500
 you add salt at the time of cooking 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.770
 because here we are going to season it with this 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.920
 goya seasoning 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.969
 but we're going to add here 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.289
 I have the diced onion 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.619
 as you can see here I also have the 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.670
 cilantro already chop it in pieces good 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.369
 let's add all 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.119
 here I have the ground chicken and also what 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.119
 let's add 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.950
 and now let's season with this seasoning 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.540
 from goya 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.540
 and we mix everything 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.670
 well we add another little bit more of that 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.830
 you are measuring how much you are doing 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.819
 putting so that it will not stay 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.709
 Very salty 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.139
 because that seasoning contains salt and then 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.299
 we probably do not need salt now 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.299
 I'm going to drop the eggs 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.840
 and we mix everything 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.250
 Well now let's do our 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.250
 Pancakes 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.989
 we are going to give it shape 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.950
 since we finish doing them all 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.950
 let's fry 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.340
 let's add the oil and how to 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.920
 I said because this is what you need 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.300
 you are feeling for how much oil 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:45.300
 It needs and good depending on how many 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:48.030
 pancakes are going to do well here this 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.030
 and now more happens three potatoes and one 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.850
 pound of ground chicken and I surrendered and 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.750
 well this is very good so now 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.790
 grope the oil you are going to use 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:04.060
 well we have our hot oil 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.060
 now let's add our pancakes 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.000
 let's add another 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.810
 let's wait for it to cook on one side 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.810
 and then we turn it 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.319
 let's add others here 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.570
 Well let's remove those already 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.570
 they are ready 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.310
 Now let's add another one so that 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.110
