00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
you'll get into a lot of shit if they

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.230 
you'll get into a lot of shit if they
find<00:02:22.990> out<00:02:23.110> it's<00:02:23.320> used<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.830> I'm<00:02:24.040> saying<00:02:24.700> if<00:02:24.910> you

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
find out it's used so I'm saying if you

happen to go to one of these playtesting

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.190 
happen to go to one of these playtesting
events<00:02:27.700> do<00:02:28.120> not<00:02:28.150> leak<00:02:28.510> anything<00:02:28.840> no<00:02:29.110> matter

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
events do not leak anything no matter

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.170 
events do not leak anything no matter
how<00:02:29.320> tempting<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.130> keep<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.910> information

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
how tempting it is keep that information

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.390 
how tempting it is keep that information
for<00:02:31.720> yourself<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.320> just<00:02:32.710> be<00:02:32.860> happy<00:02:32.890> at<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
for yourself and just be happy at the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.470 
for yourself and just be happy at the
fact<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:34.000> know<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.330> you've

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
fact that you know that you've

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.600 
fact that you know that you've
participated<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.680> secret<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.400> really

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
participated in a secret and a really

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.210 
participated in a secret and a really
exclusive<00:02:36.940> event<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.200> got<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.800> couple<00:02:39.010> of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
exclusive event so I got a couple of

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.100 
exclusive event so I got a couple of
theories<00:02:39.490> about<00:02:39.640> what<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.300> playtesting

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
theories about what this playtesting

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.560 
theories about what this playtesting
could<00:02:41.620> be<00:02:41.770> about<00:02:42.070> first<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.940> all<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.120> think<00:02:43.300> it

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
could be about first of all I think it

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.300 
could be about first of all I think it
could<00:02:43.810> be<00:02:43.960> about<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.620> Elder<00:02:44.950> Scrolls<00:02:45.190> online

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
could be about the Elder Scrolls online

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.970 
could be about the Elder Scrolls online
for<00:02:45.790> ps4<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.390> xbox<00:02:46.720> one<00:02:46.810> we<00:02:47.440> note<00:02:47.710> that<00:02:47.740> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
for ps4 and xbox one we note that the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.470 
for ps4 and xbox one we note that the
game<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.310> coming<00:02:48.460> out<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.820> those<00:02:48.970> consoles

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
game is coming out on those consoles

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.690 
game is coming out on those consoles
soon<00:02:49.840> we<00:02:50.320> don't<00:02:50.530> know<00:02:50.710> exactly<00:02:50.860> when<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.460> is<00:02:51.580> i

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
soon we don't know exactly when it is i

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.830 
soon we don't know exactly when it is i
believe<00:02:51.730> they<00:02:52.120> pushed<00:02:52.420> back<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.660> release

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
believe they pushed back the release

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.110 
believe they pushed back the release
date<00:02:53.350> for<00:02:53.500> those<00:02:54.010> consoles<00:02:54.460> and<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.000> i<00:02:55.090> think

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
date for those consoles and and i think

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.880 
date for those consoles and and i think
they<00:02:55.390> decided<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.960> wasn't<00:02:56.080> necessary<00:02:56.680> for

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
they decided it wasn't necessary for

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.650 
they decided it wasn't necessary for
that<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.100> happen<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.910> maybe<00:02:58.090> they<00:02:58.330> have<00:02:58.480> some

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
that to happen so maybe they have some

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.000 
that to happen so maybe they have some
Kings<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.050> need<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> be<00:02:59.290> sorted<00:02:59.560> out<00:02:59.830> and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
Kings that need to be sorted out and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.860 
Kings that need to be sorted out and
probably<00:03:00.550> this<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.030> what<00:03:01.270> this<00:03:01.420> play<00:03:01.630> test

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
probably this is what this play test

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.140 
probably this is what this play test
application<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.650> relating<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.280> they<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.090> know

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
application is relating to they you know

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.030 
application is relating to they you know
something<00:03:05.140> needs<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.380> be<00:03:05.410> tested<00:03:05.650> out<00:03:05.890> they

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
something needs to be tested out they

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.950 
something needs to be tested out they
have<00:03:06.160> some<00:03:06.340> problem<00:03:06.640> going<00:03:06.820> on<00:03:07.090> specifically

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
have some problem going on specifically

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.210 
have some problem going on specifically
with<00:03:08.140> regards<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.530> those<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:09.040> know

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
with regards to those you know

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.190 
with regards to those you know
current-gen<00:03:09.880> as<00:03:10.000> they<00:03:10.150> are<00:03:10.360> now<00:03:10.540> peaceful<00:03:11.110> and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
current-gen as they are now peaceful and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.050 
current-gen as they are now peaceful and
xbox<00:03:11.470> one<00:03:11.650> consoles<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.340> they<00:03:12.700> just<00:03:12.880> need<00:03:13.000> to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
xbox one consoles and they just need to

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.880 
xbox one consoles and they just need to
work<00:03:13.210> those<00:03:13.390> things<00:03:13.600> out<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.080> that's<00:03:14.560> probably

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
work those things out so that's probably

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.340 
work those things out so that's probably
the<00:03:15.280> logical<00:03:15.820> conclusion<00:03:16.030> as<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.900> what<00:03:17.200> this

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
the logical conclusion as to what this

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.000 
the logical conclusion as to what this
is<00:03:17.530> relating<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.130> obviously<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.300> less<00:03:19.510> likely

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
is relating to obviously the less likely

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.440 
is relating to obviously the less likely
conclusion<00:03:21.010> but<00:03:21.340> something<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.030> think<00:03:22.210> a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
conclusion but something that I think a

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.270 
conclusion but something that I think a
lot<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.600> people<00:03:22.690> are<00:03:22.990> jumping<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:23.710> that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
lot of people are jumping to is that

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.490 
lot of people are jumping to is that
this<00:03:24.430> game<00:03:24.640> could<00:03:24.820> be<00:03:24.910> about<00:03:25.090> fallout<00:03:25.570> 4<00:03:25.930> now

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
this game could be about fallout 4 now

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.740 
this game could be about fallout 4 now

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750

about fallout 4 year obviously I've said

about fallout 4 year obviously I've said
from<00:03:36.670> day<00:03:36.760> one<00:03:37.120> it's<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.630> development<00:03:38.380> but<00:03:38.710> we

from day one it's in development but we

from day one it's in development but we

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
able to take on playtesters because

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.760 
able to take on playtesters because
usually<00:03:45.730> play<00:03:46.120> testers<00:03:46.570> I'm<00:03:46.750> done<00:03:47.290> very<00:03:47.560> very

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
usually play testers I'm done very very

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.980 
usually play testers I'm done very very
early<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.100> in<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.340> development<00:03:48.820> cycle<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.960> if

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
early on in the development cycle and if

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.750 
early on in the development cycle and if
we<00:03:50.170> are<00:03:50.290> assuming<00:03:50.710> that<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.220> game<00:03:51.460> is<00:03:51.490> coming

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
we are assuming that this game is coming

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.330 
we are assuming that this game is coming
out<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:52.060> 2015<00:03:52.600> as<00:03:53.050> I've<00:03:53.500> been<00:03:53.530> saying<00:03:54.040> for<00:03:54.280> a

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
out in 2015 as I've been saying for a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.920 
out in 2015 as I've been saying for a
very<00:03:54.550> very<00:03:54.610> long<00:03:54.820> time<00:03:54.940> I've<00:03:55.420> set<00:03:55.840> an

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
very very long time I've set an

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.590 
very very long time I've set an
announcement<00:03:56.440> in<00:03:56.470> 2014<00:03:57.250> hopefully<00:03:58.060> at<00:03:58.180> e3<00:03:58.300> and

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
announcement in 2014 hopefully at e3 and

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.090 
announcement in 2014 hopefully at e3 and
i'll<00:03:58.840> get<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.110> on<00:03:59.320> my<00:03:59.440> next<00:03:59.680> video<00:03:59.800> if

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
i'll get to that on my next video if

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.250 
i'll get to that on my next video if
you're<00:04:00.220> watching<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:01.420> then<00:04:01.780> released<00:04:02.110> in

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
you're watching and then released in

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.820 
you're watching and then released in
2015<00:04:02.980> um<00:04:03.460> I<00:04:04.120> think<00:04:04.900> that's<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.140> logical<00:04:05.560> step

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
2015 um I think that's the logical step

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.040 
2015 um I think that's the logical step
but<00:04:06.040> if<00:04:06.160> that's<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.490> case<00:04:06.820> I<00:04:07.180> don't<00:04:07.570> know

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
but if that's the case I don't know

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.900 
but if that's the case I don't know
whether<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.470> play<00:04:08.770> testing<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.340> relating<00:04:09.760> to

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
whether this play testing is relating to

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.180 
whether this play testing is relating to
fallout<00:04:10.270> 4<00:04:10.540> because<00:04:11.230> that's<00:04:11.380> it<00:04:11.650> seems<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.070> be

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
fallout 4 because that's it seems to be

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.150 
fallout 4 because that's it seems to be
very<00:04:12.220> very<00:04:12.520> early<00:04:13.060> on<00:04:13.090> usually<00:04:13.720> they<00:04:13.870> have<00:04:14.050> a

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
very very early on usually they have a

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.740 
very very early on usually they have a
somewhat<00:04:15.160> finished<00:04:15.760> product<00:04:16.209> not<00:04:16.420> you<00:04:16.630> know

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
somewhat finished product not you know

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.960 
somewhat finished product not you know
too<00:04:16.989> far<00:04:17.590> along<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:18.040> way<00:04:18.190> but<00:04:18.700> it

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
too far along the way but it

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.150 
too far along the way but it
somewhat<00:04:19.480> complete<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:20.140> they<00:04:20.290> can<00:04:20.470> fully<00:04:20.799> just

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
somewhat complete so they can fully just

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.480 
somewhat complete so they can fully just
tear<00:04:21.430> apart<00:04:21.610> this<00:04:22.270> particular<00:04:22.980> you<00:04:23.980> know<00:04:24.100> this

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
tear apart this particular you know this

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.730 
tear apart this particular you know this
beta<00:04:24.880> alpha<00:04:25.330> or<00:04:25.780> pre<00:04:25.990> out<00:04:26.170> for<00:04:26.380> whatever<00:04:26.650> you

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
beta alpha or pre out for whatever you

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.350 
beta alpha or pre out for whatever you
want<00:04:26.920> to<00:04:26.980> call<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:27.790> they<00:04:27.880> can<00:04:28.030> get<00:04:28.150> all

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
want to call it so they can get all

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.580 
want to call it so they can get all
those<00:04:28.480> kinks<00:04:28.780> out<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.080> way<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.410> then

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
those kinks out of the way and then

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.290 
those kinks out of the way and then
start<00:04:29.890> with<00:04:29.980> a<00:04:30.010> proper<00:04:30.280> alpha<00:04:30.610> start<00:04:31.120> with<00:04:31.240> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
start with a proper alpha start with the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.390 
start with a proper alpha start with the
proper<00:04:31.570> beta<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.710> is<00:04:32.740> why<00:04:33.010> don't<00:04:33.220> think

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
proper beta so this is why don't think

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.920 
proper beta so this is why don't think
it's<00:04:33.520> fallout<00:04:33.700> 4<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.420> think<00:04:34.570> it's<00:04:34.690> too

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
it's fallout 4 I just think it's too

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.410 
it's fallout 4 I just think it's too
early<00:04:34.960> if<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:36.100> was<00:04:36.280> relating<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.730> fly<00:04:36.910> for<00:04:37.060> I

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
early if it was relating to fly for I

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.090 
early if it was relating to fly for I
would<00:04:37.630> have<00:04:37.840> expected<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.620> see<00:04:38.710> something

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
would have expected to see something

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.250 
would have expected to see something
like<00:04:39.130> this<00:04:39.340> maybe<00:04:39.550> later<00:04:39.940> this<00:04:40.240> year<00:04:40.300> maybe

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
like this maybe later this year maybe

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.410 
like this maybe later this year maybe
once<00:04:41.560> after<00:04:41.800> they've<00:04:42.130> released<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.640> game<00:04:42.820> but

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
once after they've released the game but

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.020 
once after they've released the game but
certainly<00:04:44.140> not<00:04:44.440> now<00:04:44.770> now<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.460> will<00:04:45.820> say

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
certainly not now now I will say

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.790 
certainly not now now I will say
something<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.510> this<00:04:46.660> though<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.380> fact<00:04:47.710> that

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
something to this though the fact that

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.500 
something to this though the fact that
they<00:04:47.980> are<00:04:48.010> acquiring<00:04:48.550> people<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.300> sign<00:04:49.480> a

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
they are acquiring people to sign a

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.630 
they are acquiring people to sign a
nondisclosure<00:04:49.780> agreement<00:04:50.770> suggests<00:04:51.550> that

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
nondisclosure agreement suggests that

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.100
