00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.469
 However, channel la coco xo is not waiting 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.929

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.939
 ie if you after to this video 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.470
 mainz ten tips still have not enough 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.450
 then you should definitely at laura 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.950
 stop by her is channel again end 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.630
 from this video and also below in the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.700
 funds linked as well as you 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.730
 video and therefore I am here first 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.620
 have fun with this video we go with 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.300
 the first make-up tip at the morning 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.309
 to look fresh and my biggest 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.010
 problem are eye shadow because of that 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 for me incessantly a concealer which 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.039
 products used in this video 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.899
 I write you down in the again 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.180
 I always carry infos and the concealer 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.309
 im on the winkl and on the outside angle and on 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.109
 because this one is very fluid for 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.789
 you say distributed a bit first 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.379
 with a brush and knock 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.180
 then again because one 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.920
 thereby a much more natural finish 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.780
 and you will realize that one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.460
 such a stark difference because that 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.210
 your eyes just complete 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 stops tip number one in the morning 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 better to stand the alarm clock 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.409
 at least a little 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 you do not have to move that euro 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.490
 has somehow build up or something 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.380
 Personally, that would be a bit too 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.939
 Stressful somewhere in the middle of the room too 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.829
 so be sure to get up 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.930
 but if you must for example already out 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.159
 you have to win then a lot has been won 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.290
 So then you can not stop him 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.450
 just open in half sleep and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.979
 not really notice if you 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.299
 of course, really hardcore on the way 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.890
 then you can becker him in too 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.380
 put the room as far as you once the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.970
 I'll leave you then bed 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.250
 you are coming to one 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.369
 more namely the second make-up 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.869
 tip and that is one of my favorites 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.640
 eyebrow bow highlight 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.590
 believe me that looks so nice if 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.780
 the light falls there and your face falls 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.579
 then it will be so fresh and shiny 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.430
 In any case, you will be much more alert 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.280
 from number two to set up better 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.130
 I for you 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.630
 but is the baker in a timely manner 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.130
 and I know many of you are thinking now 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.040
 maybe so but sleep longer 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.780
 the better I trust myself 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.520
 personally need a lately 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.780
 half an hour to get out of bed 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.000
 this is of course a bit 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.350
 exaggerated other people have just 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.569
 Half an hour around 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.160
 to finish at all and I take 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.510
 half an hour to get up 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.239
 but believe me if you are a bit 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.950
 then relaxed in the day then starts 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.630
 are you in a much better mood? 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.610
 on the way as if you tack tack tack 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.560
 do not even time for the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.440
 stars breakfast make-up no idea 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.850
 what me out of the house out cello away 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.380
 Just in time for that, maybe you 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.120
 once again that slumbers something 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.030
 can oppress or so and there you have 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.800
 You can start relaxed in the day and 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.630
 also the third tip includes again 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.580
 the shimmering eyeshadow only this time 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.250
 i carry it in my eyes in the angle 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.170
 this opens your eye and lets the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.940
 look incredibly radiant you see 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.680
 the comparison above no eyeshadow 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.850
 eyeshadow down, eyes are looking up 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.170
 each case much much bigger and fold 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.970
 tip number three, I will only then 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.250
 we recommend already leaving the bed 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.880
 have fresh air into the room 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.230
 to let 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.700
 the danger is, if you are still in the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.110
 bed is located and the window opens 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.610
 they have no bock stand up times for 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.410
 room is freezing but believe me 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.150
 as soon as you get up you should 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.430
 tear the window wide open around this 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.110
 allow sleep air to the outside and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.090
 nice to get fresh oxygen 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.299
 I know that makes you in any case 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.610
 awake and then a room today 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.670
 leave presents do we deal with was 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.079
 the 14 tip i can give you is 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.000
 the one for me the whole difference 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.920
 makes an eyelash curler 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.420
 if that is not so good for you 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.220
 you can try the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.940
 to fill and thereby a bit too 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.440
 heat 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.030
 often that works a bit 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.900
 but it fits easier on that 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.670
 you do not burn yourself 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.110
 The bands lend their eyelashes 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.810
 just one so unbelievably beautiful 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.819
 You see here the result and 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.189
 now the same again compared so 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.799
 one eye bent that others do not 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:07.909
 and then pushed again and you see 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:10.159
 eyelashes are just the shit the fourth 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.140
 is one of those tips that I without 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.840
 probably thinking of mine 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.199
 Drink water for half the life 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.820
 before you get up 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.560
 I think I already have that in mine 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.850
 tomorrow's routine or one 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.139
 morning routines preached water full 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.850
 it says is super good for the 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.229
 This brings your circulation to life 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.030
 in bold so if you you you have to 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.760
 Do not jump out of bed and then 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.190
 becomes a so-called so and so 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.880
 schwarzau with yes you best yourself 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.370
 are just times out 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.770
 drink some water and none 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.830
 know what you are doing jackpot or 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.599
 Do not hesitate what and then get up and 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.490
 the fifth and final styling tip 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.110
 refers to the hair when your time 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.580
 Have a bad hair day and the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.620
 can make hair in the morning is the 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.449
 Of course, if you should not 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.190
 Definitely an emergency hairstyle 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.229
 think fast and always good 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.960
 looks like it is just me 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.490
 high dutt I then a bit 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.440
 easy target, so to speak first one has 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.930
 then a weird loop on the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.570
 I'll stick my head and serve it then 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.250
 with bobby pins so tight to me this 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.250
 Knoll likes it on my head 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.499
 then you need only then 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.809
 a hair band or somehow a neckerchief 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:24.639
 and that's what I knot about 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:26.199
 say a lot that that's the case 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.729
 but a little cleaning ladies optics is me 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.729
 I really like that and that's really it 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.529
 a hairstyle that hides everything and he 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.669
 fifth and last tip and better 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:38.469
 getting up is a nice wake-up sound 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.819
 set and does not lose exactly 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.189
 understand what I mean 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:52.379
 demonstrated by the short time away tone 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:52.379
 number one and weckton number two 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.339
 not much better so hello anymore 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.860
 Clear if you belong to these people 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.060
 you really beat out of the bed 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.310
 must then maybe you should this 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.110
 smiles at about this high place but 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.089
 I personally just do ever 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.770
 in principle with a bad mood on and 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:16.300
 have absolutely no desire for the day 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:19.029
 if my alarm clock so great makes so 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.770
 that's why my recommendation would be one 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:22.839
 to hire more beautiful rectors 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.999

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:27.729
 to be able to get up better five times 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:29.409
 at five in the morning to look fresh
