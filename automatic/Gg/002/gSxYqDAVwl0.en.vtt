 the incredible team mira cards have all 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.559

 of iphone squid is ipl 4 if 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780

 many consider it his most 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.520
 great rival 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.829
 naniwa it's during the providence 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.869
 that this rivalry started it's 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.240
 naniwa who had released Korean to 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.409
 the time the trend reverses to the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.390
 blizzcon 2011 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.970

 invida chanal precisely and since that's 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.409
 an endless ping pong game that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.630
 started between the two players 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.960
 competitive spirit when you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.729
 nestea also has its share 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.149
 of achievements since he is the first 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.570
 player to have won three gsl including 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.430

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.390
 in a row he also had a winrate 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.230
 perfect in zvp and zvz until 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.470
 these records 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.120
 defeated by san and dimaga among the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.739
 little things a little more funny he is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.319
 2nd dan of kendo 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.480
 he chose the pseudo nestea because 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.250
 the word bang is censored on starcraft 2 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.120
 and he had a bottle of nestea 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.180
 on his desk 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.760
 and finally he received 1 and steve the world 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.540
 created in his name for qualifying for 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.190
 ten consecutive seasons of the code s 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.590
 in short nestea it's not only a 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.209
 refreshing drink but also 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.790
 one of the deans of the stage and the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.530
 best zerg player that exists if
