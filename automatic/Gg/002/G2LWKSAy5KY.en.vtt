00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
free game I mean there's some blood

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.050 
free game I mean there's some blood
effects<00:01:28.070> they<00:01:28.460> look<00:01:28.670> like<00:01:28.760> they're<00:01:28.940> from

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
effects they look like they're from

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.850 
effects they look like they're from
seven<00:01:29.360> years<00:01:29.479> ago<00:01:29.690> but<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.080> know<00:01:30.110> crappy

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
seven years ago but you know crappy

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.469 
seven years ago but you know crappy
blood<00:01:31.100> effects<00:01:31.400> can<00:01:31.610> still<00:01:31.820> be<00:01:31.940> amusing<00:01:32.390> I

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
blood effects can still be amusing I

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.719 
blood effects can still be amusing I
guess<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:32.990> they<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.650> slow<00:01:34.040> motion<00:01:34.550> for

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
guess and they have slow motion for

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.460 
guess and they have slow motion for
critical<00:01:35.090> hits<00:01:35.300> but<00:01:35.509> honestly<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.110> gets<00:01:36.290> old

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
critical hits but honestly that gets old

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.080 
critical hits but honestly that gets old
after<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.830> while<00:01:36.890> except<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:37.790> this<00:01:37.850> one<00:01:37.910> time

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
after a while except for this one time

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.750 
after a while except for this one time
when<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.810> slow<00:01:39.260> motion<00:01:39.620> activated<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.340> then<00:01:40.670> I

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
when I slow motion activated and then I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.910 
when I slow motion activated and then I
stab<00:01:41.120> someone<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.660> balls<00:01:41.870> that<00:01:42.530> was<00:01:42.680> nice

above<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.960> and<00:03:21.170> someone<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.680> going<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:21.980> get

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
above you and someone is going to get

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.680 
above you and someone is going to get
stomped<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.880> almost<00:03:23.120> think<00:03:23.360> they<00:03:23.510> do<00:03:23.570> this

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
stomped on I almost think they do this

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.300 
stomped on I almost think they do this
on<00:03:23.900> purpose<00:03:23.960> because<00:03:24.500> if<00:03:24.980> someone<00:03:25.220> gets

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
on purpose because if someone gets

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.100 
on purpose because if someone gets
annihilated<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:26.300> can<00:03:26.450> actually<00:03:26.630> execute

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
annihilated you can actually execute

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.050 
annihilated you can actually execute
that<00:03:27.440> gladiator<00:03:27.740> at<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.490> end<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.820> fight

that gladiator at the end of the fight

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.090 
that gladiator at the end of the fight
then<00:03:29.990> they<00:03:30.110> either<00:03:30.230> have<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.530> spend<00:03:30.740> money<00:03:30.890> to

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
then they either have to spend money to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.460 
then they either have to spend money to
revive<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.550> gladiator<00:03:31.970> or<00:03:32.210> buy<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.570> new<00:03:32.840> one<00:03:33.050> so

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
revive the gladiator or buy a new one so

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
online play is that many of the matchups

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.010 
online play is that many of the matchups
are<00:03:46.430> super<00:03:46.880> laggy<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.720> don't<00:03:47.900> really

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
are super laggy and you don't really

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.870 
are super laggy and you don't really
know<00:03:48.230> if<00:03:48.260> your<00:03:48.530> stab<00:03:48.800> hit<00:03:49.070> an<00:03:49.160> opponent<00:03:49.430> until

know if your stab hit an opponent until
a<00:03:49.910> few<00:03:50.150> seconds<00:03:50.510> afterwards<00:03:51.050> which<00:03:51.380> makes

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
a few seconds afterwards which makes

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.530 
a few seconds afterwards which makes
fighting<00:03:51.830> nearly<00:03:52.250> impossible<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:53.030> that's

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
fighting nearly impossible and that's

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.600 
fighting nearly impossible and that's
when<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.810> get<00:03:53.989> into<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.320> game<00:03:54.530> at<00:03:54.770> all<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:55.220> gave

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
when you get into a game at all I gave

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.010 
when you get into a game at all I gave
up<00:03:55.760> on<00:03:55.910> quick<00:03:56.150> match<00:03:56.330> because<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.780> just<00:03:56.900> never

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
up on quick match because it just never

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.290 
up on quick match because it just never
matched<00:03:57.590> me<00:03:57.770> with<00:03:57.890> an<00:03:58.010> opponent<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.970> only<00:03:59.180> way

I could fight in the online matches was

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.070 
I could fight in the online matches was
to<00:04:01.220> go<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.520> arena<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.120> even<00:04:02.540> in<00:04:02.660> those<00:04:02.810> the

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
to go to the arena and even in those the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.600 
to go to the arena and even in those the
time<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.380> spent<00:04:03.620> in<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.739> queue<00:04:04.040> was<00:04:04.310> way<00:04:04.550> too

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
time I spent in the queue was way too

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.290 
time I spent in the queue was way too
long

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300

the whole buying armor and weapons thing
is<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.190> good<00:04:07.400> idea<00:04:07.489> in<00:04:07.700> theory<00:04:07.970> but<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.480> was

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
is a good idea in theory but I was

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.390 
is a good idea in theory but I was
hoping<00:04:08.900> for<00:04:08.959> more<00:04:09.260> customization<00:04:09.709> in<00:04:10.160> terms

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
hoping for more customization in terms

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.699 
hoping for more customization in terms
of<00:04:10.580> color<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:10.940> stuff<00:04:11.239> like<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.690> also<00:04:12.320> all

the end the game's creators spent too

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.200 
the end the game's creators spent too
much<00:04:25.130> time<00:04:25.400> thinking<00:04:25.610> about<00:04:25.760> how<00:04:26.030> they<00:04:26.180> can

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
much time thinking about how they can

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.820 
much time thinking about how they can
make<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.480> free<00:04:26.870> game<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.260> also<00:04:27.380> makes<00:04:27.650> money

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
make a free game that also makes money

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.350 
make a free game that also makes money
and<00:04:27.919> not<00:04:28.190> enough<00:04:28.340> time<00:04:28.640> just<00:04:28.669> making<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.210> game

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
and not enough time just making the game

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.360 
and not enough time just making the game
fun<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:30.140> fights<00:04:30.410> depend<00:04:30.800> more<00:04:30.919> on<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.130> stuff

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370
