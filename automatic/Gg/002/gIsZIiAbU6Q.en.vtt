just<00:00:41.070> am<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> create<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.420> new<00:00:42.719> project

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
just am going to create a new project

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.860 
just am going to create a new project
and<00:00:43.590> label<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.489> opening<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.690> just

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and label it opening and now I'm just

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.470 
and label it opening and now I'm just
going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> insert<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:48.090> allows

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
going to go to insert and this allows

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
going to go to insert and this allows
you<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.660> insert<00:00:49.170> different<00:00:49.440> shapes<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you to insert different shapes and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.630 
you to insert different shapes and
objects<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:52.199> inserted<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.829> rectangle

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
objects so I just inserted a rectangle

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.150 
objects so I just inserted a rectangle
and<00:00:53.789> now<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.199> draw<00:00:55.500> settings

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and now if you go up to draw settings

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
and now if you go up to draw settings
it'll<00:00:56.520> allow<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> adjust<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.629> settings

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229 
it'll allow you to adjust the settings
so<00:00:58.710> let's<00:00:59.070> add<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> gradient<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.000> this

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so let's add a gradient to this

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
so let's add a gradient to this
rectangle<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.829> drag<00:01:02.100> this

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
rectangle to do that just drag this

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.440 
rectangle to do that just drag this
little<00:01:02.430> square<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.480> line<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:05.270> I'm<00:01:06.270> going

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
little square to the line and I'm going

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
little square to the line and I'm going
to<00:01:06.510> drag<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> way<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.770> far<00:01:08.040> left

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to drag this all the way to the far left

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670 
to drag this all the way to the far left
and<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.060> drag<00:01:09.689> another<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> line

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and then drag another one to the line

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
and then drag another one to the line
and<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> double<00:01:11.400> click<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> will

I'm<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.090> drag<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.509> off<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.960> far

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
I'm going to drag this off to the far

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.109 
I'm going to drag this off to the far
right<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.130> now<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.729> adjust<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
right and now I'm going to adjust the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.850 
right and now I'm going to adjust the
angle<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> give<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> horizontal

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
angle to give it kind of a horizontal

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 
angle to give it kind of a horizontal
look<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.700> when<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.880> click<00:01:24.150> OK<00:01:24.290> it<00:01:25.290> should

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
look and when you click OK it should
apply<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> settings<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.909> looks<00:01:27.119> weird

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
apply the settings now it looks weird

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.120 
apply the settings now it looks weird

preview button it will show you what it
actually<00:01:32.040> looks<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> browser<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> now

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
actually looks like in a browser so now

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
go to jump in from right but I'm going

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.050 
go to jump in from right but I'm going
to<00:02:47.520> select<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.420> delay<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:52.040> 0.49<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.370> that's

to select the delay to 0.49 and that's
going<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.450> allow<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:56.390> it's<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.600> to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
going to allow this to it's going to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.540 
going to allow this to it's going to
give<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:58.140> delay<00:02:58.590> each<00:02:59.010> one<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.400> these<00:02:59.489> a

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
give it a delay each one of these a

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.790 
give it a delay each one of these a
delay<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.000> they<00:03:00.390> don't<00:03:00.720> all<00:03:00.989> come<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.380> at<00:03:01.500> once

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
delay so they don't all come in at once

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400 
delay so they don't all come in at once
so<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.940> last<00:03:03.180> one<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:03.630> set<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.230> one

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
so on the last one I just set that one

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.220 
so on the last one I just set that one
to<00:03:04.440> two<00:03:04.800> seconds<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.330> click<00:03:06.570> preview

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
to two seconds and if I click preview

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.680 
to two seconds and if I click preview
this<00:03:08.220> what<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.850> going<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.030> look<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.270> then

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
this what it's going to look like then

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.900 
this what it's going to look like then
you<00:03:09.840> can<00:03:09.959> add<00:03:10.140> other<00:03:10.320> animations<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.459> text

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
you can add other animations and text

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.760 
you can add other animations and text
links<00:03:12.300> but<00:03:12.510> when<00:03:12.720> you're<00:03:12.840> through<00:03:13.110> go<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.380> file

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
links but when you're through go to file

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.880 
links but when you're through go to file
and<00:03:14.040> export<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:15.000> then<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.020> can<00:03:16.230> go<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.620> the
