00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.529 
strongest inflationary pressures they
should<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.610> concerned<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.390> their<00:00:57.510> own

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.479 
should be concerned because of their own
policies<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.410> China<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.949> response<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> the

financial<00:00:59.579> crisis<00:01:00.270> under<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.110> absolutely

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
financial crisis under this absolutely

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.470 
financial crisis under this absolutely
gigantic<00:01:02.160> expansion<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> money<00:01:03.270> supply

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
gigantic expansion in the money supply

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.479 
gigantic expansion in the money supply
so<00:01:04.259> depending<00:01:04.649> on<00:01:04.739> how<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> measure<00:01:05.220> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so depending on how you measure it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.680 
so depending on how you measure it
there's<00:01:05.670> actually<00:01:05.940> more<00:01:06.149> money<00:01:06.420> floating

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
there's actually more money floating

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.180 
there's actually more money floating
around<00:01:06.869> China<00:01:07.289> than<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:07.649> is<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.800> floating

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
around China than there is a floating

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.830 
around China than there is a floating
around<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> u.s.<00:01:08.729> even<00:01:09.390> though<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> Chinese

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
size of the American economy so when

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.480 
size of the American economy so when
you've<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> money<00:01:14.070> floating<00:01:14.340> around

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
you've got that money floating around

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.550 
you've got that money floating around
you<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> chance<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.330> prices<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.140> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you have a chance of prices going up so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.929 
you have a chance of prices going up so
they<00:01:16.680> should<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:17.070> worried<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> situation

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
they should be worried the situation

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.550 
they should be worried the situation
right<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.090> isn't<00:01:18.390> terrible<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
right now isn't terrible but the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.929 
right now isn't terrible but the
government<00:01:19.830> itself<00:01:20.040> has<00:01:20.400> set<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> conditions

for high inflation now they have to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.810 
for high inflation now they have to
fight<00:01:23.460> those<00:01:23.729> conditions

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.850 
1989 in joonam for a few months before
you<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.210> current<00:01:42.720> round<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.200> inflation<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you this current round of inflation is

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.109 
you this current round of inflation is
not<00:01:43.890> nearly<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.850> those<00:01:45.210> levels<00:01:46.610> but<00:01:47.610> certainly

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
not nearly at those levels but certainly

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.870 
not nearly at those levels but certainly
every<00:01:48.869> Chinese<00:01:49.320> political<00:01:49.680> leader<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.430> very

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
every Chinese political leader is very

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.390 
every Chinese political leader is very
sensitive<00:01:51.360> about<00:01:51.800> whether<00:01:52.800> inflationary

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
sensitive about whether inflationary

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.100 
sensitive about whether inflationary
pressures<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:54.030> getting<00:01:54.270> beyond<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:54.900> they

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
pressures are getting beyond what they

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.320 
pressures are getting beyond what they
view<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.340> boundaries<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> assure

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
view to be the boundaries that assure

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.800 
view to be the boundaries that assure
ongoing<00:01:58.080> social<00:01:58.350> stability<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.570> this

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
ongoing social stability so I think this

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.270 
ongoing social stability so I think this
is<00:02:00.869> very<00:02:01.020> much<00:02:01.380> front<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.770> center<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.160> their

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
is very much front and center in their

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.160 
is very much front and center in their
own<00:02:02.460> concerns<00:02:03.030> as<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.479> look<00:02:03.690> forward<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.080> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
own concerns as they look forward to the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.279 
own concerns as they look forward to the
coming<00:02:04.289> months<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.890> year<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> there's<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
coming months and year so there's a

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.020 
coming months and year so there's a
problem<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.100> problem<00:02:08.130> will<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.759> worse

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
problem and the problem will get worse

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.820 
problem and the problem will get worse
unless<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.750> government<00:02:10.020> does<00:02:10.320> something<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
unless the government does something and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.080 
unless the government does something and
what<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> government<00:02:11.370> needs<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.580> do<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.940> is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
what the government needs to do is is

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.150 
what the government needs to do is is
shrink<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.989> money<00:02:13.170> supply<00:02:13.380> there's<00:02:14.040> no

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
shrink the money supply there's no

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.190 
shrink the money supply there's no
disaster<00:02:14.820> coming<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.239> China<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:15.989> if<00:02:16.050> they<00:02:16.140> do

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
disaster coming for China but if they do

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.020 
disaster coming for China but if they do
nothing<00:02:16.830> then<00:02:17.370> you'd<00:02:17.580> see<00:02:17.760> inflation

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
nothing then you'd see inflation

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.580 
nothing then you'd see inflation
increase<00:02:18.600> again<00:02:18.750> they're<00:02:19.170> going<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> do

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
increase again they're going to do

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.680 
increase again they're going to do
something<00:02:19.980> that's<00:02:20.370> not<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.000> happen<00:02:21.150> so

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
something that's not going to happen so

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.780 
something that's not going to happen so
there's<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.440> problem<00:02:22.739> here<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.670> an

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
there's a problem here but it's an

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.220 
there's a problem here but it's an
addressable<00:02:24.239> problem<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> government<00:02:24.870> can

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
addressable problem the government can

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.270 
addressable problem the government can
address<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.500> they're<00:02:25.739> just<00:02:25.920> going<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.220> to

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
address it they're just going to have to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.590 
address it they're just going to have to
pull<00:02:26.580> back<00:02:26.820> on<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.300> growth<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.230> little<00:02:28.440> bit
