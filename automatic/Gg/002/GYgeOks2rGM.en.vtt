 woerth 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.689
 we will say that this meeting with the sonar was 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.529
 to rafah and don juan who 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.170
 he sees somewhere that he exists elsewhere in resale by his 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.290
 existing physics the next 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.430
 for them he was looking for bellocco 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.130
 it was in 2006 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.560
 and unfortunately we still brought their shovels available 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.620
 at that moment it even lasted a very long time just that the beginning 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.080
 dumb as we could in woman 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.520
 a solution at your convenience and pleasure 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.470
 it is done through the economic fabric of this region 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.360
 since we have in this area are lucky to have or land 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.490
 companies active in environmental technologies the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.920
 renewable energies and in particular solar energy with actors 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.470
 important at the Swiss and international level and these are the climatologist 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.820
 who caught our attention this magnificent project total national 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.350
 in the regional vocation agadez opal it can not bring much 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.890
 support for a project 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.310
 of an international scale like planetsolar good we are very happy 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.640
 to be able and contribute even modestly I feel that it is 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.090
 rather of the version that must be spoken and we will enjoy and we count 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.860
 well enjoy and besides the promotion and the image that this project 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.380
 is not the only one who can benefit this region 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.790
 now in its preparatory phase but of course from the launch of the mac 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.150
 do around the world 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.800
 suddenly this project absolutely brilliant especially in which I live with 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.510
 which it is developed 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.510
 these are by the big media bills as we know them 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.790
 gold but indeed a project of 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.860
 a small team perfectly 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.329
 your comments and dynamic and who knows where she is going 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.990
 and I think it's absolutely great 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.990
 to attest to the law on the most delicate to water which is a shame 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.899
 daddy la fava to know when we can sow fear 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:18.519
