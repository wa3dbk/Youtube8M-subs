 to the other two young people

 In 1928, the first national football league was created 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.179
 formed by the champions and runners-up of the cup of the king 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.869
 with four Basque teams 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.189
 the arenas of gece 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.949
 the athletic of bilbao 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.010

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.369
 with three Catalans FC Barcelona Barcelona Espanyol Barcelona and European 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.399
 Barcelona 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.649
 i with two teams from Madrid 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.249
 the athletic one of madrid 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.249
 and the real madrid 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.020
 there was a vacancy 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.890
 it's not that what happened 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.840
 because it was decided to form an eliminatory I entered in several teams in 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 to decide even only equipment that was missing 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.290
 that she will start the championship danger in that tie after 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.430
 very exciting final finals full of equality against Sevilla 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.730
 logano the racing of santander 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.250
 that way the league championship was completed or rather the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.520
 first league in Spain with the circumstance that the racing of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.310
 santander 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.790
 that I like to say it was the only team of the 10 that played the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.950
 stay in first division in the field and with sweat d his forehead not with the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 prestige of having won a previous competition 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 there is already 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.770
 for Rajoy the best is 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.380
 and they were lifted with the runner-up in 1931 data points with the first the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.550
 athletic of bilbao 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.470
 in 1931 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.200
 percent the colonial exhibition was held in paris 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.310
 and on the occasion of that international event a series will be organized 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.050
 of sports events including ideas is the newspaper 'le petit alicia y 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.879
 migrations to teams like paris racing a championship was held 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:16.320
 footballing percent champions the percent of the respective countries the 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.809
 league champion espanyol but the athletic 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:23.729
 in June this condition was celebrated in June to 31 I think riac the athletic 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:28.230
 I was still disputing what the elimination phases of the king's cup 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:33.359
 indeci I have not paid the world not to go to that competition so be it went to the 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.359
 second classified that the most important to start the match 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.719
 that raised the respective secum flags of england isner and spain i do not know 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.129
 He hoisted the Spanish flag if he made us the Spanish Republican flag 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.239
 sang the national anthem the irrigation hymn was sung and I think I think I did not 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.139
 I'm wrong if I say that among the first sports society that represented the 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.510
 republic abroad was the racing of Santander and was other in that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.139

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.799
