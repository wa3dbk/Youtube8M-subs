00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
bit but I really don't know what else I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.860 
bit but I really don't know what else I
would<00:02:40.819> be<00:02:40.910> doing<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.420> what<00:02:41.630> would<00:02:41.720> be

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
many subscribers best thing to do is go

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.969
