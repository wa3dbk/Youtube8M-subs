00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.660
 hi to all readers of wenders blogs 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.000
 italy the review of today we want 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.429
 dedicate it to all those who have series 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.190
 difficulty waking up in the morning 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.500
 in fact we'll talk about watts alarms that don't 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.900
 it's just the best awake app 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.280
 for windows phone but it is also an act 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.670
 made in italy as the developer 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.200
 he is a fellow of ours just entered 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.309
 you can quickly access the app 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.960
 to the alarms you have programmed 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.390
 or create new ones of course 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.429
 by pressing the plus key by pressing the key 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.420
 more by selecting an alarm already 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.219
 existing 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.699
 you can change a whole series of 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.429
 settings for example you can activate or 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.589
 minus the alarm set or not the 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.670
 vibration obviously set the time 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.710
 on which days to activate repeat that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.739
 certain alarm clock choose one 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.379
 ringtone among those also offered by 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.560
 developer assign it name for 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.900
 distinguish it from others activate or not 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.610
 the smart alarm clock that allows you to 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.400
 get up during light sleep 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.140
 is therefore more rested by exploiting the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.780
 phone sensors 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.050
 but we will talk more about this later 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.780
 you can also activate or deactivate the alarm 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.030
 anticipated in case of weather conditions 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.610
 adverse or set a mode of 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.530
 advanced shutdown choosing between 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.100
 mathematical operations research of 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.369
 photo result of a qr code 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.530
 others, finally, you can ask 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.009
 awards alarm to suggest when the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.420
 right time to go to sleep 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.850
 coming back 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.830
 the second card is very important 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.170
 instead it collects the graphs of sleep 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.250
 monitor these in particular 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.590
 allow you to observe sleep cycles 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.299
 light and heavy sleep permitting 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.659
 we say the understanding of quality 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.630
 of rest more or less similarly to 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.590
 what the microsoft band does the lo 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.209
 Microsoft's smartwatch to be able to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.310
 take advantage of this feature 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.760
 obviously necessary to position the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.160
 own smartphone on the bed in charge 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.019
 possibly in a position where not 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.150
 risks falling and absolutely in 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.980
 airplane mode since the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.200
 radiation emitted by the smartphone are 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.530
 very dangerous once activated 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.720
 monitoring the phone will detect thanks 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.450
 to the accelerometer our movements 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.720
 thus managing to extinguish ea 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.930
 differentiate precisely the two in the graph 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.670
 types of light and heavy sleep and this 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.950
 it is the function that will then be exploited 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.519
 to get up during sleep 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.590
 light when we are more rested 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.130
 the third section instead collect the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.840
 audio recordings or practically 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.690
 of our chats or 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.370
 our Russian the night probably 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.430
 it's not one of the functions anymore 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.500
 interesting but still complete the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.480
 package making watts has the weapon 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.769
 definitely the best alarm clock app e 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.620
 not only 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.079
 before concluding we do a quick 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.930
 tour in settings where not missing 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.310
 the possibility of for example showing 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.549
 of watches optimized for the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.579
 night view 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.549
 choosing from these to set 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.829
 the brightness the sensitivity of the 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:34.330
 sleep and microphone monitoring 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:36.980
 as well as delaying the start of 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.630
 Records worth mentioning are 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.350
 definitely the settings that 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.540
 allow you to anticipate the alarm in 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.400
 case of rain or snow and that there 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.870
 therefore allow to avoid traffic 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 always arrive on time 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.900
 appointments 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.510
 you can even choose a different one 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.060
 advance based on whether it is raining or snowing 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.390
 and also choose the probability over 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.250
 obviously to the city to be monitored 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.520
 watts alarm on the front of functions 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.550
 undoubtedly the best app wakes up 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.720
 while we hope the developer of the 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.240
 time divas to improve 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.370
 the graphical interface that is not too bad 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.019
 but definitely improved for 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.100
 fully comply with the guidelines 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.830
 dictated by microsoft 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.020
 even if in the end it does not matter given the 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.780
 excellent features that are implemented 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.610
 which are certainly the most important 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.240
 watts alarm available on windows 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.990
 phone store for free but others 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.750
 unlockable features with app purchases 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.360
 at just 99 cents we are talking about e 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.860
 the graphic alarm clock during 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.320
 light sleep and wake up 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.870
 anticipated based on weather conditions 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.040
 monitoring of the trigger that can be activated 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.390
 through this small icon here below is 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.570
 included in the free version then 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.040
 you can use them without problems since 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.530
 immediately even without buying 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.290
 the application do not forget to 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.090
 subscribe to our youtube channel with 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.380
 this is all a Saturday for adriana for 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.380
