00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
alright so we're out at the field and

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.040 
alright so we're out at the field and
it's<00:00:24.130> time<00:00:24.279> to<00:00:24.400> give<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.790> f4<00:00:25.420> phantom<00:00:25.840> from

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
it's time to give the f4 phantom from

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.790 
it's time to give the f4 phantom from

fight will give you a quick flight

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.150 
fight will give you a quick flight
review<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.360> let<00:00:34.390> you<00:00:34.600> know<00:00:34.770> what<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:35.800> think<00:00:35.860> of

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
review and let you know what I think of

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.040 
review and let you know what I think of
its<00:00:36.280> flight<00:00:36.370> characteristics<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.840> we'll<00:00:37.930> see

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
its flight characteristics so we'll see

00:00:38.050 --> 00:02:56.030 
its flight characteristics so we'll see
you<00:00:38.080> in<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.290> sky

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:33.480 

whoo

alright so the videos you just saw were

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.060 
alright so the videos you just saw were
a<00:04:25.480> couple<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.960> flights<00:04:26.230> over<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.650> course<00:04:26.890> of

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
a couple of flights over the course of

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.070 
a couple of flights over the course of
two<00:04:27.340> days<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.850> put<00:04:28.060> about<00:04:28.210> six<00:04:28.600> batteries

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
two days I put about six batteries

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.410 
two days I put about six batteries
through<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.800> f4<00:04:30.160> phantom<00:04:30.640> from<00:04:30.790> nacho<00:04:31.000> planes

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
through the f4 phantom from nacho planes

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.830 
through the f4 phantom from nacho planes
calm<00:04:32.340> once<00:04:33.340> I<00:04:33.490> got<00:04:33.640> her<00:04:33.790> trimmed<00:04:34.120> out<00:04:34.270> she<00:04:34.570> flew

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
calm once I got her trimmed out she flew

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.470 
calm once I got her trimmed out she flew
straight<00:04:35.350> as<00:04:35.620> an<00:04:35.770> arrow<00:04:35.910> she<00:04:36.910> flew<00:04:37.120> really

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
straight as an arrow she flew really

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.870 
straight as an arrow she flew really
nice<00:04:37.660> she's<00:04:37.870> got<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.050> nice<00:04:38.470> slow<00:04:38.860> speed<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.490> a

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
nice she's got a nice slow speed and a

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.780 
nice she's got a nice slow speed and a
nice<00:04:40.090> high-end<00:04:40.420> speed<00:04:40.900> as<00:04:41.080> well<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.580> only

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
nice high-end speed as well but the only

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.060 
nice high-end speed as well but the only
thing<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.210> can<00:04:43.270> warn<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.080> about<00:04:44.320> is<00:04:44.740> you're

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
thing I can warn you about is you're

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.090 
thing I can warn you about is you're
really<00:04:45.580> tight<00:04:46.030> turns<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:47.500> plane<00:04:47.770> does<00:04:47.950> have

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
really tight turns this plane does have

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.210 
really tight turns this plane does have
a<00:04:48.130> tendency<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.850> drop<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.600> nose<00:04:49.890> quite<00:04:50.890> a<00:04:50.920> bit

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
a tendency to drop the nose quite a bit

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.970 
a tendency to drop the nose quite a bit
because<00:04:51.670> there<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.150> no<00:04:52.420> active<00:04:52.690> rudder<00:04:53.200> so<00:04:53.890> you

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
because there is no active rudder so you

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.190 
because there is no active rudder so you
can't<00:04:54.370> compensate<00:04:54.820> with<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.210> rudder<00:04:55.510> so<00:04:55.750> just

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
can't compensate with a rudder so just

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.450 
can't compensate with a rudder so just
be<00:04:56.320> aware<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.590> when<00:04:56.860> you're<00:04:56.980> flying<00:04:57.190> it

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
be aware that when you're flying it

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.580 
be aware that when you're flying it
watch<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.700> really<00:04:58.210> tight<00:04:58.450> turns<00:04:58.780> as<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.380> said

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
watch the really tight turns as I said

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.250 
watch the really tight turns as I said
the<00:04:59.710> nose<00:04:59.890> which<00:05:00.130> kind<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.520> drop<00:05:00.790> on<00:05:01.000> you<00:05:01.260> the

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
the nose which kind of drop on you the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.140 
the nose which kind of drop on you the
other<00:05:02.470> thing<00:05:02.770> I'll<00:05:02.980> just<00:05:03.370> let<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:03.580> know<00:05:03.910> about

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
other thing I'll just let you know about

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.690 
other thing I'll just let you know about
is<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:05.020> way<00:05:05.230> that<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.680> battery<00:05:06.190> sits<00:05:06.490> inside

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
is the way that the battery sits inside

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.930 
is the way that the battery sits inside
the<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:08.020> front<00:05:08.320> end<00:05:08.530> here<00:05:08.860> if<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.640> don't<00:05:09.820> get

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
the the front end here if you don't get

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.850 
the the front end here if you don't get
the<00:05:10.060> wires<00:05:10.300> just<00:05:10.750> right<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.200> have<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.380> set<00:05:11.680> in

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
the wires just right and have a set in

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.250 
the wires just right and have a set in
there<00:05:11.980> nice<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.250> tight<00:05:12.930> even<00:05:13.930> though<00:05:14.050> the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
there nice and tight even though the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.040 
there nice and tight even though the
canopies<00:05:14.860> held<00:05:15.100> down<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.610> slides<00:05:16.120> inside<00:05:16.450> and

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
canopies held down and slides inside and

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.230 
canopies held down and slides inside and
held<00:05:17.230> down<00:05:17.410> by<00:05:17.440> rare<00:05:18.130> earth<00:05:18.400> magnets<00:05:19.000> at<00:05:19.150> the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
held down by rare earth magnets at the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.870 
held down by rare earth magnets at the
top<00:05:19.480> here<00:05:19.750> if<00:05:20.320> you<00:05:20.890> don't<00:05:21.010> have<00:05:21.250> it<00:05:21.280> just<00:05:21.610> right

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
top here if you don't have it just right

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.820 
top here if you don't have it just right
and<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:22.180> don't<00:05:22.360> hear<00:05:22.570> it<00:05:22.720> block<00:05:23.080> make<00:05:23.800> sure

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
and you don't hear it block make sure

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.170 
and you don't hear it block make sure
you<00:05:24.100> hear<00:05:24.310> that<00:05:24.490> snap<00:05:26.280> like<00:05:27.280> that<00:05:27.310> of<00:05:27.880> the

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
you hear that snap like that of the

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.820 
you hear that snap like that of the
magnets<00:05:28.690> grabbing<00:05:29.140> really<00:05:29.380> tight<00:05:29.590> otherwise

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
magnets grabbing really tight otherwise

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.010 
magnets grabbing really tight otherwise
as<00:05:30.700> I<00:05:30.820> learned<00:05:31.000> on<00:05:31.120> my<00:05:31.210> second<00:05:31.630> flight<00:05:31.810> I

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
as I learned on my second flight I

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.840 
as I learned on my second flight I
wasn't<00:05:32.770> paying<00:05:32.950> attention<00:05:33.100> I<00:05:33.520> was<00:05:33.640> trying<00:05:33.820> to

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
wasn't paying attention I was trying to

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.850 
wasn't paying attention I was trying to
get<00:05:33.970> going<00:05:34.270> really<00:05:34.390> fast<00:05:34.720> so<00:05:35.350> I<00:05:35.380> didn't<00:05:35.770> get

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
get going really fast so I didn't get

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.990 
get going really fast so I didn't get
the<00:05:35.980> wires<00:05:36.220> moved<00:05:36.580> out<00:05:36.730> of<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.880> way<00:05:36.940> just

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
the wires moved out of the way just

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.420 
the wires moved out of the way just
right<00:05:37.450> and<00:05:37.630> she<00:05:37.930> didn't<00:05:38.200> click<00:05:38.470> so<00:05:39.040> halfway

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
right and she didn't click so halfway

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.280 
right and she didn't click so halfway
through<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:39.880> flight<00:05:40.030> I<00:05:40.150> noticed<00:05:40.630> my<00:05:40.780> canopy

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
through the flight I noticed my canopy

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.640 
through the flight I noticed my canopy
was<00:05:41.440> sitting<00:05:41.800> up<00:05:41.950> like<00:05:42.010> so<00:05:43.140> which<00:05:44.140> could<00:05:44.440> cause

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
was sitting up like so which could cause
