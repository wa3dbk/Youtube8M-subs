00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.190
 how about friends and welcome to this 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.930
 new video this time I bring you 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.450
 something that I call changing 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.220
 strategy in searching and destroying and for 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.800
 that we are going to go here to create a 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.840
 class and I'm going to tell you what it is that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.430
 they have to do first they have nothing 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.289
 have to do a class that you 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.140
 feel comfortable with her that you 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.510
 say this class is the one with me 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.400
 hallo is with which I always win over 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.340
 everything not so much the class but the weapon 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.590
 main preferably I recommend them 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.910
 that is an assault but as I say 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.739
 there will be some of you that are more 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.140
 good with him a suv more chingÃ³n light 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.809
 boxing or not what I know then good 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.440
 do that class in another class I want you 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.110
 make one with klein ers flamers or betis 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.910
 but I would recommend them to be worse 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.670
 clay merz 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.230
 in the class they are going to do a collection of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.910
 centex 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.670
 and I think that is the only thing 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.650
 we need so let's go now to 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.300
 what is the game this time 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.280
 I'm going to show you how this technique works 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.440
 on three different occasions or three 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.300
 different moments of the game is not a 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.119
 full game since it is simply 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.280
 a video to share how it works 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.900
 and how you can help this technique as well 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.760
 let's go there friends I see them in 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.070
 a moment more 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.750
 today of the friends I am back and 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.430
 while watching this first round of 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.250
 instruction I want to do two 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.750
 questions number one is you when 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.180
 they play the first round of searching and 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.860
 destroy what they do good in me 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.900
 case sometimes use to see 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.460
 how enemies play and that's what 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.220
 gives a better idea of how I should play 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.020
 and question number two is always 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.440
 you play with the same class is the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.700
 end of the game or not in my case is 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.250
 of what I want to talk to you on this day 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.810
 because I want to tell you that it is necessary 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.850
 that when they start playing with a 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.700
 class have to end up with that same 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.560
 class here what I can observe is 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.630
 that several enemies were coming for the part 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.400
 from below other quants for the cover 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.260
 as you can see here I already killed two 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.390
 enemies below 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.000
 and here in the background I want you to observe how 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.410
 behind them an enemy gets 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.060
 then it is also another thing that I could 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.310
 observe in the first round whereby 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.280
 with all the intention the semis always 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.590
 esteem that the enemy is what happens 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.240
 as I killed an enemy for the part 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.800
 of the cover most likely in 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.380
 the second did not do the same thing that did not 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.120
 out there I also observed the ones 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.430
 they came down but this time what 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.530
 that I decided was to go find the one that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.720
 put behind a and kill him again 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.480
 with some centex for which I left my 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.770
 same class and as you can see in the background 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.900
 this pause in the video and they will see how 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.330
 still there I launched my centex though 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.190
 unfortunately he had flag jacket 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.460
 but you know he was dead 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.320
 and sure then friends here what I 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.360
 I 'm going to tell you, we're trying 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.280
 again what about the kleiner that this 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.350
 sorry about the centex and it did not work 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.480
 what are we going to do now now 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.250
 let's look for a strategy change and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.930
 see if we can kill or those who 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.500
 come down or to the one who comes by 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.360
 the cover 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.340
 this time I decided the one that come by 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.940
 the cover so I took my gun more 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.410
 strong or with which I am more 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 and what is it that happens that I run 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.190
 quickly and killed him maybe if he 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.590
 I would have killed also with the scalar 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.860
 but how about civilized further back the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.900
 scratch moves more then for more 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.110
 sure I took the weapon with the one I most 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.450
 helped here as I already tried what the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.370
 bomb from behind there did not work for me and 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.720
 as also try it from the cover to 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.160
 Although it did work for me 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.830
 probable is that now the enemy is 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.990
 outside on the other hand I tried to decide 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.720
 the ones below preparing a trap 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.790
 with play merz here I put it I give myself 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.530
 mind that comes with a shotgun I do not know 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.240
 how he did not give me too I committed the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.160
 error of having fired but still 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.160
 fell here even though it has flag already 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.110
 I killed him with me in 94 then 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.790
 friends here as you can see there are points 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.770
 they want to tell us that there is not always 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.900
 to finish with the same weapon and there 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.270
 what to look for strategy changes to 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.950
 to help us improve now here 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.750
 I'm showing some parts where they 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.880
 I recommend putting play mars and where not 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.860
 I recommend you in these that just 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.480
 I do not recommend them because they are 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.910
 places where the enemies 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.920
 wait but how about we go here 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.139
 when I'm going to show you and we put it 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.749
 here generally the enemies 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.459
 they wait there at the last point not them 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:22.379
 I recommend that you put them because it's a 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.810
 very fast step so despite 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:27.360
 that have 1 flag since most likely 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.819
 it's Monday, nothing, because they 're going very fast 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.069
 then either put a here or in 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.449
 the last two points or even here 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.039
 although it will be more complicated to get there 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.169
 here because the enemies are going to be 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.389
 around the corner but they are 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.949
 places where I recommend them and 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.539
 good friends the video is over 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.249
 Give me your like if you have more 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:48.409
 tutorials on how to improve in black ops 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.409
 2 see you next video bye
