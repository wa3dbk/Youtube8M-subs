00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 U 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.100
 Of the people dont gasina e first the affects of a bike engine 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.990
 Clouds 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:20.010
 So going shoe and pedal to pass a small force Holidays 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.010
 Let me see. 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.140
 There are different kinds of pedals depending on the application. 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.900
 In Cleveland panels it is commonly used to weigh down the clip Legaspi 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.199
 It has various shapes 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.070
 So if you need to change to fade to suit your application 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:43.930
 Use post-polymerization delivered training or specialized training 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.860
 Screw the direction of delivery is different then the general direction opposite to the direction 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.750
 To remove the left pedal, turn the pedal wrench horizontally and firmly in the clockwise direction 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.320
 Turn 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.699
 Able to roll the pedal crank and returning the right pedal in the counter-clockwise direction 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 It's possible 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:03.280
 You can combine deliveries that are in reverse order of this operation into a crank 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:08.920
 Please tighten the joint so that it does not come loose. 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:13.030
 At this time, since the things below the adrenal gland are a momentary business, dr 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:19.840
 Please note that you may get injured in the pit 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:23.290
 So let's see what otters are on the bike this time. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.000
 Bicycle salts shoes to nature as Degas and insurance as required by the particular line and presence 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.150
 We recommend functional shoes because 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.870
 First, from the general, such as shoes 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.600
 There are many kinds of shoes ranging from bike shoes 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.600
 You have to make a choice depending on the pedal used for the bike's unit 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.490
 Then how to adjust the Clovis pedal and how to clip the shoe 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.330
 Let me see. 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.200
 If the clip of the bicycle is attached to the scanner, you can attach the clip 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.710
 You must choose 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.890
 The part of the clip attached to the shoe bottom 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.890
 First place the clip on the shoe and place the washer on the cleave groove 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.039
 Next , insert the bolts and tighten them with a bench for 2 persons . 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.630
 You can adjust your foot to 10 degrees inward on your foot, 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.849
 Tighten 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.600
 When attaching the click of a shoe, the shoe and the clipping part on both sides of the left and right sides are inside the esophagus 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.440
 Should be mounted 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.600
 If it is different, it will come to your legs or your posture will be incorrect. 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.970
 I will not. 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:36.640
 Combined with precise separation from the lead if you use the first Clueless Pedal 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.080
 It is quite convenient to let you know how to make the most of your bike's power. 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.240
 Not only that 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.820
 Even if there is a part where the delay like the non-sleep is unknown, it is very emotional 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.890
 You can pedal 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:55.510
 When you raise the delivery clip, push the heel slightly while pushing forward 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.800
 If you hear a click , the clip is attached to the moon 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.590
 If it does not fit well , twist it lightly to the left and right while holding the heel 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.120
 I will push forward. 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.250
 If you want to separate the joined clips, use the new heel so that you can click 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.250
 It can be easily separated with sound 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.549
 If the Clevis pedal has a strong spin, it will not fall well at three years of age. 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.150
 When 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:24.230
 If the steam is weak, it will fall well. 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.000
 The strength of the sting is decreased by 3 and the plus and minus hexagons 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.879
 It can be adjusted with a bolt. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.520
 Turning in the plus direction will make the feature stronger. 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:36.640
 - You will be able to tweak the execution to the direction 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:42.910
 You can use it now . 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:46.110
 Always get off the bike. Let's not forget this clip, Bliss. 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.110
 Could it be too much
