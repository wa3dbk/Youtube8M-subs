 welcome to crafts with children 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.590
 dotcom episode 658 how to make a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.610
 support or basic base for your dolls 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.410
 monster high materials bottle 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.480
 shampoo masking tape and scissors hello today 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.090
 let's make this nice support for you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.460
 Monster high doll we are going to use a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.890
 shampoo bottle that reaches at least the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.280
 neck of our wrist or part 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.070
 superior let's start by promoting the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.840
 label the bottle and we're going to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.570
 use a bottle that is already pre 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.969
 washed we are going to remove the part of the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.160
 half of the bottle leaving the part of 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.489
 down and some top 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.300
 to form the base that must remain 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.989
 in this way 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.810
 then we will form what will be the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.140
 top part so that it grabs the 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.700
 doll you can decorate your base using 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.090
 adhesive tape plastic gems painting 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.360
 high fabric here I will use a piece 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.159
 of my plastic discarded and what this 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.180
 will do is that my base is much more 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.950
 big I'm going to cut the base in shape 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.530
 of circle but they can do it from 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.390
 any way you want or a heart 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.630
 for example for back color towards if 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.140
 they want or draculaura in Spanish and good 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.570
 here I'm going to start decorating my base 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.850
 I in my case will make this base for 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.060
 my franky doll so I'm going to use 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.720
 a piece of duct tape and it's fine 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.360
 simple how can you see and using the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.869
 adhesive tape itself I'm going to paste the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.110
 part that I did down from my base to 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.539
 my base in if at home if you wish 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.000
 they can use materials that go 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.850
 according to your wrist 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.250
 example can use red for julia 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.770
 can use purple for spectrum 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.700
 They can use sea shells to 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.350
 lagoon and so on I hope you do 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.080
 this project at home and that is well 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.420
 versatile and very easy to do and we 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.420
 we will see in the next video bye bye
