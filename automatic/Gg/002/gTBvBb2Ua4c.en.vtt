painted<00:01:05.100> piece<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.489> metal<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.180> give<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
painted piece of metal will not give you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.750 
painted piece of metal will not give you
accurate<00:01:06.689> readings<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> I'd<00:01:08.610> recommend

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
accurate readings so I'd recommend

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
accurate readings so I'd recommend
connecting<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> earth<00:01:09.689> lead<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> screw<00:01:10.619> as

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
connecting the earth lead to a screw as

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.030 
connecting the earth lead to a screw as
shown<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:12.689> good<00:01:12.810> practice<00:01:13.260> I've<00:01:13.470> placed

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
shown here for good practice I've placed

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
shown here for good practice I've placed
a<00:01:14.220> mug<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.460> water<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> microwave<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.080> there

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
a mug of water in the microwave so there

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.780 
a mug of water in the microwave so there
is<00:01:16.409> something<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.009> while<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.400> powered

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
is something in there while it's powered
