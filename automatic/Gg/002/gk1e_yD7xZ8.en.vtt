00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
I'm Doug from global West and what we're

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.830 
I'm Doug from global West and what we're
going<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.700> discuss<00:00:09.090> in<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.540> particular

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
going to discuss in this particular

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.039 
going to discuss in this particular
segment<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.710> spring<00:00:11.519> spacers<00:00:12.090> now<00:00:12.870> these

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
segment is spring spacers now these

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.900 
segment is spring spacers now these
spacers<00:00:13.469> go<00:00:13.650> underneath<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.280> coil<00:00:14.490> spring

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
spacers go underneath the coil spring

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.910 
spacers go underneath the coil spring
for<00:00:15.389> lifting<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> vehicle<00:00:15.900> they<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.560> not<00:00:16.770> go

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
for lifting the vehicle they do not go

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.279 
for lifting the vehicle they do not go
in<00:00:17.160> between<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.520> coils<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> few

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
in between the coils and we have a few

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.519 
in between the coils and we have a few
different<00:00:19.410> spacers<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> table<00:00:21.529> what

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
different spacers here on the table what

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.349 
different spacers here on the table what
we're<00:00:22.680> mainly<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.189> address<00:00:23.670> here<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
we're mainly going to address here is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.950 
we're mainly going to address here is
the<00:00:24.840> differences<00:00:25.289> between<00:00:25.500> them<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.750> why<00:00:27.750> we

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the differences between them and why we

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.269 
the differences between them and why we
have<00:00:28.170> these<00:00:28.320> rings<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.160> these

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
have these rings here now these

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.589 
have these rings here now these
particular<00:00:29.640> rings<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
particular rings are going to be for the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.740 
particular rings are going to be for the
tubular<00:00:30.869> arm<00:00:31.140> our<00:00:31.410> tubular<00:00:31.679> arm<00:00:31.859> packages<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
tubular arm our tubular arm packages and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.350 
tubular arm our tubular arm packages and
these<00:00:33.750> spacers<00:00:34.170> over<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:35.120> are<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.270> we're

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
these spacers over here are what we're

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.770 
these spacers over here are what we're
going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> show<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:36.899> stock<00:00:37.110> arms<00:00:38.780> so

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
going to show you for stock arms so

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.170 
going to show you for stock arms so
let's<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> started<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.460> stock<00:00:41.670> arm<00:00:44.180> we

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
let's get started with the stock arm we

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.810 
let's get started with the stock arm we
have<00:00:45.210> several<00:00:45.570> different<00:00:45.719> types<00:00:46.789> we<00:00:47.789> have

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
have several different types we have

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.990 
have several different types we have
aluminum<00:00:48.270> spacers<00:00:49.280> we<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> couple<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
aluminum spacers we have a couple that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.520 
aluminum spacers we have a couple that
are<00:00:51.030> actually<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> high<00:00:51.660> density<00:00:51.809> rubber<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
are actually a high density rubber and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
are actually a high density rubber and
then<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:54.059> also<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> few<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
then we we also have a few that are a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.490 
then we we also have a few that are a
polyurethane<00:00:55.379> type<00:00:56.070> cushion<00:00:56.750> which<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:58.020> used

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
polyurethane type cushion which are used

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.900 
polyurethane type cushion which are used
on<00:00:58.739> Mustang<00:00:59.160> cats<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.930> this<00:01:00.930> particular<00:01:01.910> unit

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
on Mustang cats and this particular unit

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.250 
on Mustang cats and this particular unit
right<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:03.390> comes<00:01:03.629> standard<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.170> our

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
right here which comes standard in our

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.590 
right here which comes standard in our
tubular<00:01:04.830> control<00:01:05.100> arms<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.420> high

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
tubular control arms this is a high

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
tubular control arms this is a high
density<00:01:06.750> urethane<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.530> well<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.979> call<00:01:08.189> them

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
density urethane as well we call them

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700 
density urethane as well we call them
spring<00:01:08.549> cushions<00:01:09.049> they<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> base<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
spring cushions they go on the base of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.700 
spring cushions they go on the base of
our<00:01:10.830> control<00:01:11.130> arms<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.960> lot<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> people<00:01:13.290> ask<00:01:13.500> us

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
our control arms a lot of people ask us

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.950 
our control arms a lot of people ask us
okay<00:01:13.860> would<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.430> run<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.909> cushion<00:01:15.180> does

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
okay would you run in this cushion does

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.710 
okay would you run in this cushion does
our<00:01:16.110> control<00:01:16.530> arm<00:01:16.770> cause<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.150> car<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> raise

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
our control arm cause the car to raise

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260 
our control arm cause the car to raise
or<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.860> drop<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> pocket<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.030> whatever

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
or are we drop in the pocket or whatever

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
or are we drop in the pocket or whatever
and<00:01:21.659> now<00:01:21.780> our<00:01:21.960> control<00:01:22.290> arms<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.560> set<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and now our control arms are set up so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.310 
and now our control arms are set up so
that<00:01:23.009> when<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.400> cushion<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.880> being<00:01:24.150> used<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that when this cushion is being used it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.010 
that when this cushion is being used it
simulates<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.430> stock<00:01:27.000> height<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> lower

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
simulates the stock height in the lower

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.480 
simulates the stock height in the lower
control<00:01:28.350> arm<00:01:28.619> okay<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
control arm okay so here we have a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
control arm okay so here we have a
controller<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:34.470> you'll<00:01:34.619> notice<00:01:34.740> inside

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
controller and if you'll notice inside

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950 
controller and if you'll notice inside
here<00:01:35.700> there's<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> pocket<00:01:36.240> where<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> spring

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
here there's a pocket where the spring

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
here there's a pocket where the spring
is<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> sit<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> there's<00:01:38.369> an<00:01:38.520> index<00:01:38.880> for

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
is going to sit and there's an index for

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.710 
is going to sit and there's an index for
the<00:01:39.240> spring<00:01:39.799> well<00:01:40.799> these<00:01:41.700> particular<00:01:41.909> spacers

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the spring well these particular spacers

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.330 
the spring well these particular spacers
I<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.439> call<00:01:43.560> them<00:01:43.680> horseshoes<00:01:44.100> that's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
I like to call them horseshoes that's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.969 
I like to call them horseshoes that's
kind<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.060> look<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.799> go<00:01:46.799> in

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
kind of what they look like here go in

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.710 
kind of what they look like here go in
the<00:01:47.100> index<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.890> pocket<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.509> stock

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the index in the pocket of the stock

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.030 
the index in the pocket of the stock
lower<00:01:51.930> control<00:01:52.259> arm<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.619> see<00:01:52.770> how<00:01:52.829> nice

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
lower control arm you can see how nice

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.590 
lower control arm you can see how nice
that<00:01:53.250> fits<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> spring<00:01:56.600> actually

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that fits and then the spring actually

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.370 
that fits and then the spring actually
just<00:01:57.869> simply<00:01:58.049> sits<00:01:59.420> it<00:02:00.420> follows<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> contour

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
just simply sits it follows the contour

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350 
just simply sits it follows the contour
of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> spring<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.070> sits<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.060> spring

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
of the spring and sits in the spring

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.839 
of the spring and sits in the spring
pocket<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:08.069> way<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.369> works<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.789> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
pocket like that the way this works on a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.530 
pocket like that the way this works on a
GM<00:02:09.209> application<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.180> mainly<00:02:12.330> for

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
GM application and this is mainly for

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.020 
GM application and this is mainly for
the<00:02:12.599> older<00:02:12.810> cars

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the older cars

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.500 
the older cars
is<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.390> one<00:02:15.960> at<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.110> spring<00:02:16.760> what<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.240> for

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
is that one at the spring what like for

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.740 
is that one at the spring what like for
example<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.260> inch<00:02:19.470> spacer<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:21.510> going

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
example this is one inch spacer is going

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.920 
example this is one inch spacer is going
to<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.960> double<00:02:22.410> at<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:23.040> fender<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:24.420> this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
to be double at the fender so this

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.620 
to be double at the fender so this
spacer<00:02:25.470> will<00:02:26.430> actually<00:02:26.730> give<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.000> two<00:02:27.240> inches

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
spacer will actually give you two inches

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.330 
spacer will actually give you two inches
of<00:02:27.870> change<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:29.640> fender<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.980> measure<00:02:32.160> it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
of change at the fender you measure it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.150 
of change at the fender you measure it
from<00:02:32.430> fender<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.790> ground<00:02:33.000> okay<00:02:33.710> we<00:02:34.710> have<00:02:34.980> them

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
from fender to ground okay we have them

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.300 
from fender to ground okay we have them
in<00:02:35.250> different<00:02:35.490> heights<00:02:36.170> 3/8<00:02:37.640> 5/8<00:02:38.640> 1/2<00:02:39.240> inch

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
in different heights 3/8 5/8 1/2 inch

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.190 
in different heights 3/8 5/8 1/2 inch
3/4<00:02:41.310> 1<00:02:41.790> inch<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.480> you've<00:02:42.600> got<00:02:42.630> all<00:02:43.020> these

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
3/4 1 inch and so you've got all these

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.920 
3/4 1 inch and so you've got all these
different<00:02:43.260> applications<00:02:44.660> for<00:02:45.660> different

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
different applications for different

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.930 
different applications for different
ride<00:02:46.350> heights<00:02:46.650> available<00:02:47.370> through<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.730> type

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
ride heights available through this type

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.410 
ride heights available through this type
of<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.210> spacer<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.640> rubber<00:02:50.850> ones<00:02:51.090> there's<00:02:51.270> only

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
of a spacer the rubber ones there's only

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.530 
of a spacer the rubber ones there's only
two<00:02:51.630> sizes<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:52.140> got<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> 3/4<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.280> got<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.540> got

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
two sizes we got a 3/4 and we got a got

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.250 
two sizes we got a 3/4 and we got a got
a<00:02:54.570> 9/16<00:02:55.520> now<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.580> difference<00:02:56.940> between<00:02:57.260> this

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
a 9/16 now the difference between this

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.810 
a 9/16 now the difference between this
type<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.640> rubber<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.890> get<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
type and the rubber is that get the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.630 
type and the rubber is that get the
setup<00:03:03.180> here<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.710> this<00:03:04.920> rubber<00:03:05.190> forms

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
setup here is that this rubber forms

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.300 
setup here is that this rubber forms
around<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> spring<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:10.830> forms<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
around the spring see it just forms it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.850 
around the spring see it just forms it
drops<00:03:11.520> right<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.260> then<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.470> will<00:03:13.680> sit

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
drops right in and then this will sit

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.520 
drops right in and then this will sit
into<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.100> pocket<00:03:14.660> now<00:03:15.660> some<00:03:15.960> comments<00:03:16.440> have

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
into the pocket now some comments have

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.250 
into the pocket now some comments have
been<00:03:16.560> made<00:03:16.800> well<00:03:17.270> if<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:18.480> put<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.810> aluminum

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
been made well if you put this aluminum

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.810 
been made well if you put this aluminum
spacer<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.830> there<00:03:20.070> I'm<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.580> hear<00:03:20.790> a

spacer in there I'm going to hear a

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.720 
spacer in there I'm going to hear a
noise<00:03:21.030> or<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:22.560> know<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> popping<00:03:23.160> sound<00:03:23.190> or

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
make it sometimes a little easier to

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.600 
make it sometimes a little easier to
form<00:03:43.260> around<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> spring<00:03:43.920> pocket<00:03:44.310> itself

some<00:03:44.910> guys<00:03:45.090> are<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.239> little<00:03:45.330> bit<00:03:45.480> more

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
some guys are a little bit more

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.440 
some guys are a little bit more
comfortable<00:03:45.959> with<00:03:46.080> this<00:03:47.239> again<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.330> really

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
comfortable with this again it really

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.690 
comfortable with this again it really
doesn't<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.739> not<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> big<00:03:50.100> issue<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.459> can<00:03:50.580> go

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
doesn't it's not a big issue you can go

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.180 
doesn't it's not a big issue you can go
either<00:03:50.880> direction<00:03:51.000> ok<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.230> there's<00:03:52.860> still<00:03:53.040> no

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
either direction ok and there's still no

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.229 
either direction ok and there's still no
noise<00:03:53.430> all<00:03:53.970> right<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.760> now<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:56.820> have<00:03:57.209> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
noise all right so now we have a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.880 
noise all right so now we have a
situation<00:03:57.570> where<00:03:58.080> I've<00:03:58.260> got<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.470> tubular

here there's a flat plate down at the
base<00:04:15.650> ok<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:17.609> cannot<00:04:18.030> use<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.450> spacer<00:04:19.200> like

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
base ok you cannot use a spacer like

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.690 
base ok you cannot use a spacer like
this<00:04:19.859> in<00:04:20.720> something<00:04:21.720> with<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> flat<00:04:22.109> space<00:04:22.700> it's

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
this in something with a flat space it's

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.340 
this in something with a flat space it's
you<00:04:24.120> know<00:04:24.240> on<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.600> base<00:04:24.750> down<00:04:24.990> here<00:04:25.169> it's<00:04:25.289> not

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
you know on the base down here it's not

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.750 
you know on the base down here it's not
going<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.590> work

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
going to work

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.180 
going to work
this<00:04:27.330> does<00:04:27.780> not<00:04:27.960> fit<00:04:28.230> this<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.560> contoured<00:04:29.100> to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
this does not fit this is contoured to

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.430 
this does not fit this is contoured to
fit<00:04:29.220> inside<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.760> pocket<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:30.960> if<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.140> go<00:04:31.230> on<00:04:31.350> to

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
fit inside the pocket so if you go on to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.890 
fit inside the pocket so if you go on to
something<00:04:31.770> flat<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.030> going<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.360> rock<00:04:33.600> and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
something flat this is going to rock and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.290 
something flat this is going to rock and
it<00:04:34.350> could<00:04:34.560> actually<00:04:34.590> crack<00:04:35.370> I've<00:04:35.700> seen<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
it could actually crack I've seen the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.750 
it could actually crack I've seen the
real<00:04:36.480> thin<00:04:36.750> ones<00:04:36.960> like<00:04:37.140> 3/8<00:04:37.500> inch<00:04:37.710> crack<00:04:38.520> when

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
real thin ones like 3/8 inch crack when

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.130 
real thin ones like 3/8 inch crack when
they<00:04:38.850> try<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.090> do<00:04:39.300> something<00:04:39.540> like<00:04:39.780> that

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
they try to do something like that

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.960 
they try to do something like that
if<00:04:40.200> it<00:04:40.410> forms<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.920> the<00:04:40.950> pocket<00:04:41.490> where<00:04:41.670> it's<00:04:41.820> got

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
if it forms to the pocket where it's got

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.390 
if it forms to the pocket where it's got
the<00:04:42.120> dip<00:04:42.360> it's<00:04:42.570> not<00:04:43.020> going<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.290> do<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.680> so

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
the dip it's not going to do that so

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.470 
the dip it's not going to do that so
