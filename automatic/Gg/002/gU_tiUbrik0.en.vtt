00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.599
 for dj set up de i want you today 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.410
 show how to modifier in tractor pro 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.269
 uses 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.450
 we have tractors here in front of us 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.940
 the version 2.5 1 but it is synonymous with 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:22.070
 older versions of what we do today 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.870
 want this one poté here is him 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.080
 to give a double occupancy and that 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.990
 once the lore just function so 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.140
 deep in and out and turn once 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.900
 the filter function so lopez until 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.600
 Durable filter both on the same 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.480
 pot how to achieve that 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.489
 works through modifier some 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.899
 terms the first time 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.970
 you should know about talking about today 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.000
 modifier you have in tractor pro 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.860
 eight pieces available 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.100
 We talk about modifier values 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.160
 these range from 0 to 7 as well 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.180
 a total of eight values ​​and we go from 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.159
 conditions 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:13.130
 So that's a condition for this 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.229
 function only when we do the whole thing 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.610
 we're going to a controller manager myself 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.619
 have my device in the case the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.560
 son k2 is synonymous with each other 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.680
 equipment created and must first 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.360
 I now create my modifier since I 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.430
 no other modifier yet 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:35.140
 I have the first one right away 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.140
 So I say add-in modifier modifier 1 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.729
 you can see above under modifier state here 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.189
 in this bar also see which 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.770
 status what value the modifier 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.320
 Right now we all see 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.229
 eight modifiers have the value 0 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.150
 We are only interested in modifier 1 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.150
 here also the value is 0 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.390
 I would like to click on this button now 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.909
 Put the function of the modifier switch 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.670
 So if I should press the button 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.420
 The fashion celebration will change its status 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.110
 namely from zero to one and therefore sooner 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.570
 back when I press again from 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.970
 zero as often as I would like one 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:25.280
 ball function what I can do now 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:30.090
 i can say in the modifications 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:35.730
 if modifier 1 has the value zero and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:39.750
 that's just the case then me 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.400
 learn a button on the pressure 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:48.990
 on the button give the modifier 1 please 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:53.459
 the value 1 so again on this 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.100
 button pressure only if mode freedom 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:01.050
 the value zero has the value of 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:05.690
 modifier science on 1 the same 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.690
 I'll create it again 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.290
 modifier 1 I'm learning the same again 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.940
 button and say in mine now 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:22.680
 conditions but perform if modifier 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.459
 1 then has the status of one 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:33.060
 pressure on the button go directly and 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.400
 set the value to zero so if modify 11 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.340
 is and I press the button go on 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.549
 zero 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.060
 if modifier 1 to 0 and has 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:49.230
 I press the button give the model 4.1 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:53.250
 the value of 1 if you are up here now 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.400
 Once again you can see that I am with 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.019
 the pressure of this button now the value 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.880
 the modify can swing it back and forth 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.900
 now i can already have my bread here 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.760
 move up 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:15.480
 as in our example would have mixa 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:20.660
 equalizer lohe just learn this putty 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:25.139
 also give it a condition 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:30.259
 this function of the leader has the 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:32.280
 please only if the modifier 10 is 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:36.800
 we see up here that's right now 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:41.460
 the case so if I turn the pro 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:50.130
 I can see the deep ones here 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:53.940
 justin addition would have mixa filter 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.690
 I learn just to the same partie 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.160
 and say 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:05.220
 the professional should this function but only 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.660
 because modifier 1 has the value 1 has that 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.520
 is not the case right now 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.419
 therefore the partie still reserves 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.389
 The function of the manager as soon as I am 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:19.310
 but now with the pressure on the button 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.310
 Change the value of the model to 1 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.979
 this part becomes the filter in just 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:33.139
 I mean here in the mix reaction of 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:36.050
 is portable quiet again it did 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.900
 I use the equalizer functions again 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.789
 on it have the filter function 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.710
 So that's a very complete one now 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.969
 simple application example of body 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.319
 of course you can still celebrate with it 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.419
 to do a lot more 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.909
 especially helpful modifier if 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:53.199
 you only have a limited number of buttons 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.550
 nobs and fields has left attention 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.789
 then I can do that with the simple one 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.229
 Suddenly press a modifier one 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.889
 completely new layer on mine 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:06.560
 controller could prove for example 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.500
 I have a complete mapping for decker 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.460
 design and once I umswitchen 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.810
 i have a new napping for dect or me 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.960
 could be with these four fields here 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:23.389
 apply effects and as soon as I get this 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.729
 button press I have a completely new 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.919
 a series of effects I use 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:33.349
 can 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:34.940
 you see the borders are very very very 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.919
 you can do a lot 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.629
 To make it important what you make of it 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.279
 if you interesting possibility 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.020
 found to apply modifier 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.110
