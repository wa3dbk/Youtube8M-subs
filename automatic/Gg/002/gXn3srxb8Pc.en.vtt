games<00:00:40.210> were<00:00:40.420> really<00:00:40.690> about<00:00:40.899> building<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.530> base

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
games were really about building a base

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.889 
games were really about building a base
defending<00:00:42.610> that<00:00:42.730> base<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.239> building<00:00:43.809> an

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
defending that base and building an

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.360 
defending that base and building an
assault<00:00:44.200> army<00:00:44.680> that<00:00:44.770> you<00:00:44.890> could<00:00:45.040> go<00:00:45.130> attack

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
assault army that you could go attack

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.030

the<00:00:45.670> other<00:00:45.790> base<00:00:45.969> first<00:00:46.450> thing<00:00:46.690> we<00:00:46.809> said<00:00:47.020> is<00:00:47.380> we

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
the other base first thing we said is we

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.190 
the other base first thing we said is we
need<00:00:48.219> to<00:00:48.340> kind<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.610> wash<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.390> stain<00:00:49.629> of<00:00:49.660> CNC
