and<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.130> find<00:00:29.369> these<00:00:29.429> cooking<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.000> do

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and you find these cooking so you can do

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.490 
and you find these cooking so you can do
this<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.359> any<00:00:30.539> sort<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> meat<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.289> like

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
this with any sort of meat that you like

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.970 
this with any sort of meat that you like
so<00:00:32.070> start<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.759> some<00:00:33.120> ground<00:00:33.600> white<00:00:33.780> pepper

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
so start with some ground white pepper

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
so start with some ground white pepper
so<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.190> pepper<00:00:35.399> salt<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.149> sugar<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.750> really

so the pepper salt and sugar is really

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
so the pepper salt and sugar is really
for<00:00:37.200> seasoning<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:37.890> they've<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:38.250> two<00:00:38.489> other

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
ingredients so we almost always add two

five<00:03:14.470> millimeters<00:03:15.069> of<00:03:15.250> oil<00:03:15.430> on<00:03:15.639> this<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.269> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
five millimeters of oil on this so the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.780 
five millimeters of oil on this so the
oil<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:17.169> ready<00:03:17.349> for<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.040> frying<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:18.639> can

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
oil is ready for the frying and you can

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.430 
oil is ready for the frying and you can
check<00:03:19.030> by<00:03:19.329> just<00:03:19.510> taking<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:19.810> little<00:03:19.900> pinch<00:03:20.260> of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
check by just taking a little pinch of

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.650 
check by just taking a little pinch of
your<00:03:20.620> coating<00:03:21.000> dropping<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.359> you<00:03:22.419> get<00:03:22.540> the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
your coating dropping in and you get the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.809 
your coating dropping in and you get the
immediate<00:03:22.989> this<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.739> all<00:03:23.889> their<00:03:24.040> reaction<00:03:24.519> so

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
immediate this is all their reaction so

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.720 
immediate this is all their reaction so
where<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.720> go<00:03:25.810> check<00:03:26.109> an<00:03:26.230> end<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:26.680> I'm<00:03:26.980> I've

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
where you go check an end so I'm I've

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.610 
where you go check an end so I'm I've
just<00:03:28.000> Pat<00:03:28.239> like<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.569> lot<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.900> corns<00:03:29.139> out<00:03:29.260> on<00:03:29.379> here

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
just Pat like a lot of corns out on here

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.539 
just Pat like a lot of corns out on here
but<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:29.859> do<00:03:30.010> want<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.220> give<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.459> little

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
but you do want to give it a little

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.520 
but you do want to give it a little
shake<00:03:30.879> if<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.209> pop<00:03:31.389> it<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.599> otherwise<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.319> oil

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
shake if we pop it in otherwise the oil

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.770 
shake if we pop it in otherwise the oil
might<00:03:33.099> burn<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> little<00:03:33.700> bit<00:03:33.849> too<00:03:34.000> quickly<00:03:34.209> so

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
might burn a little bit too quickly so

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.379 
might burn a little bit too quickly so
it's<00:03:35.560> just<00:03:35.739> lay<00:03:36.099> it<00:03:36.280> down<00:03:36.310> Oh<00:03:36.840> lovely<00:03:39.389> and

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
on Tom doing and what you'll see is it

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.330 
on Tom doing and what you'll see is it
fries<00:03:45.669> up<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:47.260> sesame<00:03:47.739> seeds<00:03:48.129> kind

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
fries up is that the sesame seeds kind

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.699 
fries up is that the sesame seeds kind
of<00:03:48.430> really<00:03:48.639> stand<00:03:49.000> out<00:03:49.239> dude<00:03:50.199> if<00:03:50.349> they<00:03:50.440> always

of really stand out dude if they always
peek<00:03:50.980> out<00:03:51.250> out<00:03:51.579> of<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.879> corn<00:03:52.120> flour<00:03:52.329> crust

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
peek out out of the corn flour crust

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.379 
peek out out of the corn flour crust
that<00:03:53.019> is<00:03:53.079> created<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:54.609> when<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.030> chicken<00:03:55.269> is

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
that is created so when the chicken is

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.000 
that is created so when the chicken is
about<00:03:55.480> halfway<00:03:55.780> cooked<00:03:55.989> about<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.769> time

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
about halfway cooked about the time

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.009 
about halfway cooked about the time
you're<00:03:57.310> about<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.669> flip<00:03:57.970> them<00:03:58.150> over<00:03:58.269> this<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:58.959> a

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
you're about to flip them over this is a

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.020 
you're about to flip them over this is a
good<00:03:59.169> time<00:03:59.319> just<00:03:59.379> thicken<00:03:59.799> up<00:03:59.889> the<00:03:59.949> sauce<00:04:00.280> so

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
good time just thicken up the sauce so

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.119 
good time just thicken up the sauce so
once<00:04:01.269> again<00:04:01.389> cold<00:04:01.840> air<00:04:02.079> is<00:04:02.349> going<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.680> be<00:04:02.889> a

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
once again cold air is going to be a

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.629 
once again cold air is going to be a
magic<00:04:03.639> trick<00:04:03.879> so<00:04:04.569> what<00:04:05.079> we<00:04:05.169> have<00:04:05.349> here<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.859> a

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
magic trick so what we have here is a

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.300 
magic trick so what we have here is a
bit<00:04:06.879> of<00:04:06.910> corn<00:04:07.209> set<00:04:07.449> up<00:04:07.569> of<00:04:08.230> some<00:04:08.410> water<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.190> it

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
bit of corn set up of some water and it

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.890 
bit of corn set up of some water and it
makes<00:04:09.340> this<00:04:09.519> really<00:04:09.669> six<00:04:10.180> flurry<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.810> what

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
makes this really six flurry and what

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.990 
makes this really six flurry and what
you<00:04:10.959> want<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.169> do<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.709> whenever<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.459> add<00:04:12.669> corn

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
you want to do is whenever you add corn

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.640 
you want to do is whenever you add corn
flour<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.540> thicken<00:04:13.720> any<00:04:13.989> sources<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.470> turn

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
flour to thicken any sources you turn

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.720 
flour to thicken any sources you turn
the<00:04:14.799> heat<00:04:14.919> down<00:04:14.980> first

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
the heat down first

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.400 
the heat down first
otherwise<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.209> coals<00:04:16.419> I'll<00:04:16.630> go<00:04:16.780> or<00:04:16.930> gloopy

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
otherwise the coals I'll go or gloopy

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.680 
otherwise the coals I'll go or gloopy
and<00:04:17.650> clump<00:04:18.010> together<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:18.609> just<00:04:18.909> a<00:04:19.120> steady

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
and clump together so just a steady

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.590 
and clump together so just a steady
stream<00:04:19.959> as<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:20.530> pour<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.829> in

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
stream as you pour it in

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.660 
stream as you pour it in
okay<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.680> we<00:04:22.890> need<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.070> keep<00:04:23.190> cooking<00:04:23.580> this

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
okay so we need to keep cooking this

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.300 
okay so we need to keep cooking this
until<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.060> becomes<00:04:24.360> translucent<00:04:24.720> again<00:04:25.440> and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
until it becomes translucent again and

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.620 
until it becomes translucent again and
so<00:04:26.580> at<00:04:26.760> this<00:04:26.850> point<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.150> can<00:04:27.240> turn<00:04:27.360> your<00:04:27.480> heat

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
so at this point you can turn your heat

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.230 
so at this point you can turn your heat
back<00:04:27.780> up<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.230> think<00:04:28.890> about<00:04:28.980> corn<00:04:29.340> flour<00:04:29.640> crusts

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
back up I think about corn flour crusts

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.120 
back up I think about corn flour crusts
is<00:04:30.390> that<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.570> doesn't<00:04:30.720> any<00:04:30.900> color<00:04:31.170> too<00:04:31.380> much<00:04:31.590> so

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
is that it doesn't any color too much so

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.980 
is that it doesn't any color too much so
don't<00:04:32.970> be<00:04:33.120> going<00:04:33.330> for<00:04:33.570> like<00:04:33.660> kind<00:04:33.840> of<00:04:33.870> an

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
don't be going for like kind of an

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.050 
don't be going for like kind of an
overly<00:04:34.410> dark<00:04:34.680> brown<00:04:35.010> because<00:04:35.460> at<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.880> point

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
overly dark brown because at that point

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.220 
overly dark brown because at that point
you<00:04:36.210> might<00:04:36.300> overcook<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.780> chicken<00:04:36.810> but<00:04:37.200> I

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
you might overcook the chicken but I

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.380 
you might overcook the chicken but I
think<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.800> really<00:04:37.920> good<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.430> go<00:04:38.580> look<00:04:39.270> at

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
think this is really good to go look at

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.900 
think this is really good to go look at
that<00:04:39.830> mmm<00:04:40.920> so<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.340> chicken<00:04:41.610> is<00:04:41.700> ready<00:04:41.820> to

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
that mmm so this chicken is ready to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.030 
that mmm so this chicken is ready to
come<00:04:42.120> out<00:04:42.150> now<00:04:42.300> it's<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.750> lovely<00:04:43.320> golden<00:04:43.560> brown

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
come out now it's a lovely golden brown

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.920 
come out now it's a lovely golden brown
color<00:04:44.370> all<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.150> want<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:45.510> something<00:04:45.660> like<00:04:45.870> a

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
color all you want is something like a
