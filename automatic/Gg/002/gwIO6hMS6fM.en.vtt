there's<00:00:00.240> always<00:00:00.539> one<00:00:01.020> challenge<00:00:01.530> which<00:00:01.740> is

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
there's always one challenge which is

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.200 
there's always one challenge which is
time<00:00:02.870> we<00:00:03.870> always<00:00:04.290> are<00:00:04.980> short<00:00:05.370> on<00:00:05.580> time<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.120> you

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
time we always are short on time to you

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.339 
time we always are short on time to you
a<00:00:06.240> new<00:00:06.509> car<00:00:06.870> we'd<00:00:07.319> like<00:00:08.179> by<00:00:09.179> let's<00:00:09.840> say<00:00:10.050> nine

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
a new car we'd like by let's say nine

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.400 
a new car we'd like by let's say nine
month<00:00:10.710> or<00:00:10.980> together<00:00:11.429> from<00:00:12.210> starting<00:00:12.750> concept

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
month or together from starting concept

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.330 
month or together from starting concept
putting<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.920> drawings<00:00:14.280> together<00:00:15.920> we<00:00:16.920> always

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
putting the drawings together we always

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.330 
putting the drawings together we always
have<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.609> good<00:00:17.820> planning<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.680> always<00:00:19.830> want

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
have a good planning but we always want

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.490 
have a good planning but we always want
to<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.580> concept<00:00:21.180> design<00:00:21.600> longer<00:00:21.930> than<00:00:22.320> we

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to do concept design longer than we

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.290 
to do concept design longer than we
should<00:00:22.740> really<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.550> which<00:00:23.789> means<00:00:24.060> that

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
should really do it which means that

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.599 
should really do it which means that
when<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.750> when<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.019> freeze<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.830> concept<00:00:26.369> it's

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
when we when we freeze the concept it's

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.269 
when we when we freeze the concept it's
a<00:00:26.730> bit<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.150> panic<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.080> rush<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.590> long<00:00:28.830> hours

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
a bit of a panic and rush in long hours

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.389 
a bit of a panic and rush in long hours
you<00:00:29.519> would<00:00:29.670> detail<00:00:30.330> design<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.769> getting<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
you would detail design and getting the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.900 
you would detail design and getting the
manufacturer<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:34.530> manufacturer<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.790> all

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
manufacturer the manufacturer to do all

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.880 
manufacturer the manufacturer to do all
the<00:00:36.059> parts<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.600> time<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.079> run<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> car<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the parts on time and run the car on the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.940 
the parts on time and run the car on the
time<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.399> okay<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.629> pushed<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> concept

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
time but okay we pushed with the concept

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.180 
time but okay we pushed with the concept
try<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> car<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.930> good<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.860> could

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
try to do the car is as good as we could

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.510 
try to do the car is as good as we could
possibly<00:00:44.539> do<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.010> then<00:00:47.010> after<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
possibly do and then after that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520 
possibly do and then after that
everybody<00:00:47.850> pushed<00:00:48.360> quite<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.379> got

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
everybody pushed quite out and we got

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.100 
everybody pushed quite out and we got
the<00:00:49.649> car<00:00:49.860> running<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.399> time<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.899> first

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the car running on time so the first

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.180 
the car running on time so the first
challenge<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:53.510> was<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.050> timing<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.949> an

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
challenge was was that one timing and an

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.369 
challenge was was that one timing and an
artwork

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
artwork

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
artwork
the<00:00:58.379> second<00:00:58.800> challenge<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> s2000<00:01:00.660> was

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the second challenge for the s2000 was

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
the second challenge for the s2000 was
really<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> make<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.850> car<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.300> good<00:01:04.070> value<00:01:05.070> for

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
really to make the car is good value for

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.429 
really to make the car is good value for
money<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.790> possible<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:07.220> primarily<00:01:08.220> its<00:01:08.640> its

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
money as possible it's primarily its its

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.030 
money as possible it's primarily its its
customer<00:01:10.439> car<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.640> need<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.090> set<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> at<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
customer car and we need to set it at a

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.120 
customer car and we need to set it at a
Senate<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.310> reasonable<00:01:14.970> price<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.920> there<00:01:16.920> was

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
Senate at reasonable price so there was

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
Senate at reasonable price so there was
a<00:01:17.159> big<00:01:17.460> push<00:01:17.759> day<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.240> reviewing<00:01:18.780> everything

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
a big push day in reviewing everything

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.160 
a big push day in reviewing everything
we<00:01:19.710> didn't<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.790> could<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> it's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
we didn't see if we could do it it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.490 
we didn't see if we could do it it's
good<00:01:22.470> quality<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.220> his<00:01:23.400> performance<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.170> for

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
good quality in his performance but for

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130 
good quality in his performance but for
less<00:01:25.710> money<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.580> was<00:01:26.880> quite<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> big

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
less money and that was quite a big

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
less money and that was quite a big
challenge<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.799> involved<00:01:29.430> all<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.850> us

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
challenge it involved all of us

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.170 
challenge it involved all of us
reviewing<00:01:30.750> ways<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.979> manufacturing<00:01:32.820> things

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
reviewing ways of manufacturing things

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.230 
reviewing ways of manufacturing things
ways<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.700> designing<00:01:35.700> things

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
ways of of designing things

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.890 
ways of of designing things
and<00:01:38.159> searching<00:01:39.159> different<00:01:39.430> suppliers<00:01:40.150> and<00:01:40.630> so

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
and searching different suppliers and so

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.899 
and searching different suppliers and so
on<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.799> with<00:01:42.490> these<00:01:43.090> many<00:01:43.450> parts<00:01:44.020> where<00:01:44.350> we

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
on and with these many parts where we

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.530 
on and with these many parts where we
every<00:01:45.909> use<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.330> price<00:01:46.659> by<00:01:47.020> 50%<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.270> if

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
every use the price by 50% and if

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.700 
every use the price by 50% and if
actually<00:01:50.020> not<00:01:50.290> paid<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.040> much<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:52.450> in<00:01:52.840> terms<00:01:53.380> of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
actually not paid so much in in terms of

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.490 
actually not paid so much in in terms of
weight<00:01:54.250> or<00:01:54.670> performance<00:01:55.600> or<00:01:55.840> anything<00:01:56.170> like

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
weight or performance or anything like

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.460 
weight or performance or anything like
that<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:58.149> was<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.360> second<00:01:58.840> big<00:01:59.050> challenge

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
that so that was a second big challenge

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.980 
that so that was a second big challenge
of<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.740> car<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.850> third<00:02:01.149> challenge<00:02:01.570> is<00:02:01.960> that

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
of the car the third challenge is that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.800 
of the car the third challenge is that
it's<00:02:02.350> it's<00:02:02.619> completely<00:02:03.550> new<00:02:04.300> sets<00:02:04.630> of

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
it's it's completely new sets of

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.400 
it's it's completely new sets of
regulations<00:02:05.229> super<00:02:06.190> 2000<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.360> is<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.930> bit

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
regulations super 2000 so it is a bit

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.380 
regulations super 2000 so it is a bit
different<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:09.119> WRC<00:02:10.119> car<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:11.019> it's<00:02:11.920> very<00:02:12.390> much

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
different to WRC car it's it's very much

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.699 
different to WRC car it's it's very much
easier<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:14.440> than<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.180> WRC<00:02:16.180> car<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.470> the

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
easier to do than a WRC car but in the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.979 
easier to do than a WRC car but in the
other<00:02:17.830> end<00:02:18.160> all<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.730> knowledge<00:02:18.970> we<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.630> from

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
other end all the knowledge we have from

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.920 
other end all the knowledge we have from
the<00:02:20.110> WRC<00:02:20.680> car<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.459> couldn't<00:02:21.850> apply<00:02:22.060> everything

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
the WRC car we couldn't apply everything

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.660 
the WRC car we couldn't apply everything
because<00:02:23.410> some<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.130> stuff<00:02:24.430> we're

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
because some of the stuff we're

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.960 
because some of the stuff we're
forbidden<00:02:25.420> by<00:02:25.690> de<00:02:25.750> by<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.769> regulations<00:02:27.700> but

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
forbidden by de by the regulations but

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.630 
forbidden by de by the regulations but
the<00:02:28.660> regulation<00:02:29.320> works<00:02:29.590> works<00:02:30.190> quite<00:02:30.610> well

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the regulation works works quite well

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.000 
the regulation works works quite well
they<00:02:31.120> force<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.870> effectively<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.830> make<00:02:32.950> a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
they force you effectively to make a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.120 
they force you effectively to make a
cheaper<00:02:33.640> car<00:02:33.880> by<00:02:34.660> using<00:02:34.720> simple<00:02:35.470> design<00:02:36.100> and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
cheaper car by using simple design and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.660 
cheaper car by using simple design and
cheap<00:02:37.120> materials<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.920> last<00:02:39.130> point<00:02:39.489> is

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
cheap materials the last point is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.650 
cheap materials the last point is
testing<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.750> car<00:02:41.850> sufficiently<00:02:42.850> before<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
testing the car sufficiently before the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660 
testing the car sufficiently before the
Amala<00:02:43.930> Gatien<00:02:44.410> because<00:02:44.769> once<00:02:45.010> we<00:02:45.220> are<00:02:45.250> getting

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
Amala Gatien because once we are getting

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.300 
Amala Gatien because once we are getting
january<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.480> car<00:02:46.720> specification<00:02:47.709> is<00:02:47.860> frozen

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
january the car specification is frozen

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.390 
january the car specification is frozen
by<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.730> fi<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:50.170> it's<00:02:50.350> really<00:02:50.769> important<00:02:51.370> that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
by the fi so it's really important that

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.210 
by the fi so it's really important that
we<00:02:51.940> test<00:02:52.470> properly<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.739> make<00:02:53.950> sure<00:02:54.190> that

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
we test properly and we make sure that

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.740 
we test properly and we make sure that
everything<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.820> reliable<00:02:56.160> before<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.370> date

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
everything is reliable before that date

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.600 
everything is reliable before that date
the<00:02:58.750> Fiesta<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.350> much<00:02:59.590> smaller<00:03:00.010> which<00:03:00.370> to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
the Fiesta is much smaller which to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.670 
the Fiesta is much smaller which to
start<00:03:00.880> with<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.239> what<00:03:01.269> we<00:03:01.660> want<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.230> that's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
start with is what we want and that's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.190 
start with is what we want and that's
what<00:03:02.890> we<00:03:03.100> wanted<00:03:03.579> because<00:03:04.030> small<00:03:04.480> car<00:03:04.870> mean

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
what we wanted because small car mean

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.030 
what we wanted because small car mean
it's<00:03:05.560> lighter<00:03:05.920> it's<00:03:06.790> got<00:03:07.150> less<00:03:07.390> aerodynamic

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
it's lighter it's got less aerodynamic

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.000 
it's lighter it's got less aerodynamic
dragon<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.570> usually<00:03:10.570> it's<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.110> better<00:03:11.709> weight

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
dragon and usually it's a better weight

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.729 
dragon and usually it's a better weight
distribution<00:03:12.720> driver<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.019> co-driver<00:03:14.200> of

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
distribution driver and the co-driver of

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.120 
distribution driver and the co-driver of
the<00:03:15.220> back<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.390> gives<00:03:16.660> us<00:03:16.780> more<00:03:17.130> 50:50

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
the back so it gives us more 50:50

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.120 
the back so it gives us more 50:50
weight<00:03:18.160> distribution<00:03:18.579> so<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:20.859> good

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
weight distribution so it is a good

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.099 
weight distribution so it is a good
thing<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.609> certainly<00:03:22.030> with<00:03:22.299> with<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.900> new

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
thing and certainly with with the new

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.440 
thing and certainly with with the new
regulation<00:03:23.980> you're<00:03:24.190> not<00:03:24.400> like<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.880> modify<00:03:25.239> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
regulation you're not like to modify the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.229 
regulation you're not like to modify the
body<00:03:25.840> shell<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.950> if<00:03:27.130> we<00:03:27.370> were<00:03:27.489> starting<00:03:28.060> with<00:03:28.180> a

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
body shell so if we were starting with a

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.840 
body shell so if we were starting with a
big<00:03:28.570> car<00:03:28.930> lighter<00:03:29.230> focus<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.280> would<00:03:30.459> be<00:03:30.640> very

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
big car lighter focus it would be very

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.970 
big car lighter focus it would be very
difficult<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.480> be<00:03:31.720> competitive<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.440> super

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
difficult to be competitive in super

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.670 
difficult to be competitive in super
2000<00:03:33.640> so<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.390> Fiesta<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:34.930> definitely<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
2000 so the Fiesta is definitely the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.270 
2000 so the Fiesta is definitely the
right<00:03:35.859> car<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.489> start<00:03:36.790> with<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:38.620> top<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.160> that

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
right car to start with on top of that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.400 
right car to start with on top of that
we<00:03:39.519> really<00:03:39.970> lucky<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.540> it's<00:03:40.780> really<00:03:41.320> an

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
we really lucky that it's really an

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.120 
we really lucky that it's really an
exciting<00:03:41.769> car<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.609> looks<00:03:42.970> good<00:03:43.269> and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
exciting car it looks good and

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.030 
exciting car it looks good and
do<00:03:44.450> everything<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.750> car<00:03:45.990> works<00:03:46.290> wild<00:03:46.860> for

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
do everything in the car works wild for

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.730 
do everything in the car works wild for
the<00:03:47.190> radicals<00:03:47.760> good<00:03:48.500> suspension<00:03:49.500> geometry

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
the radicals good suspension geometry

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.990 
the radicals good suspension geometry
and<00:03:50.580> it's<00:03:51.120> good<00:03:51.360> good<00:03:52.020> base<00:03:52.260> engine<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.250> it's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
and it's good good base engine so it's

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.170 
and it's good good base engine so it's
very<00:03:54.600> good<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:54.870> us

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
very good for us

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.730 
very good for us
obviously<00:03:57.180> it's<00:03:57.330> got<00:03:57.540> some<00:03:57.750> drawback<00:03:58.380> being

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
obviously it's got some drawback being

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.470 
obviously it's got some drawback being
small<00:03:59.190> it's<00:03:59.460> difficult<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.090> package

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
small it's difficult to package

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.640 
small it's difficult to package
everything<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.290> car<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.960> cockpit<00:04:04.470> is

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
everything in the car and the cockpit is

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.610 
everything in the car and the cockpit is
is<00:04:04.950> obviously<00:04:05.490> much<00:04:05.730> narrower<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:06.690> with<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
is obviously much narrower so with the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.340 
is obviously much narrower so with the
new<00:04:08.090> regulation<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.240> seats<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.080> saw<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
new regulation on seats and saw the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.190 
new regulation on seats and saw the
seats<00:04:10.800> are<00:04:11.070> much<00:04:11.340> stronger<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.630> much<00:04:12.840> wider

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
seats are much stronger and much wider

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.740 
seats are much stronger and much wider
it's<00:04:14.190> like<00:04:14.400> you're<00:04:14.670> not<00:04:14.820> so<00:04:15.120> obvious<00:04:15.540> to

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
it's like you're not so obvious to

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.390 
it's like you're not so obvious to
package<00:04:16.140> everything<00:04:16.320> inside<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.220> cockpit

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
package everything inside the cockpit

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.770 
package everything inside the cockpit
but<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.720> wasn't<00:04:19.380> too<00:04:20.160> complicated<00:04:20.610> and<00:04:21.239> we

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
but it wasn't too complicated and we

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.390 
but it wasn't too complicated and we
were<00:04:22.110> quite<00:04:22.350> happy<00:04:22.500> with<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.130> result<00:04:23.580> the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
were quite happy with the result the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.430 
were quite happy with the result the
normally<00:04:26.400> aspirated<00:04:26.540> engine<00:04:27.540> ease<00:04:27.690> wasn't

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
normally aspirated engine ease wasn't

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.480 
normally aspirated engine ease wasn't
such<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.280> big<00:04:29.640> big<00:04:29.880> challenge<00:04:30.210> really<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
such a big big challenge really the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.880 
such a big big challenge really the
challenge<00:04:32.970> was<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.270> have<00:04:33.570> more<00:04:33.870> power<00:04:34.110> than<00:04:34.320> no

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
challenge was to have more power than no

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.490 
challenge was to have more power than no
competitors<00:04:35.730> which<00:04:36.000> we<00:04:36.390> think<00:04:37.050> we<00:04:37.320> have

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
competitors which we think we have

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.120 
competitors which we think we have
always<00:04:38.100> certainly<00:04:38.850> right<00:04:39.120> up<00:04:39.360> there<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:40.500> was

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
always certainly right up there that was

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.640 
always certainly right up there that was
a<00:04:41.190> challenge<00:04:41.730> but<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.300> engine<00:04:42.660> itself<00:04:43.140> is<00:04:43.380> not

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
a challenge but the engine itself is not

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.130 
a challenge but the engine itself is not
so<00:04:44.040> complicated<00:04:44.340> in<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.210> simpler<00:04:45.720> than<00:04:45.900> the

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
so complicated in it's simpler than the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.230 
so complicated in it's simpler than the
ER<00:04:46.170> than<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.770> turbo<00:04:46.980> engine<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:48.210> engine

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
ER than the turbo engine the engine

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.540 
ER than the turbo engine the engine
installation<00:04:49.020> is<00:04:49.530> well<00:04:49.800> it's<00:04:49.980> much<00:04:50.280> much

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
installation is well it's much much

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.520 
installation is well it's much much
simpler<00:04:51.120> because<00:04:51.570> we<00:04:51.720> don't<00:04:51.960> have<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.380> waive

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
simpler because we don't have to waive

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.760 
simpler because we don't have to waive
the<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.400> intercooler<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:55.200> on<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.740> on

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
the the intercooler and so on and so on

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.970 
the the intercooler and so on and so on
so<00:04:56.100> that's<00:04:56.910> much<00:04:57.480> easier<00:04:57.510> to<00:04:58.170> install<00:04:58.410> the

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
so that's much easier to install the

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.420 
so that's much easier to install the
testing<00:04:59.690> is<00:05:00.690> very<00:05:00.750> important<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:01.980> in<00:05:02.130> any

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
testing is very important and in any

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.060 
testing is very important and in any
case<00:05:02.640> sure<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.240> important<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.200> know<00:05:04.350> in<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.740> few

area<00:05:05.460> where<00:05:05.880> we<00:05:06.150> need<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.360> little<00:05:06.660> bit<00:05:06.960> of<00:05:07.020> we

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
needed a little bit of improvement we

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.110 
needed a little bit of improvement we
had<00:05:11.960> we<00:05:12.960> had<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.530> car<00:05:13.800> running<00:05:14.220> on<00:05:14.370> time<00:05:14.760> when

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
had we had the car running on time when

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.800 
had we had the car running on time when
we<00:05:15.300> wanted<00:05:15.750> so<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.050> was<00:05:16.380> good<00:05:17.330> with<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.510> fury

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
we wanted so that was good with the fury

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.470 
we wanted so that was good with the fury
cups<00:05:19.170> but<00:05:19.980> it<00:05:20.220> was<00:05:20.400> good<00:05:20.670> as<00:05:20.820> well<00:05:20.850> to<00:05:21.330> waive

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
cups but it was good as well to waive

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.850 
cups but it was good as well to waive
the<00:05:21.720> memory<00:05:21.990> we<00:05:22.500> fix<00:05:22.890> them<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:25.020> we<00:05:25.260> did<00:05:25.440> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
the memory we fix them so we did the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.610 
the memory we fix them so we did the
first<00:05:26.100> running<00:05:26.850> shakedown<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:27.780> debugging

went to Greystoke and Greystoke we

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.780 
went to Greystoke and Greystoke we
already<00:05:36.840> managed<00:05:37.290> quite<00:05:37.590> a<00:05:37.620> quite<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.250> lot<00:05:38.610> of

that<00:05:46.740> we<00:05:46.920> went<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.460> drifts<00:05:48.300> are<00:05:48.420> the

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
that we went to the drifts are the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.090 
that we went to the drifts are the
friends<00:05:49.050> you<00:05:49.230> testing<00:05:49.740> on<00:05:49.860> Tom<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.190> can

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
friends you testing on Tom I can

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.270 
friends you testing on Tom I can
and<00:05:51.520> that<00:05:52.420> went<00:05:52.660> really<00:05:52.990> well<00:05:53.140> we<00:05:53.530> were<00:05:53.680> very

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
and that went really well we were very

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.230 
and that went really well we were very
very<00:05:54.790> rough<00:05:56.370> gravel<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:59.370> that<00:06:00.370> was<00:06:00.610> good<00:06:00.910> we

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
very rough gravel and that was good we

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.100 
very rough gravel and that was good we
had<00:06:01.390> we<00:06:01.930> had<00:06:02.970> minimum<00:06:03.970> problem<00:06:04.510> with<00:06:04.690> the<00:06:04.870> car

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
had we had minimum problem with the car

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.450 
had we had minimum problem with the car
they<00:06:05.440> considering<00:06:06.160> over<00:06:06.430> of<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:06.880> roads<00:06:07.090> way

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
they considering over of the roads way

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.590 
they considering over of the roads way
so<00:06:09.460> yeah<00:06:09.940> that's<00:06:10.660> looking<00:06:10.990> good<00:06:11.410> and<00:06:11.760> these<00:06:12.760> as

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
so yeah that's looking good and these as

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.930 
so yeah that's looking good and these as
I<00:06:13.810> said<00:06:13.840> it<00:06:14.380> was<00:06:14.590> a<00:06:14.620> few<00:06:15.040> place<00:06:15.340> where<00:06:15.610> we<00:06:15.790> need

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
I said it was a few place where we need

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
I said it was a few place where we need
to<00:06:16.180> work<00:06:16.420> more<00:06:16.780> on<00:06:16.840> the<00:06:17.020> car<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:18.120> at<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.540> point

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
to work more on the car and at the point

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.230 
to work more on the car and at the point
we<00:06:20.230> are<00:06:20.260> today<00:06:20.830> pretty<00:06:21.310> much<00:06:21.550> everything<00:06:22.120> is

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
we are today pretty much everything is

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.150 
we are today pretty much everything is
fixed<00:06:22.750> and<00:06:22.900> we<00:06:22.960> ap<00:06:23.530> with<00:06:23.740> with<00:06:24.010> the

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
fixed and we ap with with the

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.640 
fixed and we ap with with the
performance<00:06:24.910> and<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.240> reliability<00:06:25.780> one

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
performance and the reliability one

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.640 
performance and the reliability one
place<00:06:26.920> where<00:06:27.220> we<00:06:27.370> always<00:06:27.550> work<00:06:28.170> a<00:06:29.170> lot<00:06:29.620> with

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
place where we always work a lot with

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.550 
place where we always work a lot with
Ford<00:06:30.160> is<00:06:30.370> on<00:06:30.520> suspension<00:06:31.050> kinematics<00:06:32.050> because

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
Ford is on suspension kinematics because

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.370 
Ford is on suspension kinematics because
they've<00:06:32.770> got<00:06:33.070> a<00:06:33.100> big<00:06:33.490> computer<00:06:34.020> software<00:06:35.020> that

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
they've got a big computer software that

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.360 
they've got a big computer software that
they<00:06:36.250> can<00:06:36.520> run<00:06:36.790> and<00:06:37.330> we<00:06:37.810> couldn't<00:06:38.110> run<00:06:38.440> so<00:06:38.770> we

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
they can run and we couldn't run so we

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.310 
they can run and we couldn't run so we
always<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.760> very<00:06:40.270> close<00:06:40.540> relationship<00:06:41.290> with

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
always a very close relationship with

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.800 
always a very close relationship with
them<00:06:41.770> on<00:06:42.510> suspension<00:06:44.580> kinematics<00:06:45.580> and<00:06:45.850> design

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
them on suspension kinematics and design

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.570 
them on suspension kinematics and design
and<00:06:47.110> there<00:06:47.320> again<00:06:47.710> it's<00:06:47.950> been<00:06:48.190> it's<00:06:48.460> been

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
and there again it's been it's been

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.600 
and there again it's been it's been
quite<00:06:49.000> successful<00:06:49.270> and<00:06:50.020> then<00:06:50.860> a<00:06:50.980> twirl<00:06:51.280> we<00:06:51.460> had

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
quite successful and then a twirl we had

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.690 
quite successful and then a twirl we had
we<00:06:51.910> had<00:06:52.060> some<00:06:52.090> work<00:06:52.720> with<00:06:53.590> the<00:06:53.800> stylus<00:06:54.430> days

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
we had some work with the stylus days

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.900 
we had some work with the stylus days
went<00:06:55.060> on<00:06:55.180> on<00:06:55.510> the<00:06:55.540> car<00:06:55.900> to<00:06:56.170> make<00:06:56.320> sure<00:06:56.380> that<00:06:56.910> the

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
went on on the car to make sure that the
