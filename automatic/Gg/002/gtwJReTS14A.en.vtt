about 10 shots at this block gonna fail
at<00:02:06.540> 115<00:02:07.540> yards<00:02:07.720> as<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.649> see<00:02:08.860> it's<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.399> long<00:02:10.209> ways

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
at 115 yards as you see it's a long ways

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.890 
at 115 yards as you see it's a long ways
some<00:02:11.230> people<00:02:11.260> struggle<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.130> with<00:02:12.250> a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900

generally<00:03:08.650> what<00:03:08.769> you'll<00:03:08.890> find<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.250> you'll

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
generally what you'll find is you'll

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.130 
generally what you'll find is you'll
find<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.609> rear<00:03:09.790> peep<00:03:09.970> like<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> rear<00:03:10.750> circle

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
find a rear peep like this a rear circle

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.740 
find a rear peep like this a rear circle
and<00:03:11.620> then<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.799> got<00:03:11.950> your<00:03:12.070> front<00:03:12.250> pins<00:03:12.750> what

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
and then you got your front pins what

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.240 
and then you got your front pins what
this<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.109> is<00:03:14.350> it's<00:03:14.500> basically<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:15.010> ghost

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
this is is it's basically like a ghost

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.690 
this is is it's basically like a ghost
ring<00:03:15.489> setup<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:17.620> know<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.799> Center<00:03:18.160> what<00:03:18.579> I<00:03:18.609> do

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
ring setup you know you Center what I do

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.280 
ring setup you know you Center what I do
is<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.000> Center<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.420> housing<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.109> rear

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
is I Center the housing in the rear

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.960 
is I Center the housing in the rear
circle<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.890> then<00:03:21.280> you've<00:03:21.370> got<00:03:21.519> your<00:03:21.609> pins<00:03:21.850> for

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
circle and then you've got your pins for

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.990 
circle and then you've got your pins for
elevation<00:03:22.590> as<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.769> said<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.040> Prior<00:03:24.250> video<00:03:24.519> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
elevation as I said in Prior video the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.490 
elevation as I said in Prior video the
bottom<00:03:25.390> pin<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.690> floating<00:03:26.049> pin<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.380> can

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
bottom pin is a floating pin so I can

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.130 
bottom pin is a floating pin so I can
set<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.709> certain<00:03:27.130> yardages<00:03:27.489> well<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.870> is

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
set that certain yardages well this is

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.940 
set that certain yardages well this is
actually<00:03:30.000> down<00:03:31.000> here<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.480> actually<00:03:31.959> 70<00:03:32.620> yards

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
actually down here is actually 70 yards

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.789 
actually down here is actually 70 yards
so<00:03:33.670> I'm<00:03:33.760> out<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:33.940> pin<00:03:34.329> at<00:03:34.600> 115<00:03:35.290> yards<00:03:35.440> what<00:03:35.709> I'm

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
so I'm out of pin at 115 yards what I'm

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.770 
so I'm out of pin at 115 yards what I'm
doing<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.430> Center<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.150> circle<00:03:37.480> on<00:03:37.750> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
doing is I Center the circle on the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.099 
doing is I Center the circle on the
housing<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.609> I'm<00:03:39.609> holding<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.690> saw<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.930> hey

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
housing and I'm holding you saw the hey

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.770 
housing and I'm holding you saw the hey
Bill<00:03:41.290> I'm<00:03:41.470> holding<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:42.280> top<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.450> hay<00:03:43.569> bale

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
Bill I'm holding the top of the hay bale

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.979 
Bill I'm holding the top of the hay bale
about<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> half<00:03:44.859> an<00:03:45.069> inch<00:03:45.750> underneath<00:03:46.750> the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
about a half an inch underneath the

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.830 
about a half an inch underneath the
front<00:03:47.260> sight<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.090> really<00:03:49.389> have<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.600> zero

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
front sight so I really have the zero

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.830 
front sight so I really have the zero
reference<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.970> pretty<00:03:52.239> much<00:03:52.359> just<00:03:52.420> slinging

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
reference and pretty much just slinging

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.110 
reference and pretty much just slinging
them<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.200> hoping<00:03:53.769> they<00:03:53.889> get<00:03:54.519> close<00:03:54.790> which

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
them and hoping they get close which

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.780 
them and hoping they get close which
kind<00:03:56.079> of<00:03:56.139> becomes<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:56.889> little<00:03:57.010> instinctive<00:03:57.579> and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
kind of becomes a little instinctive and

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.610 
kind of becomes a little instinctive and
light<00:03:58.209> as<00:03:58.329> Lance<00:03:58.569> was<00:03:58.720> kind<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:58.959> walking<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.500> on

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
light as Lance was kind of walking in on

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.380 
light as Lance was kind of walking in on
some

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
some

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:24.110 
some
