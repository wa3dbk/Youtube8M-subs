00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.640 
what approach do next is take my
lipstick<00:06:03.420> so<00:06:03.660> I'm<00:06:03.750> done<00:06:04.020> with<00:06:04.260> my<00:06:04.410> face

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
lipstick so I'm done with my face

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.370 
lipstick so I'm done with my face
actually<00:06:05.010> I'm<00:06:05.910> going<00:06:06.090> to<00:06:06.150> use<00:06:06.530> our<00:06:07.530> RiRi<00:06:07.860> boy

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
actually I'm going to use our RiRi boy

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:24.029 
actually I'm going to use our RiRi boy
looks<00:06:10.380> like<00:06:10.620> this

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.159 

that's<00:06:24.789> what<00:06:24.969> really<00:06:25.089> what<00:06:25.240> looks<00:06:25.629> like<00:06:25.719> army

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
that's what really what looks like army

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.739 
that's what really what looks like army
and<00:06:26.499> I'm<00:06:27.099> just<00:06:27.249> going<00:06:27.460> to<00:06:27.520> take<00:06:27.909> my<00:06:29.400> fix+

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:30.749 
and I'm just going to take my fix+

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:33.510 
and I'm just going to take my fix+
max<00:06:31.749> brainy<00:06:32.349> I<00:06:32.619> really<00:06:32.949> don't<00:06:33.099> know<00:06:33.249> what<00:06:33.399> it's

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
max brainy I really don't know what it's

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.850 
max brainy I really don't know what it's
used<00:06:33.699> for<00:06:33.819> but<00:06:34.629> I<00:06:34.659> use<00:06:34.930> it<00:06:34.960> anyway<00:06:35.529> because<00:06:35.710> I

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
used for but I use it anyway because I

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.829 
used for but I use it anyway because I
like<00:06:36.039> the<00:06:36.159> way<00:06:36.279> it<00:06:36.550> turns<00:06:36.819> out<00:06:37.059> and<00:06:37.659> I'm<00:06:37.719> just

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:37.839 
like the way it turns out and I'm just

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:43.139 
like the way it turns out and I'm just
going<00:06:37.960> to<00:06:38.050> spray<00:06:38.229> my<00:06:38.409> face<00:06:41.969> okay

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:43.149 
going to spray my face okay

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:54.160 
going to spray my face okay
and<00:06:43.479> then<00:06:43.749> I<00:06:43.960> just<00:06:44.259> let<00:06:44.499> that<00:06:44.680> sit

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.550 

so<00:06:54.710> it<00:06:54.800> takes<00:06:55.010> a<00:06:55.100> couple<00:06:55.130> minutes<00:06:55.760> to<00:06:56.330> dry<00:06:56.570> but

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
so it takes a couple minutes to dry but

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.340 
so it takes a couple minutes to dry but
yeah<00:06:57.770> so<00:06:58.070> this<00:06:58.250> is<00:06:58.310> my<00:06:58.490> face<00:06:58.940> that<00:06:59.510> I<00:06:59.540> do<00:06:59.750> like
