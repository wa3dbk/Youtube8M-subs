00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.330 

in<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.660> video<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.379> would<00:00:07.620> like<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.919> show<00:00:08.280> you

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
in this video I would like to show you

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.180 
in this video I would like to show you
how<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.760> use<00:00:09.090> selective<00:00:09.780> coloring<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.440> with

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
how to use selective coloring and with

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.450 
how to use selective coloring and with
Lightroom<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.980> I'm<00:00:13.980> going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.250> show<00:00:14.400> two

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
Lightroom and I'm going to show two

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.840 
Lightroom and I'm going to show two
different<00:00:14.730> methods<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.920> one<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.460> easier

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
different methods and one is the easier

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.750 
different methods and one is the easier
and<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> other<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.690> more<00:00:19.580> takes<00:00:20.580> more

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
and the other one is more takes more

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.710 
and the other one is more takes more
work<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:23.789> first<00:00:24.090> way<00:00:24.269> we're<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
work and the first way we're going to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.099 
work and the first way we're going to
use<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:26.090> go<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.560> ASL<00:00:28.560> tab<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.849> choose

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
use the go to the ASL tab and choose

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.870 
use the go to the ASL tab and choose
saturation<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.309> in<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.460> picture<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
saturation and in this picture I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.950 
saturation and in this picture I
obviously<00:00:33.570> want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> keep<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.610> wet<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.120> we

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
obviously want to keep the wet and we

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.619 
obviously want to keep the wet and we
move<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.350> all<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> other<00:00:37.920> colors<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.120> we're

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
move to all the other colors so we're

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.010 
move to all the other colors so we're
simply<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:42.020> sliding

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
simply going to do just that by sliding

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.799 
simply going to do just that by sliding
all<00:00:43.290> these<00:00:43.700> covers<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:47.190> zero<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> my<00:00:48.420> -

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
all these covers to zero of the my -

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.369 
all these covers to zero of the my -
Hamlet<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.760> as<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.059> see<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.480> red<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
Hamlet and as you can see the red is a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.049 
Hamlet and as you can see the red is a
bit<00:00:53.100> bill<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.350> we<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.699> bump<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
bit bill and we can bump up the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.889 
bit bill and we can bump up the
saturation<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> move<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.719> if<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
saturation to make it move it and if you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.799 
saturation to make it move it and if you
look<00:01:01.079> closely<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:02.039> will<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:03.449> only<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
look closely you will see not only the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.859 
look closely you will see not only the
shirt<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:05.000> still<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> scholar<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.479> also

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
shirt but are still a scholar but also

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
shirt but are still a scholar but also
the<00:01:07.740> lips<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.909> nose<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.610> absolutely

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the lips and the nose and I absolutely

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.499 
the lips and the nose and I absolutely
thin<00:01:12.150> skin<00:01:12.450> although<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.500> pretty<00:01:14.220> quite<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
thin skin although it's pretty quite and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.120 
thin skin although it's pretty quite and
when<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.320> problem

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
when you have this problem

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.240 
when you have this problem
you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.270> fix<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.780> by<00:01:22.170> using<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.920> second

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you can fix this by using the second

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.700 
you can fix this by using the second
method<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.840> show<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.229> second<00:01:25.560> method

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
method and you show the second method

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.469 
method and you show the second method
i'm<00:01:26.070> gonna<00:01:27.229> show<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> first

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
i'm gonna show not and then do the first

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.800 
i'm gonna show not and then do the first
and<00:01:31.130> well<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.700> both<00:01:33.090> methods<00:01:33.360> at

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and well you can use both methods at

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.499 
and well you can use both methods at
once<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.890> start<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.759> first<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.360> then

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
once and start with the first and then

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.940 
once and start with the first and then
go<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> second<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:39.259> i'm<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> show

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
go to the second but i'm going to show

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.179 
go to the second but i'm going to show
them<00:01:41.159> separately<00:01:41.670> okay<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:44.040> this

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
them separately okay and then for this

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.569 
them separately okay and then for this
method<00:01:44.430> we'll<00:01:44.729> use<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> adjustment<00:01:45.780> brush

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
method we'll use the adjustment brush

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
method we'll use the adjustment brush
and<00:01:47.840> then<00:01:48.840> simply<00:01:50.119> turn<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.810> saturation<00:01:51.990> down

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and then simply turn the saturation down

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.959 
and then simply turn the saturation down
to<00:01:52.829> minus<00:01:53.250> hundreds<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.740> we'll<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.579> start

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
to minus hundreds and we'll just start

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.170 
to minus hundreds and we'll just start
painting<00:01:57.329> all<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.530> areas<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.460> want<00:01:59.820> in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
painting all the areas we don't want in

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.370 
painting all the areas we don't want in
the<00:02:01.049> same<00:02:01.290> color<00:02:01.850> one<00:02:02.850> color<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:04.200> will

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the same color one color and they will

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.660 
the same color one color and they will
turn<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.070> black<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.030> white

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
turn to black and white

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.610 
turn to black and white
okay<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:13.819> when<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.910> cut<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.110> edges

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
okay and when you cut it to the edges

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.430 
okay and when you cut it to the edges
it's<00:02:17.130> always<00:02:17.730> useful<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.209> use<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.660> auto<00:02:18.959> mask

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
it's always useful to use the auto mask

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.000 
it's always useful to use the auto mask
function<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.160> light<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.890> doesn't<00:02:22.890> really

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
function of light one and doesn't really

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
function of light one and doesn't really
matter<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:23.670> go<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.880> bit<00:02:24.180> over<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> edge

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
matter if you go a bit over the edge

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.370 
matter if you go a bit over the edge
goes<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> little<00:02:27.020> paint<00:02:28.020> nicely<00:02:28.620> along<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.199 

can<00:02:34.380> use<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> bracket<00:02:34.980> keys<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.550> make<00:02:36.030> your

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
can use the bracket keys to make your

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:51.110 
can use the bracket keys to make your
brush<00:02:36.450> bigger<00:02:36.690> smaller<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:46.380> split<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.190> half

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.530 

[Music]

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
[Music]

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.780 
[Music]
so<00:02:54.540> it's<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.989> bit<00:02:56.510> well<00:02:57.510> not<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.290> best<00:02:58.790> masking

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
so it's a bit well not the best masking

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.090 
so it's a bit well not the best masking
but<00:02:59.970> you'll<00:03:00.660> get<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.900> point<00:03:01.200> with<00:03:01.530> some<00:03:01.890> actual

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
but you'll get a point with some actual

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.640 
but you'll get a point with some actual
work<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.330> make<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.980> perfect<00:03:05.400> mask<00:03:05.670> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
work you can make the perfect mask and
