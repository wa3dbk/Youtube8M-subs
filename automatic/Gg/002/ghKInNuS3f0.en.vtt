I'm<00:02:51.680> starting<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.190> think<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.550> hiring<00:02:53.150> him

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
I'm starting to think that hiring him

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.760 
I'm starting to think that hiring him
wasn't<00:02:53.780> such<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.050> good<00:02:54.260> idea

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
wasn't such a good idea

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.140 
wasn't such a good idea
he<00:02:55.010> doesn't<00:02:55.400> seem<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.670> know<00:02:55.790> what<00:02:55.970> he's<00:02:56.090> doing

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
he doesn't seem to know what he's doing

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.870 
he doesn't seem to know what he's doing
I<00:02:56.600> was<00:02:57.020> observing<00:02:57.380> him<00:02:57.680> earlier<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.760> only

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
I was observing him earlier and the only

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.850 
I was observing him earlier and the only
thing<00:02:59.120> he<00:02:59.240> seemed<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.510> like<00:02:59.660> about<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.080> job<00:03:00.110> is

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
thing he seemed to like about the job is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.110
