00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
their defense with one basically one

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.189 
their defense with one basically one
move<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.890> makes<00:00:29.279> sense<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> use<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
move that makes sense so I like to use a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.860 
move that makes sense so I like to use a
golem<00:00:31.910> followed<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.000> by<00:00:33.059> some<00:00:33.329> whizzers<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
golem followed up by some whizzers and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.590 
golem followed up by some whizzers and
some<00:00:34.020> wall<00:00:34.230> breakers<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.340> usually<00:00:35.550> how<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
some wall breakers this is usually how I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.500 
some wall breakers this is usually how I
used<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.070> using<00:00:38.340> my<00:00:38.430> composition<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.329> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
used this is using my composition that I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.139 
used this is using my composition that I
do<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.020> mean<00:00:40.860> obviously<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.550> basic<00:00:41.820> attack

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
do I mean obviously for the basic attack

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.069 
do I mean obviously for the basic attack
it<00:00:43.140> depends<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.219> composition<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.510> for

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it depends on your composition but for

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
it depends on your composition but for
this<00:00:46.140> base<00:00:46.379> i<00:00:46.590> decided<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> use<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> golem<00:00:47.610> some

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
this base i decided to use a golem some

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
this base i decided to use a golem some
wall<00:00:48.180> breakers<00:00:48.570> some<00:00:49.289> wizards<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:49.829> heroes

a hog attack or something but if it's if
it's<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.720> gonna<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.960> an<00:01:07.020> efficient<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
it's not gonna be an efficient way to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.640 
it's not gonna be an efficient way to
learn<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:11.220> worry<00:01:11.430> i<00:01:11.610> mean<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.650> if

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
learn then don't worry i mean like if

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
learn then don't worry i mean like if
it's<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> cost<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.400> thirty<00:01:14.670> troop

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
it's going to cost you thirty troop

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.609 
it's going to cost you thirty troop
space<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.840> kill<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> clan<00:01:16.590> castle

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
space to just kill the clan castle

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.609 
space to just kill the clan castle
earlier<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.540> might<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.689> well<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
earlier it might as well just not do it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.469 
earlier it might as well just not do it
just<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.210> more

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
just because it's it's going to be more

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.090 
just because it's it's going to be more
damage<00:01:21.990> than<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> help<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
damage than it's going to help that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.030 
damage than it's going to help that
makes<00:01:24.090> sense<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.750> i<00:01:24.780> decided<00:01:25.140> not<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.590> let<00:01:25.710> just

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
makes sense so i decided not to let just

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.550 
makes sense so i decided not to let just
because<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> difficult<00:01:26.790> layer<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
because it was a difficult layer and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.880 
because it was a difficult layer and
they<00:01:28.680> didn't<00:01:28.920> want<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> waste<00:01:29.250> my<00:01:29.400> troop<00:01:29.729> space

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
they didn't want to waste my troop space

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.980 
they didn't want to waste my troop space
but<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> dropped<00:01:32.220> my<00:01:32.430> golem<00:01:32.790> down<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.750> path

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
but I dropped my golem down and the path

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.490 
but I dropped my golem down and the path
in<00:01:34.200> my<00:01:35.040> heroes<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.360> basically<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.380> my

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
in my heroes and I basically that was my

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.670 
in my heroes and I basically that was my
plan<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:37.950> least<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:38.729> after<00:01:39.270> did<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.689> my

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
plan at least and then after did that my

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.940 
plan at least and then after did that my
plan<00:01:41.070> was<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> take<00:01:41.579> out<00:01:42.030> these<00:01:42.119> air<00:01:42.329> defense

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
plan was to take out these air defense

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950 
plan was to take out these air defense
with<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:44.189> hounds<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.759> loons<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.530 
with my hounds and loons and to do so I
just<00:01:46.229> dropped<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.560> hound<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.920> each<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.250> them

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
just dropped a hound on each of them

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.179 
just dropped a hound on each of them
follow<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:48.840> about<00:01:48.960> six<00:01:49.470> balloons<00:01:49.740> three

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
on each of the surrounding defenses and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.800 
on each of the surrounding defenses and
followed<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.860> by<00:01:52.920> rage<00:01:53.220> spells<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> back

followed up by rage spells so back
that's<00:01:55.079> basically<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> plan<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.280> any<00:01:56.430> blood

on<00:03:16.060> each<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.419> defense<00:03:17.109> is<00:03:17.260> any<00:03:17.470> more<00:03:17.680> than

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
on each of the defense is any more than

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.039 
on each of the defense is any more than
three<00:03:18.220> you're<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.209> wasting<00:03:19.630> your<00:03:19.660> balloons

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
three you're just wasting your balloons

because<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:21.160> really<00:03:21.370> don't<00:03:21.549> need<00:03:21.639> that<00:03:21.790> many

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
because you really don't need that many

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.470 
because you really don't need that many
on<00:03:22.450> one<00:03:22.780> defense<00:03:23.459> just<00:03:24.459> because<00:03:24.760> they<00:03:24.910> do<00:03:25.329> so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
on one defense just because they do so

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.900 
on one defense just because they do so
much<00:03:25.630> damage<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.349> more<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:26.769> actually<00:03:27.639> not<00:03:27.760> as

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
much damage so more is actually not as

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.559

good<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:29.739> makes<00:03:29.950> any<00:03:30.130> sense<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.970> know<00:03:31.030> only

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
good that makes any sense you know only

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.259 
good that makes any sense you know only
need<00:03:31.870> three<00:03:32.109> because<00:03:32.410> they're<00:03:33.030> their<00:03:34.030> bombs

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
need three because they're their bombs

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.569 
need three because they're their bombs
do<00:03:34.569> so<00:03:34.750> much<00:03:34.900> damage<00:03:35.010> three<00:03:36.010> balloons<00:03:36.310> can

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
do so much damage three balloons can

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.659 
do so much damage three balloons can

well if your base that you're attacking
they<00:03:52.840> have<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.290> high<00:03:54.220> damaged<00:03:54.730> core<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.410> this

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
they have a high damaged core so this

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.890 
they have a high damaged core so this
base<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:56.889> had<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.069> bunch<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.459> Tesla's<00:03:57.970> expose<00:03:58.599> and

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
base I had a bunch of Tesla's expose and

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.890 
base I had a bunch of Tesla's expose and
wizard<00:03:59.200> towers<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.739> court<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.900> felt

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
wizard towers on the court and I felt

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.750 
wizard towers on the court and I felt
like<00:04:01.989> it'd<00:04:02.169> been<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.349> better<00:04:02.590> idea<00:04:02.739> if<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.400> were

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
like it'd been a better idea if I were

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.629 
like it'd been a better idea if I were
to<00:04:04.000> throw<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:05.500> deeper<00:04:05.859> rage<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.370> they<00:04:06.489> could

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
to throw a deeper rage so they could

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.059 
to throw a deeper rage so they could
affect<00:04:06.989> more<00:04:07.989> of<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.139> base<00:04:08.319> then<00:04:08.709> just<00:04:08.949> stay

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
affect more of the base then just stay

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.780 
affect more of the base then just stay
outside<00:04:09.989> defenses<00:04:11.250> but<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.519> putting<00:04:12.669> the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
outside defenses but this is putting the

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.240 
outside defenses but this is putting the
raid<00:04:13.299> everything<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:13.989> basically<00:04:14.620> destroyed

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
raid everything is basically destroyed

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.909 
raid everything is basically destroyed
except<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.699> expo<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.500> it's<00:04:17.500> just<00:04:17.680> cleanup

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
except the expo and it's just cleanup

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.520 
except the expo and it's just cleanup
time<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:19.209> that's<00:04:19.419> yeah<00:04:19.959> that's<00:04:19.989> basically<00:04:20.289> how

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
time so that's yeah that's basically how

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.610 
time so that's yeah that's basically how
you<00:04:20.650> la<00:04:20.919> lune<00:04:21.159> in<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:22.060> general<00:04:22.450> aspect<00:04:22.900> once

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
you la lune in the general aspect once

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.650 
you la lune in the general aspect once
you<00:04:23.740> have<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:24.159> the<00:04:24.640> flow<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:24.909> your<00:04:25.150> hounds

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
you have the the flow of your hounds

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.770 
you have the the flow of your hounds
and<00:04:25.780> balloons<00:04:26.140> correct<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:27.340> can<00:04:27.520> destroy<00:04:28.450> any

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
and balloons correct you can destroy any

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.880 
and balloons correct you can destroy any
base<00:04:29.230> that<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.890> want<00:04:30.160> in<00:04:30.370> my<00:04:30.430> opinion<00:04:31.830> kind<00:04:32.830> of

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
base that you want in my opinion kind of

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.410 
base that you want in my opinion kind of
just<00:04:33.010> right<00:04:33.160> like<00:04:33.190> riding<00:04:33.670> a<00:04:33.730> bike<00:04:33.970> once<00:04:34.300> you

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
just right like riding a bike once you

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.220 
just right like riding a bike once you
learn<00:04:34.570> how<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.810> do<00:04:34.990> it<00:04:35.140> you<00:04:35.470> can<00:04:35.740> do<00:04:35.890> it<00:04:35.920> forever

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
learn how to do it you can do it forever

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.350 
learn how to do it you can do it forever
yeah<00:04:38.230> let's<00:04:38.380> just<00:04:38.440> clean<00:04:38.770> up<00:04:38.800> I'll<00:04:39.790> just<00:04:39.970> recap

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
yeah let's just clean up I'll just recap

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.530 
yeah let's just clean up I'll just recap
the<00:04:40.540> steps<00:04:40.810> first<00:04:41.590> kill<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.700> Queen<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.240> an

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
the steps first kill the Queen and an

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.330 
the steps first kill the Queen and an
air<00:04:43.690> defense<00:04:44.730> second<00:04:47.130> basically<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.250> entire

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
air defense second basically the entire

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.600 
air defense second basically the entire
rest<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:48.940> attack<00:04:49.600> is<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:50.400> drop<00:04:51.400> your

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
rest of the attack is to drop your

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.210 
rest of the attack is to drop your
hounds<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:52.240> your<00:04:52.360> balloons<00:04:53.220> simultaneously

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
hounds and your balloons simultaneously

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.450 
hounds and your balloons simultaneously
or<00:04:54.400> back-to-back<00:04:55.120> basically<00:04:56.040> it's<00:04:57.040> sometimes

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
or back-to-back basically it's sometimes

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.250 
or back-to-back basically it's sometimes
it's<00:04:57.610> better<00:04:57.820> if<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.150> drop<00:04:58.390> your<00:04:58.570> loons<00:04:58.720> first

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
it's better if you drop your loons first

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.200 
it's better if you drop your loons first
just<00:05:00.010> because<00:05:00.070> they<00:05:00.400> travel<00:05:00.790> slower<00:05:01.030> than

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
just because they travel slower than

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.660 
just because they travel slower than
your<00:05:01.300> hounds<00:05:01.980> it's<00:05:02.980> just<00:05:03.160> dependent<00:05:03.490> on<00:05:03.580> the

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
your hounds it's just dependent on the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.000 
your hounds it's just dependent on the
base<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:04.090> be<00:05:04.210> honest<00:05:04.570> some<00:05:04.900> bases<00:05:05.230> have<00:05:05.770> closer

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
base to be honest some bases have closer

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.100 
base to be honest some bases have closer
air<00:05:06.250> defenses<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.240> it's<00:05:07.450> better<00:05:07.660> if<00:05:07.870> you<00:05:07.930> have

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
air defenses and it's better if you have

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.280 
air defenses and it's better if you have
your<00:05:08.260> power<00:05:08.560> out<00:05:08.890> first<00:05:09.220> but<00:05:09.540> you<00:05:10.540> understand

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
your power out first but you understand

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.750 
your power out first but you understand
