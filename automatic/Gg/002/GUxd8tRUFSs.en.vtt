00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.960
 finally the fans were able to sigh with 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.150
 relief because they perry endured a whole 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.020
 year in anticipation of the continuation of the sensational 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.020
 games series 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.390
 dewalt ended from studio short 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.649
 slurred dlc 400 days about the calculation do not take 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.869
 when counting all this time 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.579
 probably there is hardly a stranger 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.260
 or at least the edges of the ear did not hear 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.329
 the universe of the walking dead 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.100
 this is a comic book series of the same name created 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.380
 by robert kirkman narrating about 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.930
 harsh everyday lives of people in the world stunned 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.090
 zombie epidemics by comic strip filmed 3 seasons 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.260
 series now goes just 4 and 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.300
 released two games 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.730
 one of which is a terrible action from 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.530
 first person and 2 it unscrew hurray which 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.520
 currently comes with a subtitle 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.920
 second season 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.440
 the plot of the new game continues later 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.570
 almost a year and a half after the events of the first 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.399
 the season we see with our own eyes how 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.290
 the heroine of the last part of the clementine from 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.520
 little defenseless girl who 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.079
 took care of the character or 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.180
 turned into a girl who 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.130
 have to go on many heavy things 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.869
 to survive alone as I understand it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.609
 this will be the main idea of ​​the second 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.649
 season though i hope the authors 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.249
 will come up with something else before in a fight not 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.249
 bored 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.090
 new walking dead practically not 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.370
 different from the original game the same with 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.140
 this graph is the same ideology gameplay 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.240
 the truth is there are small changes that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.520
 migrated from tungsten us for example 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 it became much more quick time event 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 scenes because the game is even stronger 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.980
 reminds an interactive film than 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.900
 quest and appeared normal 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.910
 the variability in these scenes that is if 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.040
 while running for example we stumble and 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.720
 fall it does not mean death at all and we 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.580
 we can continue playing only with 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.010
 watching some other skit also 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.840
 you ltl changed the look of the dialogs like in a beehive 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.640
 added a pause which can be included 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.800
 any moment of the game and which is not so 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.899
 enough before no changes left 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.000
 ethereal atmosphere series on screen 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.830
 dramatic scenes unfold in this 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.450
 time the player's soul scrape cats from 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.940
 seen and it all happens by 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.920
 familiar to everyone notes and although so far os 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.810
 so not happy as in the first season I think 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.670
 that by the end of the story the tracks will go where 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.150
 how better it was the same in the first 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.920
 parts 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.840
 what up to the scenes themselves during which all 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.350
 it happens who they also punch 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.760
 on a tear 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.590
 for example it was not very hard 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.870
 telling during one moment in 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.459
 house about the past and about whether that is generally necessary 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.110
 say that the writers are quite able 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.820
 playing on this story but another question 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.830
 can they support similar 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.870
 feelings are four more episodes and here I am 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.670
 getting to the problems of the game right away 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.560
 outlined his attitude towards her to me 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.120
 like the general plot and the atmosphere is not 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.070
 really cool made under 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.540
 just an hour and a half game and 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.190
 which is probably done in 5 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.959
 scenery unlike any 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.440
 flipper of ace or job studio quantic 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.570
 dream 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.519
 but there are some moments that me and 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.900
 used to be puzzled and here 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.980
 and completely begin to break the whole atmosphere 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.980
 walk in bed 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.569
 my troops first is crazy 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.189
 plot situations that us 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.319
 slip the authors go now 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.879
 spoilers so get ready in this 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.799
 episode main thought and spun 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.720
 around the fact that clementine is left alone 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.670
 and and the dog bites and it gets to 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.260
 another group of people at those naturally 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.060
 the panic of lisa begins bites they 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.920
 offer ingenious solutions and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.569
 it is not someone who offers his doctor 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.790
 can't tell a ghoul bite from 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.799
 dog he says and let's get her 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.989
 let us shut in the barn for the night if the morning in 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.859
 girls will heat fever shoot to 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.480
 horseradish dog 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.579
 I am sitting at this moment and myself 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.379
 think that she has half hands ruined 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.299
 the dog she was so bad that all 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.950
 floated in the eyes and then she crashed into 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.079
 swoon and after that you want to say 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.720
 that she should not have a fever yes 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.549
 same nonsense dudes in the second if earlier 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.689
 situations with sudden death someone from 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.489
 the characters really were 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.530
 unexpected now they become 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.510
 stamped but most importantly they resemble 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.129
 some random event generator 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.049
 go to the toilet in the parking bam 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.090
 from there creep homeless 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.859
 which fart and she picks up a gun 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.449
 which clementine accidentally left u 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.970
 shells from which is shot 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.430
 again amide spoiler and it's all for 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.169
 1 2 minutes of the game for a start I will say that 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.760
 the death of this hero you tried 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.500
 maximum sad not to furnish 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.330
 especially touching since we saw him 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.280
 Axel two minutes now and in one 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.870
 episode of the first season but in general I 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.490
 really understand what the writers 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.740
 downright scrupulously sit and 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.539
 ponder to make such a mean thing in 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.370
 one situation or another to maximize 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.289
 realistic tear someone's death 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.270
 this and the series would decide by the way you 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.460
 look at every tree on the tractor at 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.199
 some kind of cudgel with some kind of just wild 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.940
 suspicion and wondering how 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.949
 from this thing will die someone from 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.990
 the characters end up being weird 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.729
 situation is like in post-apocalyptic 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.620
 you are safe from anything in the world 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.020
 but at the same time looking for a catch in 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.120
 each situation and third places 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.010
 completely lost the game and the variation 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.380
 more precisely the meaning of this very variation 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.389
 I explain it this way for the first time 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.770
 didn't give a bottle of water to me dying 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.050
 friends asked why actually 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.210
 the funny thing is that it's not about that 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.750
 that person attacked clementine I wanted 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.430
 revenge 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.080
 but simply because I was looking at it and 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.210
 I thought that generally change from my 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.130
 choice here again need to clarify that any 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.520
 the choice in the game seems to me divided into 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.069
 2 categories of moral from which we have 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.930
 soul heat or lousy irrational from 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.490
 which directly depends on the whole story and 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.289
 each of these situations in turn 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.909
 divided into 2 categories 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.770
 these are meaningful choices which 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.750
 really affect the plot and let's say 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.610
 so for a tick so here when come across 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.440
 those that for a tick that is lost 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.539
 atmosphere of immersion that is you don't even 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.580
 think whether it is good or bad or 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.830
 what happens after your decision so 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.870
 so I played and understood that I would give a drink 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.460
 music or not give it to lean or 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.440
 It happens that something that I even 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.419
 I do not have time to stretch the water 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.400
 some of these choices are recorded here 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.500
 to the general list of solutions that are supposedly my 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.990
 more meaningful why such a turning 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.970
 water bottles I don't know about everything 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.949
 the rest, as I said, no complaints 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.900
 no bugs save from first 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.819
 season all the solutions were transferred correctly 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.680
 were the same as in the original plot 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.210
 breaks off at the most interesting place and 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.949
 as usual I want to know what will happen 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.690
 further questioned only 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.520
 effects of replicas after which in 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.740
 the top corner is the inscription that he 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.180
 or another hero will remember this me and wolfie 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.669
 asked this question now 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.379
 I continue in general with the game, I advise everyone 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.509
 read because the story 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.009
 the atmosphere deserves the only thing 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.139
 that still worries me this 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.550
 system of consequences with which everything will become 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.659
 more or less clear only in 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.969
 next episodes 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.770
 I had everything with you on this joker 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:41.479
 keep watching me repost 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.770
 call friends here like and 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.770
 comment to everyone bye
