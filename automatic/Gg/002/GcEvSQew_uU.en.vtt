00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.490
 things are said 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.329
 the first thing to do is to know your skin type 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.989
 to find out what kind of products bought afterwards 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.479
 so it's simple whether you have dry skin learning poor oily skin or 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.579
 acne-prone skin once you have determined your 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.030
 skin type you know what type of products to buy for you to facilitate the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.210
 life I already made you a selection of products depending on the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.950
 skin type 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.820
 important to do this because your skin is attacked daily by 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.810
 pollution the cigarette 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.650
 the insurer the mayor leroux the sun the kryptonite 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 So it's just going to be a habit to make gestures from me 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.560
 and ice the blood first is to clean the skin with a product 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.710

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.030

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.150
 dry it must be made aware the words are those of pottery after its fall 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.010

 this phenomenon so I use the exfoliating gel program at marionnaud 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.809
