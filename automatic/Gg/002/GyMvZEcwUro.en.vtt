00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:05.670
 As if it did not sound, recently Chinese products 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.469
 produced at the European level. 

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.409
 You can poke at me with your fingers and giggle, but the china 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:14.809
 - it does not sound offensive anymore. Hi everyone, this is im Fotos, and 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.300
 today we will talk about what is not all that made 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.300
 in Chine is bad. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.820
 For example, a great dual-sim smartphone Huawei G500Pro middle 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.539
 class, and now tell you why. 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.759
 In smartphones, style is an important component, so let's start 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.859
 with the appearance. 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.519
 The body is plastic, but very cool assembly, and nice 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:32.519
 to the touch. 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.770
 The back cover is matte structured, which is why the smart is very convenient 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.060
 lies in the hand. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.330
 4.3 inch glossy screen, no mechanical buttons, 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 three virtual. 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.660
 Massive smartphone, something like a business man 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.520
 case, and to tell the truth, not a baby and not a feather. 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.470
 But even with such height-weight parameters, control it 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.355
 not difficult, and one left, and hands do not get tired. right away 

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:55.355
 let's look at the location of the speakers and connectors. 

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.270
 On the front of the long speaker, which is mounted 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.070
 indicator light, and underneath the front camera 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.040
 on funny 0.3 mp. 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.700
 But she is. 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.780
 Under the screen, three auxiliary buttons back home 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.940
 page history 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.430
 On the left side there is a connector for micro USB, on the right side there is a swing 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.430
 volume. 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.690
 At the top end is a standard headphone jack. 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.850
 and the power button, on the bottom - a microphone. 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.190
 On the cover in a row speaker, 5 MP camera and flash. 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.180
 Under the lid we have slots for two sim cards, 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.450
 Micro SD card slots up to 32 GB and 1950 mAh batteries. 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.170
 Now about the internal stuffing. 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.080
 Our smartphone is not very simple. 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.880
 He has a MediaTek dual-core processor and gig of RAM, 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.600
 so smart flies and does not freeze. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.100
 You cannot play with strategy with it, but it does not get warm and does not slow down 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 when running relatively lightweight games. 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.570
 OS - Android 4.0, the platform is quite popular 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.640
 and universal. 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.830
 Internal memory on the move 4 GB, but there is a possibility 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.150
 Expansion to 32 GB using a card. 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.820
 No matter how transcendental battery numbers appear to you, 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.050
 in fact, a 2n percent proves to be very voracious. 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.849
 In general, the smart is enough for full time 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.529
 from 9 to 21 with the head. 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.220
 Lost music without respite for 10 hours, and only 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.709
 then asked for exercise. 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.549
 Telephone conversations without the Internet at an average load 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.310
 - this is a day and a half of work without recharging. 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.939
 Very good, but the Internet and games exhaust smart 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.599
 faster. 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.849
 From the outlet is fully charged for 5 hours 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.720
 from scratch And with this application you can easily 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.719
 control how you consume the battery. 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.260
 A few words about the Internet. I use Wi-Fi, but 3G Internet 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.550
 too. 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.819
 Here it only works on the first slot. 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.920
 Therefore, you need to install a card for the Internet 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920
 here. 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.559
 And then turn on the default card in the settings for 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.809
 calls and for an Internet, and everything is ready. 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:04.029
 If you, like me, have two calling cards, 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.180
 then each time you dial or send a message, 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.040
 the phone suggests which subscriber to use. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.920
 And you can bind the number to a specific card, 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.189
 and the prompt will not pop up. 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.599
 The last number in the list can be dialed using 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.779
 these buttons. 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:20.780
 A bit of multimedia. 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.709
 Nice to watch the video with this smart. 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.689
 Let the resolution is not the highest, but the picture quality, 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.989
 brightness and contrast level, the eye is nice. 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.499
 The speaker may be located somehow obliquely, but the sound is loud, 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.619
 albeit not very clean, and bass, and high frequencies 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:36.040
 - all as it should. 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.040
 I even watched a movie on Huawei, although I am not a fan of movies on 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.040
 small screens, but with it it is convenient. 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.219
 The internal filling is standard, without any frills. 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.430
 Five desktops, three app backgrounds and darkness 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.049
 widgets for every taste. 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.260
 Even Twitter and Facebook are on the move. 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.909
 Standard applications Google and Yandex. 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.541
 From useful file manager, translator, map 

00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.019
 addresses and FM radio. 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.309
 In all other respects, the Play Market helped me. 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.129
 Instead of the standard player - Winamp, instead of the video player 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.949
 - movies online, added an application that controls 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.299
 my battery, and fun toys. 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.529
 The camera is not bad in principle, but on condition that 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:10.529
 good lighting. 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:14.230
 Makes cute panoramas, takes 3D photos, videos in 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.230
 HD format. 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.680
 There are flash and autofocus. 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.230
 For ordinary photos you can sculpt a lot of any effects. 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.570
 The front camera is of no interest in principle, 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.170
 for in poor light it is completely useless. 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.590
 For video, go chat rooms and Skype. 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.170
 And to fix the hair. 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.220
 That's all. 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.210
 We wanted a smartphone for a little money? 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.210
 Get it! 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.410
 Value for money is excellent, not sorry 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.410
 will be 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.780
 Heavy, I confess, and Ice Cream operating system is not fresh, but in general 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.980
 smart paid off. 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.060
 Fast and fast, does not hang and works for a long time, even if 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.830
 load it up like a draft horse. 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.320
 Stylish and personable, and justified in our eyes 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.450
 far China. 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.760
 I liked it, and you remember that your choice always remains 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.640
 After you!
