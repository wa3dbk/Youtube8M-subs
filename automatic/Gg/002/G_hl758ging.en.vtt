00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.301
 When a woman sees a man, a man in sight 

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:15.840
 sees a woman in sight, between them begin to form 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:26.680
 there are some non-verbal there - I'm just glad that there is, 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.640
 what to share - on a non-verbal level, how would a man hooked 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.790
 woman like eyes. 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.860
 And there, the first cross is slippery places. 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.989
 Well, like a man saw a woman and drove past. 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.079
 I understood that I even didnâ€™t want to talk about nature and weather. 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.179
 That is, at the level of nonverbalism, a woman should already attract 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.500
 and cling specifically to a man. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.829
 Then the man approaches and begins to communicate. 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:55.829
 He throws the bait there. 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.429
 Here we have done when homework 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.839
 "Three" here on this topic - three, seven, ace - technology, 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.320
 which we coached. 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 And this happens, say, the first such interchange, 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 some kind of replicas, some of these. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.360
 As they say - the first impression can not be made twice. 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.430
 If suddenly a woman threw a grenade, in terms of 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.080
 female psychology, scared man, believe me that, 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.200
 it turns out, now I already have a forbidden book 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.869
 - a dictionary of forbidden words, where phrases, expressions ... 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.540
 Well, for example, conventions. 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.200
 Let's define an example. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 You know that a woman can not speak, I believe that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.049
 It is forbidden to speak with a man - if, then. 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.470
 This is what the men do not know, do not see. 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.159
 And so, if a woman begins to interweave 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.210
 these things here, and by chance it may, it may even 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.810
 go for a neutral topic. 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.659
 Now, if the weather is good tomorrow, then ... 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.880
 Everything, girls, this, this at once, you know, well, grouchy wife 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.780
 with a rolling pin - if you don't come home from work, then. 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 And now I have such a whole, a whole dictionary, 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.220
 You see, here are these phrases, constructions, because 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.610
 there is a certain kind of psychology of men. 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.240
 That is, it was a "grenade", it was a mine. 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.950
 A man once, having heard this from a woman, will run, 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.260
 yes, run. 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.450
 Especially if there, roughly speaking, you see, a grenade 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.750
 But not one can fly. 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.580
 Can fly 2, 3 or 4, or 5 grenades. 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.580
 Here it is. 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.940
 Therefore, really, the first impression is impossible 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.940
 build twice. 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.460
 It can only be built once. 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.580
 Therefore, if something is not as it blurted out, the man 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.190
 took and oops, yes, ran away.
