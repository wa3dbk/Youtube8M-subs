with<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.620> well<00:02:35.010> because<00:02:35.220> I've<00:02:35.430> already

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
with it well because I've already

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.890 
with it well because I've already
created<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.000> ads<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.480> they're<00:02:36.600> doing<00:02:36.870> just

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
created the ads what they're doing just

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.960 
created the ads what they're doing just
having<00:02:37.380> bits<00:02:37.590> out<00:02:37.739> nice<00:02:38.250> huge<00:02:38.550> caught<00:02:38.820> this

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
having bits out nice huge caught this

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.910 
having bits out nice huge caught this
huge<00:02:39.180> production<00:02:39.600> costs<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.230> these<00:02:40.350> ads<00:02:40.560> yeah

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
so it's easier for industry trader a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.570 
so it's easier for industry trader a
little<00:02:43.470> bit<00:02:43.590> then<00:02:43.739> start<00:02:44.190> again<00:02:44.280> from<00:02:44.519> scratch

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
little bit then start again from scratch

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.130 
little bit then start again from scratch
and<00:02:44.910> there<00:02:45.090> must<00:02:45.209> be<00:02:45.360> happy<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.720> everybody's

the<00:04:38.380> bad<00:04:39.360> it's<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.510> i<00:04:40.539> didn't<00:04:40.930> i<00:04:41.139> think<00:04:41.440> i<00:04:41.530> think

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
the bad it's so i didn't i think i think

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.020 
the bad it's so i didn't i think i think
we've<00:04:41.860> done<00:04:42.010> really<00:04:42.160> well<00:04:42.340> here<00:04:42.550> because

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
we've done really well here because

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.370 
we've done really well here because
there<00:04:43.120> was<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.270> few<00:04:43.570> put<00:04:43.750> within<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.050> little<00:04:44.289> bit

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
there was a few put within a little bit

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.170 
there was a few put within a little bit
but<00:04:44.560> but<00:04:44.919> generally<00:04:45.370> because<00:04:45.520> it<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> little

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
but but generally because it is a little

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.909 
but but generally because it is a little
premise<00:04:46.539> course<00:04:46.750> if<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.020> like<00:04:47.200> yeah<00:04:47.560> but<00:04:47.800> it's

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
premise course if you like yeah but it's

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.350 
premise course if you like yeah but it's
done<00:04:48.070> in<00:04:48.220> consumer<00:04:48.370> i<00:04:48.700> mean<00:04:48.910> i<00:04:49.000> think<00:04:49.150> they

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
done in consumer i mean i think they

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.790 
done in consumer i mean i think they
take<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.660> right<00:04:49.810> character<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.350> guy<00:04:50.440> doesn't

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
take the right character the guy doesn't

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.200 
take the right character the guy doesn't
look<00:04:50.860> like<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.039> fly<00:04:51.310> boy<00:04:51.580> he<00:04:51.700> doesn't<00:04:52.000> like

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
look like a fly boy he doesn't like

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.240 
look like a fly boy he doesn't like
something<00:04:52.419> to<00:04:52.630> national<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:53.050> i<00:04:53.289> bought<00:04:53.919> model

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
something to national so i bought model

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.320
