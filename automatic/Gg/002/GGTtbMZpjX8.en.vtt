00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.280 
them all the time as much as we possibly
can<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> we're<00:01:54.210> trying<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.810> developers

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
can and we're trying to get developers

that<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.710> patch<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:56.340> Tekkit<00:01:57.060> main<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:57.840> us<00:01:58.020> so

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that can patch up Tekkit main for us so

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.310 
that can patch up Tekkit main for us so
we<00:01:58.680> no<00:01:59.009> longer<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.700> worry<00:01:59.729> about<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.570> now

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
we no longer have to worry about it now

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.340 
we no longer have to worry about it now
that's<00:02:01.560> exciting<00:02:02.040> that's<00:02:02.810> majorly<00:02:03.810> exciting

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that's exciting that's majorly exciting

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.100 
that's exciting that's majorly exciting
we're<00:02:05.130> super<00:02:05.369> excited<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.840> means

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
we're super excited because this means

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.350 
we're super excited because this means
that<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.560> no<00:02:07.829> banned<00:02:08.129> items<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that we can have no banned items on the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.430 
that we can have no banned items on the
entire<00:02:09.810> server<00:02:10.819> no<00:02:11.819> banned<00:02:12.270> items

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 
entire server no banned items
it<00:02:13.590> won't<00:02:13.890> get<00:02:14.190> corrupt<00:02:14.660> that's<00:02:15.660> our<00:02:15.960> major

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it won't get corrupt that's our major

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.230 
it won't get corrupt that's our major
goal<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.100> not<00:02:17.130> get<00:02:17.400> anything<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.000> ruin

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
goal is to not get anything to ruin

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.260 
goal is to not get anything to ruin
itself<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.650> no<00:02:19.890> banned<00:02:20.160> items<00:02:20.430> this

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
itself and to have no banned items this

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.490 
itself and to have no banned items this
is<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.630> really<00:02:21.810> really<00:02:22.110> difficult

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
is going to be really really difficult

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.590 
is going to be really really difficult
considering<00:02:23.220> there's<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.670> couple<00:02:23.850> objects<00:02:24.420> out

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
considering there's a couple objects out

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.850 
considering there's a couple objects out
there<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.860> mess<00:02:26.070> with<00:02:26.310> everything

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
there that like to mess with everything

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.100 
there that like to mess with everything

as we plan on expanding with other
servers<00:02:57.270> now<00:02:57.900> what<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:59.010> these<00:02:59.130> servers<00:02:59.400> you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
servers now what are these servers you

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.340 
servers now what are these servers you
may<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.820> asking<00:03:00.300> well<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> couple<00:03:00.960> plans

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
may be asking well a couple plans

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.680 
may be asking well a couple plans
servers<00:03:01.830> are<00:03:02.070> at<00:03:02.160> least<00:03:02.280> triple<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.330> what<00:03:03.660> i

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
servers are at least triple is what i

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.470 
servers are at least triple is what i
should<00:03:03.840> say<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.860> have<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.400> Tekkit<00:03:06.030> classic

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
should say is we have a Tekkit classic

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.210 
should say is we have a Tekkit classic
server<00:03:06.720> coming<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.290> which<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.650> don't<00:03:07.830> expect

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
server coming up which we don't expect

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.980 
server coming up which we don't expect
to<00:03:08.340> get<00:03:08.460> majorly<00:03:08.880> popular<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:09.630> we<00:03:09.720> do<00:03:09.870> expect

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
to get majorly popular but we do expect

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.090 
to get majorly popular but we do expect
it<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.560> run<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:10.950> lot<00:03:11.220> better<00:03:11.430> than<00:03:11.970> Tekkit<00:03:12.870> mayor

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
it to run a lot better than Tekkit mayor

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.650 
it to run a lot better than Tekkit mayor
mainly<00:03:14.100> because<00:03:14.280> take<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> classic<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
mainly because take a classic is the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.630 
mainly because take a classic is the
last<00:03:15.840> resource<00:03:16.170> demanding<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:16.920> has<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> lot

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
last resource demanding and has a lot

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.010 
last resource demanding and has a lot
less<00:03:17.970> glitches<00:03:19.280> on<00:03:20.280> second<00:03:20.940> hand<00:03:21.090> we<00:03:21.510> plan<00:03:21.750> on

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
less glitches on second hand we plan on

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.800 
less glitches on second hand we plan on
making<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.820> mount<00:03:23.820> vanilla<00:03:24.500> minigame<00:03:25.500> server

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
making a mount vanilla minigame server

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.910 
making a mount vanilla minigame server
we<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:27.959> not<00:03:28.080> know<00:03:28.230> if<00:03:28.320> we're<00:03:28.440> going<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.620> use<00:03:28.890> one

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
we do not know if we're going to use one

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.790 
we do not know if we're going to use one
point<00:03:29.700> eight<00:03:29.910> point<00:03:30.239> seven<00:03:30.510> or<00:03:30.900> 1.7<00:03:31.770> point<00:03:32.220> 10

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.229 
point eight point seven or 1.7 point 10
we're<00:03:34.800> probably<00:03:35.160> going<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.400> end<00:03:35.459> up<00:03:35.640> using<00:03:35.910> one

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
we're probably going to end up using one

we're probably going to end up using one
point<00:03:36.510> eight<00:03:36.690> point<00:03:36.989> seven<00:03:37.260> but<00:03:38.870> these<00:03:39.870> will

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
point eight point seven but these will

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.290 
point eight point seven but these will
be<00:03:40.200> up<00:03:40.440> maybe<00:03:41.010> within<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.520> next<00:03:41.670> month<00:03:41.880> in

setting up is an FTB feed the beast
server<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.840> will<00:03:55.019> be<00:03:55.110> many<00:03:55.350> variations<00:03:55.769> of

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160

feed<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> beast<00:03:57.360> obviously<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:59.070> for<00:03:59.610> now<00:03:59.730> we

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
feed the beast obviously but for now we

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.630 
feed the beast obviously but for now we
will<00:04:00.660> just<00:04:00.810> currently<00:04:01.560> work<00:04:01.769> on<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.010> file<00:04:02.250> set
