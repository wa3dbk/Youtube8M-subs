scrander<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.660> you'll<00:02:07.870> see<00:02:08.200> it's<00:02:08.470> got<00:02:08.619> a

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
scrander and you'll see it's got a

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.680 
scrander and you'll see it's got a
little<00:02:08.769> metal<00:02:09.700> piece<00:02:09.970> there<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.330> actually<00:02:10.420> a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
pieces here and a keys in right here

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.229 
pieces here and a keys in right here
where<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:17.440> button<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:17.950> right<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.030> hole

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
where this button is right to this hole

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.970 
where this button is right to this hole
here<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.720> got<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.959> do<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.170> put<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.860> on

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
metallic paint use on the scrander and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.410 
metallic paint use on the scrander and
of<00:02:26.349> course<00:02:26.590> red<00:02:26.950> does<00:02:27.159> not<00:02:27.430> show<00:02:28.150> up<00:02:28.269> on

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
of course red does not show up on

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.580 
of course red does not show up on
cameras<00:02:28.840> very<00:02:29.019> well

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
top of his head to pilot panda Z what

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.410 
top of his head to pilot panda Z what
we'll<00:02:39.400> get<00:02:39.519> into<00:02:39.730> next<00:02:39.879> is<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> articulation

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
we'll get into next is the articulation

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.330 
we'll get into next is the articulation
so<00:02:40.959> let<00:02:41.080> me<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.319> remove<00:02:41.560> these<00:02:41.800> bits<00:02:42.069> since

go forward you have the knees here which
are<00:03:02.680> also<00:03:02.829> ratcheted<00:03:03.400> two<00:03:03.579> clicks<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.150> then

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
are also ratcheted two clicks and then

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.620 
are also ratcheted two clicks and then
you<00:03:04.870> also<00:03:05.049> have<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:06.010> feet<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.549> a<00:03:06.579> ball<00:03:07.420> joint

now<00:03:08.380> I'm<00:03:08.470> hoping<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:08.890> by<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.069> time<00:03:09.540> this

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
now I'm hoping that by this time this

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.539 
now I'm hoping that by this time this
figure<00:03:10.959> has<00:03:11.170> reminded<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.799> of<00:03:11.829> another<00:03:12.099> robot

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
figure has reminded you of another robot

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.030 
figure has reminded you of another robot
and<00:03:12.819> that's<00:03:12.970> because<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:14.079> whole<00:03:14.230> series<00:03:14.739> of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
and that's because the whole series of

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.339 
and that's because the whole series of
pandas<00:03:15.549> II<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.790> really<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:16.629> like<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.810> parody

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
pandas II is really just like a parody

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.800 
pandas II is really just like a parody
of<00:03:17.379> Mazinger<00:03:18.220> Z<00:03:18.430> which<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.269> why<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.480> has<00:03:19.780> a

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
of Mazinger Z which is why this has a

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.500 
of Mazinger Z which is why this has a
scrander<00:03:20.230> why<00:03:21.040> has<00:03:21.340> rocket<00:03:21.760> punch<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.150> Y<00:03:22.239> has<00:03:22.480> a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
scrander why has rocket punch of Y has a

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.479 
scrander why has rocket punch of Y has a
pilot<00:03:22.989> but<00:03:23.260> instead<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.739> pile<00:03:23.980> there<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.310> has

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
pilot but instead of a pile there it has

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.150 
pilot but instead of a pile there it has
a<00:03:24.760> little<00:03:25.510> panda<00:03:25.900> now<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.739> do<00:03:26.860> want<00:03:27.010> to

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
demonstrate the rocket punch so let's

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.069 
demonstrate the rocket punch so let's
get<00:03:29.530> both<00:03:29.769> arms<00:03:30.250> here<00:03:30.640> forward<00:03:31.329> we're<00:03:31.930> gonna

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
get both arms here forward we're gonna

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.379 
get both arms here forward we're gonna
shoot<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.530> left<00:03:32.799> one<00:03:32.980> first<00:03:33.250> here<00:03:33.489> there<00:03:34.269> you

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
shoot the left one first here there you

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.129 
shoot the left one first here there you
go<00:03:34.569> try<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.590> other<00:03:35.709> one<00:03:36.810> then<00:03:37.810> you've<00:03:37.959> also

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
go try the other one then you've also

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.930 
go try the other one then you've also
got<00:03:38.290> another<00:03:38.620> gimmick<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.370> removed<00:03:39.730> the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
got another gimmick you just removed the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.520 
got another gimmick you just removed the
scrander<00:03:40.329> set<00:03:40.660> it<00:03:40.750> aside<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.260> you'll<00:03:41.350> see

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
scrander set it aside and you'll see
