00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.559 
then depending on if you're gonna add a
bale<00:02:37.319> or<00:02:37.680> use<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.700> loop<00:02:38.909> as<00:02:39.120> your<00:02:39.390> bail

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
bale or use this loop as your bail

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.690 
bale or use this loop as your bail
depends<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.260> how<00:02:40.409> you<00:02:41.069> know<00:02:41.190> big<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.519> want<00:02:41.670> to

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
depends on how you know big you want to

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.520 
depends on how you know big you want to
make<00:02:41.879> it<00:02:42.030> I'm<00:02:42.299> gonna<00:02:42.510> use<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.870> loop<00:02:43.049> as<00:02:43.230> my

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
make it I'm gonna use this loop as my

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.500 
make it I'm gonna use this loop as my
bail<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:43.860> I'm<00:02:43.950> gonna<00:02:44.069> move<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.849> pliers<00:02:45.120> up<00:02:45.239> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
bail so I'm gonna move the pliers up a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.380 
bail so I'm gonna move the pliers up a
little<00:02:45.720> bit<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.110> start<00:02:46.260> my<00:02:46.470> loop<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.090> gets<00:02:48.269> a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
little bit to start my loop so it gets a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.479 
little bit to start my loop so it gets a
little<00:02:48.540> bigger<00:02:51.980> wrap<00:02:52.980> like<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.340> did<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:54.420> arms

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
little bigger wrap like you did the arms

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.830 
little bigger wrap like you did the arms
and<00:02:56.489> again<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.849> want<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.150> wrap<00:02:57.360> nice<00:02:57.599> and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and again you want this wrap nice and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.930 
and again you want this wrap nice and
tight<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.390> pushes<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.230> arms<00:03:01.530> down

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
tight so that it pushes the arms down

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.960 
tight so that it pushes the arms down
and<00:03:02.940> locks<00:03:03.420> them<00:03:03.629> in<00:03:03.750> place

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.240 

this<00:03:11.960> case<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.440> may<00:03:12.620> need<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:12.950> use<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.130> chain

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
this case you may need to use the chain

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.699 
this case you may need to use the chain
nose<00:03:13.580> pliers<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.030> get<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.270> even<00:03:14.390> tighter

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.890 

and<00:03:19.519> straighten<00:03:19.879> your<00:03:19.909> loop<00:03:22.540> then<00:03:23.540> trim<00:03:23.780> the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
and straighten your loop then trim the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.900 
and straighten your loop then trim the
excess

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.730 

and<00:03:28.750> tap<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.560> tail<00:03:31.020> you<00:03:32.020> can<00:03:32.230> adjust<00:03:32.620> your

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
and tap in the tail you can adjust your

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.110 
and tap in the tail you can adjust your
arms<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.850> now<00:03:34.240> you<00:03:34.300> have<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> cross<00:03:34.810> pendant
