00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.920
 Naples 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.450
 beautiful girls are in passive dignity and 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.670
 also today I come back with the new review 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.130
 of an impossible game is a game that 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.619
 was suggested to me by a user who 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.430
 I want to say hello and thank you 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.410
 stuntman 373 and suggested this to me 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.630
 flash game called almost 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.460
 Impossible is already the name says so much 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.010
 in fact this is one of those little games 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.840
 that despite having very few commands vi 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.330
 it will make life very difficult 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.540
 in fact as you can see from the video you have to 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.129
 command this little black rectangle and us 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.260
 there commands you need to use are right 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.129
 and left to move it to do it 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.080
 jumping from the video you can also find that 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.089
 the aim of the game is to pass 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.129
 the platform on the platform without ever 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.489
 fall into the void and go further 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.290
 possible in the level I also call it 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.449
 level but reality is not there at least not 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.100
 I think there is a distinction between the level 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.559
 level in the sense that you do not pass by 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.680
 level because even playing a nice game 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.510
 bit and even going a long way ahead not 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.799
 you never get to a point where you pass 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.770
 however you don't get to level 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.659
 not even one end, at least I played 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.969
 I don't admit too much though also giving 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.460
 I never got to one much later 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.219
 end so I think the purpose of the game 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.070
 both let you escape as much as possible and 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.170
 no more you go the more you come home 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.820
 the better, in short, even if there is no 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.409
 final score given to you 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.899
 you just need to remember where 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.079
 you have arrived because the field does not 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.399
 it changes every time it's always the same 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.159
 initially this game seems to me 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.109
 really very difficult because enough 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.329
 then unmanageable little black square 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.390
 you have to get used to it a little bit though 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.200
 will become more playable and the challenge will be 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.359
 that of going as far as possible 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.299
 also because after a while streep and it is 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.069
 definitely another thing that there is to 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.929
 stress in this game are those 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.600
 species of light that appear in the 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.210
 rectangles I was not very simple 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.639
 when when that light is illuminated 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.009
 small green top right and why 

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:07.780
 you are skipping the red one and when 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.300
 you are falling with the quads go towards the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.830
 low while the right and left 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.080
 only when you move to the right 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.960
 and left 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.230
 plus another command of this game 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.010
 is the down arrow that will allow you to 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.140
 shrinks to lower by 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.270
 practically and this serves because 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.380
 when you are flying , and press the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.120
 juke key said is a little more 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.650
 quickly 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.850
 I do not know what it's going thing is 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.130
 so one more thing is that they will be 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.410
 always to speech lucine when you 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.300
 make contact with the right side 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.800
 left of your little black rectangle 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.820
 with a wall of those platforms the 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.650
 your little rectangle will light up 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.200
 of orange and at that point it means that 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.780
 you can still press z and then jump 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.340
 from the platform where you are then 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.470
 you can also jump to the side in words 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.290
 poor and this will save you many times 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.400
 when you are about to fall 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.959
 well this game is not there 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.550
 nothing else to say except in flash 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.190
 so you can go and play right away and 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.420
 try like here if you like leave me 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.850
 a nice comment you see a nice like 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.030
 but before ending the video I wanted 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.160
 once again remind you that I 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.020
 together with my other friends from Ferrara 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.670
