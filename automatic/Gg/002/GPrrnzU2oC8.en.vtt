00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.140
 hello guys with you hamish and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.300
 today we talk about my zoom and unrest 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 while basically everyone without whom I 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.060
 I can not play this zoom at all 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.230
 which add it features 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.669
 approximations there x16 and so on 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.309
 I rummaged a little bit in it 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.090
 realized that their sixteen is not all 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.300
 what is possible to have in this zoom that is 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.390
 then you can get at least 256 zoom 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.899
 units can even share 10 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:56.129
 Look now at zoom x30 see 24 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:59.160
 16-12 8642 that is, you can put 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.420
 absolutely any zoom way you want 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.769
 just need to open the file 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.320
 Zoom x I did it specifically 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.530
 I will lay out separately in the description of this video 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.510
 and write down what path to throw it off 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.729
 here you can change the zoom 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.020
 whatever you put most of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.580
 People in modpak on zoom guys that is, and 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.220
 It is because of the zoom and it does not often download 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.500
 wrote that they say modpaks are helpful 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.060
 order, well, to whom, as I personally can play 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 Now let's only go with your home 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.770
 sockets here which is transparent 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.939
 only with his poor sight of course 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 when I became a ku panel with you 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.790
 wanted green found only blue nothing 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.320
 blue is also normal oh bye 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.640
 talked about zoom , etc. completely forgot 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.270
 about the upper flank did not go there 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.820
 ratchet 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.770
 Well, in short, beat at the beginning of the battle 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.610
 I think that you drain normally play all 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.670
 norms after the bridge before they did not go rest 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.469
 but in general guys download zoom x 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.409
 put it and put as much as 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.350
 You want to zoom and will you happiness can 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.930
 I do not even know the little one 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.200
 point on the tank if you have there and 25 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.730
 for example, all the fleas themselves between boys 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.830
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.180
 join the vk group 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.700
 tactics will further deal with 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.130
 configs can still make my own 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.850
 Here are the best battles you this zoom will be 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.890
 suit 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.650
 absolutely to any version since this 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.570
 I have one file in all versions 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.690
 same but if something will change i 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.070
 I will naturally talk about it here 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.070
 thanks for watching good luck
