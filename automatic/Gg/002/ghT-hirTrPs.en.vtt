obviously going down the stretch also

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.730 
obviously going down the stretch also
taking<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> game<00:01:12.810> over<00:01:13.080> yeah<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.619> he

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
taking the game over yeah you know he

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
taking the game over yeah you know he
just<00:01:13.770> say<00:01:14.189> he<00:01:14.400> drives<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.119> ball<00:01:15.299> he<00:01:15.600> hits<00:01:15.780> big

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
just say he drives the ball he hits big

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620 
just say he drives the ball he hits big
shots<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> defensive<00:01:18.000> end<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
shots and then on the defensive end I

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.969 
shots and then on the defensive end I
think<00:01:18.840> he<00:01:18.960> has<00:01:19.049> ability<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> hell<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
think he has ability to be a hell of a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
think he has ability to be a hell of a
defensive<00:01:20.490> player<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
defensive player but you know it's a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.840 
defensive player but you know it's a
