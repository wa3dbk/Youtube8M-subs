about image search engines is when I
click<00:02:55.670> through<00:02:55.909> results<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.540> get<00:02:56.659> a<00:02:56.690> lot<00:02:56.810> of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
click through results I get a lot of

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.750 
click through results I get a lot of
dead<00:02:57.109> links<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.620> what<00:02:58.069> we've<00:02:58.189> done<00:02:58.340> at<00:02:58.549> live

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
dead links and what we've done at live

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.610 
dead links and what we've done at live
search<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.299> try<00:02:59.689> to<00:02:59.750> reduce<00:03:00.139> the<00:03:00.319> amount<00:03:00.500> of

you was our macro feature and what a
macro<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.629> really<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:09.109> way<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:09.859> to

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
macro is is really a way for you to

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.710 
macro is is really a way for you to
create<00:03:10.189> your<00:03:10.280> own<00:03:10.400> search<00:03:10.790> engine<00:03:10.909> and<00:03:11.269> what

this really does is it allows you to
limit<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.489> searches<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:14.120> sites<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.569> you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
limit the searches to sites that you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.479 
limit the searches to sites that you
really<00:03:14.989> care<00:03:15.170> about<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.530> let's<00:03:16.010> say<00:03:16.189> I<00:03:16.220> want

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
really care about and let's say I want

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.830 
really care about and let's say I want
to<00:03:16.579> create<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.819> search<00:03:17.000> engine<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.569> search

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
to create a search engine a search

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.500 
to create a search engine a search
engine<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.139> is<00:03:18.500> relevant<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.190> people<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.790> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
engine that is relevant to people in the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.460 
engine that is relevant to people in the
Toronto<00:03:20.660> area<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.260> care<00:03:21.440> about

ambassador what i get is a preview of my

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.009 
ambassador what i get is a preview of my
search<00:03:34.879> macro<00:03:35.299> on<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.599> right<00:03:35.750> hand<00:03:35.900> side

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
search macro on the right hand side

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.050 
search macro on the right hand side

relevant results that are scoped by the
three<00:03:43.970> universities<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.959> I'm<00:03:45.049> gonna<00:03:45.139> close

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
three universities so I'm gonna close

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.719 
three universities so I'm gonna close
this<00:03:45.470> page<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.799> actually<00:03:46.040> go<00:03:46.159> back<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.459> save

this page and actually go back and save

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.789 
this page and actually go back and save
this<00:03:47.000> macro<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.930> I'll<00:03:48.379> actually<00:03:48.530> say

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
this macro and I'll actually say

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.530 
this macro and I'll actually say
customize<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.430> page<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.849> what<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.090> means<00:03:50.329> is

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
customize the page so what this means is

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.539 
customize the page so what this means is
not<00:03:51.109> only<00:03:51.260> minute<00:03:51.560> creating<00:03:51.859> a<00:03:51.919> search<00:03:52.190> macro

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
not only minute creating a search macro

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:53.920 
not only minute creating a search macro
that<00:03:52.639> I<00:03:52.729> can<00:03:52.909> use<00:03:52.940> I<00:03:53.239> can<00:03:53.389> actually<00:03:53.599> send<00:03:53.810> it

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
that I can use I can actually send it

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.050 
that I can use I can actually send it
around<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.769> my<00:03:54.889> friends<00:03:55.250> it's<00:03:55.400> also<00:03:55.609> adding<00:03:56.000> it

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
around to my friends it's also adding it

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.119 
around to my friends it's also adding it
to<00:03:56.090> my<00:03:56.180> scope<00:03:56.510> bar<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.019> more<00:03:57.199> macros<00:03:58.040> i

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
to my scope bar so the more macros i

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.039 
to my scope bar so the more macros i
create<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.609> easier<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.269> is<00:03:59.329> for<00:03:59.389> me<00:03:59.659> to<00:03:59.690> go

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
create the easier it is for me to go

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.539 
create the easier it is for me to go
through<00:04:00.290> all<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:00.530> different<00:04:00.590> relevant
