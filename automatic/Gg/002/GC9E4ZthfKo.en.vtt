00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.219 
casing just if you want to get an idea
of<00:02:08.069> what<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.369> will<00:02:08.429> look<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:09.090> your<00:02:09.300> window

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
of what it will look like in your window

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.540 
of what it will look like in your window
and<00:02:10.500> I'm<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> drive<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.250> screw

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and I'm going to drive that screw

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.780 
and I'm going to drive that screw
straight<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.270> through<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.140> hole<00:02:13.459> at<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.610> very

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
straight up through the hole at the very

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.910 
straight up through the hole at the very
top<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.239> bracket<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.260> okay

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
top of the bracket just like that okay

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
top of the bracket just like that okay
so<00:02:17.430> we<00:02:17.550> have<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:17.700> screw<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.720> just

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so we have one screw in there and just

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.260 
so we have one screw in there and just
for<00:02:19.620> security<00:02:20.430> purposes<00:02:20.819> I'm<00:02:20.940> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.090> put<00:02:21.239> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
for security purposes I'm going to put a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.089 
for security purposes I'm going to put a
second<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.470> usually<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.980> put

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
second one in and I usually like to put

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.580 
second one in and I usually like to put
that<00:02:23.280> screw<00:02:23.550> off<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.030> side<00:02:24.319> just<00:02:25.319> going<00:02:25.530> to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
that screw off to the side just going to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.500 
that screw off to the side just going to
taste<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.980> bracket<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.730> pull<00:02:27.030> pulling<00:02:27.360> away

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
taste the bracket is pull pulling away

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.000 
taste the bracket is pull pulling away
from<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.020> side<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.440> window<00:02:28.739> frame<00:02:28.950> a

from the side of the window frame a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.650 
from the side of the window frame a
little<00:02:29.280> we'll<00:02:29.459> just<00:02:29.700> kind<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.060> put<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.450> right

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
little we'll just kind of put it right

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.500 
little we'll just kind of put it right
up<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.080> frame<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.340> right<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.180> second

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
bracket is going to get mounted very

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.250 
bracket is going to get mounted very
much<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.310> same<00:02:35.520> way<00:02:35.810> we're<00:02:36.810> going<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.019> put<00:02:37.170> it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
much the same way we're going to put it

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.050 
much the same way we're going to put it
up<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> window<00:02:37.980> frame<00:02:38.280> all<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.730> way<00:02:38.850> back

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
up to the window frame all the way back

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.790 
up to the window frame all the way back
in<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.360> window<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.019> particular<00:02:40.349> case

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
in the window in this particular case

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.130 
in the window in this particular case
and<00:02:41.430> we're<00:02:41.730> going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.150> screw<00:02:42.540> straight<00:02:42.959> up

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and we're going to screw straight up

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.509 
and we're going to screw straight up
into<00:02:43.890> little<00:02:44.670> velcro<00:02:44.930> just<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.110> that

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
into little velcro just like that

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.070 
into little velcro just like that
alright<00:02:47.519> again<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.970> second<00:02:48.360> screw<00:02:48.630> for<00:02:48.930> good

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
alright again the second screw for good

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.740 
alright again the second screw for good
measure<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:51.260> it'll<00:02:52.260> go<00:02:52.380> into<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> side<00:02:56.750> now

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
measure and it'll go into the side now

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.270 
measure and it'll go into the side now
if<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.019> don't<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> option<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.069> putting

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
if you don't have the option of putting

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.949 
if you don't have the option of putting
that<00:02:59.519> second<00:02:59.940> screw<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.450> side<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.810> can

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
that second screw in to the side you can

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.720 
that second screw in to the side you can
always<00:03:01.110> put<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.470> second<00:03:01.830> screw<00:03:02.069> straight<00:03:02.549> up

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
always put the second screw straight up

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.460 
always put the second screw straight up
as<00:03:02.880> well<00:03:03.060> doesn't<00:03:03.450> necessarily<00:03:04.019> have<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.260> go

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
as well doesn't necessarily have to go

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.280 
as well doesn't necessarily have to go
into<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.860> side<00:03:05.480> okay<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.540> once<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
into the side okay so once we have the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.039 
into the side okay so once we have the
brackets<00:03:07.739> mounted<00:03:08.209> we'll<00:03:09.209> pick<00:03:09.420> up<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.780> blind

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
brackets mounted we'll pick up the blind

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.170 
brackets mounted we'll pick up the blind
now<00:03:10.350> before<00:03:10.980> we<00:03:11.130> actually<00:03:11.280> mount<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.880> blind

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
now before we actually mount this blind

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.850 
now before we actually mount this blind
we<00:03:12.299> have<00:03:12.420> one<00:03:12.630> more<00:03:12.870> step<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.680> step

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
we have one more step and that step

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.460 
we have one more step and that step
would<00:03:14.130> be<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.549> install<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.720> valance<00:03:16.140> clips

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
would be to install the valance clips

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.360 
would be to install the valance clips
the<00:03:17.400> valance<00:03:17.790> clips<00:03:18.709> get<00:03:19.709> attached<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the valance clips get attached to the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.340 
the valance clips get attached to the
front<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.299> head<00:03:21.480> rail<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.930> front<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.230> that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
front of the head rail in front of that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.410 
front of the head rail in front of that
rail<00:03:22.560> we<00:03:22.709> know<00:03:22.859> as<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.489> board's<00:03:23.940> coming<00:03:24.269> out

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
rail we know as the board's coming out

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.780 
rail we know as the board's coming out
of<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.690> okay<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.560> when<00:03:25.890> we<00:03:26.010> place<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.459> valance

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
of it okay and when we place the valance

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.130 
of it okay and when we place the valance
clips<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:27.329> want<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.540> make<00:03:27.600> sure<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:28.019> we

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
clips in we want to make sure that we

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.840 
clips in we want to make sure that we
put<00:03:28.350> them<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.620> such<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:28.859> place<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.250> we're<00:03:29.730> not

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
put them in such a place that we're not

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.880 
put them in such a place that we're not
going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.090> interfere<00:03:30.299> with<00:03:31.200> any<00:03:31.380> moving<00:03:31.709> parts

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
going to interfere with any moving parts

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.190 
going to interfere with any moving parts
mainly<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.880> barrels<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.600> hold<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.900> tapes

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
mainly the barrels and hold the tapes

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.430 
mainly the barrels and hold the tapes
the<00:03:35.070> cord<00:03:35.340> lock<00:03:35.579> mechanism<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.690> if<00:03:36.959> we<00:03:37.109> find<00:03:37.350> a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
the cord lock mechanism so if we find a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.900 
the cord lock mechanism so if we find a
spot<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.709> has<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.070> little<00:03:38.340> bit<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.519> an<00:03:38.579> opening

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
spot that has a little bit of an opening

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.640 
spot that has a little bit of an opening
I<00:03:39.030> think<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.359> spot<00:03:39.630> here<00:03:39.900> will<00:03:39.989> work<00:03:40.170> well<00:03:40.380> in

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
I think this spot here will work well in

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.319 
I think this spot here will work well in
this<00:03:40.739> particular<00:03:40.890> blind<00:03:41.609> we'll<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.209> sneak

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
this particular blind we'll just sneak

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.060 
this particular blind we'll just sneak
it<00:03:42.570> right<00:03:42.720> in<00:03:42.870> there<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.380> then<00:03:43.769> we<00:03:43.890> have<00:03:44.040> a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
it right in there and then we have a

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.640 
it right in there and then we have a
little<00:03:44.220> space<00:03:44.579> right<00:03:44.730> here<00:03:45.180> we'll<00:03:46.019> sneak<00:03:46.380> this

so okay now once it's in the brackets
just<00:04:13.350> try<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.859> even<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.130> blind<00:04:14.340> out<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.609> little

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
just try and even the blind out a little

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.099 
just try and even the blind out a little
bit<00:04:14.970> make<00:04:15.120> sure<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.389> have<00:04:15.510> an<00:04:15.630> even<00:04:15.840> amount<00:04:15.900> of

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
bit make sure you have an even amount of

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.430 
bit make sure you have an even amount of
space<00:04:16.380> on<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:17.160> right<00:04:17.310> side<00:04:17.579> on<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.820> left<00:04:17.910> side

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
space on the right side on the left side

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.589 
space on the right side on the left side
so<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:20.000> spacing<00:04:21.000> between<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.359> blind

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
so that the spacing between the blind

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:22.379 
so that the spacing between the blind
and<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.900> window

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
and the window

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.959 
and the window
is<00:04:22.539> about<00:04:22.749> even<00:04:23.020> it's<00:04:23.889> about<00:04:24.129> even<00:04:24.400> here<00:04:24.819> and

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
is about even it's about even here and

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.850 
is about even it's about even here and
then<00:04:25.539> once<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:25.990> get<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:26.289> just<00:04:26.499> the<00:04:26.620> way<00:04:26.800> you

that you hear that little snap okay the

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.209 
that you hear that little snap okay the
snap<00:04:33.909> meaning<00:04:34.419> that<00:04:34.689> the<00:04:34.900> bracket<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.770> seated

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:36.219 
snap meaning that the bracket is seated

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:37.950 
snap meaning that the bracket is seated
and<00:04:36.340> it's<00:04:36.460> not<00:04:36.639> accidentally<00:04:37.479> going<00:04:37.689> to<00:04:37.779> pull

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and it's not accidentally going to pull

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.080 
and it's not accidentally going to pull
open<00:04:38.110> when<00:04:38.949> you're<00:04:39.069> pulling<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.580> blinds<00:04:39.819> on

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
open when you're pulling the blinds on

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.089 
open when you're pulling the blinds on
them<00:04:40.240> down<00:04:40.389> okay<00:04:40.990> that's<00:04:41.289> very<00:04:41.349> important

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
them down okay that's very important

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:49.200 
them down okay that's very important
that<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:47.740> bracket<00:04:48.249> be<00:04:48.430> closed<00:04:48.699> all<00:04:48.909> the<00:04:48.999> way

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
that the bracket be closed all the way

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.999 
that the bracket be closed all the way
sometimes<00:04:49.749> it<00:04:49.870> takes<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.139> little<00:04:50.289> leg<00:04:50.499> strategy

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
sometimes it takes a little leg strategy

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.610 
sometimes it takes a little leg strategy
but<00:04:51.249> you<00:04:52.029> can<00:04:52.150> get<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.419> okay<00:04:52.870> so<00:04:53.319> we<00:04:53.409> have<00:04:53.529> the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
but you can get it okay so we have the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.110 
but you can get it okay so we have the
two<00:04:53.740> brackets<00:04:53.979> seated<00:04:54.729> they're<00:04:54.849> closed

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
two brackets seated they're closed

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.249 
two brackets seated they're closed
they're<00:04:55.150> tight<00:04:55.629> we<00:04:55.810> don't<00:04:55.960> have<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.110> worry

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259

about<00:04:56.319> the<00:04:56.529> blind<00:04:56.800> fold<00:04:57.129> out<00:04:57.370> we<00:04:57.849> can<00:04:58.000> lower

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
about the blind fold out we can lower

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.790 
about the blind fold out we can lower
the<00:04:58.389> blind<00:04:58.800> all<00:04:59.800> the<00:05:00.250> way<00:05:00.370> down<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:01.620> we<00:05:02.620> can

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
the blind all the way down and we can

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.320 
the blind all the way down and we can
operate<00:05:02.949> the<00:05:03.340> blind<00:05:03.550> make<00:05:03.789> sure<00:05:03.939> everything's

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330

functioning properly oh it looks great
and<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:08.050> last<00:05:08.379> step<00:05:08.710> to<00:05:09.159> our<00:05:09.189> inside<00:05:09.699> mount

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
and the last step to our inside mount

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.580 
and the last step to our inside mount
installation<00:05:10.569> is<00:05:10.659> going<00:05:10.719> to<00:05:11.020> be<00:05:11.139> adding<00:05:11.500> the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
installation is going to be adding the

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.890 
installation is going to be adding the
valence<00:05:12.039> alright<00:05:12.909> the<00:05:13.060> balance<00:05:13.419> just<00:05:13.629> snaps

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
valence alright the balance just snaps

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.129 
valence alright the balance just snaps
right<00:05:14.110> into<00:05:14.289> the<00:05:14.469> clips<00:05:14.770> that<00:05:14.889> we<00:05:15.159> added<00:05:16.139> there

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
right into the clips that we added there

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.659 
right into the clips that we added there
is<00:05:17.259> a<00:05:17.289> real<00:05:17.500> no<00:05:17.680> right<00:05:18.009> or<00:05:18.159> wrong<00:05:18.189> way<00:05:18.339> to<00:05:18.490> mount

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
is a real no right or wrong way to mount

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.550 
is a real no right or wrong way to mount
this<00:05:18.909> I<00:05:19.029> kind<00:05:19.240> of<00:05:19.270> like<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.569> mount<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.930> convex

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
this I kind of like the mount the convex

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.110 
this I kind of like the mount the convex
portion<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.159> it<00:05:21.279> toward<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.550> ceiling<00:05:21.789> but<00:05:21.999> you

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
portion of it toward the ceiling but you

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.800 
portion of it toward the ceiling but you
can<00:05:22.240> do<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.449> either<00:05:22.539> way

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
can do it either way

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.260 
can do it either way
just<00:05:23.589> place<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:23.860> top<00:05:24.189> of<00:05:24.339> the<00:05:24.400> valve<00:05:24.580> into<00:05:25.240> the

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
just place the top of the valve into the

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.860 
just place the top of the valve into the
valance<00:05:25.719> clips<00:05:26.020> like<00:05:26.259> that<00:05:27.210> just<00:05:28.210> snap<00:05:28.569> it<00:05:28.750> in

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
valance clips like that just snap it in

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:42.260 
valance clips like that just snap it in
place<00:05:29.250> okay

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.430 

okay<00:05:43.270> there's<00:05:43.630> that<00:05:43.750> one<00:05:45.660> and<00:05:46.660> there's<00:05:47.170> that

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
okay there's that one and there's that

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.260 
okay there's that one and there's that
one<00:05:47.620> so<00:05:47.830> we're<00:05:48.010> secure<00:05:48.430> now<00:05:48.640> we've<00:05:48.940> got<00:05:49.150> our

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
one so we're secure now we've got our

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.910 
one so we're secure now we've got our
valence<00:05:49.480> in<00:05:49.810> place<00:05:50.050> we've<00:05:50.350> got<00:05:50.380> our<00:05:50.620> blind

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
valence in place we've got our blind

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.490 
valence in place we've got our blind
mounted<00:05:51.400> and<00:05:51.640> guess<00:05:52.600> what<00:05:52.810> we're<00:05:53.080> finished

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
mounted and guess what we're finished

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.530 
mounted and guess what we're finished
we've<00:05:53.860> mounted<00:05:54.040> our<00:05:54.400> blind<00:05:54.670> inside<00:05:55.360> the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
we've mounted our blind inside the

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.360 
we've mounted our blind inside the
window<00:05:55.810> frame<00:05:55.840> so<00:05:56.290> that's<00:05:56.410> really<00:05:56.770> all<00:05:57.280> there

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
window frame so that's really all there

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.340 
window frame so that's really all there
is<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.700> it<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:57.850> map<00:05:58.090> your<00:05:58.270> blind<00:05:58.510> as<00:05:58.690> an<00:05:58.990> inside

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
is to it to map your blind as an inside

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.480 
is to it to map your blind as an inside
of<00:05:59.380> that<00:05:59.530> now<00:05:59.710> if<00:05:59.860> you<00:05:59.890> decided<00:06:00.400> you<00:06:00.460> wanted

of that now if you decided you wanted

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.070 
of that now if you decided you wanted
your<00:06:00.820> blind<00:06:01.030> to<00:06:01.150> be<00:06:01.240> mounted<00:06:01.510> outside<00:06:01.870> the

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
window frame the process is slightly

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.930 
window frame the process is slightly
different<00:06:05.320> you're<00:06:06.160> going<00:06:06.190> to<00:06:06.430> be<00:06:06.550> using<00:06:06.850> the

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.180 
to either mount it right to the molding
just<00:06:18.670> like<00:06:18.910> this<00:06:19.320> okay<00:06:20.320> where<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.620> outside<00:06:21.070> of

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190

the window building and what we suggest
is<00:06:26.110> that<00:06:26.140> you<00:06:26.290> pencil<00:06:26.770> mark<00:06:26.980> the<00:06:27.190> holes<00:06:27.370> one<00:06:27.670> on

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
is that you pencil mark the holes one on

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.130 
is that you pencil mark the holes one on
top<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:28.270> one<00:06:28.390> on<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.720> bottom

top and one on the bottom
pre-drill<00:06:30.040> them<00:06:30.400> so<00:06:30.640> that<00:06:30.790> when<00:06:30.940> you<00:06:31.030> put

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
pre-drill them so that when you put

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.730 
pre-drill them so that when you put
screws<00:06:31.570> through<00:06:31.810> there<00:06:32.020> you<00:06:32.170> don't<00:06:32.290> split<00:06:32.620> and

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
screws through there you don't split and

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.590 
screws through there you don't split and
crack<00:06:32.950> your<00:06:32.980> moldings<00:06:33.550> all<00:06:33.700> right<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:34.420> once

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
you've pre-drilled them put the bracket

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.970 
you've pre-drilled them put the bracket
back<00:06:36.130> up<00:06:36.780> put<00:06:37.780> your<00:06:37.870> screws<00:06:38.230> in<00:06:38.470> your<00:06:38.500> mounting

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
back up put your screws in your mounting

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.070 
back up put your screws in your mounting
screws<00:06:39.280> do<00:06:39.640> the<00:06:39.760> same<00:06:40.030> for<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:40.450> opposite<00:06:40.870> side

and<00:07:17.560> in<00:07:18.040> place<00:07:18.310> we<00:07:18.520> want<00:07:18.670> to<00:07:18.700> just<00:07:18.850> hold<00:07:19.060> it

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
and in place we want to just hold it

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.820 
and in place we want to just hold it
behind<00:07:19.330> the<00:07:19.630> bracket<00:07:20.080> we're<00:07:20.500> going<00:07:20.620> to<00:07:20.680> bring

behind the bracket we're going to bring

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.800 
behind the bracket we're going to bring
the<00:07:20.950> bracket<00:07:21.280> up<00:07:21.430> to<00:07:21.760> the<00:07:21.880> wall<00:07:22.060> just<00:07:22.090> like<00:07:22.420> so

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
the bracket up to the wall just like so

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.320 
the bracket up to the wall just like so
I<00:07:23.650> usually<00:07:24.070> like<00:07:24.190> to<00:07:24.310> rest<00:07:24.490> the<00:07:24.640> bracket<00:07:25.210> right

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
I usually like to rest the bracket right

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.030 
I usually like to rest the bracket right
on<00:07:25.510> top<00:07:25.750> of<00:07:25.930> the<00:07:26.050> window<00:07:26.200> molding<00:07:26.680> like<00:07:26.710> that

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.450 
and then we drive our screw right
through<00:07:28.870> the<00:07:29.350> holes<00:07:29.530> through<00:07:29.890> the<00:07:30.040> spacer
