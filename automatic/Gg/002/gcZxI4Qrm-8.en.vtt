00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.019
 hi everyone these women and up to date 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.300
 find today for a small 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.460
 exclusivity discovered by myself 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.650
 you have to put a capture mode of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.540
 flag is in health settings of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.220
 ranges to be shared and one elimination 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.960
 this is essential 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.420
 so I'm going to show you how to have 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.740
 an unlimited fighting adage so that 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.270
 walk with several killstreaks but 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.790
 I will especially introduce you this one 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.590
 basically it's very simple you 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.480
 do your fight adav until then 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.150
 I think everyone will come to the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.500
 then do you need a person 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.710
 who is on your team 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.540
 another in the opposing team if 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.829
 possible as soon as you launch your 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.630
 adapts of combat you do your 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.880
 elimination so I'm going to kill myself 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.650
 directly you do your elimination 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.350
 and when your fight adav arrives 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.120
 towards the end you will kill one of your 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.290
 teammates using the damage share 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.360
 when you go kill that your 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.220
 automatically kill you see you he 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.690
 there are guys sharing and it's going here from 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.890
 you exclude but you are the other so 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.310
 it's going to make it impossible for you to exclude 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.170
 the other 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.840
 once it's done you go so 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.760
 be stuck on the view of the adav you 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.070
 change class and give yourself your 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.049
 so class the same class and it's okay 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.729
 put at loading times out of expectations of 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.590
 reappearing homework appear 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.150
 you wait for you than your adav's 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.250
 fighters nai self one of your friends on 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.540
 destroy and you raise it all 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.700
 simply so you can again 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.100
 to raise it there you see that I repeat 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.229
 handling multiple times without killing 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.850
 nobody I'm happy that you're my 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.799
 teammate so that the glitch works 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.110
 you on your side you can 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.090
 use it nadav power of combat 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.780
 unlimited you make your elimination 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.840
 normal arrived late 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.159
 well you do the duplication of dav 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.540
 dedicate appeared your adav is done 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.979
 destroy and you throw them so 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.810
 so here is a duplication of 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.190
 killstreak that works with several 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.720
 killstreaks so here I am going to you 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.549
