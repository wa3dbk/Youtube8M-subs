00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
that statistic and look at the quality

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.099 
that statistic and look at the quality
of<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.640> possession<00:01:01.059> as<00:01:01.179> to<00:01:01.300> where<00:01:01.719> it<00:01:01.750> is<00:01:01.899> in

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
of the possession as to where it is in

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.710 
of the possession as to where it is in
the<00:01:02.199> field

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
the field

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.810 
the field
yeah<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.930> possession<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.700> possession<00:01:06.700> is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
yeah the possession the possession is

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.850 
yeah the possession the possession is
it's<00:01:07.330> important<00:01:07.840> when<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.050> create<00:01:08.350> chances

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
it's important when you create chances

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's important when you create chances
so<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.280> possession<00:01:09.700> for<00:01:09.909> itself<00:01:10.270> is<00:01:10.420> nothing

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so the possession for itself is nothing

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.270 
so the possession for itself is nothing
so<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:13.000> try<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.240> hide<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.020> possession<00:01:14.500> in

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
so we try to hide the possession in

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.260 
so we try to hide the possession in
front<00:01:15.640> yes<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:18.189> try<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.520> because<00:01:18.970> sometimes

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
front yes and try it because sometimes

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.330 
front yes and try it because sometimes
you<00:01:19.540> but<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:20.020> have<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.320> big<00:01:20.829> big<00:01:21.009> possession

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
to play in the high high speed but to

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.860 
to play in the high high speed but to
change<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.879> rhythm<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:46.690> can<00:02:46.930> play<00:02:47.349> in<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:48.870> huge

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870

change the rhythm you can play in a huge
huge<00:02:50.260> huge<00:02:50.500> speed<00:02:50.920> because<00:02:51.250> when<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:51.940> play<00:02:52.150> a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
huge huge speed because when you play a

huge speed after you can change the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.710 
huge speed after you can change the
rhythm<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.530> try<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.860> say

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
rhythm so you have to try to say

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.410 
rhythm so you have to try to say
aggressive<00:02:58.720> without<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.409> ball<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.370> with<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
aggressive without the ball and with the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.759 
aggressive without the ball and with the
pole<00:03:01.599> we<00:03:01.780> try<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:01.989> play<00:03:02.340> quickly<00:03:03.340> but<00:03:04.560> but<00:03:05.560> in

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
also as well for you it's important that

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.440 
also as well for you it's important that
players<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:15.069> interchange<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:16.090> position

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
players can interchange the position

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.539 
players can interchange the position
that<00:03:16.599> they<00:03:16.720> play<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:18.040> value<00:03:18.400> do<00:03:18.519> you

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
that they play in what value do you

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.869 
that they play in what value do you
place<00:03:18.610> upon<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.480> yeah<00:03:20.129> I'd<00:03:21.129> like<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.580> change

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
place upon that yeah I'd like to change

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.930 
place upon that yeah I'd like to change
but<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.480> we<00:03:23.260> needing<00:03:23.640> intelligent<00:03:24.640> players

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
but the we needing intelligent players

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.119 
but the we needing intelligent players
to<00:03:25.299> know<00:03:25.450> when<00:03:25.659> they<00:03:25.840> change<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.319> position

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
to know when they change the position

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.789 
to know when they change the position
another<00:03:27.909> play<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:29.110> know<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.440> use<00:03:29.650> this

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
another play you know can use this

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.449 
another play you know can use this
position<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.900> more<00:03:32.319> when<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:33.430> know

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
position I like more when the you know

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.080 
position I like more when the you know
the<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.599> ball<00:03:34.870> go<00:03:35.319> to<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.709> positions<00:03:36.280> the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
the the ball go to the positions the

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.059 
the the ball go to the positions the
players<00:03:37.540> more<00:03:37.780> than<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.140> players<00:03:38.409> move<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.890> lot

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
players more than the players move a lot

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.990 
players more than the players move a lot
so<00:03:40.230> maybe<00:03:41.230> in<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.920> next<00:03:42.280> time<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> fewer

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
so maybe in the next time in the fewer

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.390 
so maybe in the next time in the fewer
in<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.629> future<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.920> know<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.189> players

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
in the future that you know the players

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.699 
in the future that you know the players
can<00:03:45.730> understand<00:03:46.209> better<00:03:46.390> what<00:03:47.200> we<00:03:47.349> are

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
can understand better what we are

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.890 
can understand better what we are
looking<00:03:48.040> for<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.939> after<00:03:49.269> for<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.540> natural

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
looking for and after for the natural

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.009 
looking for and after for the natural
way<00:03:50.049> they<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.500> change<00:03:50.769> but<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.480> beginning<00:03:52.900> is

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
way they can change but the beginning is

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.949 
way they can change but the beginning is
is<00:03:53.409> better<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.890> stay<00:03:54.370> in<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.700> position<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.450> in

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
is better to stay in the position and in

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.229 
is better to stay in the position and in
the<00:03:56.110> players<00:03:56.349> in<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.860> ball<00:03:57.069> try<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:58.090> move

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
the players in the ball try to to move

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.030 
the players in the ball try to to move
as<00:03:58.420> quick<00:03:58.629> as<00:03:58.720> possible<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.260> go<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.769> the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
as quick as possible and go to the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.440 
as quick as possible and go to the
positions<00:04:00.489> when<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:00.760> have<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.030> player<00:04:01.209> there

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
positions when you have the player there

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.929 
positions when you have the player there
it's<00:04:02.019> been<00:04:02.260> an<00:04:02.409> incredible<00:04:02.950> star<00:04:03.280> how<00:04:03.640> close
