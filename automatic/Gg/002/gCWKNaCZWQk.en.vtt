there's all that science put into this

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.370 
there's all that science put into this
so<00:00:23.340> I'll<00:00:24.210> explain<00:00:24.510> all<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> sciency<00:00:25.350> stuff

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so I'll explain all the sciency stuff

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.130 
so I'll explain all the sciency stuff
later<00:00:26.480> but<00:00:27.480> right<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:27.630> I'm<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.870> gonna<00:00:27.990> kind

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:06.170 

tighten<00:01:57.660> up<00:01:59.330> and<00:02:00.330> walk

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.870 

here's<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.390> completed<00:02:08.220> they<00:02:11.100> now<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.550> reason

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
here's the completed they now the reason

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.960 
here's the completed they now the reason
for<00:02:12.910> all<00:02:13.330> its<00:02:14.040> history<00:02:15.040> winners<00:02:15.520> all<00:02:15.730> its

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
for all its history winners all its

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.860 
for all its history winners all its
paces<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:18.610> Bay<00:02:19.620> when<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:21.300> spinning<00:02:22.300> its

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
paces is this Bay when it's spinning its

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.620 
paces is this Bay when it's spinning its
right<00:02:23.140> rotating<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.130> when<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.239> spinning

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
right rotating so when it's spinning

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.990 
right rotating so when it's spinning
it's<00:02:26.290> really<00:02:26.770> short<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.370> looks<00:02:27.550> kind<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.819> tall

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
it's really short it looks kind of tall

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940 
it's really short it looks kind of tall
when<00:02:28.450> I'm<00:02:28.540> holding<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:29.050> but<00:02:29.260> it's<00:02:29.410> actually

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
when I'm holding it but it's actually

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.979 
when I'm holding it but it's actually
short<00:02:30.660> compared<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.780> most<00:02:31.930> bays<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:34.630> being

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
short compared to most bays and it being

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.000 
short compared to most bays and it being
short<00:02:35.800> I'm<00:02:36.130> realistic<00:02:36.519> for<00:02:36.819> another<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:38.010> being

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
short I'm realistic for another it being

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.790 
short I'm realistic for another it being
as<00:02:39.370> shorted<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.440> means<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.680> has<00:02:41.769> a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
as shorted it is and that means it has a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.650 
as shorted it is and that means it has a
low<00:02:42.310> center<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.970> gravity<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:46.360> not<00:02:46.510> going

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
low center of gravity so it's not going

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.820 
low center of gravity so it's not going
to<00:02:46.720> get<00:02:46.840> knocked<00:02:47.050> over<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.440> easy<00:02:47.560> because<00:02:47.709> it

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
to get knocked over is easy because it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.720 
to get knocked over is easy because it
can<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:49.390> really<00:02:49.660> low<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.900> ground<00:02:50.730> also

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
can it's really low to the ground also

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.820 
can it's really low to the ground also
it<00:02:52.120> has<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.269> weight<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.050> due<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.319> this<00:02:53.470> fusion

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it has a weight to it due to this fusion

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.520 
it has a weight to it due to this fusion
wheel<00:02:54.130> it's<00:02:54.880> kind<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.120> heavy

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
wheel it's kind of heavy

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.710 
wheel it's kind of heavy
your<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.400> then<00:02:57.519> most<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:58.000> them<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.299> guess<00:02:58.690> a

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
your and then most of them I guess a

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.110 
your and then most of them I guess a
dark<00:02:59.519> could<00:03:00.519> be<00:03:00.670> heavy

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
dark could be heavy

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.440 
dark could be heavy
it's<00:03:02.110> probably<00:03:02.650> heaviest<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.299> also

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
it's probably heaviest but it's also

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.710 
it's probably heaviest but it's also
really<00:03:04.780> thick<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:06.640> thing's<00:03:07.209> kind<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.570> here<00:03:07.690> I

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
really thick this thing's kind of here I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.970 
really thick this thing's kind of here I
don't<00:03:07.780> know<00:03:07.930> Holly<00:03:08.200> you're<00:03:08.650> going<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.829> say

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
don't know Holly you're going to say

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.789 
don't know Holly you're going to say
this<00:03:09.130> but<00:03:09.370> yeah<00:03:09.880> darks<00:03:10.329> pretty<00:03:10.540> thick<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.680> I'm

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
this but yeah darks pretty thick so I'm

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.090 
this but yeah darks pretty thick so I'm
using<00:03:12.239> blame<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:17.350> weight<00:03:17.620> causes<00:03:17.980> it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
using blame and this weight causes it

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.210 
using blame and this weight causes it
not<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.400> tip<00:03:18.609> over<00:03:18.790> as<00:03:19.060> much<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:22.829> I'm<00:03:23.829> using<00:03:24.070> the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
not to tip over as much so I'm using the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.759 
not to tip over as much so I'm using the
same<00:03:24.370> stadium<00:03:24.609> as<00:03:24.880> last<00:03:25.120> time<00:03:25.390> bagel<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.200> little

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
same stadium as last time bagel a little

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.979 
same stadium as last time bagel a little
few<00:03:26.980> in<00:03:28.560> take<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:30.010> Thunder<00:03:30.640> with<00:03:31.239> stadium

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
few in take this it Thunder with stadium

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.569 
few in take this it Thunder with stadium
as<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.630> guess<00:03:35.470> out<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.680> bounds<00:03:36.070> is<00:03:36.190> stupid

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
as to I guess out of bounds is stupid

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.940 
as to I guess out of bounds is stupid
front<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:38.280> we're<00:03:39.280> going<00:03:39.459> this<00:03:39.730> way

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
front to it and we're going this way

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.360 
front to it and we're going this way
versus<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.150> did<00:03:43.239> in<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.390> last<00:03:43.510> video

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
versus like we did in the last video

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.920 
versus like we did in the last video
l-drago<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:47.970> haven't<00:03:48.970> really<00:03:49.480> tried<00:03:49.690> this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
l-drago I haven't really tried this

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.949 
l-drago I haven't really tried this
since<00:03:50.140> I've<00:03:50.290> built<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.940> last<00:03:51.940> because<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.780> built

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
since I've built it last because I built

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.110 
since I've built it last because I built
it<00:03:53.079> before<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.650> was<00:03:53.769> amazing<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.760> never

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
it before and it was amazing it never

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.960 
it before and it was amazing it never
walls<00:03:55.530> but<00:03:56.530> then<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.739> took<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:56.920> apart<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.489> this

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
walls but then I took it apart so this

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.090 
walls but then I took it apart so this
may<00:03:58.209> not<00:03:58.390> be<00:03:58.510> specifically<00:03:59.109> good<00:03:59.769> you<00:03:59.950> might

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
may not be specifically good you might

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.660 
may not be specifically good you might
have<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.400> kind<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:01.450> mess<00:04:01.660> around<00:04:01.810> with<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.920> low

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
have to kind of mess around with the low

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.569 
have to kind of mess around with the low
profile<00:04:04.150> spit<00:04:04.510> tracks<00:04:05.069> so<00:04:06.069> let<00:04:06.190> me<00:04:06.310> get<00:04:06.459> on

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
profile spit tracks so let me get on

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:16.570 
profile spit tracks so let me get on
ready<00:04:07.560> here

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.280 

I'm<00:04:17.580> going<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.820> be<00:04:17.880> launching<00:04:18.030> since<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.050> can't

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
I'm going to be launching since I can't

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.030 
I'm going to be launching since I can't
hold<00:04:19.620> camera<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.550> watch<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.910> same<00:04:21.090> time<00:04:22.040> we

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
hold camera and watch the same time we

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.790 
hold camera and watch the same time we
launching<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.610> created<00:04:24.510> Bay<00:04:24.720> first<00:04:25.470> all

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
launching the created Bay first all

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:38.510 
launching the created Bay first all
diagram<00:04:35.750> so<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:37.200> is<00:04:37.470> an<00:04:37.590> attack<00:04:37.860> ring<00:04:38.100> but<00:04:38.400> it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
diagram so this is an attack ring but it

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.740 
diagram so this is an attack ring but it
does<00:04:38.880> tend<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.360> kind<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:39.900> sit<00:04:40.110> in<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.260> middle

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.230 

so<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.770> might<00:04:43.920> want<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.220> skip<00:04:44.490> ahead<00:04:44.730> there's

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
so you might want to skip ahead there's

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.480 
so you might want to skip ahead there's
going<00:04:45.540> to<00:04:45.630> be<00:04:45.690> an<00:04:45.780> annotation<00:04:46.020> but<00:04:46.590> right

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
going to be an annotation but right

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.360 
going to be an annotation but right
about<00:04:47.760> here

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
about here

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.940 
about here
right<00:04:50.370> there<00:04:50.780> all<00:04:51.780> right<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.590> can<00:04:55.770> just

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
right there all right that you can just

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.080 
right there all right that you can just
jump<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.490> til<00:04:57.210> it's<00:04:57.330> okay<00:04:58.670> well<00:04:59.670> it's<00:04:59.940> kind<00:05:00.060> of

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
jump to til it's okay well it's kind of

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.340 
jump to til it's okay well it's kind of
pointless<00:05:01.070> but<00:05:02.070> yeah

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
pointless but yeah

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.640 
pointless but yeah
Santosh<00:05:04.350> will<00:05:04.530> say<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.010> before<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:07.590> as

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
Santosh will say it so before that so as

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.480 
Santosh will say it so before that so as
you're<00:05:07.800> going<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:07.950> wait<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:09.840> can<00:05:10.020> see<00:05:10.250> l-drago

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
you're going to wait you can see l-drago

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:19.370 
you're going to wait you can see l-drago
is<00:05:11.880> kind<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.300> isn't<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:16.550> now<00:05:17.870> it<00:05:18.870> has<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.080> lot<00:05:19.350> of

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
is kind of isn't it now it has a lot of

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.720 
is kind of isn't it now it has a lot of
balance<00:05:20.840> wages<00:05:21.840> of<00:05:22.050> balance<00:05:22.860> but<00:05:23.070> does<00:05:23.550> not

balance wages of balance but does not

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.910

he's<00:05:29.430> actually<00:05:29.610> got<00:05:29.870> probably<00:05:31.370> scale<00:05:32.370> of<00:05:32.520> one

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
he's actually got probably scale of one
