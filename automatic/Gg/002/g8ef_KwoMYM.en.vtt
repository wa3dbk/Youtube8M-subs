00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.370
 do not 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.120
 and what happens that costs you is because it is 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.740
 very good today 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.020
 welcome to this new video in the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.369
 which one are we going to talk about what I 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.260
 I got lost because good for those who do not 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.060
 you know these days that I'm active 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.010
 I went on a trip, I went on a trip, I visited 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.510
 to my girlfriend for four days then it's 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.920
 that's why I'm inactive that was 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.110
 watching some videos of scheduled 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.750
 lenderman and good is Andaman slender 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.610
 and the guardian star but well 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.710
 I'm back and so try this 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.059
 activate a little more but good 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.670
 I tell them that it is more than anything it is a 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.770
 video collecting everything we saw this 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.989
 this from Thursday to Sunday 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.730
 Good thing there were not many things but 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.069
 something important is that we saw the mode 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.620
 good theater how is going to be the mode the 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:51.350
 theater mode in the zombies which looks 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.030
 pretty good I say this one they taught us a 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.699
 mini clip of that about 40 seconds 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.129
 about nothing else they showed us the map 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.899
 they showed us this some weapon how they were going 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.120
 to be the zombies and they showed us how 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.889
 It is that the theater will work so that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.110
 it almost looks the same as it would be 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.690
 good as it was in black ops in black ops 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.909
 1 this one and it looks pretty good we do not know 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.940
 it is not yet known how many 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.890
 seconds how many minutes how much 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.690
 it can be apart from being able to record the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.220
 theater mode alike looks great for 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.780
 at least 10 a day is something completely 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.430
 confirmed a long time ago I had been 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.440
 mentioned but it was not 100% 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.690
 confirmed otherwise we saw more than 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.490
 nothing this these days was the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.920
 constructive them good things that you 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.660
 you can build along 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.360
 trÃ nsit had already told us that transit 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.250
 it was good the new thing of transit is that 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.260
 it was going to be that you could gather materials and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.590
 build things this and you will be able to use 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.300
 things this kind of thing this to you to you 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.980
 good to help yourself not for 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.780
 example in the trailer that we were shown 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.040
 good in the previous in the gameplay that 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.980
 they taught us the old one for some 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.510
 stairs or a shield I'm not very 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.070
 sure exactly what it is but 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.200
 well you can see that it grabs what 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.060
 he puts it and what he has it again and that 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.110
 he uses it against the zombies as well as 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.940
 they were showing us some 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.760
 images in total are seven images that 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.560
 they have to do with all this that good 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.179
 stars, I call him bus of libri stops 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.649
 as well as that some good for some 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.080
 time these images are available 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.930
 this but afterwards they removed them 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.820
 will lose a lot of say are images are 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.860
 stairs and things like that I know they look 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.330
 built with materials that you can 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.160
 find anywhere not 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.770
 then, without more grace, it was what 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.190
 we saw more than the fact of how can you 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.630
 build things in transit mode and 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.430
 another important thing gentlemen for those of 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.870
 mexico in game plans are already 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.220
 available pre-sales of the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.200
 special editions of harden and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.730
 prestige do not want to give us the price 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.230
 well actually not even in the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.240
 price with the total but they are already 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.500
 available for presales I talked and 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.270
 they told me that the total pressure you 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.860
 they say until I 'm in stores and 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.990
 for that would be within a month 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.430
 when black ops 2 comes out then then and 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.840
 also so that they knew the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.060
 who want to contribute the rossi game that does not 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.560
 and that is not reached because it is already 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.240
 available in game planet so they go 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.490
 set it aside and get your note a zombie 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.860
 good the reason why they want 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.540
 set aside special editions so 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.280
 nothing people that would be all 15 many of us 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.280
 we see later goodbye
