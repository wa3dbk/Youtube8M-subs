hi<00:00:01.160> this<00:00:01.220> is<00:00:01.579> Michelle<00:00:02.150> bus<00:00:02.510> gay<00:00:02.720> and<00:00:03.020> in<00:00:03.260> this

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
hi this is Michelle bus gay and in this

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.410 
hi this is Michelle bus gay and in this
video<00:00:03.710> in<00:00:04.069> the<00:00:04.189> edge<00:00:04.340> flow<00:00:04.700> series<00:00:05.150> we're

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
video in the edge flow series we're

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.300 
video in the edge flow series we're
going<00:00:05.569> to<00:00:05.779> look<00:00:05.960> at<00:00:06.200> how<00:00:06.350> to<00:00:06.410> make<00:00:06.589> an<00:00:06.740> oblong

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.310 
going to look at how to make an oblong

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.560 
going to look at how to make an oblong
cutout<00:00:11.530> so<00:00:12.530> we<00:00:12.679> start<00:00:12.950> with<00:00:13.099> a<00:00:13.130> plane<00:00:13.460> as<00:00:13.730> usual

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
cutout so we start with a plane as usual

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:23.090 
cutout so we start with a plane as usual
and<00:00:14.809> cut<00:00:15.679> some<00:00:15.889> edges<00:00:16.279> in

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.460 

you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.320 

and<00:00:26.560> I'm<00:00:27.310> going<00:00:27.580> to<00:00:27.610> move<00:00:27.820> some<00:00:28.060> of<00:00:28.120> these

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
and I'm going to move some of these

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.690 
and I'm going to move some of these
edges<00:00:28.840> closer<00:00:29.110> together<00:00:29.440> to<00:00:29.710> make<00:00:30.040> more<00:00:30.340> of<00:00:30.580> a

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
edges closer together to make more of a

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.350 
edges closer together to make more of a
square<00:00:31.090> pattern<00:00:31.330> there

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
square pattern there

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.900 
square pattern there
and<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.320> scale<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> few<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.070> them<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.760> make

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and we scale a few of them out to make

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.930 
and we scale a few of them out to make
the<00:00:36.030> ends<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> our<00:00:36.450> oblong

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
the ends of our oblong

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.660 
the ends of our oblong
and<00:00:38.440> just<00:00:39.440> start<00:00:39.739> moving<00:00:39.980> some<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.460> other

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
and just start moving some of the other

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.910 
and just start moving some of the other
vertices<00:00:42.010> so<00:00:43.010> that<00:00:43.039> we<00:00:43.250> can<00:00:43.399> make<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.670> shape

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
vertices so that we can make the shape

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.250 
vertices so that we can make the shape
those<00:00:45.920> edges<00:00:46.460> out<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:47.180> give<00:00:47.360> more<00:00:47.600> support<00:00:48.079> on

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
those edges out to give more support on

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.290 
those edges out to give more support on
that<00:00:48.320> end

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.600 

and<00:00:55.390> we're<00:00:56.200> going<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.350> keep<00:00:56.560> scaling<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.400> make

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
and we're going to keep scaling to make

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.110 
and we're going to keep scaling to make
the<00:00:57.760> oblong<00:00:58.150> shape

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 

all<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> want<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
all right I want a little more of a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.400 
all right I want a little more of a
rounded<00:01:05.400> shape<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:06.930> big<00:01:07.140> middle

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
rounded shape there and those big middle

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.140 
rounded shape there and those big middle
part<00:01:07.620> so<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> create<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.520> few<00:01:08.850> extra

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
part so I'm going to create a few extra

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.640 
part so I'm going to create a few extra
edges

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.510 

you

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:30.750 

and<00:01:20.090> we'll<00:01:20.270> just<00:01:20.299> scale<00:01:20.689> those<00:01:20.900> out

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.150 

I<00:01:30.820> think<00:01:31.690> I'd<00:01:31.840> like<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.080> ends<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.770> be<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.920> little

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
I think I'd like the ends to be a little

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.770 
I think I'd like the ends to be a little
bit<00:01:33.280> more<00:01:33.430> pinched

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.830 

but<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.440> want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> keep<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.159> grid<00:01:38.549> pattern<00:01:39.090> so

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
but I want to keep my grid pattern so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
but I want to keep my grid pattern so
I'm<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> scale<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
I'm going to scale all of these at the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.429 
I'm going to scale all of these at the
same<00:01:41.880> time

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
same time

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.060 
same time
and<00:01:44.340> now<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.880> my<00:01:45.119> nice<00:01:45.329> oblem

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.100 

and<00:01:48.670> it's<00:01:48.940> time<00:01:49.150> to<00:01:49.300> make<00:01:49.450> some<00:01:49.480> supporting

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
and it's time to make some supporting

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.360 
and it's time to make some supporting
edges<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.970> Calvin<00:01:52.600> likes<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.230> delete<00:01:53.620> this

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
edges so Calvin likes to delete this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.840 
edges so Calvin likes to delete this
section<00:01:54.850> here<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.510> then<00:01:56.100> shift<00:01:57.100> copy<00:01:57.340> edges

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
section here and then shift copy edges

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.550 
section here and then shift copy edges
but<00:01:58.060> what<00:01:58.240> I'd<00:01:58.360> like<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:58.600> do<00:01:58.870> is<00:01:59.140> use<00:01:59.410> the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
but what I'd like to do is use the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.910 
but what I'd like to do is use the
insight<00:02:00.040> tool<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:01.140> couple<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.200> times<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.740> get<00:02:02.890> a

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
insight tool a couple of times and get a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.750 
insight tool a couple of times and get a
couple<00:02:02.980> of<00:02:03.310> insects<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.310> can<00:02:06.490> take

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
couple of insects and then you can take

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.760 
couple of insects and then you can take
this<00:02:07.000> center<00:02:07.390> part<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:07.990> can<00:02:08.140> leave<00:02:08.290> lift

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
this center part and you can leave lift

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.660 
this center part and you can leave lift
it<00:02:08.920> up<00:02:09.190> or<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:09.550> can<00:02:09.610> lift<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.000> down<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:11.320> can

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it up or you can lift it down you can

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.890 
it up or you can lift it down you can
you<00:02:12.670> know<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.270> case<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.630> want<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.840> make

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
you know so in this case I want to make

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.890 
you know so in this case I want to make
a<00:02:14.020> bulge<00:02:14.320> so<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:14.740> going<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.980> lift<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.340> up<00:02:15.520> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
a bulge so I'm going to lift it up and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.150 
a bulge so I'm going to lift it up and
then<00:02:16.900> it's<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.290> matter<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.560> shaping<00:02:18.070> the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
then it's just a matter of shaping the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.660 
then it's just a matter of shaping the
Bulge<00:02:18.370> using<00:02:19.360> some<00:02:19.540> scaling<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.520> moving<00:02:21.520> some

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
Bulge using some scaling and moving some

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.199 
Bulge using some scaling and moving some
of<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.850> vertices<00:02:22.240> around

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.819 

and<00:02:25.870> I'm<00:02:25.959> going<00:02:26.109> to<00:02:26.170> pull<00:02:26.349> those<00:02:26.469> Center

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
and I'm going to pull those Center

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.860 
and I'm going to pull those Center
vertices<00:02:27.280> up<00:02:27.519> just<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.359> keep<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.689> nice

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
vertices up just to keep the nice

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.070 
vertices up just to keep the nice
curvature<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.939> Bulge<00:02:31.120> going

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.130 

and<00:02:34.680> when<00:02:34.890> we<00:02:35.010> put<00:02:35.190> subdivision<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.180> you

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and when we put subdivision on this you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.140 
and when we put subdivision on this you
can<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.650> we<00:02:37.740> get<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.070> nice<00:02:38.730> smooth

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
can see that we get this nice smooth

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.420 
can see that we get this nice smooth
bulge<00:02:39.510> subdivides<00:02:40.410> really<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.310> well

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
