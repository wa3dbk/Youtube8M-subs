over the court while people are hitting
the<00:01:15.960> ball<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.580> hit<00:01:17.640> by

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the ball and you can actually get hit by

the ball and you can actually get hit by
the<00:01:18.000> ball<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.570> dangerous<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.080> well<00:01:19.290> now

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the ball so it's dangerous as well now

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.740 
the ball so it's dangerous as well now
when<00:01:20.850> you're<00:01:20.970> sitting<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> stands

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
watching tennis it's really not a good

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.120 
idea to heckle the player while they're
hitting<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> ball<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.360> clap<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> cheer

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
hitting the ball you can clap and cheer

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
hitting the ball you can clap and cheer
but<00:01:29.130> heckling<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.880> generally<00:01:30.570> frowned<00:01:31.170> upon
