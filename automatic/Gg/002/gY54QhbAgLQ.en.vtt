00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
show you what I got good thing I checked

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.310 
show you what I got good thing I checked
for<00:00:24.480> cars<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> mean<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.210> guess<00:00:30.570> bland<00:00:30.900> Ohio

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
for cars so I mean I guess bland Ohio

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
for cars so I mean I guess bland Ohio
appropriate<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.090> got

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
appropriate that's what I got I got

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.479 
appropriate that's what I got I got
nothing<00:00:38.210> I've<00:00:41.809> dropped<00:00:42.809> off<00:00:43.050> my<00:00:43.260> load<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
nothing I've dropped off my load and I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.580 
nothing I've dropped off my load and I
guess<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:46.160> kind<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> negative<00:00:48.000> side

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
guess this is kind of the negative side

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.490 
guess this is kind of the negative side
but<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:50.480> don't<00:00:51.480> want<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.020> don't<00:00:52.199> want<00:00:52.410> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
can see the snow here is about then a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.270 
can see the snow here is about then a
couple<00:01:27.600> feet<00:01:27.810> high<00:01:28.020> compared<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> truck

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
couple feet high compared to the truck

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.800 
couple feet high compared to the truck

purposes that I cleaned off my lights in
fact<00:05:47.720> I<00:05:47.840> could<00:05:48.020> probably<00:05:48.050> go<00:05:48.440> in<00:05:48.710> there<00:05:49.009> and

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
fact I could probably go in there and
