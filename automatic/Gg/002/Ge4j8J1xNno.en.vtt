00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.750
 girls hello everyone today i want 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.980
 make videos about empty jars for you 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.500
 many many but there are products that have 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.560
 I ended and that I would like 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.590
 share my opinion and i'm starting out 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.160
 hair products first thing you want 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.539
 show it a roll 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.320
 and shampoo and hair balm more precisely not 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.870
 balm even hair cream in purchases 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 you've seen these two products and I'm nothing 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.649
 They could not say now can be 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 say with confidence that i am more 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 never buy from these two funds in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 my first hair is very, very strong 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.079
 accustomed to this product they are on steel 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.100
 very dry very not so 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 cheerful their hair 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.269
 That's why I do not end up and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.780
 enjoyed and I throw them in the trash 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.250
 know the first time several times when 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.160
 I enjoyed me too 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.170
 liked what my hair look like 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.330
 after these two environments but very very 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 strongly attract hair I do not know why 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.619
 had never such was not here now this 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.880
 two shampoos are so used to hair 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.380
 what they just became can be said as 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.350
 would reject 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.930
 these two products and I realized that everything was mine 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.380
 hair needs another shampoo therefore 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.570
 this one goes with our wand next 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.439
 the shampoo that I ran out of it 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.799
 will be such 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.290
 garnier fructis and these shampoos my hair 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.470
 love very much they never excrete 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.890
 when i use these shampoos very much 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.689
 I like it, I think I'll buy more 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.409
 just kuku can something else 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.659
 series but because the series has garnish a lot 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.270
 and here on this shampoo to me 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.950
 well suited and liked 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.069
 smell of course in the fruit with awesome 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.899
 super super smell and shampoo too 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.729
 principle like he doesn't do any 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.830
 wonders with my hair 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.430
 but still he cares for them and and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.260
 works great next 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.170
 product for hair which unfortunately 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:25.340
 much to my regret is over 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.849
 this oil is also from garnier fructis oil 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.150
 milagros 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.099
 fighting all awesome butter for long she 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.950
 it took me a long time 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.900
 used it absolutely all of it 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.019
 loved with all my heart 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.299
 and me and before to wash my hair after 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.079
 wash your hair after you 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.959
 dry 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.500
 and during drying, I shorter it constantly 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.420
 she wore her hair she was cute below them they 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.299
 always looked perfect 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.340
 very cool butter she is now pantin 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.859
 released two new butter so i 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.620
 traded him forgive the forgive garnish and 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.389
 by the way in the garnier came out one more but still 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 one new oil line but it's already coming 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:12.329
 protected from hot tools but its me 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.370
 I also want to try, but 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.169
 this is superb if you buy it 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.299
 its not dust and you about it never 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:21.440
 regret me very much like this 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.510
 my hair is very thin porous and 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.450
 split so this oil came to me 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.430
 ideally the following products will already be 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.000
 for the face and the first thing I want you 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.079
 show it like this agel umi 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.950
 Wolf from Loreal is very cool not 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.630
 I liked her very much and I did it to the end 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.730
 I used it very fit and I 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.590
 I think when I finish now 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.599
 and the milk that me 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.370
 I think I'll come back to this one because 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.069
 that I really liked it 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.030
 she is very gentle very well schA in my 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.950
 skin and cared for her pretty well 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.560
 so I didn't like her very much 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.690
 and if you see in the store or you don't 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.090
 you can decide to buy or not to buy 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.720
 I recommend you better buy from me 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.989
 skin is dry sensitive so this 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.310
 the product is perfect for my skin 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.440
 the next thing I have ended a 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.840
 I'm right now tearing 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.120
 cream this hand cream but its 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.410
 used for both hands and face 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.150
 he just brilliantly moisturized my face 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.150
 before I applied the tone 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.139
 basis of opinion just with this cream 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.979
 forgot peeling in the winter when make-up and 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.470
 general perfect cream and sent it to me 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.960

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.180
 very , very , very sorry but here 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.979

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.870
 I bought him to fly because it would 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.050
 sachet letual therefore have see 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.210

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.340

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.280

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.450

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.570

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.780
 some ended the truth 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.090
 the next two products it was because 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.740
 makeup products first product 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.110
 which I ended it with me 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.139
 over mascara from her here already 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.450
 practically nothing i no longer 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.560
 showed told many know that 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.880
 It's for mascara and where to buy it without a clue 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.370
 they gave it to me 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.419
 and what I want to say for a long time could 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.050
 get used to it 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.599
 she did not have a rather unusual 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.969
 I have a rather unusual brush by 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.119
 this adapt 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:50.249
 it is not for them I took time but 

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:51.959
 then I loved her with all my heart and very 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.749
 often used it here with me 

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:57.089
 ended and the next thing to me 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:06:01.229
 ended it ended my tonal 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:03.360
 cream is very strange concealer he 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.699
 I was very fit on the texture, that is, it 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.189
 didn't emphasize my flaking alone 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.549
 that the strange was going on with his shade 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.829
 either this is my skin changed color changed a 

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:15.809
 either this is something st anal cream when 

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:20.399

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:22.649
 I tone color as time passed, he 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:25.529
 it became dark to me even so orange 

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:27.839
 there and then time passed he was very very 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:29.789

 until more so I do not want and I still 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:42.539
 did not find the perfect foundation on 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.209
 of my face but this one here of course passed 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.399
