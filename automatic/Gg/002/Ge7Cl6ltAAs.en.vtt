several<00:00:24.200> ways<00:00:24.350> of<00:00:24.530> fishing<00:00:24.680> north<00:00:25.040> country

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
several ways of fishing north country

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.310 
several ways of fishing north country
weights<00:00:25.580> are<00:00:25.880> spider<00:00:26.660> fishing<00:00:27.020> as<00:00:27.140> it's

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
weights are spider fishing as it's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.000 
weights are spider fishing as it's
called<00:00:27.970> but<00:00:28.970> there's<00:00:29.120> one<00:00:29.210> way<00:00:29.270> that's<00:00:30.010> not

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
called but there's one way that's not

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.860 
called but there's one way that's not
very<00:00:31.220> successful<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:31.940> that's<00:00:32.150> the<00:00:32.419> across

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
very successful and that's the across

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.170 
very successful and that's the across
and<00:00:33.050> down<00:00:33.200> if<00:00:33.650> you<00:00:33.800> fish<00:00:34.010> across<00:00:34.730> them<00:00:34.970> down

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
and down if you fish across them down

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.270 
and down if you fish across them down
you<00:00:35.930> flies<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:36.500> up<00:00:36.590> behaving<00:00:37.070> correctly

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
you flies and up behaving correctly

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.830 
you flies and up behaving correctly
they're<00:00:37.670> not<00:00:37.790> obeying<00:00:38.090> nature<00:00:38.600> they're<00:00:38.720> not

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
they're not obeying nature they're not

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.150 
they're not obeying nature they're not
drifting<00:00:39.260> with<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:39.410> current<00:00:39.500> all<00:00:39.890> they're

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
drifting with the current all they're

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.090 
drifting with the current all they're
doing<00:00:40.340> is<00:00:40.460> swinging<00:00:41.300> into<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.629> bank<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.470> no

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
doing is swinging into the bank and no

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.729 
doing is swinging into the bank and no

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
invertebrate drift is doing that all

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.970 
invertebrate drift is doing that all
insects<00:00:49.220> whether<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.610> hatching<00:00:50.059> or<00:00:50.300> dying<00:00:50.600> or

swimming to the service they're going

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.630 
swimming to the service they're going
down<00:00:53.300> with<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.690> current<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.159> cannot<00:00:55.460> be

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
down with the current and it cannot be

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.670 
down with the current and it cannot be
right<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.360> to<00:00:56.570> fish<00:00:56.750> flies<00:00:57.050> swinging

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
right for you to fish flies swinging

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.549 
right for you to fish flies swinging
into<00:00:57.830> the<00:00:58.040> bank<00:00:58.220> nothing<00:00:59.089> does<00:00:59.269> that<00:00:59.559> we've

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
into the bank nothing does that we've

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.060 
into the bank nothing does that we've
been<00:01:00.800> fishing<00:01:00.979> it<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:01.460> correct<00:01:01.670> way<00:01:01.820> as

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
been fishing it the correct way as

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.740 
been fishing it the correct way as
practiced<00:01:04.070> centuries<00:01:04.729> ago<00:01:04.970> well<00:01:05.239> at<00:01:05.449> least<00:01:05.600> I

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
practiced centuries ago well at least I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.740 
practiced centuries ago well at least I
wouldn't<00:01:06.020> have<00:01:06.110> centuries<00:01:06.530> ago<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:08.450> short

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
wouldn't have centuries ago the short

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.370 
wouldn't have centuries ago the short
line<00:01:08.960> upstream<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.820> pocket<00:01:11.180> pick<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
line upstream the pocket pick in the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.210 
line upstream the pocket pick in the
close<00:01:12.830> control<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.200> it's<00:01:15.200> skillful<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.100> it

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
close control and it's skillful and it

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.090 
close control and it's skillful and it
works<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.390> lot<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.750> hard<00:01:17.930> work<00:01:18.100> you're

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
works but it's a lot of hard work you're

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.039 
works but it's a lot of hard work you're
working<00:01:19.460> all<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.729> time<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.850> then<00:01:23.810> there's

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
working all the time and then there's

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.690 
working all the time and then there's
the<00:01:24.170> squared<00:01:24.470> across<00:01:24.740> method<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.490> saw

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the squared across method that you saw

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.060 
the squared across method that you saw
me<00:01:25.850> demonstrate<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:27.020> works<00:01:27.259> perfectly<00:01:27.770> and

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
me demonstrate that works perfectly and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.609 
me demonstrate that works perfectly and
then<00:01:28.820> there's<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.659> escalator<00:01:30.110> method<00:01:30.469> which

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
then there's the escalator method which

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.590 
then there's the escalator method which
is<00:01:30.890> something<00:01:31.250> I've<00:01:31.579> sort<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.090> developed<00:01:32.299> over

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
is something I've sort of developed over

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.870 
is something I've sort of developed over
the<00:01:32.750> years<00:01:32.930> that's<00:01:33.409> also<00:01:33.890> good<00:01:34.159> all<00:01:34.610> those

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
the years that's also good all those

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.910 
the years that's also good all those
methods<00:01:35.090> are<00:01:35.420> be<00:01:35.570> nature<00:01:35.869> they<00:01:36.380> let<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.710> Flies

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
methods are be nature they let the Flies

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.760 
methods are be nature they let the Flies
drift<00:01:37.399> downstream<00:01:37.789> with<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.329> current<00:01:38.770> but

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
drift downstream with the current but

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.990 
drift downstream with the current but
across<00:01:40.130> them<00:01:40.310> down<00:01:40.549> doesn't<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.240> swing

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
across them down doesn't the swing

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.160 
across them down doesn't the swing
you've<00:01:44.000> seen<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.329> spiders<00:01:44.750> we've<00:01:44.899> done<00:01:45.049> on

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
you've seen the spiders we've done on

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.260 
you've seen the spiders we've done on
the<00:01:45.259> program<00:01:45.710> tight<00:01:46.070> self<00:01:46.340> some<00:01:46.520> spiders<00:01:47.060> in

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
the program tight self some spiders in

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.109 
the program tight self some spiders in
the<00:01:48.310> 14<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.869> 18<00:01:50.869> range<00:01:51.439> well<00:01:52.009> 12<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.609> 18<00:01:52.939> if<00:01:53.000> you

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
the 14 to 18 range well 12 to 18 if you

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.999 
the 14 to 18 range well 12 to 18 if you
talking<00:01:53.600> about<00:01:53.689> much<00:01:53.929> Belgium<00:01:54.350> at<00:01:54.500> beyond<00:01:54.740> 12

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
talking about much Belgium at beyond 12

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.730 
talking about much Belgium at beyond 12
but<00:01:55.359> basically<00:01:56.359> we<00:01:56.539> use<00:01:56.719> in<00:01:56.990> 14<00:01:57.859> and<00:01:58.250> 16<00:01:58.579> mostly

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
but basically we use in 14 and 16 mostly

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.010 
but basically we use in 14 and 16 mostly
the<00:02:00.740> selection<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:01.250> sell<00:02:01.549> meat<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.909> will<00:02:02.210> put

the selection you sell meat I will put

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.969 
the selection you sell meat I will put
you<00:02:03.109> in<00:02:03.170> good<00:02:03.259> stead
