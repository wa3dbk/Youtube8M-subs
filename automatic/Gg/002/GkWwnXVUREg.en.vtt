 possession north of Cuba attracting a lot of cloudiness 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.220
 for now towards the arresting portion of falling a little cloudiness towards the 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.630
 region of the Spanish island 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.300

 quite far from our entire area yes they stop excellent news 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.409
 we have 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:04.920
 what we can see here 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.930
 what was that the hurricane ofelia and also to flipper and will continue its 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.850
 course to the west very slowly it will continue to weaken and it 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.320
 will keep right where he has been in hurricane count had been in hurricane 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.700
 ofelia during the last three days for now 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.890
 felipinho will certainly be a threat to all positions of 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.310

 throughout the metropolitan passion the wind continues 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.650
 gentlemen what reason of 10 miles per hour in relative mana 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.310
 in 60 percent the rest of the country or at least half of it remains 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.900
 under very cool temperatures makes the index wasit region and like chinche 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.789
 48 degrees 56 degrees 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.149
 for the big apple and chicago we noticed with 66 degrees low pressure system 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.840
 it remains very does the northeast portion of the country 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.000
 the front band like cesium stays sixth to the serving 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.530
 North of Cuba 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.399
 still believing some downpours 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.240

 leaving a lot of cloudiness for tomorrow 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.439
 so we will start our work week with a mostly cloudy sky 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.980
 and of course he got rid of isolated showers already for Monday and for the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.849
 Tuesday the wind of the maritime sector tc northeast at a rate of 12 to 15 knots this

 night temperatures will remain in the high range of the seventy low range 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.780
 from the eighty degrees the wind will continue more than all of that northeast 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.599
 and as I said some isolated showers to start the work week 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.499
 and the connections become very cloudy for next weekend 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:40.929
 we condemn 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.009
