00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.480
 Tell me guys, I'm a Christian and today I'd be 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.570
 presenting four indy games and calling 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.390
 my attention this week a good 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.240
 first to be commented on is alice paire 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.680
 the side scroller game where you control 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.849
 an alien spider elÃ©trika the iphan is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.250
 that's right 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.349
 finally you are collecting these organs from 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.270
 energy to earn more points during 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.790
 The stage you're going to use is only web for 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.980
 hang both to pass more parts 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 hard mushrooms that serves as a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 trampoline and so on 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.290
 As you progress the game 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.239
 It gets harder 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.200
 There comes a time when you're half-cursing. 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.200
 and the iscte 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.630
 It's good to get handball to the next one. 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.630
 game 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.180
 the shocked face when I saw 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.119
 internet that showed today the steering wheel of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.850
 it was silvio santos opera 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:34.220
 stone will not flying the name of the game will not 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:38.330
 It is and volleyball is slowly evolving or something 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.210
 so imagine here thinking about the game 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.409
 touched everything for money and so 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.939
 cool to be trollando is and continuing the 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.799
 rpg game that tells a story 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.840
 has been doing rpg 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.810
 but the charm of it is that you start from 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.299
 the most rotten way possible in terms of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.990
 play during the game you will unlock 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.299
 things with the sound the color of the game better 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.130
 dunga style screen drive 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.990
 different and so on. 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.110
 it resembles a mix of type games 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.650
 zelda final fantasy pokÃ©mon and others that 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.950
 have no idea what crap to see east 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.930
 where all npcs ignores children 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.930
 we used to do that in real life 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.579
 continuing the strength of this game is that he 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.980
 kind of telling you about the 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.320
 evolution of games 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.269
 technologically speaking second 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.400
 plan with the original story 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.620
 I found super creative idea for sure 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.269
 it 's worth checking the one against 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.760
 I think it does not give native support 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.000
 xbox control thing that most 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.570
 Current games make and you friend quinho 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.160
 to play on the keyboard or it will be 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.720
 that in the front unlock support to the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.420
 control 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.310
 Imagine that it 's not so much the next 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.680
 game that is worth taking a look at is the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.790
 roller 2 made by the same creators 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.170
 I noticed that boy he does not know 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.410
 write when you have no control 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.050
 total about your character 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.850
 this mother's faith is running rampant 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.250
 By the stage you have guaranteed that he 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:18.460
 arrives at full end obstacles like 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:22.360
 monsters walls panels holes beds 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.360
 elastic green squares and 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.160
 the fire you are during the course you 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.560
 have to deviate from everything 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.300
 the game's music is synchronized with the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.130
 gold bars and other things that you 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.340
 It's picking up the route. 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.750
 the first impression is very good the 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.360
 problem is that it does not change anything 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.580
 When you go through the phase and 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.740
 When you go to a new world she is 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.750
 super similar 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.820
 I preferred to leave a knife in my ear. 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.220
 this damn new regime 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.350
 another problem is that the faults of the other 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.240
 more and more only one service 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.600
 bridge that is in the middle of the 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.720
 if you die you voted at the beginning or 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.220
 this is and believe you will die 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.950
 die die die die run 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.320
 run very fast 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.720
 even the net had this bagasse not play 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.590
 for at least a week 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.060
 I'm already gone 14 hours ago to change. 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.960
 for the next game 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.169
 thomas us at lom is this even a game 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.500
 square that is called thomas ian forever 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.270
 to long the game on a cloth or the goal is 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.230
 these geometric shapes to the 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.180
 marking them and the graph is that 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.490
 from what I read of the game the creator did not have 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.230
 money to pay a designer called 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.110
 fucking and using shapes 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.620
 geometric even worse is that it got good 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.930
 game the soundtrack is what the game is 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.120
 super light different from other game 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.409
 also has only one square and is super 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.529
 heavy 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.599
 and the plans are not so difficult the only 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.959
 hard thing even to swallow history 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.629
 an ignored set of the game 

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.369
 Good thing this is a story by the games 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.860
