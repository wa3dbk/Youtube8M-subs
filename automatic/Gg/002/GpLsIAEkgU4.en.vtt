them<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.619> double<00:02:04.950> system<00:02:05.130> or<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.149> hire

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
them it's double system or you can hire

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.309 
them it's double system or you can hire
somebody<00:02:06.810> else<00:02:07.459> single<00:02:08.459> system<00:02:09.319> attenuating

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
somebody else single system attenuating

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.020 
somebody else single system attenuating
the<00:02:10.349> signal<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.039> sending<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> camera

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
the signal here sending it to the camera

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.410 
the signal here sending it to the camera
also<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:15.040> throw<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.250> little<00:02:15.490> bit<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:16.270> a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
also I can throw a little bit just a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.870 
also I can throw a little bit just a
little<00:02:16.660> bit<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:17.410> Equalization<00:02:18.190> on<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.490> signal

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
little bit of Equalization on the signal

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.610 
little bit of Equalization on the signal
for<00:02:19.150> each<00:02:19.270> channel<00:02:19.720> these<00:02:20.200> little<00:02:20.500> buttons

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
for each channel these little buttons

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.900 
for each channel these little buttons
down<00:02:20.890> here<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.370> know<00:02:21.430> they're<00:02:21.670> kind<00:02:21.850> of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
down here and I know they're kind of

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
down here and I know they're kind of
small<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.480> people<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.810> back

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
small and the people in the back

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.140 
small and the people in the back
probably<00:02:23.170> can't<00:02:23.410> see<00:02:23.590> them<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.890> can<00:02:24.670> roll<00:02:24.940> off

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
probably can't see them I can roll off

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.260 
probably can't see them I can roll off
some<00:02:25.180> low<00:02:25.570> frequencies<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:27.000> possibly<00:02:28.000> make

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
some low frequencies and possibly make

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.900 
some low frequencies and possibly make
it<00:02:28.300> sound<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.870> little<00:02:28.900> bit<00:02:29.320> brighter<00:02:29.560> if<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.670> use

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
it sound a little bit brighter if I use

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.300 
it sound a little bit brighter if I use
the<00:02:31.060> controls<00:02:31.450> here<00:02:31.780> okay<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.560> have<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> meter

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
the controls here okay I have a meter

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.430 
the controls here okay I have a meter
bridge<00:02:33.550> right<00:02:33.910> here<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:35.170> turn<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.500> on<00:02:37.440> y'all

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
bridge right here to turn this on y'all

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.690 
bridge right here to turn this on y'all
can<00:02:38.560> see<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.770> meter<00:02:38.950> bridge<00:02:39.130> probably<00:02:39.520> from

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
can see the meter bridge probably from

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.980 
can see the meter bridge probably from
way<00:02:39.820> back<00:02:40.030> there<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.770> calibrate<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:43.360> mixer<00:02:43.840> to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
way back there I calibrate this mixer to

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
way back there I calibrate this mixer to
that<00:02:44.140> camera<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.340> zero<00:02:45.850> on<00:02:46.150> my<00:02:46.480> mixer<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.080> zero

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
that camera so zero on my mixer is zero

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.120 
that camera so zero on my mixer is zero
on<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.730> meters<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.660> camera<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.650> what<00:02:51.100> I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
on the meters of the camera so what I

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.610 
on the meters of the camera so what I
see<00:02:51.489> here<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:52.000> what's<00:02:52.810> being<00:02:53.020> played<00:02:53.290> there

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
see here is what's being played there

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.490 
see here is what's being played there
does<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:53.890> make<00:02:54.100> sense<00:02:54.130> yes<00:02:54.880> sir<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:56.350> kind

a JVC it's a high-def camera okay I
haven't<00:03:03.700> seen<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.060> meter<00:03:04.209> bridge<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.720> but

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
haven't seen the meter bridge on it but

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.710 
haven't seen the meter bridge on it but
usually<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.560> meter<00:03:06.430> bridge<00:03:06.700> has<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.030> hash<00:03:07.390> mark

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
usually a meter bridge has a hash mark

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.260 
usually a meter bridge has a hash mark
on<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.140> one<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.470> little<00:03:08.770> dots<00:03:09.670> indicating

on it one of the little dots indicating
the<00:03:10.540> level<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.959> signal<00:03:11.320> has<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.070> little<00:03:12.430> hash

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
the level of signal has a little hash

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.640 
the level of signal has a little hash
mark<00:03:12.910> usually<00:03:13.300> that's<00:03:13.480> set<00:03:13.690> at<00:03:13.810> minus<00:03:14.170> 20

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.199 
mark usually that's set at minus 20
minus<00:03:15.370> 20<00:03:15.730> DB<00:03:15.940> if<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.989> set<00:03:17.260> my<00:03:17.290> zero<00:03:17.890> on<00:03:18.640> this

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
minus 20 DB if I set my zero on this

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.080 
minus 20 DB if I set my zero on this
mixer<00:03:19.540> when<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.930> put<00:03:20.200> tone<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:21.370> minus<00:03:21.700> 20

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.759 
mixer when I put tone on it to minus 20
and<00:03:22.239> take<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.750> little<00:03:22.959> piece<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.290> tape<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.680> tape

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.870 
and take a little piece of tape and tape
off<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.090> controls<00:03:25.959> here<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.980> means<00:03:27.220> my<00:03:27.489> zero

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
off the controls here that means my zero

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.100 
off the controls here that means my zero
is<00:03:28.120> minus<00:03:28.330> 20<00:03:28.840> over<00:03:29.049> here<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:30.700> go<00:03:31.120> plus

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
is minus 20 over here so I can go plus

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.060 
is minus 20 over here so I can go plus
20<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.799> my<00:03:33.549> meter<00:03:33.760> bridge<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:35.110> that's<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.920> end

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
20 on my meter bridge and that's the end

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.810 
20 on my meter bridge and that's the end
I<00:03:36.430> like<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.780> keep<00:03:37.959> my<00:03:38.200> signal<00:03:38.650> around<00:03:38.950> minus<00:03:39.580> 10

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
I like to keep my signal around minus 10

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
on a digital camera cause we have any

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.840 
on a digital camera cause we have any
rim<00:03:42.940> majors<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.420> here<00:03:44.040> okay<00:03:45.040> digital<00:03:45.549> versus

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
rim majors in here okay digital versus

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.750 
rim majors in here okay digital versus
analog<00:03:46.380> if<00:03:47.380> it's<00:03:47.590> analog<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.010> can<00:03:48.310> overdrive

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
analog if it's analog you can overdrive

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.190 
analog if it's analog you can overdrive
it<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.940> little<00:03:49.120> bit<00:03:49.269> hey<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.510> might<00:03:49.810> even<00:03:50.019> sound

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
it a little bit hey it might even sound

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.860 
it a little bit hey it might even sound
a<00:03:50.320> little<00:03:50.410> bit<00:03:50.680> cool<00:03:50.970> if<00:03:51.970> it's<00:03:52.390> digital<00:03:52.600> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
a little bit cool if it's digital and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.509 
a little bit cool if it's digital and
you<00:03:52.989> overdrive<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.829> sounds<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.100> poo

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
you overdrive it it just sounds like poo

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.069 
you overdrive it it just sounds like poo
it<00:03:54.760> might<00:03:54.940> even<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:55.299> go<00:03:55.600> away

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
it might even just go away

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.699 
it might even just go away
so<00:03:57.040> with<00:03:57.850> digital<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:58.480> try<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:58.959> keep<00:03:59.110> 10<00:03:59.380> dB<00:03:59.680> at

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
so with digital I try to keep 10 dB at

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.520
