00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.519
 hi nice that you look again 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.940
 today i'm gonna show you how 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.860
 a whole design looked but maybe none 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.360
 you know your ears flap you think huh 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.190
 what is it all about 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.949
 maybe you know as the peekaboo 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.000
 looked from all over holland it is a bake 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.199
 cake or a cake containing one 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.570
 surprise actually a figure 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.880
 sometimes more the figures and it seems 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.480
 very complicated but quite a bit 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 with it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.079
 I'm going up a few actually whole ones 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.210
 simple step show how you own one 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.030
 peekaboo looked to me as an example 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.770
 but i and looked with a heart in it 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 after all, is with a valentine's day 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
 of course , any other form 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.469
 take whatever you want 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.110
 in fact we are going to be two different ones 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.420
 cakes make a colored cake power 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.360
 factor figure going out stitches and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.230
 then with a normal looking figure in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.030
 sit 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.989
 and we start with the batter for it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.530
 nice to get a job we start with 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.299
 the normal cake batter of sugar with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.439
 butter 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.259
 I also add a little vanilla 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.000
 sugar and we mix it together 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.520
 when the butter and the sugar are mixed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.520
 the eggs go through one by one 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:31.240
 a little salty when self-rising 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.320
 flour and even that itself 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.880
 when the ordinary cake batter is ready 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.579
 now a little bit normal 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.770
 color with red color 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.100
 your a red or pink heart is not too much 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:53.899
 a few drops is enough and record and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:56.630
 walk on for a moment and then it's over 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.009
 the first looked ready already look he is beautiful 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.689
 and pink red just right and the batter 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.689
 we divide the cake mold 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.380
 I can spend an hour in the oven at 175 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.510
 degrees to guess first the colored no 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.519
 dishes and the street cougar it was 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.410
 make batter for the second cake 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.430
 I just use neutral set only 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.430
 then without the dye 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.680
 and that ready 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.800
 so you can very well see beautiful red cape 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.950
 and we are going to paste the cake now 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.950
 to cut 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.410
 the cake is red as you see 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.410
 we try to cut out the shapes 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.980
 the hearts 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.330
 we go the cake now and build a small one 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.540
 distribute the layer of the batter over the 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.540
 bottom 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.500
 that's how it goes 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.210
 and there we put the outstretched hearts 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.210
 in 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.740
 nice to each other and I do in it 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.740
 center 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.250
 look the hearts right there upright in it 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:40.550
 middle and we will divide the dough 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.000
 next to it but also one on such this is one 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.260
 then 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.240
 make sure you really have a really nice time 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.060
 layer on the bottom so you 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.600
 have enough to top there to top it off 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.940
 to lay 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.430
 for example, if you apply a layer that is too thick 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.320
 the bottom and deeds 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.990
 the figures bet then it may be that 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.420
 you have a thin layer on top 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.580
 therefore yes the figures can 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.530
 can float say they will come 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.640
 go up the now one more time 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.580
 in the oven 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.280
 win an hour at 175 degrees and then hope 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.320
 I that looked very nice peekaboo 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.220
 coming up coming 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:19.670
 well this is him then the knight design looked 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.040
 The kieke how looked so on is the so 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.040
 have nothing to see between normal t 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.640
 sometimes here in the middle and legs fiat 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.530
 can see is a bit of crohn evening 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.470
 harterink came up so i 'm whole 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.690
 curious how the rest of the cake will look 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.690
 looks inside so we're going to cut too 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.100
 j so the cake did quite well 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.980
 in the meantime you have gone up a little 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.540
 but yes the heels over 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.330
 so very visible too 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.860
 very nice to serve with 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.469
 to fail 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.389
 he might be the other special day 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.430
 did you think it was a nice video 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.710

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.210

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.370
