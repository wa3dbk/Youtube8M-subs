00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.610 

for<00:00:38.250> years<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.699> wanted<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:40.199> my<00:00:40.559> teeth

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
for years I wanted to have my teeth

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.459 
for years I wanted to have my teeth
appear<00:00:40.980> whiter<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.050> larger

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
appear whiter and a little bit larger

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.669 
appear whiter and a little bit larger
but<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.879> always<00:00:45.840> thought<00:00:46.019> I'd<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.199> to<00:00:46.469> have

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
but I always thought I'd have to have

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.619 
but I always thought I'd have to have
them<00:00:46.829> ground<00:00:47.280> down<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.179> found<00:00:48.390> out

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
them ground down so when I found out

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.479 
them ground down so when I found out
that<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.870> could<00:00:49.109> do<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.769> without<00:00:49.980> any

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that I could do all that without any

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.750 
that I could do all that without any
pain<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.210> knew<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> wanted<00:00:51.929> to<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.199> Lumineers<00:00:52.760> my

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
absolutely would not have done that if I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
absolutely would not have done that if I
had<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.560> anything<00:01:22.979> done<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> enamel

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
had to have anything done to the enamel

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
had to have anything done to the enamel
on<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.390> team<00:01:24.630> well<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> surprising

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
on my team well you know the surprising

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.830 
on my team well you know the surprising
thing<00:01:26.070> about<00:01:26.220> Lumineers<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.509> after<00:01:27.659> i

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
thing about Lumineers was that after i

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.139 
thing about Lumineers was that after i
had<00:01:28.020> been<00:01:28.200> placed<00:01:28.470> my<00:01:28.860> sensitivity<00:01:29.460> actually

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
had been placed my sensitivity actually

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.600 
had been placed my sensitivity actually
went<00:01:30.329> away<00:01:30.619> because<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.009> guess<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
went away because I guess that the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.190 
went away because I guess that the
porcelain<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.329> covered<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> parts<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
porcelain really covered up the parts of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200 
porcelain really covered up the parts of
my<00:01:34.290> teeth<00:01:34.469> that<00:01:34.649> were<00:01:34.770> sensitive<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.729> feel

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
my teeth that were sensitive so I feel

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.260 
my teeth that were sensitive so I feel
even<00:01:36.240> better<00:01:36.630> than<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.170> did<00:01:37.350> before<00:01:37.469> I<00:01:37.680> had<00:01:37.890> them

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
even better than I did before I had them

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.550 
even better than I did before I had them
if<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.390> had<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:39.780> teeth<00:01:39.930> ground<00:01:40.350> down

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
if I had to have my teeth ground down

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
if I had to have my teeth ground down
and<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.520> any<00:01:41.640> shots<00:01:41.909> involved<00:01:42.479> I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and if there are any shots involved I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.969 
and if there are any shots involved I
definitely<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.649> gotten

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
definitely would have not gotten

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.320 
definitely would have not gotten

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
harming your teeth I went to the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.160 
harming your teeth I went to the
original<00:03:25.800> course<00:03:26.660> thoroughly<00:03:27.660> convinced

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
original course thoroughly convinced

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.850 
original course thoroughly convinced
that<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.470> process<00:03:28.800> did<00:03:29.220> not<00:03:29.430> work

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
that this process did not work

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.700 
that this process did not work
and<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.250> went<00:03:30.460> up<00:03:30.550> there<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.880> validate<00:03:31.710> my

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
and I went up there to validate my

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.660 
and I went up there to validate my
misconceptions<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:34.780> I've<00:03:35.080> made<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.860> 180

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
misconceptions and so I've made the 180

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.000 
misconceptions and so I've made the 180
degree<00:03:38.010> rotational<00:03:39.010> move<00:03:39.490> as<00:03:39.760> far<00:03:39.970> as

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
degree rotational move as far as

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.950 
degree rotational move as far as
paradigm<00:03:42.010> shift<00:03:42.370> goes<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:42.910> guess<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.810> would

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
paradigm shift goes I guess you would

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.830 
paradigm shift goes I guess you would
