00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
compared to like some of the other

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.440 
compared to like some of the other
material<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.460> repair<00:01:08.970> companies<00:01:09.240> use

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
material that the repair companies use

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.450 
material that the repair companies use
um<00:01:10.520> strings<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:13.460> 74

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
um strings that I have on here are 74

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
um strings that I have on here are 74
all<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> 20<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> believe<00:01:16.860> are

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
all the way down to a 20 I believe are

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.670 
all the way down to a 20 I believe are
in<00:01:17.430> 18<00:01:17.850> plane<00:01:18.420> 18<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:19.080> two<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.320> planes

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
in 18 plane 18 so these two are planes

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.210 
in 18 plane 18 so these two are planes
the<00:01:20.009> rest<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.700> wound<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:22.220> tuning

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the rest of them are all wound on tuning

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.510 
the rest of them are all wound on tuning
is<00:01:23.509> G<00:01:24.509> D<00:01:25.049> G<00:01:25.350> C<00:01:25.590> F<00:01:26.250> AD<00:01:26.780> thus<00:01:28.070> standard<00:01:29.070> tuning<00:01:29.250> but

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
is G D G C F AD thus standard tuning but

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.749 
is G D G C F AD thus standard tuning but
both<00:01:29.939> three<00:01:30.210> steps<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:32.040> I'll<00:01:32.520> just

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
both three steps down or so so I'll just

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.420 
both three steps down or so so I'll just
go<00:01:32.909> through<00:01:32.939> each<00:01:33.180> setting<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:34.430> napkin

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
go through each setting for napkin

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.280 
go through each setting for napkin
bridge<00:01:35.610> pickups<00:01:36.030> clean<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.079> I'll<00:01:37.170> go

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
bridge pickups clean and then I'll go

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.749 
bridge pickups clean and then I'll go
over<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.890> some<00:01:38.070> storage<00:01:38.369> stuff<00:01:38.610> for

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
over to like some storage stuff for

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.620 
so that's just a knack then I'll do both
of<00:02:06.430> them<00:02:06.610> we'll<00:02:06.880> do<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.030> same<00:02:07.180> thing<00:02:07.240> so<00:02:07.570> that

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
of them we'll do the same thing so that

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.180 
of them we'll do the same thing so that
we<00:02:07.810> can<00:02:08.289> actually<00:02:08.410> hear<00:02:08.770> how<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.580> changes

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
we can actually hear how it changes

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:29.690 
we can actually hear how it changes

just<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.570> 3d<00:02:37.260> switches<00:02:37.680> I'll<00:02:38.490> do<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.970> slight

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
just the 3d switches I'll do a slight

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.440 
just the 3d switches I'll do a slight
distortion<00:02:40.250> on<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.820> effects<00:02:42.090> I'm<00:02:42.270> using

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
distortion on the effects I'm using

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.640 
distortion on the effects I'm using
right<00:02:42.630> now<00:02:42.660> -<00:02:42.780> everybody<00:02:43.170> knows<00:02:43.320> for<00:02:43.590> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
right now - everybody knows for the
