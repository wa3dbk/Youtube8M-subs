00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello to everyone so before getting into 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.350
 this video I would just like to tell you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.549
 that for the first time that 2015 a 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.720
 new deck of cards was put in 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.130
 game on card tricks points like 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.480
 you can just click on the little 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.309
 icon just on the side to be able to 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.690
 go see that on the site a second 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.950
 thing before launching this video it's 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.480
 that I should normally have done 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.520
 today a video of the speech is to 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.699
 you but that I have not received at this 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.320
 video to be able to make a video so 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.029
 on one of the questions to ask I received 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.769
 than three videos so far so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.539
 do not hesitate go click one more 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.160
 time on this little icon to go 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.510
 directly on the site check the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.980
 questions and you will be able to advertise 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.450
 for your own channel so that can 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.430
 to be good for everyone 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.630
 go see that I also have a third 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.040
 announcement to make but considering that it makes a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.780
 little bit long I'm going to keep it for the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 end of this video so look up 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.719
 the end there one last thing that I 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.430
 want to share with you today 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.140
 so on the forum of card tricks 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.430
 points like erwan to ask a question 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.200
 they said he prepared a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.420
 show and who did not know how 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 chaining turns to each other 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.100
 and he asked if anyone could 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.250
 help 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.690
 I can so today we are going 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.280
 talk about creating shows and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.570
 the sequence of turns and that's true 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.190
 only for those who follow round of karl 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.480
 for a long time they will be able to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 tell me listen manu you're nice but has 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.049
 already treated this subject so it's true that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.159
 I have already treated the subject but I have 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.930
 treated the subject from a point of view 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.640
 technique much more than the point of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.049
 view of the sales pitch so today we're going 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.700
 talk about creating shows and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.920
 the sequence of laps but more 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.250
 point of view of the patter we also return 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.250
 in the video 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.620
 so the idea to be able to create a 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.480
 consistent and interesting show it's going 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.430
 just to be able to find a red thread to 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.050
 this show the red thread it's going to be a 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.640
 theme that it has precisely duration of the beginning 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.620
 until the end of the show that will you 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.450
 help to choose the towers changed the 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.650
 goodies and even maybe to modify 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.260
 the towers in themselves just for 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.040
 can really do that well 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.320
 well consistent 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.369
 you want a red thread blaye bob 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 so for example wanted to do a little 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.030
 show for your family or for your 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.170
 friends and you want to find 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.450
 some turns they can 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.250
 chained and try to find 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.149
 ideas on how tench and so what 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.430
 what you are going to do is find a 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.000
 chord theme or the red thread of your 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.920
 show 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.649
 so imagine for example we will take 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.870
 the coincidences agree the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.160
 coincidences so the coincidences this 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.170
 that you are going to do first to 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.940
 early before even thinking about which turn 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.739
 you're going to use you're going to go on 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.989
 internet and you will inquire 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.850
 on coincidences and so you go 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.890
 watch videos on youtube by 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.750
 example go read some blogs and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.400
 you will draw some anecdotes that 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.200
 will be able to help you with the sequence of 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.430
 vultures once you have enough 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.930
 information and you have plenty of 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.280
 little anecdotes what are you going 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.630
 to do is to start your show 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.850
 you will write your show 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.489
 simply and started by explaining this 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.019
 which is a coincidence is given by 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.510
 example a first anecdote about this 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.340
 some coincidence is then for 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.840
 support what you just said but 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.280
 you 're just going to follow up on a 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.170
 turn of cards so for example the good 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.850
 choice is very easy it's perfect 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.709
 for the coincidence precisely where he 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.780
 choose from gap and as by coincidence 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.400
 is but precisely they choose the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.810
 cards that you asked once the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.120
 first round finish all you have 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.920
 to do literally know to thank 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.790
 the viewer to give a second 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.430
 anecdote 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.840
 here you go at home directly on 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.280
 something else that always has that 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.630
 always talk about coincidences so 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.549
 give you a second little anecdote 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.560
 on coincidences and then you 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.090
 will present a second round that goes 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.560
 to relate a little bit to what you 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.360
 come on explained it again so 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.430
 this is the basis of a show built 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.680
 thanks to a red thread find small 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.340
 anecdotes about your theme 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.680
 show 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.110
 then find detours that will 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.970
 precisely the wall presented the theme of 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.770
 your show and the little anecdotes 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.280
 you just presented and in the end the 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.050
 everything will naturally follow naturally 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.520
 Then themes ideas are some of 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.710
 thousands you can do a theme on 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.570
 telepathy for example thanks to the 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.090
 Forcing cards thanks 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.040
 there are a lot of towers by 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.280
 example mirror you can do all this 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.510
 thanks to telepathy to the connection that 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.530
 between people could find a thousand 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.300
 anecdotes about this stuff 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.890
 could even do tricks on the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.200
 time travel for example with 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.790
 back to the future the 1 and towers that 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.200
 ensures the site you can do 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.850
 a lot of things 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.170
 and in the end that's the thing it's a 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.810
 once you've found the theme of 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.360
 your of your show you are going 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.740
 simply choose the towers that go 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.800
 to be that they will be able to simply 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.030
 represent this theme the best or so 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.739
 you will find towers that are 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.910
 interesting and you 're just going to redo 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.040
 a little bit of the sales pitch we're going to 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.360
 change a little bit the rate to stick 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.500
 perfectly to your theme you do 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.300
 a turn to tell you another story 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.040
 you take a ride and so on 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.960
 until you did five six laps and 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.090
 that it could finally take 100 kg and 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.100
 of magic constantly here but it has 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.080
 could take 20 minutes just by chatting 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.270
 a little bit and in the end the towers of 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.220
 magic will just reinforce what you 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.380
 have done and so that will give a purpose and 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.120
 a better impact to your magic rather 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.650
 that if you were just doing five 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.910
 rounds in a row that have no relation 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.050
 the ones with the others 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.550
 because in the end as a magician 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.440
 we're here to entertain 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.120
 people and if we can entertain them while 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.710
 teaching them a few things and 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.479
 by adding small anecdotes 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.860
 funny or interesting she goes them 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.570
 people will be even more enterprising and 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.160
 will come out this show with some 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.050
 more thing than when they came back 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.440
 so more have entertained and more they are 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.340
 happy and there and that's the victory 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.840
 I thank you for watching this video 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.160
 listen to my last years according to you 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.450
 the facts today in this video 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.830
 it's that I'm going to open a new 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.270
 channel on youtube 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.040
 so this chain is not going at all - 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.690
 knew exactly the same thing two 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.460
 videos per week as promised at each 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.440
 times now in the other channel 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.580
 know a chain of top-5 that has nothing to 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.780
 see with magic but it's likely to 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.640
 to interest you there is going to be some stuff 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.840
 really funny and listened to you know 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.250
