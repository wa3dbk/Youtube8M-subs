 Of course you can write you see of youtube through ipad 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.360
 I can do it 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.320
 8 There are a lot of my videos on youtube though 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.950
 For example, the diet after the guard in the hard hundred chair, etc. 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.640
 in this way 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.260
 Many times this h dmi Kedomo I reflected the image 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:52.920
 Because cable I can also carry video and audio 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.879
 The sound from the TV speakers, not because the sound directly from the ipad from here comes out because 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.879
 Will come out 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:10.780
 Because not only this TV but also projector can be used 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.690
 That company has a short presentation 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.270
 I think the use even in that sort of 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:26.140
 In this way, you can easily expand the company presentation materials 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:29.890
