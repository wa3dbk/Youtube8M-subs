00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.340 

we've<00:00:05.240> already<00:00:05.390> talked<00:00:05.720> about<00:00:05.810> the<00:00:06.050> forward

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
we've already talked about the forward

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.040 
we've already talked about the forward
approach<00:00:06.560> and<00:00:06.890> the<00:00:06.950> importance<00:00:07.310> of<00:00:08.050> setting

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
approach and the importance of setting

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.620 
approach and the importance of setting
up<00:00:09.170> but<00:00:09.350> that<00:00:09.500> 90%<00:00:09.800> of<00:00:10.219> actually<00:00:10.790> doing<00:00:11.240> a<00:00:11.450> dive

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
up but that 90% of actually doing a dive

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.640 
up but that 90% of actually doing a dive
is<00:00:11.870> setting<00:00:12.320> up<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:12.590> with<00:00:12.740> a<00:00:12.770> good<00:00:12.980> hurdle

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
is setting up and with a good hurdle

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.810 
is setting up and with a good hurdle
from<00:00:15.650> a<00:00:15.740> judging<00:00:16.129> standpoint<00:00:16.640> though

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
from a judging standpoint though

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.760 
from a judging standpoint though
probably<00:00:17.240> 90%<00:00:17.510> of<00:00:17.869> your<00:00:17.990> score<00:00:18.350> is<00:00:18.530> going<00:00:18.710> to

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
probably 90% of your score is going to

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.950 
probably 90% of your score is going to
come<00:00:18.980> from<00:00:19.190> your<00:00:19.430> entry<00:00:19.820> and<00:00:20.570> it's<00:00:20.750> really

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
come from your entry and it's really

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.589 
come from your entry and it's really
important<00:00:21.560> that<00:00:21.769> you<00:00:22.400> get<00:00:22.789> a<00:00:22.849> good<00:00:23.029> start<00:00:23.390> but

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
important that you get a good start but

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.329 
important that you get a good start but
probably<00:00:24.019> just<00:00:24.109> as<00:00:24.560> important<00:00:24.980> to<00:00:25.070> finish

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
probably just as important to finish

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.310 
probably just as important to finish
that<00:00:25.490> dive<00:00:25.730> off<00:00:26.000> if<00:00:26.210> you<00:00:26.300> want<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.539> get<00:00:26.660> a<00:00:26.689> good

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
that dive off if you want to get a good

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.320 
that dive off if you want to get a good
score<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.400> at<00:00:28.669> this<00:00:28.849> point<00:00:29.060> we're<00:00:29.179> going<00:00:29.210> to

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
score so at this point we're going to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.989 
score so at this point we're going to
talk<00:00:29.539> about<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:30.439> forward<00:00:30.740> entry<00:00:31.249> the<00:00:31.789> hollow

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
talk about the forward entry the hollow

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.920 
talk about the forward entry the hollow
position<00:00:32.270> and<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:33.200> swim<00:00:34.010> on<00:00:34.820> an<00:00:35.000> entry<00:00:35.329> the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
position and a swim on an entry the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.000 
position and a swim on an entry the
first<00:00:36.140> thing<00:00:36.260> I<00:00:36.290> want<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.440> talk<00:00:36.590> about<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:36.980> a

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
first thing I want to talk about is a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.280 
first thing I want to talk about is a
hand<00:00:37.340> grab<00:00:37.580> and<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.330> hand<00:00:38.540> grab<00:00:38.720> is<00:00:38.960> kind<00:00:39.170> of

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
hand grab and the hand grab is kind of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.940 
hand grab and the hand grab is kind of
individualized<00:00:40.510> I'm<00:00:41.510> not<00:00:41.750> sure<00:00:41.990> anybody<00:00:42.620> on

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
individualized I'm not sure anybody on

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.470 
individualized I'm not sure anybody on
my<00:00:42.980> team<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:43.850> have<00:00:43.880> a<00:00:43.970> pretty<00:00:44.180> large<00:00:44.360> team

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
my team and I have a pretty large team

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.380 
my team and I have a pretty large team
grabs<00:00:45.280> quite<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.430> same<00:00:46.670> way<00:00:46.850> but<00:00:46.910> there<00:00:47.270> are

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
grabs quite the same way but there are

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.180 
grabs quite the same way but there are
some<00:00:47.720> things<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.110> that<00:00:48.530> are<00:00:48.680> pretty

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
some things that that are pretty

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.360 
some things that that are pretty
consistent<00:00:49.940> I<00:00:50.330> typically<00:00:51.230> teach<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.740> divers

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
consistent I typically teach the divers

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.550 
consistent I typically teach the divers
to<00:00:52.400> grab<00:00:52.850> up<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.150> outside<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.960> their<00:00:54.140> fingers

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
to grab up the outside and their fingers

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.680 
to grab up the outside and their fingers
and<00:00:54.950> they<00:00:55.280> grab<00:00:55.460> just<00:00:55.760> three<00:00:55.970> fingers<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.570> you

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
and they grab just three fingers and you

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.870 
and they grab just three fingers and you
really<00:00:56.930> pull<00:00:57.170> them<00:00:57.290> back<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.890> get<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.580> flat

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
really pull them back and get a flat

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.750 
really pull them back and get a flat
hand<00:00:59.120> on<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.360> water<00:01:00.070> what's<00:01:01.070> interesting<00:01:01.370> too

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
hand on the water what's interesting too

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.630 
hand on the water what's interesting too
is<00:01:01.790> that<00:01:01.970> I<00:01:02.090> think<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.540> lot<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.960> rip

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
is that I think that a lot of the rip

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.969 
is that I think that a lot of the rip
comes<00:01:04.640> from<00:01:04.879> not<00:01:05.180> only<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.509> hands<00:01:05.960> but<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
comes from not only the hands but the

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.120 
comes from not only the hands but the
body<00:01:07.220> position<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.200> in<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.440> tape<00:01:09.680> we<00:01:09.890> talk

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
body position and in this tape we talk

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.400 
body position and in this tape we talk
about<00:01:10.310> what's<00:01:11.270> called<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.600> hollow<00:01:11.810> position

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
about what's called the hollow position

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.350 
about what's called the hollow position
what<00:01:12.560> we<00:01:12.650> try<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.890> do<00:01:13.190> is<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.880> really<00:01:14.030> get<00:01:14.210> the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
what we try to do is to really get the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.450 
what we try to do is to really get the
core<00:01:14.660> of<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.900> body<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.410> remain<00:01:15.740> very<00:01:15.920> rigid

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
core of the body to remain very rigid

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.460 
core of the body to remain very rigid
and<00:01:16.490> tight<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.510> that<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:17.870> not<00:01:17.990> when<00:01:18.230> you<00:01:18.260> hit

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
and tight so that it's not when you hit

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.080 
and tight so that it's not when you hit
the<00:01:18.590> water<00:01:18.800> you're<00:01:19.010> not<00:01:19.160> getting<00:01:19.520> any<00:01:19.700> any

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
the water you're not getting any any

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.450 
the water you're not getting any any
movement<00:01:20.780> like<00:01:20.930> this<00:01:21.320> which<00:01:21.980> we<00:01:22.130> create

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
movement like this which we create

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.020 
movement like this which we create
splash<00:01:23.230> now<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.290> other<00:01:24.700> action<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.790> what<00:01:25.909> we

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
splash now the other action is what we

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.880 
splash now the other action is what we
call<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.330> swim<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:26.900> once<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.409> hit<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.590> water

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
call the swim so once you hit the water

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.100 
call the swim so once you hit the water
you're<00:01:28.610> going<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:28.820> swim<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.390> when<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.780> swim

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
you're going to swim and when you swim

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.020 
you're going to swim and when you swim
it's<00:01:30.409> important<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.400> remember<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.820> the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
it's important to remember that the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.490 
it's important to remember that the
first<00:01:32.180> thing<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.480> happens<00:01:32.960> on<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.200> release

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
first thing that happens on the release

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.040 
first thing that happens on the release
of<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.770> slim<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.250> at<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.610> hands<00:01:35.050> release

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
of the slim is at the hands release

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.560 
of the slim is at the hands release
forward<00:01:36.650> like<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.250> some<00:01:37.610> some<00:01:37.970> divers<00:01:38.330> tend

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
forward like that some some divers tend

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.490 
forward like that some some divers tend
to<00:01:38.690> swim<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:39.560> they<00:01:39.650> don't<00:01:39.830> get<00:01:39.979> this<00:01:41.320> this<00:01:42.320> is

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
to swim but they don't get this this is

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.140 
to swim but they don't get this this is
