00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello together yes I see again now 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.929
 start a second because I have in 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.370
 my last video about tattoos said 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.690
 that the video is too slow that I am now 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.019
 what had to cut out and that comes 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.330
 now 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.449
 because I want to tell you just now 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.859
 It was important for a short time and I got it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.250
 already achieved it is again too 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.320
 see 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.699
 so now comes the easy part 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
 I cut it out 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.010
 take it there it is about the theme of tattoos 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.300
 inflamed how to treat a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.710
 lit set so what do I have for 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.239
 made experiences and so on and so on 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.170
 on 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.420
 just so much fun what happens what 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.930
 Do you do it when you have an inflamed petto 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.640
 after me and my husband we have many 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.420
 have tattoos and for many sessions 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 have behind us 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.469
 which now and then to luck 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.600
 very rarely would I say in five 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.010
 percent of all cases happens that time 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.270
 also a tattoo can be ignited there 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.350
 the trainer nothing for you can you 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.270
 maybe not for it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.949
 it may be that you leave the studio 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.260
 goes out or a smoking applies and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.059
 something comes out penetrates the skin 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 and is in 50 one usually not 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.600
 cause that does not mean if you too 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.400
 that is so hard that the sector is again 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.439
 has taken a dirty needle or 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 that the ink was dirty or that 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.470
 she also has allergic reactions 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.750
 nothing to do with that then just 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.729
 somehow bacteria got to the skin 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.400
 and it's just that way 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.229
 body wants to get rid of these bacteria 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.030
 characterized a somehow forms a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.920
 swelling groundwater vesicles age 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.329
 Everything can form there 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.579
 I myself have the experience to 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.479
 luck only in a two tattoos made 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.820
 mainly it was on my foot and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.280
 there it was so after a foot bath 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.689
 It had cash prizes and I had it anyway 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.220
 always with the other not 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.170
 staged was the clubfoot for two weeks 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.990
 But after a week is a bit 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.390
 healed at the second at football 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.549
 the second foot so that I'm after 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 two weeks always why super cover 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.810
 had swollen foot and feel so 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.100
 nothing not a bit of that 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.810
 skin surface gone so is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.049
 my skin did not hurt at all 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.000
 generated it was hurt somehow 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.870
 Although it costs a bit I have it then 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.510
 just smeared 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.180
 nevertheless so unevenly raised but 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.610
 it did not wear any skin whatsoever 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.790
 itself as always dissolves in the salvation 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.410
 phase there nothing happened and 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.640
 somehow it suddenly scared me 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.940
 from blood poisoning or whatever 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.650
 always 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.960
 and I'm on a Saturday afternoon after 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.480
 the work then heating to notarzt 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.940
 attendance of dermatologists in 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.450
 Munich and the a tec says clearly 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.080
 I have been on antibiotic ointment 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.420
 given and gave me a tablet 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.300
 given that I dissolved in water 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 the warm water said such a thing 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.000
 given and that was like that and then 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.170
 really pipi money and also has such a 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.970
 drove a bit to ulm 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.150
 no idea or he should be healthy 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.160
 his and my foot are bathed in it 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.650
 and to renounce completely has this 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.550
 I have taken an ointment on it 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.550
 I do not think antibiotic 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.080
 maybe I have to accept it too 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.430
 have to 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.480
 I think I have no basis 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.440
 it really outwardly I can do it 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.810
 I do not know that anymore 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.760
 a long time ago I believe that I only 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.320
 but he had to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.239
 I also take antibiotic for three days 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.190
 for safety I really do not know exactly 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.880
 In any case, there will not be a day 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.100
 lasted 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.860
 with the right medication from the doctor and 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.540
 it has already swollen the skin has 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.670
 started to regenerate and everything 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.020
 was good so that was the worst thing 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.470
 could happen just pays longer 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.860
 lasted 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.650
 my husband had these inflammations 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.230
 really those inflammations where he does that 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.910
 also just in aluminum foil glove in 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.720
 has wrapped fresh foil during 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.760
 the work and the evening has us 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.880
 everywhere there is a lot of city it was 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.320
 in his arm and each one put the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.010
 was ever made fresh 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.720
 really so swollen and so has 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.209
 the bubbles formed that looked 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.160
 like blisters on burns 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.030
 really bad I 've been taking pictures 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.860
 but I think I can find it now 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.190
 unfortunately not anymore if it sees 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.269
 flats send pictures of bubbles 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.910
 formed to happiness but still has 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.900
 those tablets that I have dissolved 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.360
 and I also had something of that 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.560
 antibiotic ointment and I have 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.190
 then just used with him because we 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.930
 since home 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.090
 I then solved it for him 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.519
 against stops made that sleeping 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.260
 hung up with this solved stuff 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.180
 with these urine water there with the vip 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.340
 water and have him that a bit 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.320
 sandwiched with the small side the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.840
 antibiotic and he may have too 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.340
 It took two days and then it is total 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.400
 healed everything was fine 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.690
 So all in all, if it has a tattoo 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.340
 Maybe it was ignited by us 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.900
 lasted a week longer april time 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.880
 but it was not dramatic that nothing 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.290
 bad happened we knew none of 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.420
 which ever sting because the color 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.340
 Nevertheless, one has none 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.900
 had scarring it was perfect 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.250
 okay because we just stop first 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.300
 I went to the doctor at the first 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.390
 let me have a look 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.380
 and second, we already knew about 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.180
 If you have many tattoos you can 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.890
 to assess his body well and knows 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.920
 then what happens and what is too much 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.980
 that is not good 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.540
 had one of his first interviews 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.520
 he correct pain normal 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.410
 it was not just that at all 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.180
 a touch the vegetation is 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.010
 has really brought where I said we 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.080
 Wait one more night off now 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.280
 it still is on sunday then 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.050
 Let's go to sunday too 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.490
 white service brings nothing 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.560
 not that you have real blood poisoning 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.330
 I also got fine overnight 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.790
 it is on content and done but pay attention 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.890
 if the signals from your body that one 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.630
 tattoo pulsates and the first first 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.680
 a two days hurts too 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.900
 maybe still normal 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.310
 but if it does not derive so 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.960
 if it is only swollen when 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.110
 bubbles form if it is too much 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.290
 Encrusted is stuff or if the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.580
 skin looks right 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.169
 I would jump up 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.700
 rather go to the doctor then ask 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.380
 not maybe your tattoo artist 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.880
 but just go directly to the doctor what 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.380
 look at it then comes one 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.260
 probably and antibiotic ointment 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.760
 good is so but as we said we 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.570
 drive I've made with our 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.160
 inflamed toe dramatically so there 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.570
 annoying with piercings more ignited here 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.790
 are because it lasts until the same 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.620
 update is actually logical because yes 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.330
 piercing through the skin and is 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.880
 from the inside and everything into the lot 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.320
 can be and as your own skin 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.240
 superficially as it is not quite so 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.630
 dramatic 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.400
 that's exactly how it was again for the topic 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.160
 internet something from my previous video 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.850
 that out 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.440
 people how are your experiences with 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.020
 you had inflamed tattoos 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.110
 who knows someone must have been infected 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.070
 How is your experience? 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.200
 I would like to know everything here 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.630
 I wish you in any case 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.160
 one is likely and wild 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.470
 and you're not surprised 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.780
 because it's something new- turned- something old 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.920
 isolated blablabla cut out and 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.470
 cut back so of course 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.020
 not if the camera varies a bit 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.000
 because I think I'm still moving 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.910
 cut it together I'm cutting 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.320
 Pros, yes, exactly tell me yours 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.420
 Experiences of your kind ignited 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.100
 tattoos as always thank you right 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.240
 Sincerely for your attention well 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.240
 until the next
