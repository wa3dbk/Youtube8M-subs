it set it to extend and then you'll see

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.469 
it set it to extend and then you'll see
now<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.140> turn<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.740> monitor<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:57.420> will

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
now if we turn on the monitor it will

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.469 
now if we turn on the monitor it will
the<00:01:58.320> image<00:01:58.500> will<00:01:58.650> appear<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> screen<00:01:59.479> but

the image will appear on the screen but
it's<00:02:00.659> upside<00:02:00.810> down<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.470> now<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> fix<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.340> if

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it's upside down so now to fix that if

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.550 
it's upside down so now to fix that if
you<00:02:03.030> go<00:02:03.240> into<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.659> settings<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.290> go<00:02:04.439> into

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.559 
properties under rotation if you change
it<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.439> landscape<00:02:07.680> flipped<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:09.269> will<00:02:09.420> then

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
it to landscape flipped it will then

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.160 
it to landscape flipped it will then
flip<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.019> upside<00:02:10.259> down<00:02:10.409> as<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.799> see<00:02:11.009> here

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

and<00:02:17.210> they're<00:02:18.210> still<00:02:18.569> around<00:02:19.069> okay<00:02:20.069> now

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
and they're still around okay now

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.650 
and they're still around okay now
another<00:02:20.310> thing<00:02:20.790> I'd<00:02:20.910> recommend<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.569> go

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
another thing I'd recommend is if you go

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.449 
another thing I'd recommend is if you go
into<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> color<00:02:22.110> options<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.740> bring<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
into the color options and bring the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.699 
into the color options and bring the
brightness<00:02:23.730> up<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> hundred<00:02:24.600> it'll<00:02:25.410> make<00:02:25.590> it

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
brightness up to a hundred it'll make it

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.350 
brightness up to a hundred it'll make it
much<00:02:25.860> easier<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.310> see<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.850> screen<00:02:27.120> through

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
much easier to see the screen through

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.070 
much easier to see the screen through
