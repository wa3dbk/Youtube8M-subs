00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
like this yes into the net then we raise

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.700 
like this yes into the net then we raise
up<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.530> sword<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.480> come<00:01:41.690> for

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
frustrated trying to get the nerve so

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.170 
frustrated trying to get the nerve so
that<00:02:34.739> they<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.670> route<00:02:35.790> can't<00:02:36.000> have

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.170 
it's effective but it's really more
about<00:02:42.060> elbow<00:02:42.629> control<00:02:43.250> because<00:02:44.250> sometimes

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
about elbow control because sometimes

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.940 
about elbow control because sometimes
with<00:02:45.480> hands<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:46.049> mine<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.709> are<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> little

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
with hands like mine that are a little

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.820 
with hands like mine that are a little
smaller<00:02:47.400> if<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.390> deal<00:02:48.690> with<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.930> big<00:02:49.379> forearm

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
smaller if we deal with a big forearm

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.800 
smaller if we deal with a big forearm
it's<00:02:50.280> almost<00:02:50.519> impossible<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.239> get<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.629> nerve

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
it's almost impossible to get the nerve

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.580 
it's almost impossible to get the nerve
but<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.860> can<00:02:53.040> always<00:02:53.280> control<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.910> elbow

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
but I can always control with the elbow

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.890 
but I can always control with the elbow
so<00:02:55.590> when<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.159> find<00:02:56.459> yourself<00:02:56.879> searching<00:02:57.569> for

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
so when you find yourself searching for

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.270 
so when you find yourself searching for
that<00:02:58.019> nerve<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.910> not<00:02:59.910> being<00:03:00.150> able<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.390> find<00:03:00.690> it

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
that nerve and not being able to find it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.009 
that nerve and not being able to find it
suddenly<00:03:02.280> realizing<00:03:03.000> they're<00:03:03.750> getting

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
suddenly realizing they're getting

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.220 
suddenly realizing they're getting
frustrated<00:03:04.519> maybe<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.940> little<00:03:06.510> angry

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
frustrated maybe a little angry

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.610 
frustrated maybe a little angry
you<00:03:07.650> know<00:03:07.769> because<00:03:08.069> I've<00:03:08.220> seen<00:03:08.579> exasperation

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
you know because I've seen exasperation

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.130 
you know because I've seen exasperation
have<00:03:10.620> been<00:03:10.829> looking<00:03:11.250> for<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.609> nerve<00:03:11.989> let<00:03:12.989> it

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
have been looking for this nerve let it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.849 
have been looking for this nerve let it
go<00:03:13.459> recognize<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:16.049> let<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.379> go<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
go recognize it and then let it go and

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.059 
go recognize it and then let it go and
just<00:03:17.370> do<00:03:17.849> your<00:03:17.940> best<00:03:18.150> control<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.989> elbow<00:03:19.379> our

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
just do your best control to elbow our

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.710 
just do your best control to elbow our
bodies<00:03:20.519> carry<00:03:20.910> our<00:03:21.299> history<00:03:23.239> we<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.390> our<00:03:24.540> own

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
bodies carry our history we have our own

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.509 
bodies carry our history we have our own
perceptions<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.590> what<00:03:25.859> how<00:03:26.069> things<00:03:26.340> are

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
perceptions of what how things are

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.119

happening<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:27.720> be<00:03:27.870> able<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.109> be<00:03:28.319> an<00:03:28.650> aware

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
happening to be able to be an aware

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.300 
happening to be able to be an aware
person<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.760> have<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.060> be<00:03:30.180> aware<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.480> yourself

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
person you have to be aware of yourself

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.940 
person you have to be aware of yourself
so<00:03:32.310> your<00:03:32.579> reaction<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.410> saying<00:03:34.410> don't<00:03:34.590> kill<00:03:34.829> if

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
so your reaction to saying don't kill if

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.140 
so your reaction to saying don't kill if
you're<00:03:35.130> frustrated<00:03:36.889> recognize<00:03:37.889> that<00:03:38.150> the

you're frustrated recognize that the
first<00:03:39.389> part<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.780> learning<00:03:40.470> how<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.829> be<00:03:41.280> aware

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
first part is learning how to be aware

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.330 
first part is learning how to be aware
is<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.910> recognize<00:03:42.450> everything<00:03:43.319> even<00:03:43.950> the

is to recognize everything even the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.409 
is to recognize everything even the
things<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.760> don't<00:03:44.849> want<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.299> acknowledge

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
things you don't want to acknowledge

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.360 
things you don't want to acknowledge
like<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.169> frustration<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.829> anger<00:03:47.130> and
