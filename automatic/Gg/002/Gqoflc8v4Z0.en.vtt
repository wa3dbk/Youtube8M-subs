00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hey world what I'm going to do 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.830
 charles that has proposed me to do spike 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.240
 and what he says is to take the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.220
 twelve works and put a video of the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.050
 one chimes and each chime 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.030
 of New Year's purposes and eat 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
 a grape to see who gets the twelfth 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.849
 purpose and to be understood without dying 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 choking I think it can be 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.240
 good fun there are year resolutions 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 again will also be learning to read 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 come and you know what I think of the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 New Year's resolutions that basically 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.800
 I do not think that I do not make resolutions that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.539
 I do not understand the purposes that do not 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.820
 purpose normally but I think so 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 that it can be cool that we burn the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.260
 memory to the idea memory the roll and that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.550
 to see people choking you can 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.350
 to be thinking every time gives bad luck 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.269
 eat the grape before New Year's Eve 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.190

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.769
 here I have the video of the chimes 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 wait, wait, I never understood well 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.040
 this of the rooms 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.870
 finish the storyboard of the coming 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.470
 learn to blas animation 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.890
 learn not to waste time 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.640
 upload 30 videos catastrophic yours 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.090
 work on something that I like 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.040
 read so much more than in 2014 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.170
 improve my english 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.549
 improve my Italian 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.549
 improve my japanese 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.240
 traveling this is easy 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.240
 lose stage fright 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.570
 and change the world as far as 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.010
 possible of the streets has been much more 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.750
 of what I thought is also to say that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.640
 I've done a bit of cheating because I've 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.310
 bought the typical boat east of grapes 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.560
 peeled and seedless he says go 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.150
 bigger nonsense but if there are people 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.670
 that they eat twelve jelly beans and I can 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.070
 eat twelve grapes without seeds and good 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.600
 these are my purposes for 2015 the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.040
 putada is that as they are recorded if not 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.500
 he meets them, you can tell me that 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.420
 I have not complied with it so I think what 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.409
 more reasonable and what would make me happy is that 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.970
 leave me you in yours 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.990
 comments in your comments do not 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.780
 in the comments section 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.880
 our purposes of this 2015 and so 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.050

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.450
 I have also registered your 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.149

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.490
 thing more between us like me and and 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.050

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.789
 that you have come to watch the video and still 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.489
 you do not see it closed you are already seeing it 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.070
 I want to say one thing that I do not understand in 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.709
 life and it's the next thing I went to the cinema 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.130
 parenthesis and having seen six by 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.600
 holy god because it is very good 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.190
 total I went to the end to see watched from 6 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.200
 after listening to the band 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.970
 sound because I'm that freaky and before 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.340
 to see the movie I had been 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.620
 the soundtrack on youtube and this was 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.020
 one of the songs that is in the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.160
 original movie in the credits for 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.160
 let the copyright come out you know 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.370
 and this is what it sounded in the movies when 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.080
 I went to see the movie I was so 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.580
 happy at the movies 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.380
 and in the credits it suddenly starts to 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.300
 sound the music is worth and then this 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.069
 song makes me the delays and it sounds 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.739

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.739

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.510

 this is not peace and harmony flows through 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.370
 my veins in fact I left the cinema without 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.280

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.480
 of bombs nothing happened and that's it 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.460
 what I wanted to share with you if 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.170

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.580
 sung the song no I'm not 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.500

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.290
 need to do that 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.000

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.049

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.070
