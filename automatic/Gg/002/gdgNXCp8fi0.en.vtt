with the heat setting at the lowest I'm

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.390 
with the heat setting at the lowest I'm
using<00:00:20.490> my<00:00:20.760> cake<00:00:21.029> pan<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.689> doing<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:23.340> you

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
using my cake pan in doing this but you

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.720 
using my cake pan in doing this but you
can<00:00:23.699> use<00:00:23.970> any<00:00:24.510> pot<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.590> melt<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> sugar<00:00:26.010> and

can use any pot to melt the sugar and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.730 
can use any pot to melt the sugar and
then<00:00:27.240> transfer<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:28.230> cake<00:00:28.590> pan<00:00:30.740> so

then transfer it to your cake pan so

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.459 
then transfer it to your cake pan so
again<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.840> heat<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.350> medium<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.730> low<00:00:35.940> heat

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
again the heat is medium to low heat

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:46.069 
again the heat is medium to low heat
then<00:00:37.469> melt<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.040> sugar<00:00:39.530> just<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:45.079> okay

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
then melt the sugar just like so okay

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.500 
then melt the sugar just like so okay
should<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.289> scrape<00:00:46.710> down<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> sides<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
should we scrape down the sides of the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.979 
should we scrape down the sides of the
UM<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.710> bottom<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.520> pan<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.780> make

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
UM and the bottom of the pan to make

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:04.759 
UM and the bottom of the pan to make
sure<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.610> sugar<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.449> burning<00:01:03.769> once

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
sure that the sugar is not burning once

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.950 
sure that the sugar is not burning once
the<00:01:04.920> texture<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.909> turn<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the texture is like this turn off the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.359 
the texture is like this turn off the
heat<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.780> we<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> move<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> next

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
heat and we get a move on to the next

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.620 
heat and we get a move on to the next
step<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> while<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> sugar<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.310> still<00:01:14.640> had<00:01:15.000> we

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
step so while the sugar is still had we

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.950 
step so while the sugar is still had we
can<00:01:15.810> start<00:01:16.200> putting<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:19.009> pineapple<00:01:20.009> rings

baking give it a good tap to release
some<00:05:45.780> air<00:05:46.139> bubbles

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.469 

and<00:05:59.559> this<00:06:00.159> is<00:06:00.279> what<00:06:00.490> it<00:06:00.610> looks<00:06:00.849> like<00:06:01.059> after

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
and this is what it looks like after

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.779 
and this is what it looks like after
baking<00:06:01.719> now<00:06:02.439> one<00:06:02.770> important<00:06:03.400> thing<00:06:03.460> to

baking now one important thing to

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.570 
baking now one important thing to
remember<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:05.020> once<00:06:05.499> it's<00:06:05.860> come<00:06:06.129> out<00:06:06.339> of<00:06:06.430> the

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
remember is once it's come out of the

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.149 
remember is once it's come out of the
oven<00:06:06.659> you<00:06:07.659> need<00:06:07.869> to<00:06:08.050> take<00:06:08.259> it<00:06:08.469> out<00:06:08.589> of<00:06:08.619> the<00:06:08.889> pan

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
oven you need to take it out of the pan

straight away you don't want this to

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:15.450 
straight away you don't want this to
cool<00:06:11.860> down<00:06:12.189> or<00:06:12.550> else<00:06:12.759> you<00:06:13.089> will<00:06:13.240> risk<00:06:14.460> the

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
cool down or else you will risk the

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.239 
cool down or else you will risk the
brown<00:06:15.849> sugar<00:06:16.360> at<00:06:16.479> the<00:06:16.509> bottom<00:06:16.689> to<00:06:17.319> set<00:06:17.619> and<00:06:18.039> we

won't be able to take out the cake so

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:29.040 
won't be able to take out the cake so
flip<00:06:21.909> this<00:06:22.210> upside<00:06:22.509> down<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:27.300> then<00:06:28.300> though<00:06:28.869> of

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
flip this upside down and then though of

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.409 
flip this upside down and then though of
the<00:06:29.199> pineapple<00:06:29.740> get<00:06:29.919> stuck<00:06:30.249> on<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.819> cake<00:06:31.059> tin

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.889 
the pineapple get stuck on the cake tin
so<00:06:31.809> but<00:06:32.139> it's<00:06:32.289> easy<00:06:32.559> to<00:06:32.830> remove<00:06:33.219> and<00:06:33.639> place<00:06:34.599> it

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:34.899 
so but it's easy to remove and place it

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:43.320 
so but it's easy to remove and place it
back<00:06:35.110> again<00:06:35.589> just<00:06:35.949> like<00:06:36.639> so<00:06:40.080> and<00:06:41.939> then<00:06:42.939> one

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:01.569 
and then I cut off a first slice and

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:04.049 
and then I cut off a first slice and
then<00:07:01.779> this<00:07:01.990> is<00:07:02.139> the<00:07:02.289> second<00:07:02.680> slice<00:07:02.979> now<00:07:03.309> just
