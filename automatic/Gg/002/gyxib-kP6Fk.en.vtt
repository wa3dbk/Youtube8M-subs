sandy's treedome and first we'll start

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.440 
sandy's treedome and first we'll start
off<00:00:08.730> with<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.090> door<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:10.559> isn't<00:00:10.740> exactly

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
off with the door and this isn't exactly

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.780 
off with the door and this isn't exactly
the<00:00:12.500> normal<00:00:13.500> door<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.009> would<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.400> open

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the normal door that you would just open

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.769 
the normal door that you would just open
up<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:16.100> it's<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:18.000> random<00:00:18.480> Lego

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
up like that it's just a random Lego

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.480 
up like that it's just a random Lego
piece<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> found<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.710> my<00:00:19.740> Lego<00:00:19.980> bin<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
piece that I found in my Lego bin and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.670 
piece that I found in my Lego bin and
what<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.330> would<00:00:21.420> do<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:22.439> them<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
what you would do is put them in a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.519 
what you would do is put them in a
figure<00:00:22.949> there<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.970> turn<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.529> then

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
figure there and you turn it then

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.800 
figure there and you turn it then
they're<00:00:26.010> inside<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.300> not<00:00:27.449> entirely

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
they're inside and it's not entirely

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.070 
they're inside and it's not entirely
accurate<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> show<00:00:29.010> by<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.699> thought<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
accurate to the show by this thought it

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.720 
accurate to the show by this thought it
would<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.289> kind<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.560> cool<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> creation

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
would be kind of cool for the creation

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.760 
would be kind of cool for the creation
and<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:35.489> dome<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> Crayola

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
and the dome is really just the Crayola

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.369 
and the dome is really just the Crayola
Glo<00:00:38.520> dome<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.480> took<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.050> off<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
