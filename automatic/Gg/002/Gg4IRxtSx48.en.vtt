00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.809
 Welcome to the video training 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.870
 can 16 d my name is michael jordan 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.059
 i am photographer trainer and author and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.059
 Break through this video training 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.320
 did they hear it silently ? 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.529
 this sounds like one of the three for me 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.140
 highlights of this camera is look us 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.359
 Of course, in addition to the silent mode too 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.390
 the other modes of operation 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.979
 how can they trigger what is in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.040
 which situation maybe the best 

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:39.180
 attitude for your work 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.260
 Of course we do not just look at those 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.720
 highlights but also the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.540
 basic function I explain it first 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.299
 which knob where lever on the 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.640
 What is this camera for? 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.949
 especially good for the beginner first 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.690
 that he gets an overview like he does 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.080
 camera can serve the most meaningful and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.299
 Of course, those who are highly complex 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.790
 device best approaches that he possible 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.409
 fast also great photos makes that 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.909
 second highlight for me that's that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.280
 integrated wifi 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.700
 that's really the top hammer for me 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.010
 incredible in this little housing in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.900
 analog cameras was on the same surface 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.560
 the possibility to insert a film and 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.070
 that was it then 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.070
 And here is not only super autofocus 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.990
 but also a wlan and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.540
 like you with this wlan and one 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.460
 smartphone from smartphone from the camera 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.750
 this is for me that can trigger 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.630
 second highlight in this 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.430
 video-training is really something 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.409
 by simply installing the whole thing 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.520
 and then it just makes fun of the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.740
 to read far away 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.780
 So you do not need a cable trigger 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.640
 more also the self-timer has in the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.720
 reason with this function of mine 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.970
 overview obsolete 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.680
 central chapter in this 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.920
 video training these are the menu 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.020
 has settings on 15 tabs 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.900
 can be the most diverse 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.280
 Settings options gathered step 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.980
 step by step I go to the menu items 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.150
 by explaining it and giving it to them 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.880
 Also a few tips from mine 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.800
 photographic practice so you know it all 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.290
 quickly what settings for you 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.850
 relevant are what you absolutely need 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.680
 and what they think of the things they do 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.110
 may need in the fifteenth 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.970
 then register may may june gather 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.530
 if you have everything at hand quickly 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.830
 she was hardly want to set as 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.900
 as you want them to have the third one 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.450
 big highlight for me is the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.390
 possibility external flashguns namely 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.020
 the 600 exc from the camera too 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.300
 control 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.130
 that's unbelievable to me 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.380
 I put the flash unit away from the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.870
 Camera on and can s.der camera the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.940
 set flash output and with 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.250
 Of course, there are several flashguns available 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.480
 incredible possibilities great pictures 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.620
 to design 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.930
 I wish them much fun their karl 6d 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.380
 and of course with the video training from 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.380
