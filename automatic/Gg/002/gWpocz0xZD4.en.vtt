00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
engineering side of things you can learn

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.490

here<00:02:27.060> than<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.629> pretty<00:02:27.870> much<00:02:27.959> ever<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.470> in

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
here than you pretty much ever will in

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.250 
here than you pretty much ever will in
the<00:02:29.310> classroom<00:02:29.849> it's<00:02:30.239> more<00:02:30.629> real-world

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the classroom it's more real-world

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.770 
the classroom it's more real-world
experience<00:02:32.189> and<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:33.180> think<00:02:33.209> that's<00:02:33.569> something

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
experience and I think that's something

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.979 
experience and I think that's something
that<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:35.129> jobs<00:02:35.609> and<00:02:35.970> businesses<00:02:36.840> are

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
that that jobs and businesses are

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.360 
that that jobs and businesses are
definitely<00:02:37.470> gonna<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.680> looking<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.310> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
opinion the ideal candidate is obviously

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.289 
opinion the ideal candidate is obviously
somebody<00:03:00.329> who's<00:03:00.689> 100%<00:03:01.590> passionate<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:03.090> has<00:03:03.269> a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
love for automotive engineering and race

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.679 
love for automotive engineering and race
engineering<00:03:06.950> but<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.159> person<00:03:08.700> has<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.450> have

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
engineering but that person has to have

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.349 
engineering but that person has to have
that<00:03:10.260> knack<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:11.069> when<00:03:11.340> they<00:03:11.489> find<00:03:11.849> something

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
that knack that when they find something

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.300 
that knack that when they find something
like<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.750> they<00:03:13.470> got<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.799> realize<00:03:14.129> that

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
like this they got to realize that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.849 
like this they got to realize that
everything<00:03:14.730> else<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.150> life<00:03:15.180> at<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.840> time<00:03:16.079> is

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
everything else in life at that time is

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.710 
everything else in life at that time is
not<00:03:17.190> worth<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.669> like<00:03:17.819> they'd<00:03:18.060> rather<00:03:18.090> do<00:03:18.569> this

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
not worth it like they'd rather do this

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.819 
not worth it like they'd rather do this
over<00:03:19.049> everything<00:03:19.319> else

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
over everything else

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.530 
over everything else
like<00:03:20.310> that's<00:03:20.699> the<00:03:20.879> perfect<00:03:21.239> candidate<00:03:21.510> for

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
like that's the perfect candidate for

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.930 
like that's the perfect candidate for
Formula<00:03:22.049> SAE<00:03:22.190> somebody<00:03:23.190> who<00:03:23.310> wants<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.579> go<00:03:23.760> out

this<00:03:32.220> is<00:03:32.370> your<00:03:32.550> life

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
this is your life

you<00:03:33.000> gotta<00:03:33.180> be<00:03:33.270> willing<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.599> live<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.959> so

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
you gotta be willing to live that so

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.870 
you gotta be willing to live that so
it's<00:03:34.830> definitely<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.340> place<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.580> be<00:03:35.730> right

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's definitely the place to be right

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.650 
it's definitely the place to be right
now<00:03:37.250> but<00:03:38.250> just<00:03:38.280> I'd<00:03:38.670> like<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:39.030> continue<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
now but just I'd like to continue the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.960 
now but just I'd like to continue the
legacy<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:40.110> success<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.950> UTA<00:03:41.370> racing<00:03:41.760> has

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
legacy of success that UTA racing has

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.540 
legacy of success that UTA racing has
we've<00:03:42.810> been<00:03:42.959> around<00:03:43.050> for<00:03:43.500> thirty<00:03:44.190> years<00:03:44.280> now

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
we've been around for thirty years now

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.400 
we've been around for thirty years now
this<00:03:44.880> it's<00:03:45.239> not<00:03:45.450> just<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.840> team<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.319> an

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
this it's not just a team this is an

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.740 
this it's not just a team this is an
institution<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:47.940> can<00:03:48.120> add<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.599> the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
institution and if I can add to the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.530 
institution and if I can add to the
ongoing<00:03:49.760> longevity<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.910> institution

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
ongoing longevity of that institution

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.790 
ongoing longevity of that institution
and<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.690> think<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.019> would<00:03:52.140> be<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.650> good

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
and I think that would be a good

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.459 
and I think that would be a good
accomplishment
