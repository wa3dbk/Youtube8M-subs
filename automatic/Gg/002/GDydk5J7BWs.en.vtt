00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.310
 and I'm with patricia fernÃ¡ndez and I 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.600
 fascinates everything that brings me know her 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.990
 of course of this exhibition 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.310
 romantic so beautiful and the truth that you 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.619
 Month has been a beauty then very nice 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.349
 and it also came because there are a thousand ideas that 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.349
 can be done with a tendency that 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.169
 comes with this to beautify the piece 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.500
 there is a line of work actually 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.879
 everything is embedded with one another 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.820
 exactly because you have now we are 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.809
 seeing several things you work on 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.660
 wood on tiles by wax monies and 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.640
 porcelain painting in glass on fabric 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.640
 of sublimation that is nothing 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.780
 and good recent mine accessories 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.090
 just to give us not as if she did not 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.760
 not loading too much is also pickling 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.130
 of layer two transfers we do everything 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.410
 type of techniques for a termination to 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.180
 all these decorative objects without 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.979
 enter the decorative painting to not 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.380
 frustrate the students sometimes we 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.979
 encourage some to encourage them to paint and 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.979
 give an excellent idea to do 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.210
 nice cute things and the one that wants 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.390
 really have a result 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.920
 spectacular let's see this one that I the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.380
 I saw in the room 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.770
 this fascinated me because I went through there 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.470
 good is this little bird houses 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.440
 the sublimated tile the hayloft all me 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.320
 It seemed like a beauty and I said good what 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.789
 we want to do and also the termination 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.009
 yes you have to be very careful between the 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.420
 completions in all the details here 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.789
 pass the test but good ready good 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.369
 I am going to explain we are going to use 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.690
 pretreated tiles to sublimate and 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.060
 sublima bless 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.400
 I already have one that is cut 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 let's cut the design we're going to 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.470
 present and we put the tile 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.310
 faced 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.840
 Once the focus 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.569
 we apply masking tape 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.480
 to hold one of the strangers 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.310
 we are going to mark only one so that after 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.870
 we can wait to see how it will look 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.230
 because what happens in the obligations 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.879
 that you want to go seeing clearly already 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.879
 then once we have it fastened 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.879
 we turn 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.540
 and with the iron you have to make a 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.209
 griddle 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.159
 as long as it does not have steam so that 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.159
 apply a very even heat 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.480
 I prefer common because the girls to 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.520
 times with the steam in the holes not 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.120
 transmit the heat then it will stay 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:03.080
 to be first we apply a heat 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.040
 general to the whole sheet because it tends 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.270
 with the heat 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.140
 why place a little bit then 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.140
 we do general and we wait for sectoring 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.780
 always the middle part of the plate 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.560
 is that we will give more heat so 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.510
 we're going to go 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.550
 sectoring now patricia vote beach 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.730
 you have like in cotton on silk in which the 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.910
 has the maximum maximum maximum maximum 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.220
 yes without fear without fear without fear yes 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.709
 because we're spying the same and we're going 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.709
 seeing that he is starting to follow exact 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.560
 and while I was still working with the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.770
 heat of the iron because to say that 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.390
 is pre-treated in the tile can not 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.490
 be a common and wild tile like 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.380
 we buy but he has a movie of 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.000
 a polymer that allows it to be a 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.110
 liquid projector that absorbs 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.030
 the sublimation the sheets are sheets 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.970
 that are printed with inks has 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.790
 sublimated then as the tile does not 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.430
 it has pores then it needs a 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.739
 biting evident and that's why they 're pre 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.959
 clear treat is perfect the 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:21.540
 explanation to know why images 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:21.540
 incredible the brightness is ready 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:31.449
 having patience you have to have 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.849
 patience but meanwhile what 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.069
 we want to do live to be seen 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.439
 as if they were doing it at home 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.509
 we have behind that the shine that the 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:43.270
 sheet then this of course what 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:45.430
 you can put the trays and since to 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.189
 example we have tray we have in boxes 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.259
 we already have a charming red in 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.360
 clock has several techniques have the 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:57.460
 pickling technique then we did 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.009
 we decoupage the veins and good the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.810
 Gold brooch with the tile not with the 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.669
 blue that also has a detail of 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.940
 strass that also has a detail 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.219
 extra look everything has a detail here 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.840
 I say that the pieces have to be seen 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:15.940
 because they are incredible and some gems here 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.669
 tickets a little bit also the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.289
 trimmings if the trimmings meet a 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.139
 important position 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.789
 well now we are all there are 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.789
 involved transferring 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.600
 remain 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.360
 I loved it very well so you can 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.320
 sublimate on tile and from there 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.620
 once we say that nothing else nothing 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.210
 more can even be applied in wood and 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.340
 in cloth in some of the jobs that 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.340
 we are have we go
