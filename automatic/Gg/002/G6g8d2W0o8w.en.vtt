memory<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.030> play<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.600> here

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
memory is going to really play in here

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.810 
memory is going to really play in here
so<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> take<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.799> note<00:01:31.950> integrated

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
so you want to take them note integrated

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.149 
so you want to take them note integrated
graphics<00:01:32.970> uses<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> system<00:01:34.229> memory<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.950> its

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
graphics uses the system memory for its

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.100 
graphics uses the system memory for its
graphics<00:01:35.700> needs<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.329> doesn't<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.689> built-in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
graphics needs it doesn't have built-in

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310 
graphics needs it doesn't have built-in
memory<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.640> use<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.119> 256<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.229> you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
memory so it will use up to 256 if you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
memory so it will use up to 256 if you
have<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.680> gig<00:01:41.240> memory<00:01:42.240> module<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:43.820> 384<00:01:44.820> if

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
have a two gig memory module or 384 if

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.819 
have a two gig memory module or 384 if
you<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> force<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you have the force so this is going to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.139 
you have the force so this is going to
be<00:01:46.920> something<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> consider<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.970> do

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
be something to consider when you do

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.819 
be something to consider when you do
some<00:01:48.420> memory<00:01:48.960> upgrades<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> remember

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
some memory upgrades you got to remember

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.800 
some memory upgrades you got to remember
that<00:01:50.189> graphics<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> utilize<00:01:51.420> some

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that graphics are going to utilize some

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.149 
that graphics are going to utilize some
of<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.020> memory<00:01:52.320> will<00:01:52.560> get<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> little<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:53.009> on

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
of that memory will get a little more on

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.940 
of that memory will get a little more on

next time i also new is Thunderbolt we
have<00:02:01.590> Thunderbolt<00:02:02.009> cross<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> line<00:02:02.700> this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
have Thunderbolt cross the line this

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.480 
have Thunderbolt cross the line this
will<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.810> great<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.049> hooking<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.799> new

on the road and for your power it looks

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.159 
on the road and for your power it looks
like<00:02:59.459> it's<00:02:59.609> pretty<00:02:59.879> pretty<00:03:00.329> close<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.719> typical

hours<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.049> higher<00:03:04.349> end<00:03:04.379> one

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
hours on the on the higher end one

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.500 
hours on the on the higher end one
thirty<00:03:05.159> days<00:03:05.340> standby<00:03:05.760> which<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.120> great<00:03:06.359> and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
thirty days standby which is great and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.420 
thirty days standby which is great and
it<00:03:06.989> gives<00:03:07.169> you<00:03:07.260> all<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.500> battery<00:03:07.859> info<00:03:08.040> this

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
it gives you all the battery info this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.599 
it gives you all the battery info this
also<00:03:08.579> is<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.790> Bluetooth<00:03:09.120> 4.0<00:03:10.310> Ice<00:03:11.310> we'll<00:03:11.459> see

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
also is a Bluetooth 4.0 Ice we'll see

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:12.890 
also is a Bluetooth 4.0 Ice we'll see
what<00:03:11.790> all<00:03:11.909> that<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.359> know<00:03:12.419> hashes<00:03:12.780> out

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
what all that and you know hashes out

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.000 
what all that and you know hashes out
but<00:03:13.079> it<00:03:13.139> does<00:03:13.260> seem<00:03:13.409> to<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.799> latest

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
but it does seem to have the latest

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.009 
but it does seem to have the latest
greatest<00:03:14.370> there<00:03:14.639> so<00:03:15.269> let's<00:03:15.419> take<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.569> look<00:03:15.810> here

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
greatest there so let's take a look here

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.809 
greatest there so let's take a look here
at<00:03:16.049> this<00:03:16.409> base<00:03:16.709> model<00:03:17.219> it<00:03:17.340> comes<00:03:17.519> with<00:03:17.669> two

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
at this base model it comes with two

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.879 
at this base model it comes with two
gigs<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.269> memory<00:03:18.449> this<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.530> going<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.799> be

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
gigs of memory this is going to be

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.080 
gigs of memory this is going to be
something<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.280> important<00:03:20.790> here<00:03:20.819> for

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
something really important here for

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.280 
something really important here for
three<00:03:21.299> reasons<00:03:21.479> i<00:03:21.840> would<00:03:21.959> highly<00:03:22.109> recommend

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
three reasons i would highly recommend

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.800 
three reasons i would highly recommend
upgrading<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.639> four<00:03:24.060> gigs<00:03:24.359> now<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.659> first

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
upgrading to four gigs now the first

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.259 
upgrading to four gigs now the first
reason<00:03:25.229> is<00:03:25.379> this<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.949> not<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.220> user<00:03:26.609> upgradeable

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
reason is this is not a user upgradeable

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.059 
reason is this is not a user upgradeable
part<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:27.840> you're<00:03:28.530> not<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.829> be<00:03:28.889> able<00:03:28.919> to

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
part so you're not going to be able to

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.559 
part so you're not going to be able to
just<00:03:29.129> open<00:03:29.430> up<00:03:29.519> install<00:03:29.909> more<00:03:30.060> memory<00:03:30.120> like

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
just open up install more memory like

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.939 
just open up install more memory like
you<00:03:30.659> can<00:03:30.840> on<00:03:30.870> other<00:03:31.199> macs<00:03:31.470> or<00:03:31.680> typical

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
you can on other macs or typical

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.170 
you can on other macs or typical
computers<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:32.760> you're<00:03:32.879> going<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.030> be<00:03:33.120> stuck

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
computers so you're going to be stuck

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.640 
computers so you're going to be stuck
with<00:03:33.449> whatever<00:03:33.659> you<00:03:33.870> get<00:03:34.049> so<00:03:34.409> you<00:03:34.500> definitely

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
with whatever you get so you definitely

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.800 
with whatever you get so you definitely
want<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:34.979> get<00:03:35.099> for<00:03:35.459> here<00:03:35.760> another<00:03:36.389> reason<00:03:36.599> is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
want to get for here another reason is

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.300 
want to get for here another reason is
keep<00:03:37.019> in<00:03:37.139> mind<00:03:37.319> this<00:03:37.439> is<00:03:37.500> an<00:03:37.829> integrated

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
keep in mind this is an integrated

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.349 
keep in mind this is an integrated
graphics<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:38.849> you're<00:03:38.970> going<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.209> sharing

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
graphics so you're going to be sharing

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.849 
graphics so you're going to be sharing
this<00:03:39.569> memory<00:03:39.870> with<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.229> or<00:03:40.349> graphics

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
this memory with you or graphics

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.679 
this memory with you or graphics
processor<00:03:41.609> so<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:41.970> definitely<00:03:42.359> going<00:03:42.629> to

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
processor so you definitely going to

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.149 
processor so you definitely going to
have<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.810> little<00:03:42.959> more<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.769> third<00:03:43.979> reason

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
have a little more and the third reason

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.129 
have a little more and the third reason
is<00:03:44.459> when<00:03:44.759> you<00:03:44.879> go<00:03:45.030> up<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.269> four<00:03:45.689> gigs<00:03:45.989> you're

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
is when you go up to four gigs you're

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.659 
is when you go up to four gigs you're
going<00:03:46.259> to<00:03:46.319> get<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.650> little<00:03:46.859> more<00:03:47.009> graphics<00:03:47.609> a

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
going to get a little more graphics a

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.429 
going to get a little more graphics a
little<00:03:48.180> more<00:03:48.299> memory<00:03:48.629> available<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
little more memory available to the

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.629 
little more memory available to the
graphics<00:03:50.030> processor<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.269> get<00:03:51.449> 3<00:03:52.169> 3<00:03:52.739> 84<00:03:53.129> vs

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
graphics processor so you get 3 3 84 vs

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.179 
graphics processor so you get 3 3 84 vs
256<00:03:54.389> so<00:03:54.629> three<00:03:55.169> good<00:03:55.349> reasons<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.769> get<00:03:55.949> up<00:03:56.069> to

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
256 so three good reasons to get up to

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.460 
256 so three good reasons to get up to
four<00:03:56.459> gigs<00:03:57.150> here<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:57.509> highly<00:03:57.810> recommend<00:03:58.319> that

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
four gigs here so highly recommend that

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.229 
four gigs here so highly recommend that
apple<00:03:58.769> charges<00:03:59.009> 100<00:03:59.400> bucks<00:03:59.609> and<00:03:59.909> you<00:04:00.030> know<00:04:00.090> not

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
apple charges 100 bucks and you know not

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.149 
apple charges 100 bucks and you know not
too<00:04:00.389> big<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.810> not<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.650> big<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.889> an<00:04:02.009> upgrade

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
too big of a not to a big of an upgrade

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.399 
too big of a not to a big of an upgrade
i<00:04:02.340> guess<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.849> get<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.329> up<00:04:03.479> there<00:04:03.659> and<00:04:03.840> then<00:04:04.079> of

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
i guess to get you up there and then of

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:05.449 
i guess to get you up there and then of
course<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.769> have<00:04:04.859> an<00:04:04.949> external<00:04:05.189> superdrive

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
course you have an external superdrive

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.020 
course you have an external superdrive
no<00:04:06.449> heart<00:04:06.659> no<00:04:06.720> no<00:04:07.409> no<00:04:07.889> optical<00:04:08.459> disk<00:04:08.669> on<00:04:08.849> here

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
no heart no no no optical disk on here

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.390 
no heart no no no optical disk on here
so<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.329> you<00:04:09.389> do<00:04:09.540> right<00:04:09.780> many<00:04:10.739> disks<00:04:11.099> or<00:04:11.220> read

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
so can you do right many disks or read

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.920 
so can you do right many disks or read
any<00:04:11.579> discs<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.329> could<00:04:12.659> be<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> good

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
any discs on this could be a good

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.390 
any discs on this could be a good
upgrade<00:04:13.139> for<00:04:13.439> you<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:13.889> course<00:04:14.099> we<00:04:14.250> have

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
upgrade for you and of course we have

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.699 
upgrade for you and of course we have
the<00:04:14.430> Thunderbolt<00:04:15.090> Display<00:04:15.569> here<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:16.620> you

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
the Thunderbolt Display here that you

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.499 
the Thunderbolt Display here that you
can<00:04:16.829> add<00:04:17.099> on<00:04:17.310> with<00:04:17.579> that<00:04:17.789> now<00:04:18.180> something<00:04:18.479> I

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
can add on with that now something I

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.029 
can add on with that now something I
want<00:04:18.659> to<00:04:18.750> know<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.019> when<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.409> do<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.859> that

want to know is when you do and that
four<00:04:20.370> gig<00:04:20.750> upgrade<00:04:21.750> here<00:04:21.989> it'll<00:04:22.349> increase<00:04:22.620> it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
four gig upgrade here it'll increase it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.430 
four gig upgrade here it'll increase it
to<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.010> hundred<00:04:23.279> dollar<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.789> got<00:04:23.909> 1099<00:04:24.750> now

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
to a hundred dollar so you got 1099 now

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.940 
to a hundred dollar so you got 1099 now
let's<00:04:25.620> take<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.800> look<00:04:25.889> here<00:04:26.070> at<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.580> neck

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
let's take a look here at the neck

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
comes standard with four gigs and it's

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.430 
comes standard with four gigs and it's

to spending more money here each upgrade

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.660 
to spending more money here each upgrade
you<00:05:16.660> know<00:05:16.780> lens<00:05:17.050> to<00:05:17.290> another<00:05:17.620> good<00:05:18.100> idea<00:05:18.250> so

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
you know lens to another good idea so

you know lens to another good idea so
option<00:05:18.910> there<00:05:19.240> either<00:05:19.450> way<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:20.170> i7<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:20.830> know

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
option there either way the i7 you know

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.460 
option there either way the i7 you know
probably<00:05:21.280> give<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.880> laptop<00:05:22.420> longer<00:05:23.050> longer

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
probably give the laptop longer longer

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.920 
probably give the laptop longer longer
legs<00:05:23.770> last<00:05:24.040> longer<00:05:24.430> time<00:05:24.640> I<00:05:24.670> would<00:05:24.940> think<00:05:25.090> but

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
legs last longer time I would think but

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.180 
legs last longer time I would think but
overall<00:05:26.170> either<00:05:26.530> one<00:05:26.800> will<00:05:26.890> be<00:05:26.980> fine

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
overall either one will be fine

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.620 
overall either one will be fine
specially<00:05:27.610> we're<00:05:27.700> gonna<00:05:27.790> be<00:05:27.910> using<00:05:27.940> a<00:05:28.150> second

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
specially we're gonna be using a second

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.940 
specially we're gonna be using a second
computer<00:05:28.720> you<00:05:29.170> know<00:05:29.260> kind<00:05:29.440> of<00:05:29.500> working<00:05:29.740> on<00:05:29.800> the

road and of course you can upgrade the

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.030 
road and of course you can upgrade the
flash<00:05:31.750> storage<00:05:32.080> if<00:05:32.230> we<00:05:32.320> want<00:05:32.500> for<00:05:32.590> another<00:05:32.740> 300

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
flash storage if we want for another 300

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.830 
flash storage if we want for another 300
bucks<00:05:33.490> if<00:05:33.820> that's<00:05:33.970> worth<00:05:34.120> it<00:05:34.270> or<00:05:34.390> not<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:34.720> seems

like<00:05:35.050> a<00:05:35.080> little<00:05:35.350> bit<00:05:35.470> of<00:05:35.500> much<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:36.580> really

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
like a little bit of much it really

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.190 
like a little bit of much it really
depends<00:05:37.120> what<00:05:37.240> your<00:05:37.390> storage<00:05:37.690> needs<00:05:37.810> are

again<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:38.740> got<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:38.950> SuperDrive<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:39.760> then

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
again you got the SuperDrive and then

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.360 
again you got the SuperDrive and then
you<00:05:40.420> have<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.780> Thunderbolt<00:05:41.410> options<00:05:41.860> also

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
you have the Thunderbolt options also

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.410 
you have the Thunderbolt options also
it's<00:05:42.490> interesting<00:05:42.670> here<00:05:43.000> because<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:43.330> can

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
it's interesting here because you can

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.270 
it's interesting here because you can
get<00:05:43.480> an<00:05:43.570> ethernet<00:05:43.930> adapter<00:05:44.320> this<00:05:44.980> would<00:05:45.190> be

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
get an ethernet adapter this would be

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.410 
get an ethernet adapter this would be
something<00:05:45.460> if<00:05:45.640> you<00:05:45.700> really<00:05:45.940> want<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.240> wire

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
something if you really want to wire

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.130 
something if you really want to wire

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.390 
your computer in a few it's only 10 100
it's<00:05:50.290> not<00:05:50.410> going<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.590> be<00:05:50.650> gigabit<00:05:51.010> or<00:05:51.040> anything

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
it's not going to be gigabit or anything

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.010
