00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello how about people I have an uf of 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.400
 back with the other white battle and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.470
 black two format is a format that almost 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.680
 I do not use but I decide to use it by 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.170
 pokemon clown that is my sun work and be 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.330
 on the side but in fact I told myself we are not going to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.180
 do it where software can explode 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.670
 more that skill and it's in the uies where 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 it belongs though they may be to the ugly but 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.300
 the truth is they steal almost better work 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.710
 on the web but let's start with this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 battle begins with surf broadway yo 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.359
 I start with ninja or now it changes to 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.460
 milstein because he thought I was his 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.170
 place many people think they should 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.929
 lead with software because if we do not 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.050
 serves the pokemon although it is a good 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:45.059
 strategy really I do not use it if I 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 I use it more for the end but good here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.469
 you already make a mistake knowing that you already 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.569
 I had done fake earlier changed I do not know 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.569
 to what but having changed from md is 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:57.239
 he let his tank die so I already have 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.530
 a little less now pulls out your fire not 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.659
 I want to lose everything in my show because 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.149
 has fake audis priority I thought I was going 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.160
 to go through the youtube gap but instead of 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.990
 that was for audrey and seeing that damage 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.299
 really still with leftovers 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.280
 three strokes so he has a choice 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.590
 between putting the rocks or being a psychic 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.630
 or a youtube so it would have been the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.399
 better option but I thought it well the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.840
 I said true is locked is not going to have 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.270
 opportunity to put the rocks more 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.149
 go ahead so I think a little more 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.740
 of damage with the rocks although we assume 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.869
 even if he only has one pokémon of them 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.990
 which is used for that was for 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.580
 that I did not put him well then it was going to be 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.429
 much more convenient for me but 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.080
 then he kills me I will take out Iran 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.460
 because I know with outrage will not be able to 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.590
 kill unless choice is going to be 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.380
 confused apart so I go for the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.959
 cloud combat I know what you expect from this one 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.390
 I have good months change the objects 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.610
 now this is sometimes to be fine back 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.409
 schwander but I decided to poke for from 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.330
 here because I've already brought these two 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.720
 others because it is to be that they are mig under 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.250
 and fire and watching for the damage this I am 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.350
 that I think was more defensive because 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.840
 I pick it up super good still holds 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.580
 but I had to predict a 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 play very very very crucial because not 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 I wanted them to take control of the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.440
 battle was for your data to exist 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.690
 the cloud with matt however I made a 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.620
 double previous change although this can 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.659
 been very expensive 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.580
 since if he stayed there to sacrifice 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.799
 his structure could have made the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.090
 scout and there's probably amnesia that 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.250
 is a millionaire would not have been good in 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.500
 this moment but then it changes its 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.440
 rayco because he thought that I know that 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.870
 he thought but hey the showbol is super effe 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.970
 is very strong since amnesia has a 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.400
 extremely large special attack and it's 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.659
 As I said, I 'm scarf, so it's not 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.290
 but I think that this was a variant 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:43.019
 kauman and a little more out now take out 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.760
 his van I know not for a moment 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.290
 Earth type simply because I bring 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.209
 still several whys why not when 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.400
 because by resisting the type movements 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.769
 land but fortunately it does not get me 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.410
 eliminate I can strike you out one not one 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.090
 shadow however he could not kill it anymore 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.549
 that also swollen me because it's pretty 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.859
 weak good no was not enough 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.540
 mighty he has already two shifts 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.000
 autrique to appear until obtaining 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.709
 all these shifts plus the other autriche 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.420
 but the truth does not matter it's not going to 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.730
 kill though unless it's critical and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.620
 he's not going to get it and I'm going 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.510
 close is going to be the nights since 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.190
 I want that if I do not want you to enter it 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.019
 you because is you can give me more or 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.090
 less the return to the fight can both 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.680
 put them 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.680
 and if they put the walls really they 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.750
 call control fight 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.640
 but in the end to take them out, but I saw them 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.670
 to see it fails, I think that 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.939
 this would be really good thought that 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.900
 this would affect you super very much but 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.670
 I have this diet that in this genre 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.230
 cross so it did not matter much these 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.409
 masses power what changed and have used 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.269
 more this I knew six crypts but good 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.769
 Finally, I took out a set and go for the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.900
 Facing the lie this is the country 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.719
 we are men or clowns so guess 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.700
 that we are clowns and we are here to 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.680
 finish the last two pokémons that 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.180
 the imposing one is left so guys 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.069
 clown so I hope you have 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.489
 I enjoyed this video will have this 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.840
 with this site with a the night page that 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.280
 they have problem of failing yes but 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.260
 he also has a problem of 40 per 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.209
 cent of that you lower the accuracy 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.040
 I do not really like to get involved with 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.840
 precision but good since that 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.509
 movement that is available because no 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.160
 so we ended up with that jump the 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.169
 rocks will not survive a knight day 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.139
 I hope you enjoyed this shot of 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.880
 my clown software and see you in the 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.880
 next we comment inscribe goodbye 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.020
 Clear
