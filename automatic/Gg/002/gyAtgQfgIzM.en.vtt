00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.540
 architect marina drip 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.250
 sometimes plays the role of a leading 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.070
 program fifth corner 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.130
 Today she will tell about artificial 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.120
 stone which by the way often uses in 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.619
 their projects 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.230
 then I became more refined appeared 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.630
 new types of it with different weights new 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.470
 shades new colors and new areas 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.080
 of application 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.150
 Of course, first and foremost is the finish 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 base of whatever was done before 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.170
 the base is always different and it should 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.239
 be faced before it was done with slate 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 naturally but now others have appeared 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.850
 options are materials for construction 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.219
 houses that require follow 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 facings we always plaster this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.530
 good especially in local conditions 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.629
 climate where it quickly loses color is 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.600
 many houses that were built on 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.210
 the turn of the late nineties doctor 2000 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.039
 houses are well built and most of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.439
 they are made of bricks but during this time 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.900
 they have something to do with appearance and have not risen 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.939
 to say the least not very here too us on 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.330
 Assistance can come artificial stone 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.760
 which will allow without producing any 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.610
 global destruction just swap 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.799
 local appearance 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.810
 technology is very interesting here 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.500
 for example artificial stone for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.320
 wall decoration chosen by the mistress of the castle house 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.759
 material allowed to protect you from her 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.759
 follow concept 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.759
 and the type of land spout 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.560
 In this cafe, the interior stone is pretty 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.079
 theatrical 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.070
 loud way of applying it 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.539
 of the material 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.539
 but that is the problem 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.980
 and here is a series of works of the marina workshop 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.650
 flu 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.860
 great example of tactful relevant 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.020
 the way interior decor a good palette 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.070
 material allows you to play with thin 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.170
 shades 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.510
 artificial stone in the interior can 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.850
 play the role of an accent on some wall 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.840
 it is characteristic of the interior in style 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.180
 minimalism 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.910
 where what is beautiful effects 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.340
 achieved by playing various 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.130
 surface textures if part of the trends 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.440
 and the return to neoclassicism is 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.130
 return to vintage tradition in 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.860
 the interior 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.040
 which means that the surface should 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.710
 have some trace of time and let's say 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.140
 if in question and artificial bricks 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.110
 stone here applies a palette with 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.070
 scuffed with different shades 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.500
 several colors at once that is 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.510
 created in the mix allows you to dial 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.060
 the wall that will overflow will 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.190
 it is clear that she is very old I went to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.860
 and will give some very interesting effect 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.400
 interiors in general are competent suppliers 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.080
 help make accurate calculations and 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.600
 provide logistics helping 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.180
 professionals choose the right one 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.180
 properties of the stone for each case 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.190
 fifth angle pride 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.430
