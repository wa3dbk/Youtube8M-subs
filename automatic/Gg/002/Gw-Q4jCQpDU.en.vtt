the next game to the lottery might be a
little<00:04:43.410> bit<00:04:43.650> easier<00:04:43.940> right<00:04:44.940> now<00:04:45.150> it's<00:04:45.390> about<00:04:45.510> a

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
little bit easier right now it's about a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.920 
little bit easier right now it's about a
thirty<00:04:46.530> percent<00:04:47.040> chance<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:48.240> might<00:04:48.420> go<00:04:48.630> up<00:04:48.750> to

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
thirty percent chance it might go up to

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.170 
thirty percent chance it might go up to
close<00:04:49.140> to<00:04:49.200> forty<00:04:49.830> percent<00:04:50.190> chance<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:50.790> get<00:04:51.000> me

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
close to forty percent chance to get me

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.780 
close to forty percent chance to get me
in<00:04:51.240> each<00:04:51.450> game<00:04:51.810> next<00:04:52.620> year<00:04:52.770> anything<00:04:53.640> else
