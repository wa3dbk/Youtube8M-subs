oh<00:01:03.359> i<00:01:03.780> guess<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.470> little<00:01:04.710> flick

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
oh i guess it is just a little flick

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.440 
oh i guess it is just a little flick
kick<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.489> gets<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> head<00:01:05.850> off<00:01:05.970> which

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
kick then that gets the head off which

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.340 
kick then that gets the head off which
is<00:01:06.600> pretty<00:01:06.689> cool<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.140> wouldn't

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
is pretty cool because you wouldn't

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
is pretty cool because you wouldn't
expect<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.710> level<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.580> speed<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.630> head

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
expect that level of speed get the head

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.810 
expect that level of speed get the head
off<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.049> clearly<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.530> does<00:01:10.710> considering<00:01:11.220> jf

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
off but clearly it does considering jf

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550 
off but clearly it does considering jf
said<00:01:12.000> there's<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.390> seen<00:01:13.020> better<00:01:13.170> days<00:01:13.320> I

think<00:01:13.830> there's<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> skeet<00:01:14.310> coming<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.820> well

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
think there's a skeet coming up as well

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.920 
think there's a skeet coming up as well
so<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> try<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.659> keep<00:01:15.720> an<00:01:15.840> eye<00:01:15.900> on

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
so do want to try and keep an eye on

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
so do want to try and keep an eye on
down<00:01:16.140> skippy<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.619> what's<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.070> so

i<00:02:44.070> think<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.850> although<00:02:45.210> there<00:02:45.330> are

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
i think that's it although there are

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.940 
i think that's it although there are
hundred<00:02:45.720> frames<00:02:46.170> level<00:02:46.500> yeah<00:02:46.620> i<00:02:46.650> think<00:02:46.800> this

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
hundred frames level yeah i think this

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.580 
hundred frames level yeah i think this
might<00:02:47.100> be<00:02:47.130> pause<00:02:47.370> yeah<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.990> flip<00:02:48.990> which<00:02:49.350> looks

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
might be pause yeah and flip which looks

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.110 
might be pause yeah and flip which looks
great<00:02:49.890> especially<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.490> slow<00:02:50.700> motion<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.500> and

a<00:03:14.400> lot<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.880> don't<00:03:14.970> think<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.750> don't

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
a lot of I don't think is it I don't

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.330 
a lot of I don't think is it I don't
think<00:03:16.020> it's<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> single<00:03:16.530> dismember<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.070> replay

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
think it's a single dismember in replay

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.100 
think it's a single dismember in replay
fiserv<00:03:17.700> off<00:03:17.850> memory<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.810> like

a<00:03:19.320> example<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.430> skill<00:03:20.820> this<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.120> just<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.390> pretty

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
a example of skill this is just a pretty

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.080 
a example of skill this is just a pretty
cool<00:03:22.290> thing<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:23.130> was<00:03:23.310> done<00:03:23.490> from<00:03:23.700> this<00:03:23.880> angle

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
cool thing that was done from this angle

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.520 
cool thing that was done from this angle
and<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:24.720> thought<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.990> had<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.140> place<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
and I just thought it had a place in the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.710 
and I just thought it had a place in the
show<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.310> backflip<00:03:26.760> Lancel<00:03:27.390> jet<00:03:27.540> said

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
show this is a backflip Lancel jet said

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.990 
show this is a backflip Lancel jet said
lands<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.440> Jeff's<00:03:28.650> head<00:03:28.830> also<00:03:29.100> i<00:03:29.250> think<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.460> RC

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
lands on Jeff's head also i think the RC

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.070 
lands on Jeff's head also i think the RC
thing<00:03:30.210> is<00:03:30.330> supposed<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.600> imply<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.930> when

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
thing is supposed to imply that when

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.690 
thing is supposed to imply that when
sparta<00:03:31.380> touches<00:03:31.710> him<00:03:31.860> he<00:03:32.010> then<00:03:32.160> has<00:03:32.310> control

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
sparta touches him he then has control

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.940 
sparta touches him he then has control
over<00:03:32.730> Jeff<00:03:33.120> like<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.810> said<00:03:33.930> notice<00:03:34.380> members<00:03:34.740> but

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
over Jeff like I said notice members but

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.040 
over Jeff like I said notice members but
it<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.220> just<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.520> testament<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.210> just<00:03:36.360> awesome

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
it is just a testament to just awesome

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.200

balance<00:03:37.380> back<00:03:37.740> on<00:03:38.040> jets<00:03:38.370> head<00:03:38.550> looks<00:03:39.000> cool

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210

balance back on jets head looks cool
yeah<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.540> think<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.870> leaps<00:03:40.110> Jeff<00:03:40.380> just<00:03:40.530> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
yeah I think you leaps Jeff just a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.870 
yeah I think you leaps Jeff just a
little<00:03:40.890> bit<00:03:41.040> there<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.280> still<00:03:41.640> think<00:03:41.820> it

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
little bit there but I still think it

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.520 
little bit there but I still think it
has<00:03:42.270> a<00:03:42.300> place<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.720> know<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.260> unique

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
has a place you know it's a unique

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.380 
has a place you know it's a unique

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
actually this is actually one of my

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.880 
actually this is actually one of my
favorite<00:04:11.970> uses<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.690> particles<00:04:13.140> I've<00:04:13.260> seen<00:04:13.440> its

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
favorite uses of particles I've seen its

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.949 
favorite uses of particles I've seen its
kind<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.280> subtle<00:04:14.490> use<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.060> particles<00:04:15.600> not<00:04:15.810> it

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
kind of subtle use of particles not it

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.930 
kind of subtle use of particles not it
doesn't<00:04:16.170> obscure<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.859> action<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.489> does

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
doesn't obscure the action and does

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.460 
doesn't obscure the action and does
actually<00:04:18.150> look<00:04:18.330> pretty<00:04:18.450> damn<00:04:18.989> cool<00:04:19.230> so<00:04:19.440> let's

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
actually look pretty damn cool so let's

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.840 
actually look pretty damn cool so let's
take<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.709> look<00:04:19.830> at<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:19.950> replay<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.340> mean<00:04:20.700> I<00:04:20.760> this

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
take a look at the replay I mean I this

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.390 
take a look at the replay I mean I this
isn't<00:04:21.239> fucking<00:04:21.510> toribash<00:04:22.109> skin<00:04:22.590> judging<00:04:23.160> so<00:04:23.340> I

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
isn't fucking toribash skin judging so I

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.350 
isn't fucking toribash skin judging so I
don't<00:04:23.520> really<00:04:23.610> know<00:04:23.760> I'm<00:04:23.880> bringing<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.240> up

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
don't really know I'm bringing that up

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.240 
don't really know I'm bringing that up
but<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.720> have<00:04:25.080> had<00:04:25.229> an<00:04:25.350> issue<00:04:25.500> with<00:04:25.710> particles

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
but I have had an issue with particles

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.810 
but I have had an issue with particles
in<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.370> past

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
in the past

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.520 
in the past
I<00:04:26.850> do<00:04:27.090> feel<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.450> this<00:04:28.200> would<00:04:28.290> be<00:04:28.410> an<00:04:28.500> example

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
I do feel like this would be an example

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.930 
I do feel like this would be an example
of<00:04:28.860> something<00:04:29.010> using<00:04:29.280> particles<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.790> their

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
of something using particles to their

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.490 
of something using particles to their
best<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.300> did<00:04:30.480> not<00:04:30.690> watch<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:30.930> replay

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
best and I did not watch that replay

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.560 
best and I did not watch that replay
that<00:04:31.650> time<00:04:31.800> um<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.880> know<00:04:32.970> now<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.360> I've

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
that time um you know now that I've

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.120 
that time um you know now that I've

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
some people really do this I wouldn't

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.110 
some people really do this I wouldn't

think of a catch phrase I'm stalling for
time<00:04:50.790> because<00:04:51.240> I'm<00:04:51.300> trying<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.540> think<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.720> a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
time because I'm trying to think of a

time because I'm trying to think of a
catch<00:04:51.960> phrase<00:04:52.110> that's<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:52.530> rhymes<00:04:53.130> with

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
catch phrase that's like rhymes with

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.460 
catch phrase that's like rhymes with
particles<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:53.970> could<00:04:54.120> use<00:04:54.300> like<00:04:54.390> don't<00:04:55.290> be

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
particles that I could use like don't be

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.320 
particles that I could use like don't be
a<00:04:55.500> party<00:04:56.430> pooper<00:04:57.500> hold<00:04:58.500> down<00:04:58.710> your<00:04:59.330> particles

this<00:05:14.970> under<00:05:15.240> wraps<00:05:15.270> now<00:05:15.630> this<00:05:15.960> is<00:05:16.080> like<00:05:16.170> the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
this under wraps now this is like the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.630 
this under wraps now this is like the
sixth<00:05:16.680> time<00:05:16.710> in<00:05:16.920> watching<00:05:17.130> this<00:05:17.340> repo<00:05:17.580> and

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
sixth time in watching this repo and

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.340 
sixth time in watching this repo and
let's<00:05:17.790> actually<00:05:17.940> do<00:05:18.210> what's<00:05:18.360> going<00:05:18.480> on<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:19.290> we

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
let's actually do what's going on so we

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.590 
let's actually do what's going on so we
have<00:05:19.470> kind<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.740> like<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.860> backwards<00:05:20.760> kicked<00:05:21.060> by

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
have kind of like a backwards kicked by

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.660 
have kind of like a backwards kicked by
to<00:05:21.660> get<00:05:21.870> Jeff<00:05:22.080> there<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.470> sort<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.830> chop<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.640> the

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
to get Jeff there a sort of chop to the

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.430 
to get Jeff there a sort of chop to the
neck<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:24.060> D<00:05:24.210> capsim<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.750> you<00:05:25.020> know<00:05:25.140> i<00:05:25.170> love

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
neck the D capsim and you know i love

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.990 
neck the D capsim and you know i love
the<00:05:25.560> replays<00:05:25.860> where<00:05:26.010> jess<00:05:26.220> head<00:05:26.460> stays<00:05:26.760> in<00:05:26.940> the

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
the replays where jess head stays in the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.310 
the replays where jess head stays in the
same<00:05:27.150> place<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.540> his<00:05:27.660> body<00:05:27.870> goes<00:05:28.110> somewhere

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
same place and his body goes somewhere

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
same place and his body goes somewhere
else<00:05:28.470> so<00:05:28.590> let's<00:05:28.740> take<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.890> look<00:05:29.040> at<00:05:29.100> this<00:05:29.190> from

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
else so let's take a look at this from

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.670 
else so let's take a look at this from
well<00:05:29.760> that's<00:05:30.030> not<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.240> great<00:05:30.450> side<00:05:30.750> I'm<00:05:31.170> the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
well that's not a great side I'm the

something<00:06:43.320> this<00:06:43.530> challenge<00:06:43.950> two<00:06:44.370> weeks<00:06:44.639> does

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
something this challenge two weeks does

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.490 
something this challenge two weeks does
seem<00:06:45.240> to<00:06:45.270> be<00:06:45.389> a<00:06:45.480> really<00:06:45.810> good<00:06:45.900> time<00:06:46.110> for<00:06:46.380> him<00:06:46.470> to

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
seem to be a really good time for him to

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.810 
seem to be a really good time for him to
set<00:06:46.830> the<00:06:46.919> challenge<00:06:47.220> and<00:06:47.310> it's<00:06:47.430> like<00:06:47.550> I<00:06:47.580> said

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
set the challenge and it's like I said

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.340 
set the challenge and it's like I said
last<00:06:47.940> week<00:06:48.030> we<00:06:48.210> had<00:06:48.240> a<00:06:48.389> lot<00:06:48.690> more<00:06:48.870> replays<00:06:49.230> than

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
last week we had a lot more replays than

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.020 
last week we had a lot more replays than
we<00:06:49.410> normally<00:06:49.530> do<00:06:49.800> for<00:06:49.919> replay<00:06:50.190> challenge<00:06:50.220> so<00:06:51.000> I

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
we normally do for replay challenge so I

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.460 
we normally do for replay challenge so I
think<00:06:51.120> this<00:06:51.300> standard<00:06:51.810> from<00:06:51.930> now<00:06:52.080> on<00:06:52.260> will<00:06:52.440> be

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
think this standard from now on will be

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.670 
think this standard from now on will be
a<00:06:52.560> two<00:06:52.800> week<00:06:53.040> tour<00:06:53.700> bus<00:06:53.880> crashed<00:06:54.150> um<00:06:54.419> I<00:06:55.020> suppose

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
a two week tour bus crashed um I suppose
