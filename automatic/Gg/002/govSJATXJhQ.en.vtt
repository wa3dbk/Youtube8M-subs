comic ridiculous but and this will give
you<00:01:09.310> an<00:01:09.399> idea<00:01:09.429> of<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.850> footprint<00:01:10.329> that<00:01:10.450> I'm

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
you an idea of the footprint that I'm

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:11.429 
you an idea of the footprint that I'm
looking<00:01:10.749> for

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
looking for

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.239 
looking for
well<00:01:12.069> should<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:14.530> things<00:01:14.799> gonna<00:01:15.069> go

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
well should these things gonna go

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:23.039 
well should these things gonna go
rolling<00:01:15.640> everywhere<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:18.189> should<00:01:18.249> be<00:01:21.899> let<00:01:22.899> me

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
rolling everywhere it should be let me

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.559 
rolling everywhere it should be let me
just<00:01:23.259> stop<00:01:23.469> those<00:01:23.649> rolling<00:01:24.039> away<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:25.270> will<00:01:25.389> be

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
just stop those rolling away it will be

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.859 
just stop those rolling away it will be
something<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:25.929> this<00:01:26.289> right<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:28.479> that's

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
something like this right that's that's

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.039 
something like this right that's that's
the<00:01:29.049> width<00:01:29.289> that<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:29.979> brought<00:01:30.389> these<00:01:31.389> X's<00:01:31.869> are

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
the width that I brought these X's are

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.289 
the width that I brought these X's are
the<00:01:32.109> a<00:01:32.709> seafood<00:01:33.130> rifle<00:01:33.549> nestle's<00:01:33.969> I've<00:01:34.090> made

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
the a seafood rifle nestle's I've made

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.889 
the a seafood rifle nestle's I've made
these<00:01:34.420> little<00:01:36.240> attachments<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.359> go<00:01:37.479> here

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
these little attachments to go here

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.319 
these little attachments to go here
these<00:01:38.740> are<00:01:38.979> twenty<00:01:39.189> five<00:01:39.429> to<00:01:39.670> one<00:01:39.700> reduction

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
these are twenty five to one reduction

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.209 
these are twenty five to one reduction
ratio<00:01:40.749> the<00:01:41.380> reason<00:01:41.619> I<00:01:41.679> brought<00:01:41.829> these<00:01:42.009> is

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
ratio the reason I brought these is

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.620 
ratio the reason I brought these is
because<00:01:42.399> they<00:01:42.520> lock<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.329> don't<00:01:43.509> have

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
because they lock and you don't have

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.319 
because they lock and you don't have
power<00:01:43.869> on<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.920> don't<00:01:45.490> go<00:01:45.729> nowhere

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
power on they don't go nowhere

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.080 
power on they don't go nowhere
and<00:01:46.799> when<00:01:47.799> I<00:01:47.889> first<00:01:48.130> came<00:01:48.490> up<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.759> idea<00:01:49.029> of

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
and when I first came up the idea of

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.669 
and when I first came up the idea of
dermis<00:01:49.420> truck<00:01:49.659> I<00:01:49.869> was<00:01:50.049> going<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.259> use<00:01:50.409> it<00:01:50.439> as<00:01:50.649> a

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
dermis truck I was going to use it as a

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.629 
dermis truck I was going to use it as a
tow<00:01:51.100> truck<00:01:51.159> or<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:52.229> utility<00:01:53.229> vehicle<00:01:53.859> for<00:01:54.189> the

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
tow truck or a utility vehicle for the

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.690 
tow truck or a utility vehicle for the
trail<00:01:54.999> tracks<00:01:55.299> that<00:01:55.539> we<00:01:55.689> ran<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:56.950> wanted

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
trail tracks that we ran so I wanted

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.699 
trail tracks that we ran so I wanted
when<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.479> thing<00:01:58.689> wasn't<00:01:58.869> moving<00:01:59.139> I<00:01:59.380> didn't

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
when this thing wasn't moving I didn't

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.989 
when this thing wasn't moving I didn't
want<00:01:59.829> it<00:01:59.889> to<00:02:00.009> roll<00:02:00.959> so<00:02:01.959> I<00:02:01.990> went<00:02:02.319> for<00:02:02.469> these<00:02:02.649> and

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:10.400 

the<00:02:06.999> front<00:02:07.359> wheels<00:02:07.869> are<00:02:08.229> about<00:02:08.470> here<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.310> don't

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the front wheels are about here I don't

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.940 
the front wheels are about here I don't
see<00:02:10.680> that<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.040> camera<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.380> really<00:02:13.770> not

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
see that in camera this is really not

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.690 
see that in camera this is really not
working<00:02:14.250> very<00:02:14.430> well<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:14.970> all<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:18.470> front<00:02:19.700> first

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
working very well at all so front first

floating<00:02:32.460> around<00:02:32.540> but<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.320> get<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> idea

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
floating around but you get the idea

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.230

they all will be approximately lined up

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.680 
they all will be approximately lined up

this indicates the cab the truck cab and
these<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.250> two<00:02:50.490> rails<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.290> chassis

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
these are the two rails of the chassis

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.100 
these are the two rails of the chassis
that<00:02:52.890> are<00:02:53.100> going<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.340> go<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:54.600> these<00:02:54.870> are<00:02:55.020> going

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
that are going to go and these are going

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.360 
that are going to go and these are going
to<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.290> mounted<00:02:55.620> two<00:02:56.630> at<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.900> moment<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.710> hand

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
to be mounted two at the moment on hand

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.330 
to be mounted two at the moment on hand
I'm<00:02:59.490> putting<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.940> transfer<00:03:00.980> case<00:03:01.980> between

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
I'm putting a transfer case between

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.770 
I'm putting a transfer case between
these<00:03:02.850> two<00:03:03.120> instead<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.630> running<00:03:05.780> through

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
these two instead of running through

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.430 
these two instead of running through
here<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:08.600> may<00:03:09.600> or<00:03:09.750> may<00:03:09.870> not<00:03:09.900> do<00:03:10.260> that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
here like that I may or may not do that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.000 
here like that I may or may not do that
we'll<00:03:10.950> see<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:14.600> because<00:03:15.600> it's<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.840> two<00:03:16.080> four

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
we'll see and I because it's a two four

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.900 
we'll see and I because it's a two four
by<00:03:17.040> six

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
by six

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.449 
by six
I<00:03:17.940> thought<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.570> steering<00:03:19.020> word<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.220> all

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
I thought the steering word with the all

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.000 
I thought the steering word with the all
this<00:03:20.640> rubber<00:03:21.090> here<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:22.050> would<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.590> sleep

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
this rubber here that would just sleep

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.590 
this rubber here that would just sleep
when<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> tried<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.700> steer<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.209> that's<00:03:24.390> why<00:03:24.570> I

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
when I tried to steer so that's why I

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.090 
when I tried to steer so that's why I
went<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.990> rear<00:03:25.170> steer<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.770> that's<00:03:25.980> why

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
went for a rear steer and that's why

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.750 
went for a rear steer and that's why
these<00:03:26.160> axles<00:03:26.760> are<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.030> far<00:03:27.360> apart<00:03:27.510> hold<00:03:28.320> on<00:03:28.760> so

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
these axles are so far apart hold on so

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.760 
these axles are so far apart hold on so
that<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.120> will<00:03:30.240> allow<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.870> little<00:03:31.200> bit<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.560> this

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
that it will allow a little bit of this

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.070 
that it will allow a little bit of this
I<00:03:32.130> don't<00:03:32.850> know<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.270> going<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.510> work<00:03:33.570> it

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
I don't know if it's going to work it

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.930 
I don't know if it's going to work it
might<00:03:34.350> bind<00:03:34.650> up<00:03:34.920> because<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.310> these<00:03:35.400> wind<00:03:35.670> rise

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
might bind up because of these wind rise

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.570 
might bind up because of these wind rise
I<00:03:36.330> don't<00:03:36.870> know<00:03:36.959> I'm<00:03:37.650> making<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.340> so

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
I don't know I'm making this up so

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
I don't know I'm making this up so

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
this into something quite cold the cab

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.990 
this into something quite cold the cab
will<00:04:00.600> be<00:04:00.709> still<00:04:02.120> homemade<00:04:03.120> steel<00:04:03.390> cab<00:04:04.970> get<00:04:05.970> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
will be still homemade steel cab get a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.570 
will be still homemade steel cab get a
mold<00:04:06.330> sheet<00:04:06.600> steel<00:04:06.870> it's<00:04:07.530> going<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.830> have<00:04:08.070> as

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
mold sheet steel it's going to have as

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.860 
mold sheet steel it's going to have as
it's<00:04:09.120> going<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.360> look<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:11.239> 40s<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.420> 50s

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
it's going to look like a 40s to 50s

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.740 
it's going to look like a 40s to 50s
military<00:04:13.590> trucks<00:04:14.190> sort<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.150> GNC<00:04:15.720> or

Studebaker or the Russian ones you know

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.210 
Studebaker or the Russian ones you know
it's<00:04:19.229> not<00:04:19.620> going<00:04:19.770> to<00:04:19.830> be<00:04:19.919> anything<00:04:20.039> in

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
it's not going to be anything in

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.760 
it's not going to be anything in
particular<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:20.880> just<00:04:21.090> going<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.330> be<00:04:21.479> a

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
particular it's just going to be a

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.640 
particular it's just going to be a
cool<00:04:23.430> well<00:04:23.580> truck<00:04:23.940> with<00:04:24.210> split<00:04:25.080> front<00:04:25.349> window

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
cool well truck with split front window

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.730 
cool well truck with split front window
screens<00:04:26.009> and<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.840> things<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.110> opening

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
screens and and things like that opening

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.450 
screens and and things like that opening
doors<00:04:28.979> hopefully<00:04:29.490> but<00:04:29.750> we'll<00:04:30.750> see<00:04:30.930> how<00:04:31.110> we<00:04:31.169> go

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.020 

so<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.550> can<00:04:35.729> see<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.590> size<00:04:37.590> will<00:04:38.030> this

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
so you can see that the size will this

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.149 
so you can see that the size will this
will<00:04:39.180> be<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.419> problem<00:04:39.599> size<00:04:39.990> here<00:04:40.590> of<00:04:40.830> the

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
will be the problem size here of the

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.230 
will be the problem size here of the
track<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.990> will<00:04:43.110> be<00:04:43.490> I'm<00:04:44.490> not<00:04:44.699> too<00:04:44.849> sure<00:04:45.090> what

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
track it will be I'm not too sure what

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.499 
track it will be I'm not too sure what
it'll<00:04:45.419> be<00:04:45.539> maybe<00:04:45.990> about<00:04:46.259> 2<00:04:46.560> foot<00:04:46.860> long<00:04:47.300> one<00:04:48.300> and

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
it'll be maybe about 2 foot long one and

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.100 
it'll be maybe about 2 foot long one and
a<00:04:48.629> half<00:04:48.840> maybe<00:04:49.229> and<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:51.060> don't<00:04:51.330> know<00:04:51.539> a<00:04:51.569> scale<00:04:51.930> it

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
a half maybe and I don't know a scale it

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.610 
a half maybe and I don't know a scale it
as<00:04:52.259> I'm<00:04:53.220> not<00:04:53.400> too<00:04:53.580> interested<00:04:53.879> in<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.620> it'll

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
as I'm not too interested in that it'll
