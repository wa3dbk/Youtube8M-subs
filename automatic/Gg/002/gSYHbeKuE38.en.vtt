00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.390 
go back to when there was supposed to be
a<00:03:30.240> third<00:03:30.660> person<00:03:31.230> Call<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.470> Duty<00:03:31.800> set<00:03:32.160> in<00:03:32.310> the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
a third person Call of Duty set in the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.090 
a third person Call of Duty set in the
Vietnam<00:03:32.820> era<00:03:33.200> isn't<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.410> odd<00:03:34.620> that

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
Vietnam era isn't it odd that

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.070 
Vietnam era isn't it odd that
sledgehammer<00:03:35.430> games<00:03:35.760> was<00:03:36.210> tasked<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.660> making

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
sledgehammer games was tasked to making

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.710 
sledgehammer games was tasked to making
a<00:03:37.170> third<00:03:37.410> person<00:03:37.890> Cod<00:03:38.130> with<00:03:38.820> no<00:03:39.060> experience<00:03:39.540> of

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
a third person Cod with no experience of

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.050 
a third person Cod with no experience of
that<00:03:39.870> timeline<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.680> only<00:03:40.980> helping<00:03:41.460> with

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
that timeline and only helping with

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.810 
that timeline and only helping with
modern<00:03:42.480> warfare<00:03:42.660> 3<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.920> doesn't<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.340> seem<00:03:44.580> odd

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
modern warfare 3 so doesn't it seem odd

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.700 
modern warfare 3 so doesn't it seem odd
that<00:03:44.850> Activision<00:03:45.540> would<00:03:45.750> make<00:03:45.990> them<00:03:46.320> cancel

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
that Activision would make them cancel

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.740 
that Activision would make them cancel
that<00:03:47.130> call<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.520> duty<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:47.940> favor<00:03:48.240> of<00:03:48.450> another

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
that call of duty in favor of another

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.360 
that call of duty in favor of another
one

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
one

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.710 
one
what<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.490> another<00:03:50.760> studio<00:03:51.210> that<00:03:51.570> has

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
what is another studio that has

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.610 
what is another studio that has
experienced<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.500> timeline<00:03:53.480> trail<00:03:54.620> so

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
experienced in that timeline trail so

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.710 
experienced in that timeline trail so
what<00:03:56.010> if<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.280> reason<00:03:56.430> why<00:03:56.700> zombies<00:03:57.210> ended<00:03:57.570> so

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
what if the reason why zombies ended so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.510 
what if the reason why zombies ended so
abruptly<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:58.440> because<00:03:58.860> they<00:03:59.040> were<00:03:59.100> tasked

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
abruptly is because they were tasked

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.640 
abruptly is because they were tasked
with<00:03:59.760> finishing<00:04:00.270> that<00:04:00.630> third<00:04:00.990> person<00:04:01.230> Call<00:04:01.620> of

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
with finishing that third person Call of

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.310 
with finishing that third person Call of
Duty<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.220> mean<00:04:02.760> think<00:04:03.000> about<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.270> a<00:04:03.600> third

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
Duty I mean think about it a third

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.430 
Duty I mean think about it a third
person<00:04:04.830> Cod<00:04:05.100> would<00:04:06.030> be<00:04:06.260> revolutionary

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
person Cod would be revolutionary

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.010 
person Cod would be revolutionary
if<00:04:07.650> advanced<00:04:08.250> warfare<00:04:08.670> fails<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.390> deliver<00:04:09.540> and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
if advanced warfare fails to deliver and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.110 
if advanced warfare fails to deliver and
I<00:04:10.170> think<00:04:10.410> Activision<00:04:11.010> knows<00:04:11.220> call<00:04:11.610> duty<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.970> on

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
I think Activision knows call duty is on

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.160 
I think Activision knows call duty is on
its<00:04:12.270> last<00:04:12.330> legs

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
its last legs

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.920 
its last legs
so<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.830> really<00:04:14.310> change<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.760> series<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.600> final

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
so to really change the series the final

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.050 
so to really change the series the final
action<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:16.710> be<00:04:16.830> made<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.340> take<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.940> to

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
action that can be made is to take it to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.900 
action that can be made is to take it to
third<00:04:18.330> person<00:04:18.690> if<00:04:19.350> making<00:04:19.830> exosuits<00:04:20.520> can't

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
third person if making exosuits can't

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.300 
third person if making exosuits can't
save<00:04:21.210> the<00:04:21.390> series<00:04:21.810> maybe<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.620> third<00:04:22.860> person

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
save the series maybe a third person

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.730 
save the series maybe a third person
Call<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.520> Duty<00:04:23.850> will<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.420> mean<00:04:25.020> think<00:04:25.290> about<00:04:25.380> it

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
Call of Duty will I mean think about it

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.590 
Call of Duty will I mean think about it
Treyarch<00:04:26.100> put<00:04:26.310> too<00:04:26.520> much<00:04:26.670> effort<00:04:26.940> into<00:04:27.300> the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
Treyarch put too much effort into the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.210 
Treyarch put too much effort into the
zombies<00:04:27.960> storyline<00:04:28.140> for<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.860> end<00:04:29.010> there

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
zombies storyline for it to end there
