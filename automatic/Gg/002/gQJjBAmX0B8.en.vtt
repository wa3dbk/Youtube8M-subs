enabler<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.620> blocks<00:00:46.890> won't<00:00:47.340> fall<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
enabler so the blocks won't fall if it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
enabler so the blocks won't fall if it
is<00:00:48.719> connected<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.379> two<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:50.039> blocks<00:00:50.370> by

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
is connected to two or more blocks by

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.080 
is connected to two or more blocks by
side<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.320> attached<00:00:52.710> dialect<00:00:53.250> directly

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
side or it is attached dialect directly

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
side or it is attached dialect directly
to<00:00:54.300> our<00:00:54.329> wall<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.629> build<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.469> same<00:00:58.680> as

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to our wall so you can build the same as

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.430 
to our wall so you can build the same as
before<00:00:59.059> but<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.210> will<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.570> bit<00:01:00.780> harder<00:01:01.260> so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
before but it will be a bit harder so

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.709 
before but it will be a bit harder so
you<00:01:01.559> need<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:01.980> more<00:01:02.190> stuff<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> build<00:01:03.059> like

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you need to do more stuff to build like

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.550 
you need to do more stuff to build like
you<00:01:03.870> did<00:01:04.049> before<00:01:05.510> exceptions<00:01:06.560> inventory

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
you did before exceptions inventory

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.250 
you did before exceptions inventory
blocks<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> non<00:01:08.400> keep<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.360> non<00:01:09.869> cubes

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
blocks and non keep up and non cubes

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.690 
blocks and non keep up and non cubes
don't<00:01:10.710> fall<00:01:11.119> leaves<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.450> plants<00:01:12.600> don't<00:01:13.020> fall

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
don't fall leaves and plants don't fall

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.429 
don't fall leaves and plants don't fall
oakwood<00:01:14.700> has<00:01:15.030> specially<00:01:15.540> hanging<00:01:15.960> rules<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
oakwood has specially hanging rules to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.730 
oakwood has specially hanging rules to
prevent<00:01:16.619> corruption<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:19.070> big<00:01:20.070> trees<00:01:21.740> sequoia

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
prevent corruption of big trees sequoia

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.920 
prevent corruption of big trees sequoia
would<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.939> especially<00:01:24.479> special<00:01:25.200> rules<00:01:25.830> too

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
would use especially special rules too

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.929 
would use especially special rules too
so<00:01:27.930> they<00:01:28.170> let<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.500> chop<00:01:28.530> whole<00:01:29.159> sequoia<00:01:29.610> from

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
so they let you chop whole sequoia from

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
so they let you chop whole sequoia from
ground<00:01:30.210> other<00:01:30.659> night<00:01:30.840> what's<00:01:30.990> acquire<00:01:31.380> with

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
ground other night what's acquire with

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.940 
ground other night what's acquire with
is<00:01:32.400> i<00:01:32.700> guess<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> new<00:01:34.110> jangle<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.740> but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
is i guess it's the new jangle one but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.179 
is i guess it's the new jangle one but
i'm<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.250> sure<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.439> soul<00:01:37.439> sound<00:01:37.680> does<00:01:37.979> not

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
i'm not sure and soul sound does not

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.270 
i'm not sure and soul sound does not
fall<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.229> use<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.829> helper

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
fall at all so you can use it for helper

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.399 
fall at all so you can use it for helper
bridges<00:01:42.799> mmm<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:44.340> also<00:01:44.579> well<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.600> mod<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
bridges mmm they also well the mod the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.569 
bridges mmm they also well the mod the
developer<00:01:47.070> added<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:48.470> night<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.770> cold<00:01:50.040> wet

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
developer added a night and cold wet

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.120 
developer added a night and cold wet
sand<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.290> i'm<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> show<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.770> how<00:01:52.979> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
sand so i'm going to show you how it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.070 
sand so i'm going to show you how it
works

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
works

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.789 
works
so<00:01:56.080> once<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.040> once<00:01:57.850> there<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.240> water<00:01:58.799> near

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
so once you once there is a water near

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.520 
so once you once there is a water near
sand<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.869> sound<00:02:02.170> gets<00:02:02.530> wet<00:02:03.060> obviously<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
sand the sound gets wet obviously and it

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.340 
sand the sound gets wet obviously and it
creates<00:02:06.070> an<00:02:06.430> item<00:02:07.649> let<00:02:08.649> me<00:02:08.770> do<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.100> cold<00:02:10.350> wet

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
creates an item let me do get cold wet

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
creates an item let me do get cold wet
sand<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.690> item<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:14.500> enables<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
sand so this item and now enables you to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.030 
sand so this item and now enables you to
build<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:17.040> well<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.250> build<00:02:18.400> sandcastles<00:02:19.150> so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
build in well to build sandcastles so

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.690 
build in well to build sandcastles so
with<00:02:21.959> with<00:02:23.220> sand<00:02:24.750> normal<00:02:25.750> sound<00:02:26.489> you're<00:02:27.489> not

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
with with sand normal sound you're not

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.390 
with with sand normal sound you're not
able<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.720> for<00:02:28.989> example<00:02:32.130> I'm<00:02:33.130> sorry

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
able to do this for example I'm sorry

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.750 
able to do this for example I'm sorry
you're<00:02:34.150> not<00:02:34.209> able<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.920> sand<00:02:36.370> here

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
you're not able to have sand here

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.850 
you're not able to have sand here
without<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.480> falling<00:02:37.750> because<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.709> always

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
without it falling because it always

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.699 
without it falling because it always
falls<00:02:39.239> because<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.600> gravity<00:02:40.989> but<00:02:41.590> with

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
falls because of the gravity but with

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:50.009 
falls because of the gravity but with
wet<00:02:41.920> sand<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.910> can<00:02:43.150> do<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:49.300> that's<00:02:49.870> how

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
wet sand you can do this so that's how

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.370 
wet sand you can do this so that's how
it<00:02:50.170> lets<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:51.060> it's<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.180> bit<00:02:52.330> weird<00:02:52.510> that's<00:02:53.140> how

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
it lets you it's a bit weird that's how

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.810 
it lets you it's a bit weird that's how
it<00:02:53.500> lets<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:53.950> build<00:02:54.910> sandcastles<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.700> can

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
it lets you build sandcastles so you can

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.660 
it lets you build sandcastles so you can
have<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.180> like<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.549> build

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
have this like this and you can build

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.990 
have this like this and you can build
sand<00:03:03.940> castles<00:03:04.000> with<00:03:04.540> wet<00:03:05.320> sand<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.670> that's<00:03:06.850> how

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
sand castles with wet sand so that's how

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.140 
sand castles with wet sand so that's how
it<00:03:07.150> works<00:03:08.790> now<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:11.459> developer<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.670> really

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
it works now the developer is a really

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.360

with Santa gets wet sand I showed you or
porter<00:05:33.770> on<00:05:33.919> to<00:05:34.070> dry<00:05:34.250> sand<00:05:34.580> wet<00:05:35.330> sand<00:05:35.630> uses<00:05:36.050> the

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
porter on to dry sand wet sand uses the

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.540 
porter on to dry sand wet sand uses the
hanging<00:05:36.560> rules<00:05:36.800> described<00:05:37.310> above<00:05:38.229> so<00:05:39.280> it<00:05:40.280> uses

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
hanging rules described above so it uses

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.550 
hanging rules described above so it uses
if<00:05:40.880> there<00:05:41.060> is<00:05:41.150> a<00:05:41.180> block<00:05:41.450> next<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:42.080> two

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
if there is a block next to it two

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.140 
if there is a block next to it two
blocks<00:05:42.740> next<00:05:43.070> to<00:05:43.160> it<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.430> it<00:05:43.580> doesn't<00:05:43.970> fall

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
blocks next to it and it doesn't fall

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.969 
blocks next to it and it doesn't fall
