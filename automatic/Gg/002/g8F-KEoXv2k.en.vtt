hey so I've told you about our drainage
problem<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.980> backyard<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:06.109> how<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.140> was

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
problem in the backyard and how I was

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.470 
problem in the backyard and how I was
going<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.280> use<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.700> tiller<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:11.000> dig<00:00:12.000> either<00:00:12.330> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
going to use the tiller to dig either a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.870 
going to use the tiller to dig either a
swell<00:00:12.960> or<00:00:13.410> French<00:00:13.889> drains<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:15.350> I've<00:00:16.350> started

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
swell or French drains and I've started

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.529 
swell or French drains and I've started
I've<00:00:17.880> gotten<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.750> ditch<00:00:19.680> dug<00:00:20.520> around<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> yard

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
I've gotten a ditch dug around the yard

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.300 
I've gotten a ditch dug around the yard
and<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.990> thought<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> would<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.529> show<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.010> what

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and I thought I would just show you what

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.620 
and I thought I would just show you what
I've<00:00:23.430> done<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.670> far<00:00:25.609> by<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> way<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.300> rained

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
I've done so far by the way it rained

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960 
I've done so far by the way it rained
last<00:00:27.960> night<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.680> supposed<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.400> like

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
last night and it's supposed to be like

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.900 
last night and it's supposed to be like
a<00:00:30.150> record<00:00:30.539> rain<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.439> us<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.520> end<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
a record rain for us but the end of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.049 
a record rain for us but the end of
tonight<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.570> said<00:00:34.559> seven<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.130> eight<00:00:35.340> inches<00:00:35.790> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
tonight I said seven or eight inches of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.770 
tonight I said seven or eight inches of
rain<00:00:36.360> by<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> time<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.160> over<00:00:38.399> with

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
rain by the time this is all over with

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.869 
rain by the time this is all over with
but<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.170> tell<00:00:40.440> even<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.219> ditch

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
but you can tell even with this ditch

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.290 
but you can tell even with this ditch
obviously<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.989> catching<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.559> water<00:00:44.300> but

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
obviously it's catching the water but

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
obviously it's catching the water but
even<00:00:46.200> beyond<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> ditch<00:00:46.950> there's<00:00:47.340> water

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
even beyond the ditch there's water

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.880 
even beyond the ditch there's water
everywhere<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.450> our<00:00:48.539> backyard<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.530> I've<00:00:49.620> got

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
everywhere in our backyard so I've got

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.450 
everywhere in our backyard so I've got
to<00:00:50.010> figure<00:00:50.190> something<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:51.949> at<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.129> point

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
to figure something out at this point

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
to figure something out at this point
I'm<00:00:53.610> thinking<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.360> probably<00:00:54.809> need<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> French

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
I'm thinking I probably need a French

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.610 
I'm thinking I probably need a French
drain<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.370> way<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> street<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
drain all the way out to the street to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.670 
drain all the way out to the street to
carry<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.489> water<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:00.030> out<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> drainage

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
carry this water on out to the drainage

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.240 
carry this water on out to the drainage
system<00:01:02.809> but<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> ditch<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.650> does<00:01:04.979> seem

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
system but the ditch as it is does seem

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.320 
system but the ditch as it is does seem
like<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> works<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:07.549> it's<00:01:08.549> catching<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.030> lot<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
like it works the it's catching a lot of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
like it works the it's catching a lot of
water<00:01:09.540> from<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.320> other<00:01:10.439> side<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.920> fence

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
water from the other side of this fence

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.920 
water from the other side of this fence
on<00:01:11.490> our<00:01:11.850> neighbor's<00:01:12.150> yard<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.689> higher<00:01:12.900> than

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
on our neighbor's yard it's higher than

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.100 
on our neighbor's yard it's higher than
ours<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:15.330> one's<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:15.990> more

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
ours and this one's got a little more

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
ours and this one's got a little more
heel<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
heel to it so you can see it's not it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
heel to it so you can see it's not it
holding<00:01:18.960> water<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.009> other<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
holding water like that other one is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.920 
holding water like that other one is
until<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> very<00:01:21.060> end<00:01:23.150> I'm<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.180> sure<00:01:24.570> where<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
until the very end I'm not sure where to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
until the very end I'm not sure where to
take<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:26.990> one<00:01:27.990> idea<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.439> had<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.430> just

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
take this one one idea I had was to just

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.840 
take this one one idea I had was to just
dig<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:31.409> deep<00:01:31.619> pit<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.250> fill<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> with

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
dig a really deep pit and fill it with

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.770 
dig a really deep pit and fill it with
gravel<00:01:33.829> to<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> catch<00:01:35.670> basin<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.570> all

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
gravel to be like a catch basin for all

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.060 
gravel to be like a catch basin for all
of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> water<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.920> that'll

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
of the water I don't know if that'll

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.850 
of the water I don't know if that'll
work<00:01:41.280> or<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.259> my<00:01:43.259> goal<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:45.600> stop<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
work or not but my goal is to stop the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.300 
work or not but my goal is to stop the
sinkholes<00:01:47.630> I'm<00:01:48.710> thinking<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.070> they're

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
sinkholes I'm thinking that they're

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.120 
sinkholes I'm thinking that they're
probably<00:01:50.640> used<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> creek<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.229> drained

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
probably used to be a creek that drained

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.380 
probably used to be a creek that drained
into<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.670> area<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.560> graded<00:01:56.219> full<00:01:56.640> when

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
into this area that was graded full when

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.069 
into this area that was graded full when
the<00:01:57.509> neighborhood<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.340> created<00:01:59.930> but<00:02:00.930> we've

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the neighborhood was created but we've

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.889 
the neighborhood was created but we've
got<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> pretty<00:02:01.500> bad<00:02:02.040> sinkhole<00:02:02.790> right<00:02:03.060> here

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
got a pretty bad sinkhole right here

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.319 
got a pretty bad sinkhole right here
that's<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.829> reason<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:06.310> pool<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.939> sitting

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
that's the reason this pool is sitting

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.199 
that's the reason this pool is sitting
here<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:09.280> know<00:02:09.459> if<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.789> pick<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.090> up

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
here I don't know if I can pick it up

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.110 
here I don't know if I can pick it up
with<00:02:10.360> one<00:02:10.599> hand<00:02:13.379> but<00:02:14.379> you<00:02:14.860> can<00:02:15.069> see<00:02:15.370> it's

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
with one hand but you can see it's

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.710 
with one hand but you can see it's
pretty<00:02:16.330> dangerous<00:02:16.629> for<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> kids<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.569> I've

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
pretty dangerous for the kids so I've

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.100 
pretty dangerous for the kids so I've
got<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.989> figure<00:02:20.140> out<00:02:21.569> something<00:02:22.569> other<00:02:22.840> than

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
got to figure out something other than

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.860 
got to figure out something other than
just<00:02:23.910> covering<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> holes<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:28.360> anyways<00:02:28.720> I

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
just covering the holes and anyways I

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.539 
just covering the holes and anyways I
just<00:02:28.900> wanted<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.379> show<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.620> there's<00:02:30.310> another

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
just wanted to show you there's another

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.830 
just wanted to show you there's another
one<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:32.700> me<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.819> Jefferson<00:02:34.239> actually<00:02:34.390> had

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
one and me and Jefferson actually had

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.680 
one and me and Jefferson actually had
this<00:02:35.019> covered<00:02:35.410> with<00:02:36.340> dirt<00:02:36.610> yesterday<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.599> it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
this covered with dirt yesterday and it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.589 
this covered with dirt yesterday and it
has<00:02:37.870> sunk<00:02:38.230> again<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:39.970> think<00:02:40.060> there's<00:02:40.390> just

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
has sunk again so I think there's just

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.360 
has sunk again so I think there's just
so<00:02:40.870> much<00:02:41.110> water<00:02:41.380> coming<00:02:41.799> back<00:02:42.069> here<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:45.190> just

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
so much water coming back here we just

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.500 
so much water coming back here we just
got<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.579> figure<00:02:45.760> out<00:02:45.819> how<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.390> out<00:02:46.480> of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
got to figure out how to get it out of

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
got to figure out how to get it out of
our<00:02:46.660> backyard<00:02:48.540> all<00:02:49.540> right<00:02:49.660> we'll<00:02:50.049> talk<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.440> you

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
our backyard all right we'll talk to you

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.250 
our backyard all right we'll talk to you
later<00:02:50.650> but
