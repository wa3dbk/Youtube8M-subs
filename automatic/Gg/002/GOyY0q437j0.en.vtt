00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.980
 many people use adventure knives 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.090
 to cut wood is to cut pieces of 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.519
 wood to build fixed coats 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.230
 Among other things 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.410
 I particularly think this is a 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.210
 most suitable job for an ax in the 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.550
 least a machete 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.110
 I like doing this kind of activity. 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.600
 and split firewood with a knife only to 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.420
 test the equipment to see whether a 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.179
 actual emergency situation this knife 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.280
 will be able to endure a very stern job 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.719
 that you have a knife that will hold a 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.379
 heavier work 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.260
 It is interesting that you perform this 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.449
 work the way jude - the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.319
 equipment for making such 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.769
 activity 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:52.449
 make small wedges so you do not 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.139
 of both equipment 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.659
 look aa blow your knife exactly 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:01.420
 where it is supported by the wood 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.780
 you will cut out very carefully with the 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.780
 hands 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.000
 we wake up enough 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.000
 I can already break with my mother. 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.520
 thus saving on my equipment 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.860
 cracking firewood with a knife is a 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.500
 very simple but requires a lot of attention 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.659
 first of all it is not all kinds of 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.920
 knife that can handle severe treatment 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.850
 ideal for a funk knife or for the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.580
 less than the spike of the knife is to travel 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.450
 all interior of the cable 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.530
 secondly, care is taken to 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.110
 do not get hurt 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.840
 you can even hit your finger on the hand 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.630
 and laughed at her play in the woods 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.299
 It's over when you need a knife. 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.970
 very sharp and functional as less 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.739
 Heavy work, you'd better do it. 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.670
 You will be able to trust more in your 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.350
 equipment 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.120
