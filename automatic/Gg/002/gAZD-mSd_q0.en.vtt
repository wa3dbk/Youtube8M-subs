appear with one common trait and that is
they<00:01:15.340> have<00:01:15.369> very<00:01:15.579> little<00:01:16.359> melodic<00:01:17.109> value

instead<00:01:18.909> what<00:01:19.090> they<00:01:19.209> do<00:01:19.270> is<00:01:19.959> literally<00:01:20.499> stop

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009

licks well when it comes to these latter
lick<00:01:45.459> ideas<00:01:45.849> and<00:01:45.999> there's<00:01:46.119> some<00:01:46.240> common

lick ideas and there's some common

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.599 
lick ideas and there's some common
points<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.590> think<00:01:47.770> you're<00:01:48.009> important<00:01:48.520> to

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
points that I think you're important to

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.359

that you're in I mean you might have a

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.809 
that you're in I mean you might have a
couple<00:02:05.349> of<00:02:05.619> overlap<00:02:06.009> notes<00:02:06.279> let's<00:02:06.490> say<00:02:06.549> if<00:02:06.639> I'm

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
couple of overlap notes let's say if I'm

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.859 
couple of overlap notes let's say if I'm
an<00:02:06.969> a<00:02:07.149> major<00:02:08.670> you're<00:02:09.670> a

an a major you're a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.949 
an a major you're a
tones<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:11.430> gonna<00:02:11.519> have<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:12.030> ton<00:02:12.659> of<00:02:12.690> notes

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
tones you're gonna have a ton of notes

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.390

in<00:02:13.200> your<00:02:13.230> ladder<00:02:13.530> lick<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.280> don't

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
in your ladder lick that really don't

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.550 
in your ladder lick that really don't
relate<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.030> key<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.450> major<00:02:15.750> whatsoever

relate to the key of a major whatsoever

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.640 
relate to the key of a major whatsoever
in<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.069> particular<00:02:17.310> example<00:02:17.549> so<00:02:18.560> that's<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
in that particular example so that's the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.199 
in that particular example so that's the
idea<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:19.980> you'll<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.370> whack<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.730> notes<00:02:21.060> in

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
idea is you'll have a whack of notes in

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.970 
idea is you'll have a whack of notes in
there<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.599> do<00:02:21.780> not<00:02:21.810> relate<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.650> key<00:02:22.860> that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
there that do not relate to the key that

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.430 
there that do not relate to the key that
you're<00:02:23.129> in<00:02:23.220> number<00:02:24.000> two<00:02:24.209> these<00:02:24.930> latter<00:02:25.140> lick

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
you're in number two these latter lick

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.800 
you're in number two these latter lick
ideas<00:02:25.769> are<00:02:25.890> primarily<00:02:26.519> fingering<00:02:27.299> patterns

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
ideas are primarily fingering patterns

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.990 
ideas are primarily fingering patterns
so<00:02:28.079> you<00:02:28.170> basically<00:02:28.650> apply<00:02:29.099> them<00:02:29.340> as<00:02:29.459> modular

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
so you basically apply them as modular

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.580 
so you basically apply them as modular
or<00:02:30.180> geometrical<00:02:30.840> ideas<00:02:31.200> upon<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
or geometrical ideas upon the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.890 
or geometrical ideas upon the
fingerboard<00:02:32.269> let's<00:02:33.269> see<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.629> was<00:02:33.780> your

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
idea it has nothing really to do so much

on the fingerboard that you think is

to start messing around with now the
third<00:03:05.730> thing<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.030> want<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.239> bring<00:03:06.359> up<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.769> they

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
third thing I want to bring up is they

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.339 
third thing I want to bring up is they
are<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.340> basically<00:03:08.849> performed<00:03:09.450> with<00:03:09.750> total

lateral<00:03:15.060> lick<00:03:15.209> ideas<00:03:15.599> because<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.739> know<00:03:17.040> if

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
lateral lick ideas because you know if

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.309 
lateral lick ideas because you know if
you<00:03:17.220> don't<00:03:17.609> they're<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.599> gonna<00:03:18.720> sound<00:03:18.989> like

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
you don't they're just gonna sound like

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.949 
you don't they're just gonna sound like
a<00:03:19.380> bunch<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.889> really<00:03:20.280> wrong<00:03:20.849> notes<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.660> people

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
a bunch of really wrong notes and people

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.240 
a bunch of really wrong notes and people
are<00:03:22.049> just<00:03:22.109> gonna<00:03:22.230> think<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.620> you're<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.919> lousy

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
are just gonna think that you're a lousy

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.580 
are just gonna think that you're a lousy
guitarist<00:03:24.150> instead<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.109> you<00:03:25.230> know<00:03:25.319> some<00:03:25.470> kind

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
of hip outside player so with those

like a AZ 7th kind of sound and it goes

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.770 
like a AZ 7th kind of sound and it goes
like<00:03:45.989> this

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:01.190 

okay<00:03:52.780> I'll<00:03:52.870> slow<00:03:53.020> that<00:03:53.140> down<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.350> little<00:03:53.440> bit<00:03:58.560> I

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
okay I'll slow that down a little bit I

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.190 
okay I'll slow that down a little bit I
notice<00:04:02.200> how<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.620> started<00:04:02.950> on<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.720> then

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
notice how it started on a and then

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.229 
notice how it started on a and then
we're<00:04:05.319> sort<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.530> walking<00:04:05.680> into<00:04:06.010> that

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
we're sort of walking into that

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.000 
we're sort of walking into that
chromatics<00:04:07.239> string<00:04:08.020> cross<00:04:08.230> idea<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:10.890> then<00:04:11.890> it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
chromatics string cross idea and then it

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.300 
chromatics string cross idea and then it
went<00:04:12.190> into<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.910> B<00:04:13.540> which<00:04:13.930> is<00:04:14.050> a<00:04:14.080> ninth<00:04:14.709> quartile

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
went into a B which is a ninth quartile

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.210 
went into a B which is a ninth quartile
and<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:16.329> did<00:04:16.510> start<00:04:16.780> with<00:04:16.870> here<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.650> had<00:04:18.100> that

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
and I did start with here so I had that

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.520 
and I did start with here so I had that
as<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.519> thought<00:04:18.730> then<00:04:19.419> when<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.959> second<00:04:20.290> part

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
as the thought then when the second part

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.710 
as the thought then when the second part
came<00:04:20.799> in<00:04:21.040> we<00:04:21.549> came<00:04:21.700> off<00:04:21.880> e<00:04:22.060> which<00:04:22.450> is<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.600> 5th

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
came in we came off e which is the 5th

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.110 
came in we came off e which is the 5th
of<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:26.200> in<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.310> end<00:04:27.460> when<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.940> thing

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
of a and in the end when the thing

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.570 
of a and in the end when the thing
wrapped<00:04:28.330> up<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.660> ended<00:04:28.990> up<00:04:29.110> on<00:04:29.290> it<00:04:29.440> G<00:04:29.770> note<00:04:30.160> so

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
wrapped up it ended up on it G note so

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.090 
wrapped up it ended up on it G note so
that's<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.150> flat<00:04:31.480> seven<00:04:31.930> tone<00:04:32.140> of<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:32.860> a

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
that's the flat seven tone of that a

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.230 
that's the flat seven tone of that a
dominant<00:04:33.700> seventh<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:35.500> there's<00:04:36.400> starting<00:04:37.120> and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
dominant seventh so there's starting and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.420 
dominant seventh so there's starting and
ending<00:04:37.450> points<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.530> all<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.100> stuff<00:04:39.280> in

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
ending points but all the stuff in

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.700 
ending points but all the stuff in
between<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:41.140> bunch<00:04:41.500> of<00:04:41.590> really

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
between is just a bunch of really

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.940 
between is just a bunch of really
outside<00:04:42.450> work<00:04:43.450> chromatic<00:04:43.960> based<00:04:44.350> concept

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
outside work chromatic based concept

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.190 
outside work chromatic based concept
that<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.520> mess<00:04:45.700> around<00:04:45.820> with<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:46.660> there<00:04:47.140> you

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
go there's my ladder lick example and I

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.080 
go there's my ladder lick example and I
hope<00:04:50.290> that<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:50.710> explanation<00:04:51.100> helps<00:04:51.729> not
