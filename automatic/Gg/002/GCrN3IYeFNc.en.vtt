00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.390
 today we are in the maintenance workshop 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.489
 of the cars of the Alfa Romeo museum 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.040
 next to me that is this 1500 super 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.730
 1928 sport that a racing car 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.800
 and a similar model won the first 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.180
 of the eleven editions record remained 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.489
 unbeaten of the alpha romeo 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.629
 as regards the thousand miles la 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.129
 a thousand miles with the real one 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.750
 original the racing one 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.540
 this car along with two other models 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.010
 of the house officers will take part 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.650
 to the historical re-enactment of the thousand 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.449
 miles to be held in mid-May therefore 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.220
 in a few days this together with 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.530
 two other cars will support the streets 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.760
 of Italy to be seen to be done 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.040
 applaud from the public that it is always 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.070
 numerous in a race like la mille 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.070
 miles 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.490
 this 6c 1500 super sport car is one 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.350
 car that is 86 years old 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.570
 this one was designed by 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.700
 ingenious designer vittorio jano is 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.100
 was the mother of all 6 c 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.649
 since it was born as if there were 1500 then 1700 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.460
 50 then 1900 was one at the time 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.830
 racing car 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.600
 if we want revolutionary because it did 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.610
 of the lightness of the reliability of the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.170
 brilliant performance its points of 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.270
 force looks at all features 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.830
 that were just right for a race 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.869
 as like the thousand miles 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.030
 also this 1500 obviously has 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.709
 all supported a test path that 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.590
 let's have our cars made for 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.630
 get to the best possible 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.459
 departure and of course also at the finish line 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.840
 of brescia in this case Sunday 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.850
 next 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.769
 these cars generally every year 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.560
 they make three four thousand kilometers up 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.209
 road because these kilometers do 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.250
 good for cars because they are always held 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.120
 in shape they are always perfect 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.120
 departure of events 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.020
 and so it is also with the other two 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.360
 cars that together with 1500 ss that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.980
 we presented earlier make up the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.700
 alfa romeo alla mille official team 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.010
 2014 miles between the three cars 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.610
 undoubtedly the most valuable e 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.290
 greater legend and the 6c 1700 that stands 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.900
 exactly my shoulders 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.120
 just the 6c 33 cars maybe that one 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.360
 more legendary because a car 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.620
 analogous in 1930 won the edition of 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.420
 that year of the thousand miles with 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.910
 nuvolari e guidotti and nuvolari was 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.740
 the first pilot in the thousand miles that 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.390
 broke the average speed record 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.060
 of over 100 per hour on the whole 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.280
 route from Brescia to Rome and back e 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.830
 this for the era were and has been 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.830
 remained a stratospheric record for a long time 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.430
 among the three cars we have the car 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.650
 the sports 2000 of 1954 is younger 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:40.530
 which is a prototype an exclusive car 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:43.099
 of the Alfa Romeo Museum but we have it 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:50.040
 performed the last function test 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:51.900
 of the 6c 1750 to drive it navigate it further 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.340
 to the mechanical functionality test 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.170
 of the car we also did a test 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.970
 with all the equipment for the races 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.970
 of economic pipe regularity 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.739
 the cars of the Alfa Romeo museum are 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.200
 protagonists of a whole series of 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.489
 annual events taking place throughout 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.680
 the world is indeed as they say 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.070
 they travel the world from Europe to the states 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.470
 united to Japan to South Africa are 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.449
 protagonists of events around the world 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.150
 and are static and dynamic events that it is 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.960
 one of the features that has always been 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.910
 distinguishes the cars of the museum 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.860
 alfa romeo and that move in 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.860
 conditions of strict originality
