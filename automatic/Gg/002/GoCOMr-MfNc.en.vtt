versatile<00:01:04.880> versatile<00:01:05.880> machine<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> guess<00:01:07.130> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
versatile versatile machine I guess so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.010 
versatile versatile machine I guess so
list<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.580> apps<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> list<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
list of apps you can go to list of the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.300 
list of apps you can go to list of the
apps<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.650> oops<00:01:13.369> it's<00:01:14.369> all<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:17.159> can

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
apps here oops it's all here and you can

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.390 
apps here oops it's all here and you can
actually<00:01:17.549> go<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.990> each<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.799> apps<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
actually go to on each of your apps and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.210 
actually go to on each of your apps and
set<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> DPI<00:01:21.470> what<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> don't<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.009> don't

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
set the DPI what you don't if you don't

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.630 
set the DPI what you don't if you don't
know<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.520> DPI<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.060> basically<00:01:25.049> that's<00:01:25.640> dots

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
know what DPI is basically that's dots

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
know what DPI is basically that's dots
per<00:01:26.880> inch<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.479> yeah<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> by<00:01:31.229> changing

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
per inch I think yeah so by changing

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.640 
per inch I think yeah so by changing
this<00:01:31.860> density<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.000> set<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.650> 160

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
this density right now it's set at 160

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.760 
this density right now it's set at 160
um<00:01:35.060> which<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.479> tablet<00:01:37.049> mode<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.590> let's

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
um which is I think tablet mode so let's

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
um which is I think tablet mode so let's
go<00:01:37.890> actually<00:01:38.130> launch<00:01:38.759> my<00:01:39.060> gmail<00:01:39.509> real<00:01:39.750> quick

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
go actually launch my gmail real quick

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.260 
go actually launch my gmail real quick
here<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.189> let's<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> looks

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
here and what let's see what it looks

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.370 
here and what let's see what it looks
like

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
like

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.279 
like
so<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.369> looks<00:01:45.579> like<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.759> regular<00:01:46.119> regular<00:01:46.930> off

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
so it looks like a regular regular off

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.529 
so it looks like a regular regular off
um<00:01:47.619> um<00:01:48.240> let's<00:01:49.240> go<00:01:49.450> switch<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.049> books<00:01:51.360> let's<00:01:52.360> go

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
um um let's go switch and books let's go

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.340 

and<00:01:58.600> change<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.680> density

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.380

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
to a mid high low stock tablet stock

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.140 
to a mid high low stock tablet stock
value<00:02:08.810> tablet<00:02:09.289> oh<00:02:09.560> that's<00:02:10.399> what<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.789> that

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.160 
so which is really cool and you can
switch<00:02:45.710> it<00:02:45.740> back<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.340> settings<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.990> best

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
switch it back in settings and the best

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.810 
switch it back in settings and the best
part<00:02:48.350> about<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.640> can<00:02:49.790> actually

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
part about this is that you can actually

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.950 
part about this is that you can actually
switch<00:02:50.420> /<00:02:51.320> app<00:02:51.590> doesn't<00:02:52.550> change<00:02:52.970> some<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.840> the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
switch / app doesn't change some of the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.590 
switch / app doesn't change some of the
other<00:02:54.200> hybrid<00:02:54.920> roms<00:02:55.340> out<00:02:55.580> there<00:02:55.790> doesn't<00:02:56.510> let

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
other hybrid roms out there doesn't let

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.080 
other hybrid roms out there doesn't let
you<00:02:56.690> do<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:57.020> but<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:58.460> latest<00:02:58.640> version<00:02:59.060> of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
you do that but the latest version of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.900

probably<00:04:44.909> go<00:04:45.240> sideways<00:04:45.740> I<00:04:46.740> think<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.550> have<00:04:47.639> to

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
probably go sideways I think you have to

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.480 
probably go sideways I think you have to
enable<00:04:47.969> it<00:04:48.439> but<00:04:49.439> there<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.740> go<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.219> you<00:04:50.310> got

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
enable it but there you go so you got

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.700 
enable it but there you go so you got
the<00:04:50.520> tablet<00:04:51.090> mode<00:04:51.270> here

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.460 

there<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.640> you<00:04:57.180> can<00:04:57.360> access<00:04:57.540> settings<00:04:58.020> if<00:04:58.320> you
