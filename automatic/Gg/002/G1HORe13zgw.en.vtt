00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.670
 so here you go 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.400
 see today how to count the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.100
 marois so I remind you that we do not treat 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.560
 not always body 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.300
 everyone knows it in medicine - 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.590
 drug is used since it is 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.940
 effective so it's important not to do 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.290
 as it is mentioned in a lot of 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.330
 beekeeping unions that is to say treat 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.770
 systematically weakens 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.600
 immune defenses of bees and one 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.760
 strengthens the resistance of the Var 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.400
 so that's practically worse than the 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.770
 light varroa so before treating it 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.480
 have to do a counting operation is 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.720
 proclaimed if we put what we call 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.270
 an age that is a sticky surface 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.559
 a little sticky at the bottom of the hives and 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.220
 on which we will count the 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.589
 number of Var fell in a day if 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.420
 you have less than ten var a hive 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.600
 looks average in 24 days 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.989
 hours 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.540
 you are not dealing if you treat the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:59.059
 linen I take a sheet of paper a4 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.970
 simple and as the Russian goes reintegration 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.900
 square I do a diagonal have to little 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.940
 near square surface that's it and that it me 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:14.000
 so gave here a notebook on which I 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.130
 want to go from Greece there on the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.570
 product that will get stuck we will say the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.009
 bees winged small var 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.539
 it's just fat 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.820
 milk rinse under we know I cross 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.590
 a course for sale in all 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.070
 agricultural cooperatives so serve 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.689
 cows after the migration clickquot by 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 school is institutions you 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.009
 find the countryside we take from greece 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.469
 and we just spread out we have to be 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.149
 generous enough to who is a 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.890
 sufficient film but not to 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.259
 two thrones opus it's no use of 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.450
 great talent it's not a drawing it takes 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.509
 that there was everywhere 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.200
 and here it is on it so the Var go 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.969
 come and stick to it so I did 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.049
 quickly a surface and now I 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.249
 put it in the bottom of hives then 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.210
 badly shows you how I put it in 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.640
 my hives because I have some 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.140
 economic apiaries but on a hive a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 little bit of quality there is a drawer that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.039
 serves it flat so it's this one angels 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 and who therefore serves once a year and that 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.200
 was done in a few seconds I have 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.899
 body apiaries and that I'm going to 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.259
 show how do you know me here are we 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.259
 go together 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:35.640
 we will go to the hive that is there 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:38.550
 right have changed so that's hive 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.349
 way that was not intended to be 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.349
 replaced for easy moving 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.400
 so I take two knives enough 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.400
 beefy I raise the bottom 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.720
 policemen from two pieces of wood 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.530
 then we lose it slowly 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.060
 here and like the section of the street 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.650
 heaters have made the width of the paper there 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.140
 just slip this paper attention this 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.930
 paper must not clog the entrance so 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.310
 on the fence of hives fund 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.310
 I slip my paper 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:51.190
 here and we do not want to the end 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:52.720
 we're closing now we're fine 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.610
 check others or steal that paper 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.390
 do not close the troubling it's all 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.390
 There you go
