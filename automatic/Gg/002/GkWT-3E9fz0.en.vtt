00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.219
 Hey guys, what's up, John? 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.380
 on the island games are okay you guys are 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.540
 welcome, this is a video more this video 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.580
 here again leave our series 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.890
 knowing the colossus this is the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.619
 seventh and seventh place and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.170
 Let's go to the video and let's go 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.539
 starting with the colosso technique is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.240
 as usual and the name of this here or 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.739
 hydros position and is the seventh 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:40.559
 game he has the weight of 280 tons and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.780
 length of 280 feet 85.3 meters 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.120
 that team that marked our team until the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.610
 moment and for you to have an idea is the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.770
 second highest college in the game I think 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.149
 Most of us have figured out which one is the greatest, right? 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.949
 but anyway for those who do not know they will have 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.000
 to wait his turn and it is not so 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.829
 so far 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 this attack was the technical file of the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:08.760
 idols and we will leave for the colossus the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.479
 colossus the first aquatic colossus of the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.240
 game 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.920
 the hydro symbolizes a giant guide and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.229
 from here also one of the most 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.479
 Fear boots at the player when the game is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.030
 played for the first time because dude 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.310
 that there is one area of the idols there is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 his place is where he sends the Andrew is 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.509
 just an intruder in the place and you can see 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.060
 because the idol only manifests itself 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.549
 even when the under jumps in the water 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.650
 the fight against him is very epic since 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.420
 to get his attention when he jumps on the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.610
 Water until we get a ride. 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.310
 care for underwater 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 everything is perfect to fight soundtrack is 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.960
 really the very epic colossus one of the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.930
 my favorites certainly set the scene one 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.939
 large lake with ruins of a bridge in the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.280
 my opinion that pillar that of 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.479
 to inspire the procel was used by 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.820
 fishermen nÃ© 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.219
 where in my vision also the biggest sale 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.340
 of this population when it existed 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.590
 one was fishing on the scenery is also well 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.050
 pretty dark pretty doing that light 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.040
 fog because of the water where it combines 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.220
 very well with the idols right 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.160
 curiosities the producers of the game do not 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.050
 drew the bottom of this lake for you 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.540
 to see it do with that 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.880
 tentacles coming out of peggy's idols 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.700
 when you 're jumping and then you 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.020
 will simply see an invisible floor is 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.420
 very bizarre 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.640
 This curiosity here is a kind of 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.680
 continued failure of producers to 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.780
 you get an idea because after the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.360
 idols is defeated appears his scene 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.000
 sinking in the dead lake, it's okay to have 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.550
 but we'll come back later in the arena 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.780
 him he will be supporting this was a 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.610
 producers error 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.500
 they should not have put this on 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.540
 sink after he died and yes 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.120
 floating because even after we 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.540
 defeat a colossus we have that way of 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.580
 extra game called reminiscences that the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.470
 mold where you find the colossus does not 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.630
 is a form of flashback 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.190
 so you can go that way for yourself 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.080
 You have to reach the colossus and the 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.630
 Anderson will pray in front of him going 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.580
 have to get close to the colossus and 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.920
 Dude, how the hell are you doing this? 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.200
 sunken care on the bottom of the lake 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.150
 then after the producers 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.730
 realized that they put the colossus 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.209
 But then they forgot that 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.340
 in the beginning he had founded is bizarre 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.739
 so I hope that you have 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.350
 liked the video if you liked xuxa 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.660
