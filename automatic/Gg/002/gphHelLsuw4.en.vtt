00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.750 
when looking at landscape paintings we
can<00:00:07.200> see<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.830> compositions<00:00:08.580> are

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
can see that the compositions are

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.820 
can see that the compositions are
generally<00:00:09.300> divided<00:00:09.690> into<00:00:09.900> three<00:00:10.559> different

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
generally divided into three different

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.240 
generally divided into three different
areas<00:00:11.630> these<00:00:12.630> are<00:00:12.690> commonly<00:00:13.410> referred<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.980> as

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
areas these are commonly referred to as

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.760 
areas these are commonly referred to as
the<00:00:14.460> foreground<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.929> middle<00:00:16.199> ground<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.710> the

background artists throughout the ages

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.330 
background artists throughout the ages
have<00:00:21.270> exploited<00:00:22.050> these<00:00:22.199> three<00:00:22.619> divisions<00:00:23.160> in

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
have exploited these three divisions in

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
have exploited these three divisions in
order<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.789> achieve<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> greater<00:00:24.510> sense<00:00:24.900> of

for the sake of brevity we'll just focus
on<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> three<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.559> now<00:00:38.329> let's<00:00:39.329> first<00:00:39.600> look<00:00:39.840> at

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
on the three for now let's first look at

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.520 
on the three for now let's first look at

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
of Dutch landscape painting we can see

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.220 
of Dutch landscape painting we can see
the<00:00:49.500> three<00:00:49.739> men<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.219> horses<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.629> front<00:00:51.930> are

the three men on horses in the front are

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.310 
the three men on horses in the front are
the<00:00:52.770> darkest<00:00:53.280> elements<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> middle<00:00:55.079> ground

the darkest elements the middle ground

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.700 
the darkest elements the middle ground
is<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> gray<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:57.090> background<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.079> sky<00:00:58.350> is

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
by separating the composition into these

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.950 
by separating the composition into these
three<00:01:03.920> distinct<00:01:04.460> areas<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.150> viewer<00:01:05.360> is<00:01:05.570> able

three distinct areas the viewer is able

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.960 
three distinct areas the viewer is able
to<00:01:06.080> easily<00:01:06.440> read<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.950> elements<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.610> compose

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
to easily read the elements and compose

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.930 
to easily read the elements and compose

picture of a cat at a restaurant in
Italy<00:02:59.910> we<00:03:00.910> obviously<00:03:01.090> know<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.380> cat

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
Italy we obviously know that the cat

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.500 
Italy we obviously know that the cat
occupies<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.430> foreground<00:03:03.910> because<00:03:04.150> he's

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
occupies the foreground because he's

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.890 
occupies the foreground because he's
overlapping<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.680> buildings<00:03:06.069> behind<00:03:06.579> him<00:03:06.970> now

this<00:03:08.530> may<00:03:08.739> seem<00:03:09.060> stupid<00:03:10.060> simple<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> fact

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
this may seem stupid simple but the fact

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.890 
this may seem stupid simple but the fact
that<00:03:11.950> objects<00:03:12.790> aren't<00:03:13.090> transparent<00:03:13.450> is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
that objects aren't transparent is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.900 
that objects aren't transparent is
something<00:03:14.410> which<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.650> exploited<00:03:15.400> all<00:03:15.639> the

something which is exploited all the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.780 
something which is exploited all the
time<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.329> painting<00:03:17.010> painters<00:03:18.010> really<00:03:18.519> want

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
time and painting painters really want

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.759 
time and painting painters really want
to<00:03:18.970> differentiate<00:03:19.420> between<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.200> layers<00:03:20.440> in

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
to differentiate between the layers in

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.460 
to differentiate between the layers in
space<00:03:21.100> by<00:03:21.430> utilizing<00:03:22.120> color<00:03:22.389> or<00:03:22.660> value

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
space by utilizing color or value

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.000 
space by utilizing color or value
changes<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:25.209> often<00:03:25.530> differences<00:03:26.530> between<00:03:26.739> the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
changes so often differences between the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.240 
changes so often differences between the
layers<00:03:27.250> are<00:03:27.579> exaggerated<00:03:28.480> in<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:29.739> Morandi

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
layers are exaggerated in this Morandi

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.370 
layers are exaggerated in this Morandi
we<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:30.609> see<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.000> each<00:03:31.239> object<00:03:31.840> has<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.049> clear

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
we can see that each object has a clear

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.680 
we can see that each object has a clear
value<00:03:32.650> change<00:03:33.190> as<00:03:33.430> a

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
artists like to exaggerate these

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.150 
artists like to exaggerate these
differences<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.840> they<00:03:39.990> can<00:03:40.170> say<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.800> is

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
differences so they can say that this is
