00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
you can produce that Kuk motion you're

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.799 
you can produce that Kuk motion you're
looking<00:01:01.420> for<00:01:02.430> again<00:01:03.489> regulating<00:01:04.420> your<00:01:04.540> speed

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
your speed will help develop those good

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.310 
your speed will help develop those good
habits<00:01:21.280> you'll<00:01:22.090> also<00:01:22.299> want<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:23.109> make<00:01:23.289> sure

that<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:23.799> get<00:01:23.979> consistent<00:01:24.570> rotation<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.719> your

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
that you get consistent rotation of your

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.719 
that you get consistent rotation of your
bowling<00:01:26.500> ball<00:01:26.649> or<00:01:26.859> axis<00:01:27.189> tilt<00:01:27.429> of<00:01:27.579> your

bowling ball or axis tilt of your
bowling<00:01:28.060> ball<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:28.689> that's<00:01:28.899> what<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.679> rotate

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
bowling ball so that's what the rotate

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.770 
bowling ball so that's what the rotate
and<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.520> fingers<00:01:30.850> consistently<00:01:31.600> can

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
and the fingers consistently can

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.319 
and the fingers consistently can
accomplish<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.789> you<00:01:33.789> can<00:01:33.969> make<00:01:34.149> effective

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
accomplish and you can make effective

force pairs on the lanes because you're

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.529

there's about three good tips that we

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.029 
there's about three good tips that we
can<00:02:00.880> give<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.210> first<00:02:01.719> allow<00:02:02.049> your<00:02:02.350> backswing

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
can give you first allow your backswing

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.069 
can give you first allow your backswing
to<00:02:03.100> move<00:02:03.369> freely<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.969> swiftly<00:02:04.329> to<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.689> top<00:02:04.899> of

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
to move freely and swiftly to the top of

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.609 
to move freely and swiftly to the top of
your<00:02:05.229> backswing<00:02:05.710> try<00:02:06.670> not<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.060> make<00:02:07.619> control

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
your backswing try not to make control

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.089 
your backswing try not to make control
your<00:02:08.890> swing<00:02:09.280> as<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:10.149> begin<00:02:10.479> your<00:02:10.539> arm<00:02:10.869> swing

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
your swing as you begin your arm swing

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.530 
your swing as you begin your arm swing
controlling<00:02:12.099> it<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.430> back<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.909> swing

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
controlling it to the back of the swing

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.910 
controlling it to the back of the swing
means<00:02:13.719> you<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:13.959> tension<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.590> your<00:02:14.709> arm

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
means you have tension and your arm

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.640 
means you have tension and your arm
muscles<00:02:15.159> too<00:02:15.790> much<00:02:16.000> tension<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:16.629> it<00:02:17.500> will

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
muscles too much tension and it will

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.890 
muscles too much tension and it will
slow<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.129> swing<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.000> point<00:02:19.239> where<00:02:19.450> you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
slow the swing to the point where you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.750 
slow the swing to the point where you
probably<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.650> force<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.280> through<00:02:21.519> on<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
probably have to force it through on the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.640 
probably have to force it through on the
forward<00:02:22.180> swing<00:02:22.390> that's<00:02:22.930> not<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> good<00:02:23.409> way<00:02:23.590> to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
forward swing that's not a good way to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.130 
forward swing that's not a good way to
get<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.950> regulated<00:02:24.459> ball<00:02:25.090> speed<00:02:25.390> control<00:02:25.870> so

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
get a regulated ball speed control so

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.229 
get a regulated ball speed control so
let<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.709> swing<00:02:27.189> go<00:02:27.370> free<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.849> loose<00:02:27.969> to<00:02:28.180> the

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
let that swing go free and loose to the

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.599 
let that swing go free and loose to the
top<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.689> your<00:02:28.810> backswing<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.500> then<00:02:30.069> as<00:02:30.280> the

top of your backswing and then as the

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.420

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
ball begins to go onto the forward swing

ball begins to go onto the forward swing
the<00:02:33.609> first<00:02:33.879> part<00:02:34.569> of<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.750> ball<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.079> should

the first part of the ball you should

allow gravity to help the ball fall into

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.420 
allow gravity to help the ball fall into
