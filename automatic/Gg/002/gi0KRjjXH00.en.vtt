00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.439
 hello and welcome to this docu stein 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 of a new kind since I'm going to you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.150
 explain some small techniques and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.619
 hints to succeed some success a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.109
 little more difficult than the others 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.340
 firstly thanks to effect recipes I 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.020
 believe that I extend to the pseudo in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 sorry if that's not the case 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 proposed this topic on a topic 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 dedicated to the dorfhus times today I 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.329
 will you talk about two successes 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 but first success on the canigou the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.840
 bills but also the success has been repeated on 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.840
 our dear friend the dragon pig 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.719
 easy tell me you just have to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 kill the case neither ball and bill 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.649
 a first yes but it's not so 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 easy as that since a doll at this 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 rock slipped into the fight his 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.170
 role is simply to take 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.720
 all the damage instead of the cases nor 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.970
 ball and this effect there can not be 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.380
 disenchant the challenge of this success 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.100
 So is killing the doll to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.439
 this scare 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.189
 after the canigou the voids so the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.439
 cannet ball and bill 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.659
 before the doll and for that it is necessary 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.310
 go through indirect damage for 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.650
 both solutions are available to you 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.630
 first of all the poison damage then 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.850
 for that one will be very well suited 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 with his insidious poison or his 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 new trap of silence 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.770
 but if you prefer the bristles know 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.619
 that a salida can also do it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.500
 with his paralyzing poison spell 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.299
 finally there are also cra for example 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.040
 with their poisoned flash that can 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.540
 do poison damage the second 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.180
 solution it's the push damage 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 for that there is a wide panel of class 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.060
 who are available to help you 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.950
 for example yop the cral sram lenny rip 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.290
 that or even the zobal can very well 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.850
 agree if you want to make it a 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.920
 little harder you can always 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.659
 just use liberation 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 but be careful I advise you to have 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.740
 a stuff dedicated to pushing damage 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.270
 expressly for the occasion since the case neither 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.009
 ball and bill heals gold if he gets 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.599
 heals more than the amount of damage 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.130
 that you inflict on him inevitably 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.780
 to be a little hard to kill him 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.910
 in any case attention to 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.190
 spell that inflicts more damage 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.990
 carried out a push this is the case 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.060
 some zobal spells for example 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.010
 why because the doll to this eye 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.690
 will still take the damage of the spell 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.210
 ie if you are a ball zoo 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.770
 you inflict 150 damage then you 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.810
 push and the ouch takes without damage from 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.880
 push the first 150 of damage 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.350
 are still taken for the doll by 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.910
 the doll at this scare there is when 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.190
 as well as the thrust Draws which are 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.870
 really inflicted on the stupid canigou then 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.940
 it can very quickly become very complicated 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.380
 now here is the case neither ball and bill 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.700
 awaits you and you do not have to 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:52.350
 excuse to miss success we stay 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.480
 in the same high-level slice with a 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.820
 success that requires to beat the dragon 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.130
 pig in the end all his tricks to 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.870
 side of an enemy so for that we're going 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.280
 give you the simplest tips 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.110
 and the easiest to achieve 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.970
 but of course there are plenty 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.770
 other attention all the tricks 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.960
 which follow however requires a 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.710
 thing is to have more initiative than 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.480
 piggy dragon 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.730
 otherwise we will use your dishes 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.950
 will cause a quick but painful death 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.630
 the most obvious solution is good 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.910
 sure to have a sacrieur who play in 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.190
 first in his team a small 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.630
 attraction and we talk about it more against 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.610
 this trick it works only if you are 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.020
 4 or less because otherwise at the end of a 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.970
 moment there will be a little problem of 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.560
 placement around the monster returnees 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.390
 unless you really want to 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.740
 complicate the task by pushing you 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.630
 have that it's no longer their turn 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.790
 in order to steal their place next to the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.530
 monster returnees do not forget your 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.970
 cooperation is more available at 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.250
 first round is indeed the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.260
 spell attraction on the sacrier who you 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.910
 will perform the challenge a 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.100
 dawa bridge can also do it 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.870
 for that it is enough that he places his 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.880
 barrel not far from his allies such 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.680
 way it can attract an enemy 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.150
 then the panda gets into the state 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.800
 Soul start smaller spell during 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.870
 the ass and finished his turn in the year 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.580
 be careful though this technique 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.430
 is not recommended by the association 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.390
 bridge protector to have last 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.550
 trick yop 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.470
 he has the opportunity to push an ally 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.730
 and then to jump to end up at 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.709
 melee of enemies 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.190
 the reverse is also possible it can 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.440
 first jump and then push back an enemy 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.269
 his allies here you have now 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.220
 some tips for success 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.320
 I remind you once again but 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.520
 this list is not exhaustive since 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.140
 for example classes with 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.820
 teleportation like the exe the time when the 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.250
 facts that can succeed success 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.570
 all alone attention however the whole thing 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.160
 is not to do a redit it's also 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.830
 to come out alive because mine of 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.450
 nothing the piggy dragon it hurts 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.160
 this two systems is now complete 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.200
 you have no excuse to succeed 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.250
 his two successes and as for us we get 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.120
 found next week for a 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.120
 new dofus times
