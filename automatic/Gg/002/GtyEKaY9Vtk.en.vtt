00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.500
 you never know what 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.070
 so many more 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.070
 will become 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 they 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.440
 all to describe you can see 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:57.089
 now tell 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:01:03.070
 and we are honest people we have nothing to hide and 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:10.840
 you do not tell me why not trading on 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:18.810
 the road and you do not know well I see that 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.810
 empty ranks in general, I myself Kharkiv 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.630
 what channel will you say now 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.469
 Natalia, good afternoon, tell me so 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.000
 I understand you are an entrepreneur and here 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.369
 actually rio stand in the background already 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.439
 closed shops although working hours 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.319
 that's what happens on baramash and how 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.710
 in general, the situation is now with trade 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:00.350
 or not and no ruble make jan how 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.270
 would be next to him as soon as it started 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.459
 google and no trade fell why 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.500
 because Russia is mostly on the same 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.739
 Russia rescued Russia came and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 bought now there is no russia and therefore as 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.750
 would all trade have fallen no trade with 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.430
 every day is getting worse and worse and worse and 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.410
 Tell me from Russia, but they went there 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.510
 there were mostly wholesale buyers in 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.510
 retail buy and retail 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.209
 Well, that is, you think, but not even that 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.980
 count and probably feel that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.260
 In general, the income of entrepreneurs strongly 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.660
 diminished by much diminished 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.670
 end what will happen in general and how in general 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.780
 entrepreneurs evaluate this one here 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.080
 the situation that has developed in Ukraine 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.190
 what 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.870
 as if to the naturally better side what 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.830
 This is the current government which 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.840
 came to power 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.989
 she naturally 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.360
 very much she did mean things meanness 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.430
 and that it is not legitimate to come itself it 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.129
 I do not recognize we do not recognize this election 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.830
 who were who were passing somewhere 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.730
 there it is not clear where it is how we would 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.599
 anything that does not recognize it all for us 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.620
 not long and rocky you personally voted 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.110
 on this sky area 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.830
 I do not why I do not want me for anyone 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.290
 vote and poverty that 40 choose a 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.120
 how as it does that go to the polls in 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.980
 we have a president positive therefore 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.780
 I see, thanks, but tell me 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.329
 approached I just heard you stood with 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.370
 colleagues discussed with their neighbors 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.530
 events in Donetsk, this is what started our 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.329
 conversation we do you think that's 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.860
 Does it happen in Donetsk at all? 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.170
 it is not in a civilized country 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.790
 impossible television country is all 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.890
 this is done again this and the present 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.690
 our power which is now 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:02.420
 we are at the threshold of 200, so this is 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.000
 actually unthinkable scary and painful and 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.730
 very sorry for the people who are from this 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.760
 suffer and in general when it is already over 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.620
 something incomprehensible when they all end 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.370

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.810
