00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.379
 before I give you the technique of the unicorn 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.690
 You can show office a bit 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.169
 work on the head and do her 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.960
 take one strand adds another 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:23.020
 steps to turn this 180 degrees 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.919
 Add a new strand to it 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.910
 180 degrees new strict introduces me 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.890
 think there you can see very well in the video 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.200
 defend your cell phones 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:41.200
 you also all your hair to one side 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:45.180
 tie the braid firmly and first I show 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.710
 the technology in my view 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.650
 theoretically if you are weaving yourself 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.030
 would you see this from your perspective 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:58.149
 and you share two of them 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.880
 hairstrands off and both we stand 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.089
 turned to the left crossed over to the right 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.110
 turned to the left crossed over to the right 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.939
 turned to the left crossed over to the right 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.639
 and now you see this is from the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.590
 spectator perspective must always be 

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:20.439
 both have to stand in the fore 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.299
 same direction but to be screwed 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.969
 in the opposite direction 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.490
 be crossed this does not matter if it is 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.340
 now both strands have entered the left 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.560
 and crossed over right or how 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.020
 here both strands turn right 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.119
 one turned and crossed over left so 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.279
 depending on how it works both 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.469
 only important that both stand in the 

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:43.810
 same direction be screwed and 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.990
 but then in the other direction 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.840
 Crossed so if you do that here 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.579
 do that until the end 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.189
 and always a turn as we do 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.259
 Turn this left over to the right 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.509
 turn left to turn over 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.270
 You can refuse on the right side 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.520
 then that works is very important 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.110
 and must be pretty tight at the beginning 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.910
 be wrapped up because if you do that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.110
 hair rubber drum rum is clear that will 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.670
 then a little more relaxed 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.260
 but does not turn up because the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.079
 hair strands twisted against each other 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.950
 be and that's the whole occurs 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.290
 this 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.210
 occurred pot that is in german 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.110
 unicorn pot called or in English 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.030
 Thank you for watching Unicorn Break 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.370
 I would be very positive about that 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.970
 rating or a comment from you 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.270
 looking forward 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.270
 Many Thanks
