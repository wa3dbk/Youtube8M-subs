00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.060
 so here is a beautiful vital 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.950
 the distribution 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.950
 so that 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.949
 lamy 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.820
 it is true that it is detroit but good 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.820
 so that's the problem happened 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
 right here 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.510
 claeys to the camshaft is not it 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:00.680
 here here a landing to break here I know 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.680
 not if we see well here the case and there 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.250
 good then here of course as he remained 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.610
 a lot of time open and well there 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:20.910
 starts to rust so here is the chain 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 here is to look at the case that has it and 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.310
 then, if there is a possibility to redo 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.340
 and if there is no possibility to change 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.340
 the engine is not it but that's good 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.520
 it's good you 're las vegas is also 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520
 the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.410
 the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.050
 all right we do not have it here it's 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:59.250
 the one where I went up earlier who 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:02:01.260
 is broken too so broken in half 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.370
 that's in principle I think it 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.080
 was broken on all the bearings holds 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:10.020
 here too the cases that here here I know 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.620
 not if you see there she's broken him 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.740
 so here is my faith then we will 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.990
 start disassembling and then see what's going on 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.160
 past 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.770
 so we will see if they are not against 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.200
 the scene since not not on but 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.820
 good there on this one I do not have much 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.620
 hope anyway but good as that has 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.370
 broken 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.470
 maybe pasta soups at big 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.830
 stayed closed and then huh and then 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.830
 so what is it to see 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.830
 here 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.720
 go break 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.080
 so the little wood 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.080
 hi the agreement 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:26.590
 hello now the surprise this is 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:29.430
 the big surprise if the shape of a 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.430
 second case it's 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.150
 break too 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.620
 the latter broke net 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.660
 step 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:54.590
 I come back broken right here is what 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.590
 here are all my pieces 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.019
 so here 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.409
 oh well there are pushers that 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.409
 do not come back 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:16.790
 yeah thanks there it's the same it's recent 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:16.790
 advice is the same it's the same 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.750
 so I'll go out the most evening then 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.919
 I want to see what give the keys that 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.919
 you do not fight to see 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.280
 to oyonnax 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.740
 obama 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.470
 for the moment there is nothing broken 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.610
 for the moment nothing broken so 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.840
 then we will see 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.790
 we will see at the pistons 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.480
 I'm going to put them in place 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.480
 I do not mix them 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.249
 yeah 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:42.320
 there's more to the turbo 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:44.949
 exhaust manifold and then I have some 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.949
 cylinder heads for the hour
