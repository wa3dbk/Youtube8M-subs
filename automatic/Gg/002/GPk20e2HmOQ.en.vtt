goes horribly wrong there also seems to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.889 
goes horribly wrong there also seems to
be<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.189> bread<00:02:05.520> model<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:05.939> every<00:02:06.210> class<00:02:06.540> in

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
so what does this mean the bread update

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.660 
so what does this mean the bread update
is<00:02:11.510> big<00:02:11.960> with<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.710> number<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.070> files<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.580> the
