the side and I always sieve and km's
perfect<00:02:14.209> fit<00:02:14.329> sleeves<00:02:14.689> because<00:02:15.049> they<00:02:15.170> fit<00:02:15.379> so

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
perfect fit sleeves because they fit so

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.259 
perfect fit sleeves because they fit so

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
cards so I'm gonna set that over there

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.110 
cards so I'm gonna set that over there
we're<00:02:21.109> gonna<00:02:21.200> move<00:02:21.409> on<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.709> my<00:02:22.310> first<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.939> two

packs of Japanese red collection red
collection<00:02:25.909> I<00:02:26.120> believe<00:02:26.359> was<00:02:26.540> normal

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
collection I believe was normal

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.699

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
victories in English and the card trick

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.429 
victories in English and the card trick
does<00:02:30.920> vary<00:02:31.459> on<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:31.969> set<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:32.659> it<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:32.989> entirely

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
does vary on this set so it is entirely

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.890 
does vary on this set so it is entirely
possible<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:34.189> I<00:02:34.400> mess<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.879> up<00:02:34.939> so<00:02:35.810> we're

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
possible that I mess it up so we're

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.770 
possible that I mess it up so we're
gonna<00:02:35.989> move<00:02:36.170> one<00:02:36.530> card<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.670> front<00:02:38.000> and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
gonna move one card to the front and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.920 
gonna move one card to the front and
we're<00:02:38.900> gonna<00:02:38.989> see<00:02:39.200> what<00:02:39.319> happens<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:41.480> we<00:02:41.540> have

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930

rare holographic card but they don't

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.369 
rare holographic card but they don't
have<00:03:02.419> non<00:03:02.930> Hollow

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
have non Hollow

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.589

rares<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:03.949> set<00:03:04.189> so<00:03:04.430> any<00:03:04.879> rare<00:03:05.180> card<00:03:05.480> is

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
rares in this set so any rare card is

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.420 
rares in this set so any rare card is
going<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.900> be<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.019> hollow<00:03:06.260> or<00:03:06.620> potentially

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
going to be a hollow or potentially

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.640 
going to be a hollow or potentially
better<00:03:07.659> so<00:03:08.659> I'm<00:03:08.719> hoping<00:03:08.930> for<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.139> hollow<00:03:09.379> out<00:03:09.560> of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
better so I'm hoping for a hollow out of

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.809 
better so I'm hoping for a hollow out of
this<00:03:09.769> second<00:03:10.099> pack<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:10.459> we'll<00:03:10.579> see<00:03:10.730> what

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
this second pack but we'll see what

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:11.909 
this second pack but we'll see what
happens

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
happens

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.899

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
correctly it's not only from rising

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.689 
correctly it's not only from rising
rivals<00:03:44.659> but<00:03:45.049> like<00:03:45.769> chasing<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.250> moonlight
