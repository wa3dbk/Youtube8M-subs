is blue here's the Sun all smiling and
happy<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.629> light<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.290> Sun<00:00:40.559> looks<00:00:40.950> right

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
happy the light from the Sun looks right

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.540 
happy the light from the Sun looks right
to<00:00:41.700> our<00:00:42.059> eyes<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.980> made<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.399> of

to our eyes but it's actually made up of
many<00:00:45.000> many<00:00:45.420> different<00:00:46.050> colors<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.489> shine<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
many many different colors if we shine a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
many many different colors if we shine a
sun's<00:00:48.300> light<00:00:48.629> through<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> special<00:00:49.620> piece<00:00:49.829> of

sun's light through a special piece of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.180 
sun's light through a special piece of
glass<00:00:50.309> called<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.820> prism<00:00:51.440> something<00:00:52.440> really

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
glass called a prism something really

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
glass called a prism something really
cool<00:00:53.460> happened

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
cool happened

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.779 
cool happened
the<00:00:54.690> prism<00:00:55.140> breaks<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.680> white<00:00:56.070> light<00:00:56.460> into

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the prism breaks up the white light into

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.810 
the prism breaks up the white light into
all<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.960> different<00:00:58.410> colors<00:00:58.859> isn't<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
all of the different colors isn't that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.450 
all of the different colors isn't that
neat<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.989> colors<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.649> make<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> white

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
neat the colors that make up the white

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.940 
neat the colors that make up the white
light<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:03.409> red<00:01:04.430> orange<00:01:05.430> yellow<00:01:05.729> green<00:01:06.540> blue

indigo and violet do you know where

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.359 
indigo and violet do you know where
house<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.270> those<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.930> same<00:01:13.409> colors

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
house you see those very same colors

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.270 
house you see those very same colors
in<00:01:15.969> a<00:01:16.179> rainbow<00:01:17.399> pool<00:01:18.399> huh

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
in a rainbow pool huh

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.610 
in a rainbow pool huh
when<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.030> mix<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.960> those<00:01:22.110> colors

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
when you mix all of those colors

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.940 
when you mix all of those colors
together<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.400> makes<00:01:23.940> white<00:01:24.390> light<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.740> might

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
together it makes white light you might

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.400 
together it makes white light you might
be<00:01:26.130> wondering<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.880> why<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> sky<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.050> not

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
be wondering then why the sky is not

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.150 
be wondering then why the sky is not
white<00:01:28.860> instead<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.550> blue<00:01:29.930> well<00:01:30.930> let's<00:01:31.800> take<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
white instead of blue well let's take a

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.880 
white instead of blue well let's take a
closer<00:01:32.580> look<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> sky<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.870> sky<00:01:34.320> is

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
closer look at the sky the sky is

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.750 
closer look at the sky the sky is
actually<00:01:35.850> made<00:01:36.120> of<00:01:36.479> teeny<00:01:36.990> tiny<00:01:37.590> molecules<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
actually made of teeny tiny molecules of

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.570 
actually made of teeny tiny molecules of
gas<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.570> water<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.530> can't<00:01:40.830> see<00:01:41.190> them<00:01:41.430> what

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
gas and water you can't see them what

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.570 
gas and water you can't see them what
about<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.760> microscope<00:01:42.510> but<00:01:43.050> they<00:01:43.229> are<00:01:43.500> there

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
about a microscope but they are there

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.790 
about a microscope but they are there
when<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> white<00:01:45.330> light<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.900> Sun<00:01:46.200> hits<00:01:46.530> all

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
when the white light of the Sun hits all

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.700 
when the white light of the Sun hits all
of<00:01:46.860> these<00:01:47.369> molecules<00:01:47.720> they<00:01:48.720> work<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
of these molecules they work just like a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.730 
of these molecules they work just like a
big<00:01:50.160> prism<00:01:51.030> remember<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.110> prism

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
big prism remember that a prism

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.820 
big prism remember that a prism
separates<00:01:53.640> white<00:01:54.270> light<00:01:54.690> into<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
separates white light into all of the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.940 
separates white light into all of the
different<00:01:56.190> colors<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:57.350> here's<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.590> reason

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
different colors now here's the reason

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.200 
different colors now here's the reason
the<00:01:59.100> sky<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.399> blue

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the sky is blue

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.200 
the sky is blue
the<00:02:00.930> prism<00:02:01.470> created<00:02:01.979> by<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.190> molecules<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the prism created by the molecules and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.109 
the prism created by the molecules and
water<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> air<00:02:04.160> reflect<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.399> blue<00:02:05.759> light

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
water in the air reflect the blue light

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.810 
water in the air reflect the blue light
more<00:02:06.840> than<00:02:06.869> any<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.860> other<00:02:08.039> colors<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
more than any of the other colors and

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.840 
more than any of the other colors and
because<00:02:09.539> more<00:02:09.989> blue<00:02:10.380> light<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.860> reflected<00:02:11.670> in

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
because more blue light is reflected in

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.920 
because more blue light is reflected in
the<00:02:12.030> sky<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:13.080> sky<00:02:13.410> looks<00:02:13.770> blue<00:02:14.450> now<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.510> all

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the sky the sky looks blue now we all

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.210 
the sky the sky looks blue now we all
know<00:02:16.470> why<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.890> sky<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.430> blue<00:02:18.620> if<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.190> a

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
know why the sky is blue if you have a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.000
