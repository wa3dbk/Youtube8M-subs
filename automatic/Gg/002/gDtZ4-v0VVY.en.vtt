00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.700
 past and now with news 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.339

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.260
 forgery of the fisheries ministry and 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.730
 aquaculture began to deliver in the week 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.320

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.150
 identification of fishermen 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.950
 professionals on this subject and I 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.870
 I talk now to the lieutenant that 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.270
 is from the environmental military police here 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.430
 a lieutenant with the requirement of the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.559
 professional fishermen to have this 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.929
 qualification of the professional 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.199
 fisherman 's license is a license 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:40.569
 which authorizes persons to act 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.280
 with the professional fisherman differentiated 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.960
 of amateur fishermen 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.710
 why not at the time of inspection 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.969
 being therefore this portfolio of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.729
 professional fisherman is a proven 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.909
 that it survives or has as its 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.139
 main income so that fishing 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.149
 condition it will be able to use 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.280
 specific gear 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.049
 an example of net ropes of spines 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.720
 and other types of materials that are 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.990
 prohibited for the amateur fisherman ae 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.560
 still it will be able to fish without limit of 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.630
 quota 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.810
 in the case of the amateur fisherman he can 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.230
 use only reed reed 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.590
 rewind it to the hand line while 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.600

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.210
 of fish plus one specimen 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.420
 then it is where another differential in which 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.670
 the person will be able to act and so 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.160
 capture more fish and also 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.840

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.330
 usually he could not what 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.070
 happens to the fisherman has been caught without 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.890

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.350
 wallet he has material is seized 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.100
 in case he is caught without the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.990
 portfolio or acting properly 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.850

 working with the professional fisherman but 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.750
 without having the record reconciled with the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.490
 amateur fisherman and so will suffer 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.720
