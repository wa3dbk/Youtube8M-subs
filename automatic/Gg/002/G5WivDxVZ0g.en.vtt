00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
polish on top otherwise the colors will

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.570 
polish on top otherwise the colors will
disappear<00:01:25.750> once<00:01:25.900> water<00:01:26.290> touches<00:01:26.890> your<00:01:27.100> hands

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
disappear once water touches your hands
