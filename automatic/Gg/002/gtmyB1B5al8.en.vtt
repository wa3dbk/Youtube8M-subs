tribe<00:00:36.000> called<00:00:36.300> quest<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.920> three

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190

tribe called quest it's just a three
measure<00:00:38.430> loop<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.899> may<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> most

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
measure loop but it may be the most

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
measure loop but it may be the most
elaborate<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.430> I've<00:00:41.579> done<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.969> far<00:00:42.110> not<00:00:43.110> gonna

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
elaborate one I've done so far not gonna

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
elaborate one I've done so far not gonna
lie<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:43.980> tricky<00:00:44.129> figuring<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
lie it was a little tricky figuring it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.369 
lie it was a little tricky figuring it
out<00:00:44.850> because<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.539> got<00:00:45.719> some<00:00:45.989> interesting

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
out because it's got some interesting

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.680 
out because it's got some interesting
chords<00:00:47.039> maybe<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:47.879> too<00:00:48.059> common<00:00:48.480> chord

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
chords maybe some not too common chord

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.049 
chords maybe some not too common chord
progressions<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
progressions going on but it really is a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.049 
progressions going on but it really is a
very<00:00:51.360> cool<00:00:51.629> very<00:00:51.899> recognizable<00:00:52.739> loop<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.250> if

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
very cool very recognizable loop and if

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.459 
very cool very recognizable loop and if
you<00:00:54.120> put<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.629> effort<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.170> shouldn't

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you put in a little effort it shouldn't

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.010 
you put in a little effort it shouldn't
be<00:00:55.559> too<00:00:55.680> hard<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.539> like<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.629> said<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
be too hard to get like I said it is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.959 
be too hard to get like I said it is
only<00:00:58.050> three<00:00:58.559> measures<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.550> I'm<00:00:59.640> gonna<00:00:59.760> break

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
only three measures so I'm gonna break

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.840 
only three measures so I'm gonna break
it<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.149> measure<00:01:00.690> by<00:01:00.930> measure<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.520> wrote

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it down measure by measure and I wrote

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.359 
it down measure by measure and I wrote
out<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> sheet<00:01:03.390> music<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.110> use<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> free

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
out the sheet music I use this free

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.060 
out the sheet music I use this free
program<00:01:05.580> called<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> musescore<00:01:06.920> which<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
program called the musescore which you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
program called the musescore which you
can<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.549> free<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:08.939> musescore<00:01:09.450> org

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
can get for free I think musescore org

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
can get for free I think musescore org
or<00:01:10.409> something<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:10.979> anyway<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.790> write<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
or something but anyway I write out the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
or something but anyway I write out the
sheet<00:01:12.390> music<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.229> hopefully<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> can

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
sheet music for you so hopefully you can

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.320 
sheet music for you so hopefully you can
follow<00:01:13.890> along<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.880> also<00:01:15.030> put

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
follow along with that I will also put

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.840 
follow along with that I will also put
up<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> annotations<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.380> usual<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
up the annotations as usual so if you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.100 
up the annotations as usual so if you
don't<00:01:18.000> read<00:01:18.180> sheet<00:01:18.360> music<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.930> follow

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
don't read sheet music you can follow

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.890 
don't read sheet music you can follow
that<00:01:19.380> along<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.799> well<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.509> would<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> point

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that along as well I would like to point

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.020 
that along as well I would like to point
out<00:01:22.110> though<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:23.009> sheet<00:01:23.430> music<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
out though that the sheet music is a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.780 
out though that the sheet music is a
little<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.420> off<00:01:24.799> rhythmically<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.580> notes

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
little bit off rhythmically the notes

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.390 
little bit off rhythmically the notes
are<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.119> correct<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.470> first<00:01:28.890> part<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
are all correct but the first part is a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
are all correct but the first part is a
little<00:01:29.549> bit<00:01:29.700> rhythmically<00:01:30.299> off<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
little bit rhythmically off so if you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.330 
little bit rhythmically off so if you
read<00:01:31.320> sheet<00:01:31.530> music<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
read sheet music and you think it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.770 
read sheet music and you think it
doesn't<00:01:32.490> sound<00:01:32.790> quite<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.450> play<00:01:33.630> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
doesn't sound quite right to play it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
doesn't sound quite right to play it
straight<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:35.220> couldn't<00:01:35.759> figure<00:01:35.939> out

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
straight like that I couldn't figure out

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.580 
straight like that I couldn't figure out
how<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.420> quarter<00:01:36.720> note<00:01:36.869> triplets<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.439> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
how to do quarter note triplets in this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.910 
how to do quarter note triplets in this
program<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:39.020> using<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> original<00:01:40.290> song<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
program so using the original song as a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
program so using the original song as a
guide<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.150> how<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> rhythm<00:01:42.509> should<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:42.930> but

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
guide as to how the rhythm should go but

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
guide as to how the rhythm should go but
the<00:01:43.259> notes<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.799> correct<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.600> anyway

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the notes are all correct so anyway

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.590 
the notes are all correct so anyway
here's<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> first<00:01:46.079> measure

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:12.000 

here's<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.720> first<00:01:53.840> chord<00:01:54.200> yeah

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.680 

here's<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.100> second<00:02:13.430> measure

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.240 

so<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.750> hit<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.900> first<00:02:21.140> together<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.070> this

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
so you hit the first together like this

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:36.710 
so you hit the first together like this
and<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:24.470> f-sharp<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.070> middle

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.059 

so<00:02:37.720> here's<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.020> first<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.770> second

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
so here's the first and the second

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:49.740 
so here's the first and the second
measure<00:02:39.250> together

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:02.770 

then<00:02:50.750> here's<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.020> third<00:02:51.260> measure<00:03:01.600> two<00:03:02.600> notes

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
then here's the third measure two notes

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:16.550 
then here's the third measure two notes
in<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.020> right<00:03:03.050> hand

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:43.059 

so<00:03:17.560> here's<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.890> whole<00:03:18.040> three<00:03:18.310> measure<00:03:18.519> whoo

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.890 

now<00:03:44.069> on<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> original<00:03:44.730> he<00:03:44.819> does<00:03:45.000> at<00:03:45.150> about<00:03:45.390> 98

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
now on the original he does at about 98

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.210 
now on the original he does at about 98
beats<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.290> minute<00:03:46.410> that's<00:03:46.739> where<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.980> had<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.190> be

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
beats a minute that's where I had to be

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.760 
beats a minute that's where I had to be
going<00:03:47.610> before<00:03:48.000> I'll<00:03:48.630> slow<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:48.989> down<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.560> about

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
going before I'll slow it down to about

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.670 
going before I'll slow it down to about
60<00:03:50.420> I'll<00:03:51.420> play<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.750> through<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:51.989> few<00:03:52.050> times<00:03:52.410> on

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
60 I'll play it through a few times on

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.949 
60 I'll play it through a few times on
that<00:03:53.000> because<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.209> definitely<00:03:54.450> one<00:03:54.840> that

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
that because this is definitely one that

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.780 
that because this is definitely one that
you're<00:03:55.050> going<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.260> want<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.470> play<00:03:55.680> with<00:03:55.790> at

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
you're going to want to play with at

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.009 
you're going to want to play with at
least<00:03:56.910> practice<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.480> first<00:03:57.599> probably<00:03:57.989> a

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
least practice it first probably a

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.900 
least practice it first probably a
little<00:03:58.140> bit<00:03:58.319> slower<00:03:58.590> than<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.920> original

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
little bit slower than the original

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:55.890 
little bit slower than the original
tempo<00:04:00.349> so<00:04:01.349> here<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.680> at<00:04:01.950> 60<00:04:02.459> beats<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.790> minute

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.060 

and<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:57.080> just<00:04:57.260> keeps<00:04:57.440> repeating<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.950> whole

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
and that just keeps repeating the whole

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.050 
and that just keeps repeating the whole
time<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:59.800> I'm<00:05:00.800> gonna<00:05:00.980> put<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.280> whole<00:05:01.430> three

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
time so I'm gonna put the whole three

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.850 
time so I'm gonna put the whole three
bars<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.510> sheet<00:05:02.690> music<00:05:02.840> up<00:05:03.200> here<00:05:03.230> if<00:05:03.650> you

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
bars of sheet music up here if you

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.260 
bars of sheet music up here if you
haven't<00:05:04.190> already<00:05:04.340> you'll<00:05:04.730> probably<00:05:04.910> want<00:05:05.210> to

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
haven't already you'll probably want to

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.170 
haven't already you'll probably want to
fullscreen<00:05:05.480> this<00:05:06.080> part<00:05:06.380> because<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:08.060> would

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
fullscreen this part because that would

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.030 
fullscreen this part because that would
be<00:05:08.270> much<00:05:08.420> easier<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.810> see<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.230> sheet<00:05:09.620> music

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
be much easier to see the sheet music

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.120 
be much easier to see the sheet music
and<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:11.450> hope<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.690> guys<00:05:11.840> dug<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.230> tutorial<00:05:12.770> if
