is the squid this is like our third

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.620 
is the squid this is like our third
point<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.380> we<00:02:20.530> got<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.820> if<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:22.240> don't<00:02:22.450> give

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
point that we got so if we don't give

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.410 
point that we got so if we don't give
away<00:02:22.780> he'll<00:02:23.140> probably<00:02:23.440> be<00:02:23.739> in<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.030> there's
