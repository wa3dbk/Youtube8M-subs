00:00:04.828 --> 00:00:06.835
 Two other candidates from the "young" 

00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:10.327
 will have to sing again, and Demi Lovato will decide 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.368
 which candidate will remain in the competition. 

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.859
 It's a lot of pressure now. 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.803
 The first to sing to survive is CeCe Frey. 

00:00:20.297 --> 00:00:25.102
 CeCe Frey - Performance Survival On My Own - Nikka Costa 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:53.260
 Until the sun 

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:57.797
 the morning appear, 

00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:06.305
 making light of all my fears. 

00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:09.581
 I wipe away tears 

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.991
 that I never showed 

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:20.515
 here in my loneliness. 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.007
 When I'm down and feeling depressed. 

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:36.779
 I close my eyes so I can be with you. 

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:41.636
 Oh, baby be strong for me. 

00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:46.385
 Baby, belong to me. 

00:01:46.798 --> 00:01:49.373
 Help me through. 

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:53.943
 Help me, I need you. 

00:01:54.684 --> 00:01:57.765
 Sometimes I wonder 

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.757
 where I've been. 

00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:05.716
 Who I am. 

00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:10.213
 If I fit. 

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.742
 I can not win, 

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.831
 but I can be strong 

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:24.115
 here in my loneliness. 

00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:29.150
 On here... 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:34.477
 On here... 

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:43.695
 in my loneliness. 

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:57.221
 CeCe? 

00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:01.713
 Do you know what I think? 

00:03:02.853 --> 00:03:05.655
 I have no idea what Willie is going to sing ... 

00:03:05.923 --> 00:03:08.522
 but in my opinion, you just saved yourself. 

00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:10.364
 Because I thought it was very good! 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.033
 I do not know the song very well, but you did a great job. 

00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:19.874
 I thought it was amazing! Congratulations. 

00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:26.640
 Last night, I thought you had an 'identity crisis'. 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.139
 I felt like you were trying to look like Ke $ ha or something. 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.375
 But tonight, you got it right. 

00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:35.699
 It was a powerful performance. It was very impressive. 

00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:41.799
 The CeCe question is that I did not understand why 

00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:44.167
 You did not do something like that last night. 

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:47.364
 Last night, in all that crazy makeup, 

00:03:47.532 --> 00:03:49.645
 You looked like a clown. 

00:03:50.408 --> 00:03:54.444
 The music was wrong. You're rolling on the stage. 

00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:56.831
 That's why we liked you the first time, 

00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:00.683
 it was simply good music, very well sung. 

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:05.391
 "Thank you, Simon. "We'll see if that'll be enough." 

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:07.207
 Demi can not comment now, 

00:04:07.402 --> 00:04:09.939
 because he will make his great decision in a little while. 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.888
 "Good luck today, my dear. -Good luck. 

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:15.531
 Next, the second candidate of the group 'young': Willie Jones. 

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.774
 He will sing to continue in the competition, 

00:04:18.062 --> 00:04:20.282
 and then Demi Lovato will decide which candidate 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.633
 will be one of the 12 finalists, and who will return home.
