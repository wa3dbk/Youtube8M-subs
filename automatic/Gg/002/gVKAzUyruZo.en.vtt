it's actually one of my favorite Marvel

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.710 
it's actually one of my favorite Marvel
Legends<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.680> I'll<00:00:22.769> explain<00:00:23.160> why<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:24.480> first

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
Legends and I'll explain why the first

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.490 
Legends and I'll explain why the first
thing<00:00:24.840> being<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.650> think<00:00:27.260> she's<00:00:28.260> all

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
thing being that I think she's all

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.870 
thing being that I think she's all
original<00:00:29.070> there's<00:00:29.220> no<00:00:29.340> parts<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.789> they

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
original there's no parts that they

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
original there's no parts that they
stole<00:00:30.150> from<00:00:30.359> anybody<00:00:30.720> else<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.890> always

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
stole from anybody else and I always

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.709 
stole from anybody else and I always
like<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.090> figure<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.450> don't

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
like to have that in a figure I don't

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.020 
like to have that in a figure I don't
really<00:00:33.930> care<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.920> things<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.520> just

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
really care for the things that are just

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 
really care for the things that are just
copies<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.630> everything<00:00:37.110> else<00:00:37.290> over<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.950> over

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
copies of everything else over and over

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.970 
copies of everything else over and over
again<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.710> her

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
again so I really do like that about her

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.110 
again so I really do like that about her
she<00:00:41.579> stands<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.390> about<00:00:43.280> 5<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.550> 3/4<00:00:45.090> inches

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
she stands just about 5 and 3/4 inches

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
she stands just about 5 and 3/4 inches
tall<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.629> she's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> good<00:00:46.050> scale<00:00:46.530> she<00:00:47.010> comes

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
tall so she's a good scale she comes

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
tall so she's a good scale she comes
with<00:00:47.370> her<00:00:47.550> little<00:00:47.789> buddy<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.239> Lockheed

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
with her little buddy the Lockheed

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.500 
with her little buddy the Lockheed
dragon<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.559> Lockheed<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> dragon<00:00:50.610> he's<00:00:51.329> got

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
dragon or Lockheed the dragon he's got

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
dragon or Lockheed the dragon he's got
this<00:00:51.660> little<00:00:51.840> yellow<00:00:52.410> base<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.100> pegs<00:00:53.370> into

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
this little yellow base that pegs into

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.150 
this little yellow base that pegs into
his<00:00:53.760> feet<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:55.170> goes<00:00:55.739> onto<00:00:55.980> her

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
his feet there and that goes onto her

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
his feet there and that goes onto her
arm<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.550> saw<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.149> she<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.420> hold<00:00:57.600> him<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
arm as you saw so she can hold him I

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
arm as you saw so she can hold him I
don't<00:00:58.859> really<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.280> why<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.609> removable

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
don't really know why it's removable

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
don't really know why it's removable
since<00:01:00.480> he<00:01:00.600> probably<00:01:00.870> can't<00:01:01.170> stand<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.649> his<00:01:01.890> own

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
since he probably can't stand on his own

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.399 
since he probably can't stand on his own
but<00:01:02.670> still<00:01:02.910> its<00:01:03.090> sculpted<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:04.049> well<00:01:04.199> it's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
but still its sculpted really well it's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.980 
but still its sculpted really well it's
a<00:01:04.470> cool<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:05.010> accessory<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.810> got

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850

don't<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> lot<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> figures<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.829> that's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
don't have on a lot of figures so that's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.560 
don't have on a lot of figures so that's
another<00:01:47.189> reason<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.180> one

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
another reason I really like this one

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.020 
another reason I really like this one
as<00:01:48.720> far<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:48.960> articulation<00:01:49.680> goes<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.340> head<00:01:50.610> can

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
as far as articulation goes the head can

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.780 
as far as articulation goes the head can
look<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.829> not<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> huge<00:01:53.369> range<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
look up and down not a huge range of

look up and down not a huge range of
motion<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.210> due<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> hair<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.079> can

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
motion there due to the hair but it can

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.590 
motion there due to the hair but it can

which<00:02:07.290> works<00:02:07.500> really<00:02:07.619> well<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:09.179> waist

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
which works really well and a waist

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.869 
which works really well and a waist
twist<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> best<00:02:11.069> waist<00:02:11.340> twist<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:11.790> a

twist not the best waist twist it's a

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.590 
twist not the best waist twist it's a
little<00:02:12.150> bit<00:02:12.270> ugly<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:12.629> it's<00:02:13.230> still

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
little bit ugly but it's still

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.620 
little bit ugly but it's still
works<00:02:13.720> really<00:02:13.900> well<00:02:14.170> T<00:02:14.950> jointed<00:02:15.400> hips<00:02:15.640> it's

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
works really well T jointed hips it's

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.150 
works really well T jointed hips it's
kind<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> old<00:02:17.230> school<00:02:17.410> ball<00:02:17.920> peg

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
kind of like the old school ball peg

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.100 
kind of like the old school ball peg
like<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.520> old<00:02:18.670> Ninja<00:02:18.910> Turtles<00:02:19.360> or<00:02:19.570> actually

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
like that old Ninja Turtles or actually

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.620 
like that old Ninja Turtles or actually
the<00:02:20.290> Marvel<00:02:20.860> Legends<00:02:21.250> psylocke<00:02:22.000> has<00:02:22.240> similar

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
the Marvel Legends psylocke has similar

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.980 
the Marvel Legends psylocke has similar
hips

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
hips

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.140 
hips
the<00:02:23.500> first<00:02:24.010> batch<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.670> first<00:02:24.880> original

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the first batch the first original

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.980 
the first batch the first original
Psylocke<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:26.560> effectively<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.690> get<00:02:28.840> all

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
Psylocke so it's effectively you get all

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.810 
Psylocke so it's effectively you get all
the<00:02:29.110> range<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.380> motion<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.680> need<00:02:29.950> can't<00:02:30.550> flare

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
the range of motion you need can't flare

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.970 
the range of motion you need can't flare
out<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> side<00:02:31.360> too<00:02:31.750> too<00:02:32.020> much<00:02:32.320> but<00:02:32.800> if<00:02:32.890> you

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
out to the side too too much but if you

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.030 
out to the side too too much but if you
rotate<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:34.150> rotate<00:02:34.570> again<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.470> can<00:02:35.770> and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
rotate and then rotate again you can and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.490 
rotate and then rotate again you can and
it<00:02:36.400> doesn't<00:02:36.580> look<00:02:36.760> too<00:02:36.940> bad<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.210> I'm<00:02:37.960> okay<00:02:38.320> with

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
it doesn't look too bad so I'm okay with

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.830 
it doesn't look too bad so I'm okay with
that<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.610> that's<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.150> she<00:02:40.180> has<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.600> cut

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
that and that's because she has that cut

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.960 
that and that's because she has that cut
joint<00:02:41.050> there<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.470> thigh<00:02:41.680> double<00:02:42.670> jointed

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970

joint there in the thigh double jointed
knees<00:02:43.170> shin<00:02:44.170> swivel<00:02:44.500> at<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.650> top<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> boot

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
knees shin swivel at the top of the boot

an ankle pivot an ankle rocker and a toe

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.640 
an ankle pivot an ankle rocker and a toe
pivot<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.690> she's<00:02:49.960> just<00:02:50.200> loaded<00:02:50.590> with

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
pivot so she's just loaded with

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.880 
pivot so she's just loaded with
articulation<00:02:51.390> definitely<00:02:52.390> easy<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.140> pose<00:02:53.380> and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
articulation definitely easy to pose and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.830 
articulation definitely easy to pose and
it's<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.460> good<00:02:54.640> looking<00:02:54.940> figure<00:02:55.210> definitely<00:02:55.810> a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
it's a good looking figure definitely a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.200 
it's a good looking figure definitely a
nice<00:02:56.020> x-men<00:02:56.500> figure<00:02:56.890> nice<00:02:57.460> sculpt<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.030> don't

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
nice x-men figure nice sculpt I don't

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.580 
nice x-men figure nice sculpt I don't
really<00:02:58.330> know<00:02:58.510> why<00:02:58.720> they<00:02:58.960> didn't<00:02:59.230> use<00:02:59.320> any<00:02:59.500> of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
really know why they didn't use any of

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.230 
really know why they didn't use any of
these<00:02:59.800> parts<00:03:00.160> again<00:03:00.430> at<00:03:00.760> least<00:03:00.850> not<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.180> I

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
these parts again at least not that I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.150 
these parts again at least not that I
can<00:03:01.450> think<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.870> because<00:03:02.440> they're<00:03:02.770> pretty<00:03:02.980> good

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
can think of because they're pretty good

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160 
can think of because they're pretty good
even<00:03:03.880> though<00:03:04.030> she's<00:03:04.210> a<00:03:04.240> little<00:03:04.330> bit<00:03:04.630> small<00:03:04.990> and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
even though she's a little bit small and

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.540 
even though she's a little bit small and
has<00:03:05.350> what<00:03:05.590> some<00:03:05.770> people<00:03:05.860> call<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.160> noodle

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
has what some people call the noodle

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.760 
has what some people call the noodle
arms<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:07.450> still<00:03:08.110> think<00:03:08.290> it's<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.470> pretty<00:03:08.680> good

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
arms I still think it's a pretty good

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.530 
arms I still think it's a pretty good
figure<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.520> I<00:03:09.550> do<00:03:09.670> recommend<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.360> and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
figure so I do recommend it and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.540 
figure so I do recommend it and
especially<00:03:11.470> if<00:03:11.530> you're<00:03:11.650> an<00:03:11.740> x-men<00:03:12.040> fan<00:03:12.280> you

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
especially if you're an x-men fan you

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.980 
especially if you're an x-men fan you
should<00:03:12.580> probably<00:03:12.940> pick<00:03:13.210> this<00:03:13.390> figure<00:03:13.750> up

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
should probably pick this figure up

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.750 
should probably pick this figure up
