maybe<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.530> jumped<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.009> something<00:01:32.340> but

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
maybe if he jumped or something but

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.249 
maybe if he jumped or something but
turns<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.750> enough<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.170> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
turns out that was just enough and now

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.050
