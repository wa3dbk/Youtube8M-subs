00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The BMW M4 F82 tuned by Hamann Motorsport

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Akrapovic Exhaust System

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The M4 started in April 2014 and replaced the M3 E92

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It took the step back from the V8 (E92) )to the inline 6 cylinder which we know from the M3 E36 /  M3 E46

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but this time something changed

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it was the first M with an inline 6 cylinder which was biturbo charged

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
BMW reduce the displacment from 4.0L (V8 E92) to 3.0L (inline6)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but with 431 HP they put in near the same power like the E92 (420 HP) got + reduce the fuel consumption
