00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
getting better at what they do they can

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.070 
getting better at what they do they can
see<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> absolute<00:01:08.820> value<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.360> podcasting

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
see the absolute value in podcasting

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.350 
see the absolute value in podcasting
they<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.190> absolute<00:01:11.520> value<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.120> using

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
they can see the absolute value in using

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.510 
they can see the absolute value in using
that<00:01:12.570> technology<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.070> powerful<00:01:14.280> way

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that technology in a really powerful way

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.580 
that technology in a really powerful way
and<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.090> they'll<00:01:15.390> pursue<00:01:15.870> professional

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and so they'll pursue professional

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.880 
and so they'll pursue professional
development<00:01:17.430> amongst<00:01:18.090> themselves

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
development amongst themselves

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.690 
development amongst themselves
absolutely<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.010> possible<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.460> other

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
absolutely it's possible for other

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700 
absolutely it's possible for other
schools<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.510> do<00:01:21.720> because<00:01:22.320> it's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
schools to do what we do because it's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
schools to do what we do because it's
about<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> pedagogy<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.700> about<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> thinking

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
about the pedagogy is about the thinking

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
about the pedagogy is about the thinking
it's<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.740> shared<00:01:26.280> belief<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it's about the shared belief and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.430 
it's about the shared belief and
understandings<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.390> staff<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.900> students<00:01:28.260> to

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
understandings of staff and students to

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.230 
understandings of staff and students to
say<00:01:28.620> you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.010> can<00:01:29.130> work<00:01:29.340> differently<00:01:29.760> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
say you know we can work differently to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
say you know we can work differently to
get<00:01:30.450> better<00:01:30.930> outcomes<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.620> you<00:01:31.710> might<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:32.070> an

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
get better outcomes and you might get an

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160 
get better outcomes and you might get an
additional<00:01:32.580> resetting<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.990> we're<00:01:34.140> not

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
additional resetting so we're not

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
additional resetting so we're not
sitting<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.800> classroom<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.640> teacher

that they all have the capacity to say I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
that they all have the capacity to say I
get<00:01:47.730> how<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.120> technology<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.960> used<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.410 
get how this technology can be used and
I'll<00:01:49.890> use<00:01:50.160> really<00:01:50.460> solid<00:01:50.940> teaching<00:01:51.300> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
I'll use really solid teaching and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510 
I'll use really solid teaching and
learning<00:01:51.540> processes<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.830> that<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.160> know<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
learning processes so that we know the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.300 
learning processes so that we know the
learning<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.910> real<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.300> it's<00:01:54.450> right<00:01:55.070> arm<00:01:56.070> is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
learning is real and it's right arm is

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.370 
learning is real and it's right arm is
absolutely<00:01:56.820> no<00:01:57.300> text<00:01:57.570> box<00:01:57.720> in<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:57.930> classroom

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
absolutely no text box in my classroom

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.760 
absolutely no text box in my classroom
which<00:01:58.680> has<00:01:59.010> enabled<00:01:59.400> me<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> be<00:02:00.770> hugely

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
which has enabled me to be hugely

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.190 
which has enabled me to be hugely
flexible<00:02:02.370> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.760> that<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> teach<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.990> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
flexible in the way that I teach and it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.510 
flexible in the way that I teach and it
actually<00:02:04.320> helps<00:02:04.710> them<00:02:04.800> expand<00:02:05.250> their

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
actually helps them expand their

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.749 
actually helps them expand their
thinking<00:02:06.170> if<00:02:07.170> you're<00:02:07.470> challenging<00:02:08.250> them<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
thinking if you're challenging them and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.420 
thinking if you're challenging them and
you<00:02:09.000> know<00:02:09.209> where<00:02:09.450> they're<00:02:09.629> at<00:02:09.769> then<00:02:10.769> generally

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
you know where they're at then generally

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
you know where they're at then generally
kids<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:12.030> come<00:02:12.239> along<00:02:12.480> they'll<00:02:12.870> they'll

learner I can I'm more resourceful the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.270 
learner I can I'm more resourceful the
way<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.690> learned<00:02:33.990> best<00:02:34.290> has<00:02:34.500> been<00:02:34.680> identified

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
way I learned best has been identified

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.870 
way I learned best has been identified
and<00:02:35.840> that's<00:02:36.840> how<00:02:37.140> i<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.410> my<00:02:37.830> learning<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
and that's how i do my learning all the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.970 
and that's how i do my learning all the
time<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.300> people<00:02:40.080> walk<00:02:40.260> into<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.590> school<00:02:40.800> may

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
time now people walk into the school may

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.100 
time now people walk into the school may
visit<00:02:41.160> they<00:02:41.520> look<00:02:41.850> around<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.120> go<00:02:42.240> wow<00:02:42.420> free

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
visit they look around and go wow free

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.690 
visit they look around and go wow free
bodies<00:02:43.410> engaged<00:02:43.770> in<00:02:44.010> learning<00:02:44.160> when<00:02:44.460> we<00:02:44.550> go

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
bodies engaged in learning when we go

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.240 
bodies engaged in learning when we go
yeah<00:02:45.060> that's<00:02:45.990> our<00:02:46.170> expectation<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.040> that's

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
yeah that's our expectation and that's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.640 
yeah that's our expectation and that's
