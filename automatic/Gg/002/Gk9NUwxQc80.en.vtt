00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
inventory of the forest and there I had

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.120 
inventory of the forest and there I had
my<00:02:43.760> first<00:02:44.150> real<00:02:44.769> experiences<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:45.950> insights

my first real experiences and insights
getting<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:46.940> know<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.420> forest<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.200> we

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
getting to know the forest and we

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.680 
getting to know the forest and we
noticed<00:02:49.310> there<00:02:49.550> was<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:49.819> big<00:02:50.030> problem<00:02:50.330> with

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
noticed there was this big problem with

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.979 
noticed there was this big problem with
the<00:02:50.840> regeneration<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.040> trees<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:52.989> I

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
the regeneration of the trees so I

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.020 
the regeneration of the trees so I
started<00:02:54.410> realizing<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.310> sometimes<00:02:55.580> you

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
started realizing that sometimes you

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.350 
started realizing that sometimes you
have<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.269> look<00:02:56.390> for<00:02:56.660> solutions<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.560> unforeseen

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
corners of the science fields so I wrote

developing<00:04:02.269> further<00:04:02.600> but<00:04:02.959> that<00:04:03.109> they<00:04:03.260> do<00:04:03.319> have

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
developing further but that they do have

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.830 
developing further but that they do have
an<00:04:03.950> inherent<00:04:04.400> capability<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.450> understanding

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
an inherent capability of understanding

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.250 
an inherent capability of understanding
human<00:04:06.880> communication<00:04:07.880> even<00:04:08.420> grammar<00:04:08.900> and

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
human communication even grammar and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.400 
human communication even grammar and
basic<00:04:10.010> understanding<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.970> abstract<00:04:11.930> thinking

basic understanding of abstract thinking

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.140 
basic understanding of abstract thinking
in<00:04:12.650> algebra<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:15.019> really<00:04:15.489> got<00:04:16.489> me<00:04:16.729> on<00:04:16.940> a

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
in algebra so that really got me on a

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.569 
in algebra so that really got me on a
completely<00:04:17.750> different<00:04:18.229> trail<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.160> seeing

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
completely different trail and seeing

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.550 
completely different trail and seeing
what<00:04:19.789> was<00:04:19.940> happening<00:04:20.389> to<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.630> orangutans<00:04:21.229> in

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
what was happening to the orangutans in

what was happening to the orangutans in
the<00:04:22.099> most<00:04:22.250> horrible<00:04:22.669> conditions<00:04:23.419> being<00:04:23.630> kept

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
the most horrible conditions being kept

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.020 
the most horrible conditions being kept
somewhere<00:04:24.380> even<00:04:24.650> uses<00:04:24.979> prostitutes<00:04:25.280> others

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
somewhere even uses prostitutes others

somewhere even uses prostitutes others
were<00:04:26.690> being<00:04:26.870> eaten<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:29.060> felt<00:04:29.389> this<00:04:30.080> is

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
were being eaten and I just felt this is

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.140 
were being eaten and I just felt this is
not<00:04:30.770> right<00:04:31.130> this<00:04:31.580> is<00:04:31.720> injustice<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:34.280> looked

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
not right this is injustice so I looked

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.700 
not right this is injustice so I looked
at<00:04:35.330> what<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.659> other<00:04:35.690> projects<00:04:36.260> were<00:04:36.409> doing

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
at what the other projects were doing

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.260 
at what the other projects were doing
but<00:04:36.890> most<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.280> them<00:04:37.490> had<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.789> do<00:04:37.909> more<00:04:38.090> with

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
but most of them had to do more with

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.720 
but most of them had to do more with
tourism

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
tourism

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.140 
tourism
nice<00:04:40.360> pictures<00:04:40.870> then<00:04:41.590> really<00:04:42.190> with<00:04:42.520> providing

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
nice pictures then really with providing

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.620 
nice pictures then really with providing
these<00:04:43.300> orangutangs<00:04:43.960> with<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.340> safe-haven<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:46.600> I

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
these orangutangs with a safe-haven so I

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.540 
these orangutangs with a safe-haven so I
decided<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.380> do<00:04:47.680> something<00:04:47.920> myself

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
decided to do something myself

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.890 
decided to do something myself
so<00:04:48.960> what<00:04:49.960> can<00:04:50.380> I<00:04:50.500> possibly<00:04:51.010> do<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.900> protect

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
so what can I possibly do to protect

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.560 
so what can I possibly do to protect
that<00:04:53.080> house<00:04:53.350> of<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.770> orangutans<00:04:54.100> and<00:04:54.640> so<00:04:55.420> that

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
that house of the orangutans and so that

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.390 
that house of the orangutans and so that
might<00:04:55.780> which<00:04:55.960> in<00:04:56.170> my<00:04:56.320> daughter<00:04:56.590> will<00:04:57.070> be<00:04:57.100> safe

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
might which in my daughter will be safe

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.320 
might which in my daughter will be safe
in<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.210> trees<00:04:58.480> there<00:04:58.720> so<00:04:59.560> I<00:04:59.590> thought<00:05:00.270> wait<00:05:01.270> a

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
in the trees there so I thought wait a

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.390 
in the trees there so I thought wait a
minute<00:05:01.600> when<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.840> got<00:05:02.110> married<00:05:02.350> I<00:05:02.890> had<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.250> pay

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
the dowry in the form of six sugar bombs

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.480 
the dowry in the form of six sugar bombs
and<00:05:05.380> I've<00:05:05.470> been<00:05:05.650> studying<00:05:06.100> them<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.430> they

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
and I've been studying them and they

have an incredible productivity and

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.470 
have an incredible productivity and
they've<00:05:08.800> all<00:05:08.950> these<00:05:09.130> ecological<00:05:09.480> benefits

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
they've all these ecological benefits

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.900 
they've all these ecological benefits
and<00:05:10.720> economically<00:05:11.320> interesting<00:05:12.190> why

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
and economically interesting why

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.800 
and economically interesting why
shouldn't<00:05:13.540> I<00:05:13.720> do<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:15.240> in<00:05:16.240> order<00:05:16.450> to<00:05:16.600> make

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
shouldn't I do that in order to make

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.940 
shouldn't I do that in order to make
that<00:05:17.500> sugar<00:05:18.040> pom<00:05:18.540> process<00:05:19.540> possible<00:05:19.900> you<00:05:20.770> need

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
that sugar pom process possible you need

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.770 
that sugar pom process possible you need
a<00:05:21.160> range<00:05:21.400> of<00:05:21.580> technologies<00:05:22.210> but<00:05:22.480> you<00:05:22.660> also

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
a range of technologies but you also

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.230 
a range of technologies but you also
need<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.470> range<00:05:24.010> of<00:05:24.280> organizational

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
need a range of organizational
