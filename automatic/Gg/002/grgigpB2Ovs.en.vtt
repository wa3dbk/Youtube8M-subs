00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.240
 so little back on the net botwin little 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 after two days of use so you 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.509
 can see I used the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.450
 green and turquoise blue protections 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.430
 supplied with double scotch 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.980
 it's not very pretty but at least that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.449
 protects the machine not hesitate really 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.560
 used because we tend to go 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.910
 banging in front and behind 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.650
 So that's for sure the blue parts 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 turquoise and green that's when they 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.050
 fall so it's a beautiful machine 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.809
 super machine here so the button 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.559
 ignition at the rear the plug for 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.829
 recharge a lot of tutorials exists on 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.559
 internet and a majority in 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 English will allow you to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.890
 find out more about the machine 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.660
 how to use it and that's what 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.059
 side there the panel behind which is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.610
 find the battery there the black border 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.690
 with the letters behind is removing 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.640
 relatively easy in when there are 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.129
 tutor to actually access alajuela 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 re-inflated she rather deflates this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.059
 which allows a quick start 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.640
 hastily easy on the other side so 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.130
 on the left side in the same panel in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.869
 imitation leather is therefore the map 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.620
 shit of the machine 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.290
 the left crankset 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.230
 here it's in my case I'm right-handed 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.690
 at a meter 87 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.010
 it moves a lot at the beginning and that's the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.120
 part that will take the most so 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.160
 do not hesitate to protect it I pass them 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.620
 to protect me for the blow so I'm going 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.680
 add a little bit of this kind of 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.060
 foam the handle that can lift 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.770
 the machine is a little sore hand 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.030
 the same if it is still 13 kilos 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.080
 so to enter a building 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.050
 carry five minutes they are too 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.060
 changed two hours c maximum two hours 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.530
 two and a half years to lay 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.850
 completely 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.080
 that's enough so there yes 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.450
 the little little protection that 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.620
 I had also put no hesitation in scotcher 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.140
 on the imitation leather it does not hold very 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.970
 well doubt the scotch here on brest 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.470
 the plastic and the bottom bracket no 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.450
 problem it is very very good and it 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.050
 not bad so 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.090
 so good machine on two days I 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.140
 had to do 45 minutes to resume 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.120
 kick the balanced late is great 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.920
 practice here you can see just 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.160
 this aside on the charger it plugs 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.040
 on a normal electrical outlet and that's 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.170
 a relatively simple plug to understand 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.060
 and a little language part is it 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
 must put up and branch 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.739
 and then after a little light when 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.470
 it rolls it recharges when it's towards its 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.450
 girl whose load is so here is so 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.650
 to return to the grip there is 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.020
 several videos you'll see read 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.130
 in the description or appear on the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.060
 video if you have enabled the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.800
 adaptations 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.000
 to the site of nay mode one with also 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.910
 a very good explanation from here again 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 for English-speaking retailers 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.280
 inside the machine making the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 defeat 70 super machine now so 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.140
 there are some demo videos of my 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.500
 first tests 45 minutes an hour 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.480
 Max not great for a cumulative spread on 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.100
 two days early 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.720
 the light came and after that it broke 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.209
 there here so just a little aside on 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.150
 the app on the app so at the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:26.459
 beginning there is the possibility therefore to have 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:31.380
 a speed restriction must be supported 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.209
 on the button with the small gauge that 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.110
 is at the top finally that represented in 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:41.060
 water will be listed the glue all and that is in 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.650
 bottom right and so when checked 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.630
 this button you're going to have a tool a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.640
 little warning that will be put in place 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.900
 and who says a lot that you are in 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.359
 beat unbridled you can wait 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.280
 than one kilometer hour announced in the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.140
 specs after on the distance I do not have 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.049
 still tested the ads 20 km 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.519
 max autonomy in relation to my weight 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.040
 I think I have a rather 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.060
 drives this kilometer 10 to 15 km to 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.220
 test after so as 100% 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.329
 beginner I had never done before I 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.709
 really recommend a machine it is 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:16.320
 nice she is very soft at the foot 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.760
 after that it hurts the legs 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.290
 expect to see a little bit of 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.460
 pain inside the feet 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.260
 tense muscles at the end of the day 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.150
 but it's really fun once 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.060
 do it and walk around 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.640
 streets and a very slippery feeling 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.440
 nice so if you hesitate between 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.940
 several machines 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.470
 it costs a bit more but it's 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.310
 the most accomplished in terms of design is 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.650
 not a copy of the solo he who is the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.600
 first of an electric cycle have been 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.140
 made a name a little over three years 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.390
 I believe and behind that in addition to that 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.470
 the application the mobile application is 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.660
 a real plus finds in terms of 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.430
 customization of led etc 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.680
 it really makes the object fans here 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.820
 I hope it has been in your 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.010
 choice if you did not buy the 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.010
 machine is in any case soon thank you
