00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
Thibodeau's or coach we're going to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.779 
Thibodeau's or coach we're going to
compete<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.749> we're<00:01:45.710> going<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:45.859> be<00:01:46.340> prepared

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
compete and we're going to be prepared

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.730 
compete and we're going to be prepared
the<00:01:47.659> thing<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.170> guess<00:01:48.380> my<00:01:48.590> biggest

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
the thing that I guess my biggest

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.039 
the thing that I guess my biggest
concern<00:01:49.189> is<00:01:49.219> that<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.789> know<00:01:50.179> without<00:01:50.479> Derrick

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
concern is that you know without Derrick

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.380 
concern is that you know without Derrick
and<00:01:51.200> some<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:51.920> changes<00:01:52.039> we<00:01:52.340> made<00:01:52.549> you<00:01:53.299> know

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
and some of the changes we made you know

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.330 
and some of the changes we made you know
our<00:01:53.509> ability<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.869> score<00:01:54.289> is<00:01:54.649> going<00:01:55.039> to<00:01:55.100> be<00:01:55.219> an

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
our ability to score is going to be an

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.309 
our ability to score is going to be an
issue<00:01:55.630> we<00:01:56.630> know<00:01:56.719> we're<00:01:56.840> going<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:57.020> defend

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
issue we know we're going to defend

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.200 
issue we know we're going to defend
that's<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.249> been<00:01:58.429> a<00:01:58.460> staple<00:01:58.729> at<00:01:58.939> Toms

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
that's that's been a staple at Toms

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.719 
that's that's been a staple at Toms
teams<00:01:59.569> but<00:01:59.979> scoring<00:02:00.979> could<00:02:01.249> be<00:02:01.310> something

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
teams but scoring could be something

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.450 
teams but scoring could be something
that<00:02:01.909> we<00:02:02.420> struggle<00:02:02.659> with<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.020> times<00:02:03.259> but<00:02:03.590> it's

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
that we struggle with the times but it's

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.789 
that we struggle with the times but it's
a<00:02:04.549> long<00:02:04.700> year<00:02:05.030> 82<00:02:05.539> games<00:02:05.810> hopefully<00:02:06.499> we<00:02:06.619> stay

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
a long year 82 games hopefully we stay

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.870 
a long year 82 games hopefully we stay
healthy<00:02:06.950> that's<00:02:07.310> going<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:07.609> a<00:02:07.639> big<00:02:07.850> issue

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
healthy that's going to be a big issue

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.289 
healthy that's going to be a big issue
with<00:02:08.209> us<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:10.069> we'll<00:02:10.250> see<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:10.700> we've<00:02:11.150> had

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
with us and and we'll see but we've had

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.450 
with us and and we'll see but we've had
really<00:02:11.510> good<00:02:11.690> success<00:02:11.870> last<00:02:12.319> two<00:02:12.530> years

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
really good success last two years

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.070 
really good success last two years
we<00:02:13.670> went<00:02:13.820> dare<00:02:14.030> come<00:02:14.330> back<00:02:14.480> healthy<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.990> we're

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
we went dare come back healthy and we're

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.690 
we went dare come back healthy and we're
not<00:02:15.170> going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.380> rush<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.370> know<00:02:16.520> he's

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
not going to rush that and you know he's

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.180 
not going to rush that and you know he's
coming<00:02:16.940> back<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:17.870> hard<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.320> replace<00:02:18.860> a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
coming back so it's hard to replace a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.010 
coming back so it's hard to replace a
player<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.790> magnitude<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.750> short

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
player of that magnitude in the short

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.170 
player of that magnitude in the short
term<00:02:21.260> because<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.220> have<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.730> room<00:02:22.940> for

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
term because you have to have room for

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.850 
term because you have to have room for
him<00:02:23.300> when<00:02:23.450> he<00:02:23.540> comes<00:02:23.690> back<00:02:23.870> absolutely<00:02:24.530> no<00:02:24.710> we

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
him when he comes back absolutely no we

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.860 
him when he comes back absolutely no we
