00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.500
 hahaha 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.400
 nowadays the human being uses only 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.490
 10% of his brain capacity 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.120
 however some scientists 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.040
 would claim that during our 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.640
 evolution that keeps changing over time 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.800
 centuries 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.660
 the man will one day be quite capable 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.450
 to understand and use different 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.160
 forces yet unknown incomprehensible 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.720
 currently 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.890
 on the other hand and according to some camps 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.170
 incredible in the world 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.840
 there would be people capable of 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.640
 move objects by the thought of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.319
 to be able to release their inner energy 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.590
 or be able to change the composition 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.180
 molecular of fire or class here's 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.180
 a few unexplained cases 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.210
 telekinesis or psychokinesis and the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.790
 metapsychic faculty to act directly 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.250
 on matter by the mind he would 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.020
 then possible to move even 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.750
 even levitate various objects 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.640
 only thanks to the thought the body the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.390
 more surprising telekinesis was 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.190
 studied in Russia in the 1970s 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.200
 scientists have studied the code neither 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.820
 the cula guina a Russian woman who 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.950
 claimed to have psychological powers 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.840
 naughty and fiq 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.400
 after long minutes of meditation 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.200
 the woman would then enter a kind 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.420
 of trance and would clear a kind 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.680
 magnetic energy 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.260
 according to the many witnesses of this 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.790
 study nor the cula guina would have managed to 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.980
 stop the heartbeat of a 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.420
 frog and this only by the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.980
 thought 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.770
 then she would have also managed to 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.590
 move various objects always through 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.090
 thought however a lot of 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.290
 people would claim that all this 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.290
 remains a huge hoax 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.290
 pyrokinesis is a capacity 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.510
 psychic to create manipulate 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.950
 and control the molecules of fire he 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.110
 would be possible to create a ball of 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.360
 fire or ignite various objects into them 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.760
 touching one of the very first cases of 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.190
 recorded pyrokinesis then that of 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.100
 william underwood in michigan in 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.900
 the 1880s according to the doctor 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.660
 woundman who was able to study his case 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.460
 he will explain that william could grace 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.250
 to his breath raise the temperature 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.840
 of this one is so he managed to 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.390
 ignite handkerchiefs and various 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.220
 clothes this body however remain at 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.220
 this day still unexplained 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.850
 telepathy is a capacity to be able 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.790
 communicate with another person without 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.500
 sensory or oral interaction it 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.720
 would be possible to understand what a 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.270
 other person thinks of you without even 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.860
 dialogue a lot of scientists have 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.320
 studied this case with many 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.660
 people from different backgrounds age and 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.390
 sex without really getting results 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.640
 concrete however we can notice a 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.160
 incredible inexplicable exchanges between 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.200
 two twins most often twins 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.270
 will have the same desires the same tastes 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.760
 the same sentences without really 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.950
 discuss before a very strong link and 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.250
 mysterious unites them until the end of 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.250
 their life 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.419
 kinesis is the crio capacity 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.370
 psychic to freeze any 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.069
 what a right object in touching him 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.289
 there is also the power of 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:27.449
 chiropractic which also consists of a pretty one 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.449
 object but only by thought 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.940
 yeah 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.940
 me
