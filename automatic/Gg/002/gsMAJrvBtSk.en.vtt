00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.150
Aside from Monty Python’s Complete Waste
of Time, it’s rare for us to see a video

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.960
game derived from British comedy.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.859
I mean, what could you do?

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.210
Father Ted’s Blasphemy Challenge?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.759
The official Black Books drunken belligerence
simulator?

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.379
Left for Shaun of the Dead?

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.210
All a bit silly, if you ask me.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.550
And none sillier than this attempt to turn
near-silent protagonist Mr. Bean into a video

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.200
game superstar.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.190
Unfortunately, crap Banjo-Kazooie knockoffs
do not a superstar make.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.070
Actually, let me rephrase that.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.940
Crap Crash Bandicoot Slash Banjo Kazooie knockoff.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.590
Without adding Crash in there, I’d be afraid
that I was giving it too much credit.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.310
So you’re walking through the park, trying
to find pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and for

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.990
some reason the park is filled with bees,
dogs, man-eating sunflowers, boxes full of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.270
explosives, artillery turrets, bees, more
bees, old vicious British women, ents, moles,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.300
pigeons, rakes, and the occasional bottomless
pit.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.900
But don’t worry!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.080
There are signs copied-and-pasted every so
often that tell you exactly what you’re

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.580
looking at.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.990
Glad to see that our shovelware now adheres
to OSHA standards.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.990
Anyway.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.920
You trapse through each interminably long
stage, dodging the forces of evil - that is

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.290
to say, copied and pasted nature - and enjoy
an existential crisis with the abysmal controls

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.700
and animation.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.240
Take too many hits and you deplete your...
teddy bears?

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.240
And then you die.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.590
I can’t even make this up.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.990
Fortunately, you’re not entirely defenseless;
you can shoot bug spray and stun things in

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:11.640
your path, hit things with a saucepot, fire
a slingshot, or become a pirate and gain invincibility.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.659
Now, don’t get me wrong.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.450
I dig the whole Mr. Bean shtick, the physical
comedy, the timing, the irony.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.290
Here’s the problem: Mr. Bean’s Wacky World
has absolutely none of this.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.980
And not even the addition of horrifically-encoded
clips from the 2002 Mr. Bean cartoon series

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.120
can improve this trash heap of a game.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.499
Because honestly, and I’ve acquainted myself
with a couple episodes as an educational measure

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:45.120
mind you, it just can’t compare to the live-action
product.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.419
The whole point of Rowan Atkinson’s character
is that he’s this childish cartoon person,

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.499
which doesn’t work at all in an actual cartoon.

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:57.000
It’s because he’s doing these things in
real life that it’s even marginally entertaining.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.799
But don’t let that stand in the way of a
dollar.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.379
When in doubt, just pound out another Wii
game with a cartoon character.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.260
Thus is the peril of getting a large install
base: The ware-shovellers flock to it like

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.810
a nerds to Holy Grail showing.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.719
So here we have a game derived from a method
of performance that emphasized unique, histrionic

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:26.439
activity, turned into a long, samey, poorly-executed
3D platformer.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.019
And I do mean poorly-executed.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.900
The music bites, the camera’s uncomfortable
and pans at a rate of about 2 degrees of arc

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.989
per hour, the jumping controls feel specifically
designed to dump you in the nearest pit...

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.370
and if you can overcome all that crap, the
game itself is insultingly simple.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.319
At that point, it becomes just a collect-a-thon
slog through low-res settings.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.189
No one deserves that kind of treatment, player
or franchise character alike.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.480
Just as if you saw the real Mr. Bean coming
down the street, if someone presents you with

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.829
a copy of this game, just RUN.

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.779
Run far away, lest you get a hot-water-bottle
full of tea poured on you.

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:03.649
You’ll be glad you did.
