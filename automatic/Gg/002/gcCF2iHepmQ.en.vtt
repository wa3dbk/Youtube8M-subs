00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:10.679
 talks galera sc line floripa good rs 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.940
 was to tie in the area again and today it's me 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.650
 I came here to show you one. 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.600
 little project I've been losing some 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 time it is a speed boat rc that same to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.519
 I already wanted to say sorry that page 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.230
 for not filming the process of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.230
 boat hull construction 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:36.990
 good, I'm soon jirak the boat is made of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.190
 done it 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:48.270
 It's all done right and I just 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:51.260
 I came in here with one with the right white ribbon 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.260
 stayed like this 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.170
 there 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.890
 What I needed to set up your store. 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.059
 You need a certain deflower. 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:08.560
 simple to assemble where I used four pieces 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:14.050
 these here sure deep down I I 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.480
 colei here points out a strong attack another 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.670
 here and one at the end to state later 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.909
 collect with hot glue right and then did 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.700
 bottom 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.159
 the law only by this logic to function I 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.219
 I took advantage of another autoelogio 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.350
 drumstick that is what the brushed motor 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:37.469
 family uesc of 30 there of 40 about 40 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 crack stones and a receptor all from the 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:44.039
 another right model and then I just 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.810
 I needed to buy what this kit 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:52.800
 boat that is what this right axis is there 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:58.740
 already comes with one with the propeller 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.760
 and the rudder which is a very good m by signal 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.409
 right 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:09.780
 It was what I bought. 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:13.260
 there to make the rudder move together 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.840
 with what came served with being changed 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.870
 rock is not very simple 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.720
 Alencar I already did with a string of those of 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.560
 power elektro film of use of the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:31.040
 Only those old houses that hockey and hockey 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.040
 There's a little time protection 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 So I'll see if I can in the premiere of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.120
 work here for you 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.620
 the motor that has there and west they are a 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.130
 Brushed 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.280
 but it supports battery charges you lightly 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.890
 that scheme, nor do we have to 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.209
 care with an engine temperature 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.520
 keep an eye on 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:02.810
 like here he will not have as much 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.110
 it's resistance like it was on the top of the tire 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.050
 All I think you will not try 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.400
 turn it out here to be able to 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.850
 move calm 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:20.170
 It's okay to get the tire. 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.170
 I'm going to put the tire 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.549
 It was difficult here alone that I had here. 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:45.000
 There's no taste in the ground anymore. 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.000
 so I 'll start my radio here 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:04:05.950
 this is his functional and the difference is 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:11.409
 only a chic store she has common 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.780
 electronics of some model, right? 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:19.989
 I used two-channel radio and got the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.859
 front is sure with zeal and project well 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.470
 simple 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.960
 those who even have an electronic 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:31.150
 some other model there is to enjoy 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.789
 All right, just be sure to seal the 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.260
 boat not to enter water and close 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.919
 also the time that I would like in the water 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.530
 for nothing because if there are splashes of sql 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:46.680
 the receiver might not be legal 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.680
 the boys hug and until the next
