00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
which I guess with the appropriate a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.430 
which I guess with the appropriate a
pretty<00:00:35.040> good<00:00:35.219> time<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.610> quit<00:00:36.200> you<00:00:37.200> can't

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
pretty good time to quit you can't

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.139

that's your thing too it's a cleanse

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.639 
that's your thing too it's a cleanse
because<00:00:42.960> you're<00:00:43.110> not<00:00:43.230> you're<00:00:43.350> supposed<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
because you're not you're supposed to
