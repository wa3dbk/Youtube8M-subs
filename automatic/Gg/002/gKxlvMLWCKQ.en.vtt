 If you are like a lot because it deals 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.660
 nader on a trick of line 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.949
 that is possible if boy ran into 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
 the portal from the we will make a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.149
 portal of ice that you think a portal 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.040
 of ice I think it can look good 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.770
 let's start 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.330
 well we come here because like this 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.160
 is the world of tricks, although 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.210
 we know how to calmly welcome obsidian 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.340
 ok and we make ourselves a portal 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.340
 a portal portal of all life 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.040
 and that is a little bit more before to see if 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.050
 he has to behave all his life not what 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.280
 let's turn it on I refuse to turn it on 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.770
 ok but that we are going to put a 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.629
 example here a star if it wins vale 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.949
 for example good does not matter what block 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.430
 as if you want it to be stone 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.470
 agreement and let's take a button a 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.660
 dispense some dispense that there is just 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.869
 back and in 36 but we put a 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.479
 cubito of water then that cubito the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 button there and now quietly 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.020
 we repeaters and the rest few 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.200
 well, what do we want to do with 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.410
 this fund that the water shut down the portal 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.119
 ok then we need to put 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.160
 repeaters what do you consider then 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.460
 I only put three or two depends on the day 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.460
 OK 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.119
 we expose and we move them we are going to see them 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.060
 plug into something that is being the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.800
 mister drop in after lopez 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.960
 hopper this I say hop the drop the break 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.770
 my mother so much mess and to the maximum of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.229
 clicks is worth three clicks at all 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.689
 what does that mean? It's easy when I 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.299
 the goal is that I understand here is worth 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.520
 and quickly I hit it, I'm going to press 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.229
 the button this is going to turn on glass 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.519
 will bring very off the portal but I 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.269
 I'm going to stay inside the cne of 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:16.010
 agreement before we give or that comes 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.760
 inside and inside I'm 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.590
 la la la la la la for nothing are going to 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.260
 a little while calmly as seeing what 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.269
 nice is the wonderful leader now 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.140
 we decided to enter remember that 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.720
 annoyance of the portal 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.670
 Upon entering we will generate a portal 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.280
 totally random a little bit more 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.900
 away, okay, you see, there was initial here 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.459
 we generated this this is the one that 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 we are going to need to be able to 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.769
 do the trick we're going to break four 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.040
 it's worth 1 2 3 and 4 on the other side we're going to 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.040
 do the same 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.710
 another four once done this we went 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.480
 up 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.480
 at the height of the portal itself 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.960
 very good as if we were doing 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.190
 a double portal 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.190
 Well the same thing 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.120
 now on the roof we leave one and 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.850
 we put three the transforma 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:17.340
 that would stay such that it's worth 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:21.510
 once done this look magic light what 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.819
 which has not broken ha ha ha ha 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.110
 we remove the lateral ones only 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.830
 lateral when the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.350
 natural 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.060
 good we can if you want and that 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.570
 I wanted to make an ice ice portal 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.570
 compact 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.569
 there is 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.670
 incredible and now wants to show the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.560
 roof is worth it because if we remove this from 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.660
 here is going to break the portal then 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.780
 let's remove one side and the other 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.640
 side and remove it in the middle 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.110
 the other side we do the same one lateral and 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.060
 then the other side and we remove it in 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.720
 the middle 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.330
 and it is already 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.180
 we could break quietly 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.640
 and ready that you think ice is important 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.590
 and important if you put a block over 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.930
 of the portal right now as it is not 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.780
 fixed to the invented portal that we had 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.489
 made to cheat minecraft is going to 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.349
 disappear the portal ok 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.980
 if we break a block it will disappear 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.630
 the portal 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.390
 what else can we do with this little 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.210
 good trick there is another thing we can 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.310
 do with this trick it's worth that I'm going to 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.820
 teach now let's do it again 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.130
 the trick we are going to repeat it for a little while 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.200
 but why am I going to teach you something that 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.900
 will like something else that can be done 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.970
 it is what we have done is this ? 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.560
 but you can also leave it empty without 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.690
 put ice or anything and stop portal 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.950
 that is being empty, but now 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.180
 I'll show you all the ways that 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.510
 I have come up with possible 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.510
 agreement 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.130
 Well, that's here 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.569
 perfect I've put three is fine 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.940
 we have another one so that the energy arrives 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.300
 ay ay ay ay ay 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.810
 I will break this portal worth going to be able 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.710
 do it quietly and develop 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.710
 let's turn it on 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.130
 and there we will be there 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.060
 super we do here 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.770
 and how much better the next truquito 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.139
 it is the same but otherwise leaves 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.070
 of portal 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.950
 we enter 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:54.420
 and good you have to vale we are going to repeat the 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:58.580
 same the same device as before is worth 22 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.870
 to 14 for a 2 for 2 1 for 1 vale 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.870
 climbed up the 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.399
 and the same thing we do in this side is worth 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.920
 and we remember 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.850
 the scare 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.100
 play the rain seriously is super 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.960
 annoy vale is already done 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.110
 the imaginary portal is worth and now 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:31.350
 we calmly break 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.350
 we can leave it like this empty ok ok 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.190
 or what we can do 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.800
 leave it empty empty empty there will be 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.270
 there it is so let's leave it empty 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.550
 have no problem 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.770
 if the portal is not completely empty 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.120
 that is also very cool is good 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.470
 it's great 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.700
 - I'm really funny, I do not know 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.620
 I'm going to repeat again because you know 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.110
 how is it going but are you going to also have the 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.440
 option is worth leaving just one line of 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.150
 portal or make it disappear 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.430
 in agreement you are going to leave a line of 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.050
 portal but come on , you 're going to 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.300
 discover you as soon as you remove one 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.760
 line here you have a part then I'll 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.440
 remove power you put blocks and this line 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.960
 will disappear and will be left alone this vale 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.520
 and that's it but it was a beige cycle terra 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.380
 with the bidder you will surely see it and 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.480
 easily because these certain guys 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.950
