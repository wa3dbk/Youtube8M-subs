00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.929
 and with that van der gijp with an excellent weeks ago we were 

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:10.579
 equivalent alderman for years was expected 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.459
 yes i have judgment 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.929
 he writes therein stood with his nose on top a large equal yellow 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.150
 what of course 3 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.749
 also 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.099
 yes I saw the referee for that group 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.099
 of negligence then calmly I think 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.939
 because of the Orthodox Jew had to get answers 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820
 I've never heard of it 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.140
 the sickness 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.940
 it was very angry that they were all 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.180
 the molecules for drug monitor are appointed 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.050
 but I am therefore very positive that it would keep stimulating me again 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.620
 so water 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 I actually know I have nothing more fatally injured 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.010
 in this period between both rounds mayor a bit then 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.050

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.740
 he said he knew it 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.560
 what is the situation with his nose on top for a breakthrough role 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.800
 I don't know 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.860
 compare 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.710
 that's for those against 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.369
 I am not you I say he spoke so handsome that we once close ourselves 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.910
 people I didn't understand a man well 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 there will certainly be all there 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.170
 I understood more not to change about size sewing machine just had the card after you 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.480

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.270
 I say weighted sewing 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.190
 he seemed to be pointing at each other 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.820
 there was more luxury and I can't stand mali subtop the chorus on the bone 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.930
