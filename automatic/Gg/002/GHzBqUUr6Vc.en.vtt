00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.340
 halo fans welcome to one 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.490
 new blu-ray review and the blair witch 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.789
 project was yesterday for dinosaur project 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.619
 now you can even a ford with footage movie 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 the only suck you know yes I like 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.460
 that genre absolute i can do that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 big ones that do not win anything 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.849
 and that will certainly be in the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.170
 continue to be next year 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.899
 but I also had yours for you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 pays for project of documentary 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.380
 at one of those already with 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.320
 dinosaurs or loans x3 busy 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.480
 but was very happy and well if 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.629
 you read the story you listened through 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.910
 then you feel smooth to say so 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.550
 solarworld he loses several tv movies 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.949
 but there was also a series and that's how it is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.699
 then built up a bit 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.350
 especially since here it is a researcher 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.180
 with the overall smartphone goes the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 he takes his son luke with him 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.630
 after he flew from school 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.799
 I see someone on youtube 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 made fun and he is looking for in the congo 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.790
 a mysterious aquatic but short 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.280
 before they arrive there will be the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.040
 helicopter in which also a film crew 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.570
 is the one accompanying the expedition of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.340
 heaven brought by own flight 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.950
 dinosaurs and they land his one 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.990
 very inhospitable world in the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.200
 a good 65 million years seemingly nothing 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.000
 Of course, it has to be changed 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.220
 come that the film a lot of camera 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.590
 has dared so it is with good 83 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.770
 relatively short minutes out very 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.509
 entertaining there is a lot to the noemi 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.380
 Really well done and good too 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.360
 Trickster is never without larger 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.770
 Colleagues like Jurassic Park turn their attention to it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.140
 The film wants to come, however 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.420
 In the end, it does not work 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 especially as really this pseudo 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 documentation about a few people stop 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.710
 go in the bush and on dinosaurs 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.090
 will meet 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.369
 Very well there are some very 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.860
 atmospheric moments there was also one 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.020
 some really nice shock deposits and 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.730
 the whole thing kept the wave so 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.030
 never too much of the effects 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.250
 has nothing to do and what to do now 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.290
 that must be said is the atmosphere though 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.080
 also very beneficial to the arc of tension 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.760
 the actors deliver very solid 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.640
 performance certainly nothing 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.290
 special also no outliers here 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.510
 and in the overall picture I was of yours 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.410
 he also projects very well in the end 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.330
 surprised but very pleased 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.590
 because the whole really like one piece 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.519
 it really came out very well 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.110
 works and that is a film 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.269
 he is certainly not a high budget 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.920
 but had the director certain 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.410
 has laid ambitions of the day 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.340
 almost lost world on pseudo 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.500
 Making a documentary that's him 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.880
 very good for good and the whole was 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.730
 really entertaining entertainment 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.040
 certainly not terrific or something 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.200
 but the movie provides a truly with 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.530
 really entertaining 10 with good 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.600
 kicked dinosaurs and last of all 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.280
 where is the 7 of 10 points likely 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.870
 sure not everyone's thing 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.239
 especially because of camera daring public 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.850
 also occurs and yes the blu-ray 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.070
 does not appear until the middle of June of the planet 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.780
 However, media moment tement offers 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.820
 also just a making of and trailer 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.010
 textraw the picture quality knows, however 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.299
 Stretching over a long distance would be convincing 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.700
 becomes the character of a fake 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.709
 documentation is very fair that works 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.769
 of course that the sharpness always 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.750
 again, the contrast he varies with 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.310
 rather average 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.250
 and many details especially in the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.660
 darker scenes through something 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.410
 on the other hand , the tone is homogeneous 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.810
 the few moments were mixed 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.060
 were very dynamic with happen 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.920
 therefore, they really do know 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.890
 convincing and overall one really 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.079
 very solid sound mixing altogether 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.239
 release you certainly before 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.890
 first of all should suffer for especially 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.210
 all those who are fit with women 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.490
 Great do not start 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.130
 to which I belong yet I was 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.710
 The music was very solid 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.020
 and markets maintenance of the new blu ray 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.670
 criticism at this time to your project me 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.180
 Hope you liked it and that 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.180
 next time
