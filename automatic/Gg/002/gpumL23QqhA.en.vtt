00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.880
 Hello dear friends with you DS and 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.299
 today i would like to share with you 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.749
 some moments about gta5 in general 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.689
 today on the official rockstar site 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:26.499
 was higher on the ad in which they 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:30.809
 said not very good news in 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:33.970
 In general, gta 5 was transferred for now, but 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:36.970
 we were given some screenshots of ki and 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.240
 finally the system requirements 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.200
 let's all quietly I'll tell you 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.840
 Well, I will not torment you immediately tell you what 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.730
 the official release date we have become the date 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.310
 this is May 24 , 2015 this is of course all 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.100
 very bad but as a rockstar says something 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.440
 that they of course apologize for 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.500
 date shift but the game requires 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.049
 additional few weeks for 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.420
 testing and polishing but what there 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.030
 a couple of weeks there two months or a month 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.909
 how much do we get there in general they 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.719
 want to make the game as much as possible 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.390
 optimized as possible 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:20.710
 but basically I support them in this 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.259
 because the situation with gta 4 showed us 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.569
 what not to rush into this too 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.490
 everything was terrible just terrible but although 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.920
 everything was fine with me 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.189
 assuring some people still had 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.729
 terrible they say type thanks for your 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.250
 understanding and we assure you these 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.189
 a few extra weeks or rather months 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.299
 will be worth releasing the game in 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.189
 March well, of course it is now all 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.990
 just bombing us will go just hard 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.899
 bombs with but i'm basically not going to survive 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.950
 the fact that 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.600
 system requirements now looked 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.520
 in principle, they are quite good to tell you now 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.750
 and I have a little time now 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.649
 update is good but the farther 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.619
 they say that with the line for now 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.690
 it will be 30 players 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.780
 Also online will be available this way along with 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 gta 5 output and will also include 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.480
 yourself a new mode is a robbery 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.720
 robbery for the cat barking on the console will 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.799
 released the next weeks along the way after 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.780
 release on the principle here is not bad but in 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.130
 In principle, 30 players are the same as on 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.230
 Yandex gene 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.299
 and principle on the screenshots you can 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.519
 see the graph is almost the same as 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.560
 And on Yandex money, yes, that is, almost not 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.489
 different we thought there would be quite 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.870
 all supernatural we thought that 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.480
 systemic friction will be gigantic but 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.540
 although I am not very, very normal 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.329
 I will say let's consider now 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.920
 system requirements let me tell you 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.470
 minimum system requirements 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.840
 First we have about the operating 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.840
 systems we have support only 64-bit 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.709
 system bit to 32 bits not 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.220
 supported by 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.450
 Well, we have minimal windows 8 and 1 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.540
 windows 8 windows 7 and windows vista 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.420
 ati nvidia 9800gt video card 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.340
 one gigabyte 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:24.700
 on board is a video card or md hd 4870 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.220
 with one gigabyte aboard 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.730
 Direct x10 10 1 must be supported and 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:37.120
 11 process times strangely enough intel core 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:41.470
 2 duo ku art ku 6 600 very somehow 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.500
 weak I think you need another 2 and 4 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.910
 gigahertz aboard this processor or 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.400
 same m yes MDF and us 9850 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.890
 Quat core processor with 2 and a half 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.060
 Hertz RAM 4 gigabytes 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.310
 just a special disk space 65 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.989
 gigabyte basically all games shostak 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.970
 hanging but still tough tough you 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.080
 I will say this but about 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.830
 recommend recommended so about 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.900
 the operating system us here falls out 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.019
 windows and did not recommend it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.710
 already nvidia gtx 660 video cards with two 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.570
 GB I 650, I hope 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:31.270
 to upgrade 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:37.030
 or md hd 7870 gigabytes here's the process 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:39.130
 us intel core i5 3470 with 3 and 2 gigahertz 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.390
 I have the same board 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:48.720
 That is, the principle is not bad or mdx 8 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:51.850
 fx 8350 with four gigahertz themselves 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.760
 RAM 8 gigabytes just 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.100
 how to change the pilot fits perfectly 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.919
 I thought I wouldnâ€™t pull 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.050
 enough of one place so 6 5 gigabytes 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.419
 Well what can I say in principle, not bad 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.020
 wall requirements are great for me 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.210
 not bad 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.380
 About course the video card should still 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.570
 think i think 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.580
 like it, but you decide how to 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.630
 you do this news and write 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.490
 I will surely be in the comments 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.400
 interested descended about bombs with you 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.910
 what about now but personally I donâ€™t worry 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.990
 fair 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.930
 unduly play calmly here but who is waiting 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.880
 for now of course now it burns here 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.770
 but basically all guys hope so 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.430
 did you like it 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.980
 say well, at least systemically 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.220
 requirements said it was cool 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.290
