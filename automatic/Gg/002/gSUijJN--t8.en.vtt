 senators at what attempt we are the chain can be used to measure if 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.539
 the first dawn was reached in cases of course tube 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:13.299
 coaches are responsible for playing the little feet performed on the ground by 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.219
 part of their players 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.949
 just in scotland they call to action before it comes out start through gods 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.090
 signals like these somewhat or difficult to interpret from the outside or 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.720
 sending in the field not substitute that it becomes messenger of the action from 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.640
 run in American football is allowed an infinite number of 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.060
 substitutions from one section to another 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.070
 the grouping you see here is defined as an online add and is the time in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.760
 which attack players make arrangements to perform the new action 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.300
 assign break this group is broken elected center leads to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.149
 starting position of passion with passing through one's legs 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.710
 best of me the line that passes through the idv balloon of the attack line 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.949
 of the line of defense 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.220
 is defined as a line of express ge and is an imaginary line but a lot 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.080
 important in American football as we shall see at this point expects only 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.430
 that the center executes lost me too and key the quota 7 I receive the ball 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.830
 here on the blackboard we see indicated by the arrow the sense in which the attack seeks 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.900
 to earn the famous 10 art stars stars within the equally famous 4 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.410
 red attempts we see the attack and in front of the attack the defense 11 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.650
 players to do 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.400
 what we see indicated by the braids is the line of attack il 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.920
 center if the is the first player indicated with the x to put his hand on the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.290
 the two eyes are shoulder to shoulder 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.720
 and even more extended are the two dangers the players that make up the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.180
 real attack line 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.390
 here you score stubborn 2 uguai you should see two players who can 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.130
 receive the balloon that the first - and and this wide the is equal for 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 summer spot sprite at the back of the attack line at least one yard behind 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.330
 there may be other receivers like the price indicated by the arrow and then 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.540
 there are always the portal that said roman beta this is the quarterback e 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.250
 the director of the men's team that receives offers administers all 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.750
 balls and then behind him and then katy by the arrows the two cart here 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.330
 see images of high odds hey oh more fascinating role the more 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.510
 difficult in the attack of American football at the time of the attack 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.840
 because it requires the ball enpa back work to rest the ball is 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.680
 one of his backup armani or ball carriers 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.600
 or to execute a throw it has one of its receivers the falon can be 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.760
 leaning with a passage handed over to old bari or being thrown 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.100
 backwards with the contest opi this instead the steps forward of course 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100
 the most fascinating game in American football 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.989
 what you see are the five players who can apply for the 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.229
 invoice this instead is indicated in the images is the typical the four men 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:17.459
 of line one the two owes celebrate untamed interiors of petite ecole i 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.459
 two external summer activities and and between players behind the line 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.180
 that is, the index in the middle gave me wetterzentrale inverter line 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.340
 and then you 2 the oakland side inverters are for outdoors then there are the 4 faults 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.049
 blessed are those that even now 2phone breasts warns those wider and 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.309
 the more internal ones are posted 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:42.029
 these 7 players you see have the primary objective of stopping 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.650
 immediately strength 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.519
 that are arranged in modern football, even if not especially in 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.269
 this way if you connect the inverter to the online players e4 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.569
 of the three players line we identify ambush in the center and the two defensive 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.269
 from the sides 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.719
 of the four line backrest we identify v2 install inverter crowd and it is for 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.140
 internal e2 outside lan better online external backups 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.129
 2 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.079
 continuing in our explanation of what American football is. 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.039
 fascinating sport but as I have seen quite complex we begin to see 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.090
 how the attack can move the ball 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.370
 photo do it with a throw forward fundamentally or with a force 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.920
 launch and what are the two stage actions of the state in American football and yes 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.130
 more or less 50% of the offensive game selections clearly divide 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.810
 the primary objective is to reach the goal but you can also be satisfied 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.110
 so freemoda text that is to say collect at least tg art within 4 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.889
 attempts 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.330
 there are two types of travel: the inside run or the door to the outside 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.479
 with we see in which the ball carrier in this case the number 32 turns around 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.849
 to the defense to look for space without obviously leaving the vital field 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.629
 myth 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.669
 running inside is a widely used game. michael is also enough 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.050
 difficult to gain long exposure difference 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.349
 clearly in that area of ​​the field there are very many defenders who are there 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.460
 on purpose to stop the race itself 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.710
 much easier to earn a large arpeggios as is said 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.250
 a wide distance to the outside when the ball carrier in this case the 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.770
 number 34 abortion a lot of space to move 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.400
 very important to follow the blocks during a running action 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.659
 of the companions of the ball carrier 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:43.990
 hangs up throwing grabs the opponent or moving it so as to open the 

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:46.989
 way to your own vanille 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:04.769
 graphical part of its linemen are absolutely basic fundamental 

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:06.619
 for the success of a series of photos 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:11.429
 sometimes a single block as you see here in the case of the number 68 can transform 

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:16.159
 a force destined to lose ground in a major dated race 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.009
 for the man who blocks and immediately identify 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.189
 who must be removed from the ball carrier's path 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.919
 ca 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:33.729
 I go 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.940
 freezes cannot hold your opponent a benefit that is left 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.910
 in American football exclusively to the defender 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.200
 as you see from this type of action it is not just a lock anyway the key to 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.520
 a running action three or four blocks can bring the fa bearer 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.710
 strength that ages high 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.520
 and the work that offensive men are also very important 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.749
 play away from their starting area 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:09.900
 Yup 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.770
 who 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.770
 Yup 

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:21.559
 photo 

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:27.239
 carrying the ball with a run inside the zone you are entitled 

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:32.489
 at a pace from 3 to 6 points down can be transformed with a kick on 

00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:36.789
 so extra text points if the ball is sent from the pick up to the player 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:37.869
 in the middle of the posts 

00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:39.520
 there is an additional point 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.349
 here we see a very important action in the strength game look at the block 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:45.889
 of the number 44 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:50.439
 a lot of sex the key lock is carried by another anime 

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:55.199
 in fact, the various between two large categories are divided here 

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:59.770
 circled carry a key lock star beta hotel better man more 

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.749
 fast that brings the ball but very often as we have seen the merit 

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:06.929
 half of the fus 

00:08:06.929 --> 00:08:09.240
 fruit 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.979
 tool
