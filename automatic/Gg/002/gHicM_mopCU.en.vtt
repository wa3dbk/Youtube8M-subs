00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi to all if there is a video game 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.879
 which is a lot of books 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.200
 well assassin's creed car between 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.240
 little tunes book collector versions 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.040
 the novels the comics the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.120
 encyclopedias where the great art-book in 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.620
 what you give your head 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.549
 besides, it might be nice to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.410
 you make a little calf if there on 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.330
 But back to our sheep sailors 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 because today we will talk about art 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.529
 book and pirates with the path of 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.529
 assassin's creed call the black flag 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.829
 we 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.040
 then act of assassin's creed iv and the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.990
 second a book on the universe of 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.280
 assassin's creed edited by titan books 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.410
 be aware that the last we 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.940
 had already released the one on assassin's 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.040
 creed iii and more 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.810
 titan books is used to doing 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.360
 artbooks on video games we owe them 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.660
 among others those on halo as well as 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.070
 areas 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.809
 we can say that they have a 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.370
 some mastery in this universe at 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.080
 level of its external appearance there is 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.980
 absolutely no complaints this is an art 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.479
 large book 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.430
 it is also in the same format as 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.479
 this on assassin's creed iii and in addition 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.340
 the cover is rigid 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.570
 as for the illustration on the jacket 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.640
 she is perfectly in the mood of the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.229
 game and in addition the title is perfectly 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.710
 discreet and does not spoil anything 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.780
 all 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.520
 when we remove the jacket we 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.619
 discover a black cover with the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.670
 3d game logo representing the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.229
 black flag of the jacques gives 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.180
 by the way I think some have 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.070
 preferred the sobriety of this cover 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.750
 to the illustration that there is on the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.920
 jacket the mud begins with a 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.810
 twenty pages dedicated to the tiny 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.860
 abstergo we discover the research 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.990
 who were doing from the point of view 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.970
 architectural a mix between 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.970
 graceful styles of a space sailboat 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.020
 and vegetation of tropical tic 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.670
 inside the buildings it will also be 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 unveiled as well as the new system 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.360
 ali muse by cons this part will be the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.130
 only in the contemporary period because 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.780
 the rest of the art book will be devoted to 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.820
 eighteenth century the era of piracy 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.380
 so everything starts with some 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.580
 dedicated to the character we will see 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.530
 all searches done by 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.180
 compared to those usable for modes 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.460
 multiplayer or the characters 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.470
 main edward kelly hackers like 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.920
 black beard or to finish the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.020
 Templars 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.030
 which started to surprise me in 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.830
 this section seleucie graph used 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.239
 usually in their video game book 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.959
 we are more used to seeing 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.510
 drawings lice 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.560
 or so the 3d modeling brief some 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.930
 net and precise thing 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.190
 gold here though some drawings 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.480
 follow this conventional style 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.730
 there are others that have been made 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.260
 like paintings with a blurred side and 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.209
 in motion that I personally love 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.010
 the next part would be the most 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.750
 important on the one hand compared to its 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.799
 size over 100 pages but also by 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.110
 compared to the quality of the illustrations 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.260
 that we will find there indeed 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.819
 will have a lot of 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.099
 in research compared to decorations 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.439
 that will not depend Caribbean life at 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.900
 eighteenth century and that through de bor 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.150
 devil cry devil or temples 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.709
 Incas to name only the quality of 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.180
 drawings it's really amazing 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.530
 if they take the same graph 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.209
 I quoted previously giving us 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.129
 thus the impression of seeing the paintings 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.819
 vintage that had been made at the 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.620
 oil painting 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.819
 only the presence of texts and their 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.260
 reading will remind us that we are 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.090
 well in a video game is by the way 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.829
 good to report that this ex have 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.629
 judiciously placed and does not want anything 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.549
 ruined the beauty of this art book 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.260
 they also allow us to see that a 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.970
 very great importance was brought to 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.500
 research and design of this 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.120
 universe which by the way was not 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.430
 a thin case considering the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.930
 gigantism of the target one can not 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.269
 talk about pirates without talking of course 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.769
 of the Caribbean Sea and its ships 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.389
 the end is a goat will be precisely them 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.220
 dedicated we will have first of all a 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.409
 first part dedicated to sailboats 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.120
 and pirate ships where we will have everything 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.829
 first a double page showing the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.629
 detailed shots of a pirate ship 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.849
 then we will see the different boats 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.790
 that will meet during the game as 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.840
 that of the black beard pirate the queen 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.819
 anne's revenge 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.840
 I then have a part called 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.340
 battleship 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.079
 again we will have a lot 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.579
 really superb illustration that we 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.379
 make us think a little about the paintings we 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.840
 can sometimes see in museums where 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.760
 everything is just smoking fire and explosions 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.440
 it's a block will end with a 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.359
 last section called the funds 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.430
 sailors so here we are deceiving 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.449
 illustration where we will see reefs 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.459
 but also wrecks 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.840
 but we will also see the different 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.400
 creatures we will encounter in 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.709
 this universe such as different 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.139
 orc sharks or whatnot 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.090
 it's a goat vonn unveil his models 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.799
 for the book the art of assassin's 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.629
 creed iv then in terms of its appearance 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.069
 outside I put a 4 out of 5 he would have 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.060
 could have been five six the blanket had 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.159
 been in leather I think it was 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.289
 really well compared to a book on 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.190
 the pirates of the eighteenth century morning to 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.130
 level of its content 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.620
 I put one in five because there is 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.599
 as many texts as illustration and 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.949
 the whole thing is really very very good at 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.909
 level now of the layout there 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.680
 also a 5 out of 5 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:33.449
 plainly everything is harmonious texts 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.889
 do not mess up the pictures and the 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.539
 most images are in full 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.680
 full page or double page it's 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.150
 absolutely superb 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.940
 now at the level of the report that has 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.650
 been taken the gemmi 1 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.350
 three out of five can still be found 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.700
 deliver less than 30 euros for the 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.860
 French version it should be noted that the 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.580
 French version is cheaper than the 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.020
 English version 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.570
 which gives us now an honest 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.100
 total of 17 out of 20 which is really 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.840
 a good note for this art book 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.190
 so before finishing his videos 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.350
 I'd like to make a little aside 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.030
 about the publisher huginn muninn because he 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.630
 Be aware that it's a goat assassin's 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.000
 creed iv 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.260
 it also exists in French normally 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.130
 most of the arts books are published in 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.780
 the English base 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.790
 there is no Spanish translation 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.650
 in chinese chinese etc 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.540
 but we are lucky thanks to them 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.920
 guînes and fitted gloves called 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.810
 to have a French translation and 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.860
 especially for a lower price than art 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.140
 book in english version 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.130
 so thanks guys when you could 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.200
 notice it throughout the video 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.060
 I really loved this art book 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.620
 it's absolutely great and besides I 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.940
 have never played the game so for those 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.800
 who are taking their foot 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.570
 right now it's a goat is 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.410
 absolutely essential 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.210
