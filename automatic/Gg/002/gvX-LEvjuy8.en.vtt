00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
little magnets in here too that it comes

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.190 
little magnets in here too that it comes
with<00:02:10.819> so<00:02:11.819> that's<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
with so that's that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.830 
with so that's that
and<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.250> really<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.730> these<00:02:14.910> i<00:02:15.209> feel<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.660> they

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and I really like these i feel like they

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.339 
and I really like these i feel like they
shut<00:02:16.140> well<00:02:17.330> they<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> little<00:02:18.750> heavier<00:02:19.200> than

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
shut well they are a little heavier than

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.589 
shut well they are a little heavier than
I<00:02:19.500> thought<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.280> thinking<00:02:20.940> maybe<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.420> is

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
I thought so I'm thinking maybe this is

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.020 
I thought so I'm thinking maybe this is
why<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> shipping<00:02:22.470> was<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.519> much<00:02:23.760> because

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
why the shipping was so much because

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.830 
why the shipping was so much because
these<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.810> way<00:02:25.640> some<00:02:26.640> because<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.330> magnets

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
these do way some because of the magnets

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.170 
these do way some because of the magnets
um<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:30.420> again<00:02:30.720> they<00:02:31.590> shut<00:02:31.890> pretty<00:02:32.250> well<00:02:32.489> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
um and again they shut pretty well and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.360 
um and again they shut pretty well and
they<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.510> they<00:02:33.780> don't<00:02:33.810> open<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.319> easily<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.340> I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370
