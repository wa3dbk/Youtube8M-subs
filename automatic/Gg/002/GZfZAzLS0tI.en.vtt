00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
and it's part of a of course Polaroid's
offering<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> strange<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.220> because

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
offering a kind of strange just because

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.540 
offering a kind of strange just because
it<00:01:44.610> looks<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:45.090> like

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
it looks more like

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.210 
it looks more like
no<00:01:45.940> ice<00:01:46.120> cream<00:01:46.360> sandwich<00:01:46.810> type<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.140> device<00:01:47.350> or

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
no ice cream sandwich type of device or

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.610 
no ice cream sandwich type of device or
you<00:01:49.090> know<00:01:49.210> just<00:01:49.510> because<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.990> way<00:01:50.110> it's<00:01:50.380> laid

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
you know just because the way it's laid

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.440 
you know just because the way it's laid
out<00:01:50.680> yeah<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.280> doesn't<00:01:51.400> look<00:01:51.610> close<00:01:52.210> to

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
out yeah it doesn't look close to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.330 
out yeah it doesn't look close to
jellybean<00:01:52.900> what<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:53.260> see<00:01:53.500> or<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:54.010> go<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.160> the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
jellybean what we see or to go to the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.280 
jellybean what we see or to go to the
app<00:01:54.490> panel<00:01:54.940> let's<00:01:55.630> see<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:55.990> looks<00:01:56.140> like

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
app panel let's see what it looks like

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.500 
app panel let's see what it looks like
there<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.190> with<00:01:57.310> its<00:01:57.430> quad-core<00:01:57.700> processor

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
there and with its quad-core processor

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.870 
there and with its quad-core processor
it<00:01:58.660> seems<00:01:58.930> like<00:01:59.110> its<00:01:59.290> handling<00:01:59.770> most<00:02:00.430> things

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
it seems like its handling most things

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.660 
it seems like its handling most things
from<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.630> basic<00:02:02.170> test<00:02:02.440> now<00:02:02.950> it's<00:02:03.190> worth<00:02:03.400> noting

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
from a basic test now it's worth noting

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.060 
from a basic test now it's worth noting
that<00:02:03.850> doesn't<00:02:04.510> seem<00:02:04.660> like<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.200> with<00:02:05.710> Google

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
that doesn't seem like it is with Google

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.890 
that doesn't seem like it is with Google
based<00:02:06.280> product<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.300> don't<00:02:07.540> get<00:02:07.660> things

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
based product so you don't get things

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.109 
based product so you don't get things
like<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.350> Google<00:02:08.740> Play<00:02:08.890> Store<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:09.790> some

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
like the Google Play Store so some

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.210 
like the Google Play Store so some
people<00:02:10.420> might<00:02:10.540> be<00:02:10.750> thinking<00:02:10.960> about<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.890> it's

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
people might be thinking about that it's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.860 
people might be thinking about that it's
a<00:02:12.310> consideration<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:13.180> it's<00:02:13.540> like<00:02:13.690> they<00:02:13.840> have

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a consideration but it's like they have

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.190 
a consideration but it's like they have
the<00:02:14.140> ANU<00:02:14.500> no<00:02:14.800> ecosystem<00:02:15.730> yeah<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.900> have

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
the ANU no ecosystem yeah so you have

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.140 
the ANU no ecosystem yeah so you have
that<00:02:17.440> server<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:18.100> account<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.790> probably

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
that server to account you can probably

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.300 
that server to account you can probably
use<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.450> with<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.810> device<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.160> you're

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
use that with this device but if you're

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.310 
use that with this device but if you're
looking<00:02:21.340> for<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.210> portable<00:02:22.780> tablet<00:02:22.960> not

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
looking for just a portable tablet not

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.480 
looking for just a portable tablet not
something's<00:02:23.830> not<00:02:23.860> going<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.130> really<00:02:24.250> break

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
something's not going to really break

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.070 
something's not going to really break
the<00:02:24.610> bank<00:02:24.790> maybe<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.300> might<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.660> your<00:02:25.780> device

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the bank maybe this might be your device

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.500 
the bank maybe this might be your device
for<00:02:26.380> you
