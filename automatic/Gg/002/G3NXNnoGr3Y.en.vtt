00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
for mobile we looked at lots of users

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
for mobile we looked at lots of users
and<00:01:00.510> how<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.870> express<00:01:01.170> different<00:01:01.500> things

using<00:01:02.250> emoji<00:01:02.629> emoji<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.719> processed<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
using emoji emoji is processed in the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.770 
using emoji emoji is processed in the
occipital<00:01:04.979> temporal<00:01:05.220> sites<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
occipital temporal sites which is the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.480 
occipital temporal sites which is the
same<00:01:07.049> part<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.409> our<00:01:07.560> brain<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.010> processes

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
same part of our brain that processes

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.770 
same part of our brain that processes
facial<00:01:09.030> recognition

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
facial recognition

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560

so<00:01:10.049> basically<00:01:10.740> emoji<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> language<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so basically emoji is a language that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
so basically emoji is a language that
everyone<00:01:12.840> already<00:01:13.110> knows<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> next
