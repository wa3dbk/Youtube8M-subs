00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
going to look for me through the array

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.410 
going to look for me through the array
of<00:02:03.500> microphones<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.460> base<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.180> tower

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
of microphones in the base and the tower

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.620 
of microphones in the base and the tower
of<00:02:05.810> your<00:02:05.990> unit<00:02:06.410> but<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.460> doesn't<00:02:07.790> see<00:02:08.450> me

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
of your unit but it doesn't see me

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.450 
of your unit but it doesn't see me
because<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:09.200> doesn't<00:02:09.530> see<00:02:09.619> my<00:02:09.770> eyes<00:02:09.979> my<00:02:10.400> nose

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
because it doesn't see my eyes my nose

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.910 
because it doesn't see my eyes my nose
in<00:02:10.910> my<00:02:11.060> mouth<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.630> with<00:02:12.050> these<00:02:12.170> face<00:02:12.470> finding

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
in my mouth and with these face finding

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.520 
in my mouth and with these face finding
features<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.640> reason<00:02:13.940> Polycom<00:02:14.420> did<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.320> is

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
features the reason Polycom did this is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.130 
features the reason Polycom did this is
so<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.940> doesn't<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:17.330> go<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.600> any<00:02:17.840> random

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
so that it doesn't just go to any random

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.320 
so that it doesn't just go to any random
noise<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.010> room<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.640> James<00:02:19.880> child

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
noise in the room so if James child

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.290 
noise in the room so if James child
starts<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.960> clap<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:21.710> cellphones<00:02:22.400> ring<00:02:22.790> it's

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
starts to clap or cellphones ring it's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.810 
starts to clap or cellphones ring it's
not<00:02:23.540> just<00:02:23.750> going<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.960> go<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.140> recognize<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:25.010> so

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
not just going to go to recognize it so

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.180 
not just going to go to recognize it so
as<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.390> start<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.840> release<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.290> paper<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.980> sees

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
as I start to release the paper it sees

more of my body language you want
nonverbal<00:03:16.400> cues<00:03:16.870> whereas<00:03:17.870> some<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.410> older

nonverbal cues whereas some of the older
camera<00:03:19.220> tracking<00:03:19.670> systems<00:03:20.150> would<00:03:20.480> have<00:03:20.690> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
camera tracking systems would have the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.620 
camera tracking systems would have the
speaker<00:03:21.800> frame<00:03:22.130> down<00:03:22.340> here<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.360> need<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.510> have

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
speaker frame down here you need to have

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.810 
speaker frame down here you need to have
all<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.110> wasted<00:03:24.590> space<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.160> we're<00:03:25.310> trying<00:03:25.580> to

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
all that wasted space so we're trying to

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.420 
all that wasted space so we're trying to
use<00:03:26.060> up<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.510> frame<00:03:26.840> as<00:03:27.190> efficiently<00:03:28.190> as

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
use up the frame as efficiently as

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.229 
use up the frame as efficiently as
possible

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239
