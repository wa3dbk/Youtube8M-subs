00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and this game's not out at the moment

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.279 
and this game's not out at the moment
we're<00:00:15.120> playing<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> test<00:00:15.809> flight<00:00:15.990> bill

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
we're playing this on a test flight bill

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.230 
we're playing this on a test flight bill
but<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.560> wanted<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.830> bring<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.490> quick<00:00:17.850> early

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
but we wanted to bring you a quick early

but we wanted to bring you a quick early
look<00:00:18.420> at<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.750> as<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.289> think<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.619> game<00:00:19.740> with

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
look at it as I think it's a game with

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.570 
look at it as I think it's a game with
some<00:00:20.460> serious<00:00:20.880> potential<00:00:21.830> like<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> say<00:00:23.039> test

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
some serious potential like I say test

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.160 
some serious potential like I say test
flight<00:00:23.760> build<00:00:23.970> everything<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.960> is

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
flight build everything in this is

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.470 
flight build everything in this is
subject<00:00:25.440> to<00:00:25.650> change<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.670> do

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
subject to change so there we are do

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.730 
subject to change so there we are do
keep<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> mind<00:00:28.109> when<00:00:28.289> you're<00:00:28.350> watching

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
keep that in mind when you're watching

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.569 
keep that in mind when you're watching
this<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.580> Carver<00:00:30.060> racing<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.980> I'm<00:00:31.980> playing<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
this so Carver racing is I'm playing on

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.460 
this so Carver racing is I'm playing on
the<00:00:32.669> simplest<00:00:33.120> track<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> moment<00:00:34.380> with

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
the simplest track at the moment with

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.490 
the simplest track at the moment with
the<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> slowest<00:00:35.730> ship<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:37.380> whole

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the with the slowest ship and the whole

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.709 
the with the slowest ship and the whole
idea<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.790> tap<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.600> hand

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
idea is that you tap on the right hand

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.299 
idea is that you tap on the right hand
side<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> screen<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> accelerate<00:00:41.040> so

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
side of the screen and you accelerate so

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
side of the screen and you accelerate so
there<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.969> are<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.600> me<00:00:42.719> accelerating

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
there we are you can see me accelerating

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
there we are you can see me accelerating
is<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.430> thrust<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:45.180> I

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
is to see the little bit of thrust if I

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.760 
is to see the little bit of thrust if I
talk<00:00:45.719> there<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.520> tap<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
talk there we are if I tap on the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.930 
talk there we are if I tap on the
left-hand<00:00:49.770> side<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.160> screen<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.730> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
left-hand side of the screen like so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.049 
left-hand side of the screen like so
then<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.390> boost<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:53.579> I'm

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
then I boost there we are and I'm

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.270 
then I boost there we are and I'm
tilting<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.719> device<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.260> turn<00:00:55.890> left<00:00:56.160> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
tilting the device to turn left and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.500 
tilting the device to turn left and
right<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.700> like<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> steering<00:00:57.480> wheel

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
right a little bit like a steering wheel

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.619 
right a little bit like a steering wheel
let's<00:00:58.020> say<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> now<00:00:59.879> let's<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> main

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
let's say so now let's go to the main

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.639 
let's say so now let's go to the main
menu<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.640> we'll<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> nudge<00:01:03.469> so<00:01:04.469> we<00:01:04.559> were

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
menu and we'll go to nudge so we were

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.289 
menu and we'll go to nudge so we were
just<00:01:04.679> on<00:01:04.889> over<00:01:05.369> when<00:01:05.609> and<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.639> here<00:01:08.639> we<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.909> if

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
just on over when and so here we are if

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.699 
just on over when and so here we are if
I<00:01:09.859> spin<00:01:10.859> round<00:01:11.039> and<00:01:11.310> pick<00:01:11.579> up<00:01:11.789> these<00:01:12.200> oh<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:13.709 
I spin round and pick up these oh I

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:15.889 
I spin round and pick up these oh I
can't<00:01:13.950> smack<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> ice<00:01:14.490> well<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.149> smack<00:01:15.689> into

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
can't smack it ice well I smack into

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:16.969 
can't smack it ice well I smack into
those<00:01:16.109> things<00:01:16.139> but<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.619> pick<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:16.920> things

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
those things but if I pick these things

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.169 
those things but if I pick these things
up<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.639> that<00:01:18.119> gives<00:01:18.329> me<00:01:18.859> a<00:01:19.859> sort<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:20.819> sort

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
up and that gives me a sort of it sort

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.660 
up and that gives me a sort of it sort
of<00:01:21.209> adds<00:01:21.359> to<00:01:21.689> my<00:01:21.810> shield<00:01:22.170> my<00:01:22.829> shield<00:01:23.279> depletes

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
of adds to my shield my shield depletes

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.609 
of adds to my shield my shield depletes
whenever<00:01:23.999> I<00:01:24.060> hit<00:01:24.270> something<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.319> the<00:01:25.409> side<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
whenever I hit something on the side of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.989 
whenever I hit something on the side of
the<00:01:25.770> track<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.009> whatever<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.399> is<00:01:26.490> or<00:01:26.520> into<00:01:26.969> a

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:26.999 
the track or whatever it is or into a

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:31.609 
the track or whatever it is or into a
you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.599> an<00:01:27.689> object<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.170> whatever<00:01:29.869> but<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you know an object or whatever but I can

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.019 
you know an object or whatever but I can
replenish<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.249> with<00:01:32.399> these<00:01:32.549> things<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:33.029 
replenish it with these things and

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:35.179 
replenish it with these things and
usually<00:01:33.389> they're<00:01:33.569> on<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.380> they're<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
usually they're on you know they're in

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.769 
usually they're on you know they're in
spaces<00:01:35.729> where<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.209> know<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.359> want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> be

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:36.779 
spaces where you know you want to be

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:38.629 
spaces where you know you want to be
taking<00:01:37.139> the<00:01:37.259> line<00:01:37.469> essentially<00:01:38.219> you<00:01:38.459> want<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:38.639 
taking the line essentially you want to

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:40.279 
taking the line essentially you want to
be<00:01:38.700> sort<00:01:38.849> of<00:01:38.909> take<00:01:39.149> they<00:01:39.419> show<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.929> where<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
be sort of take they show you where the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.729 
be sort of take they show you where the
racing<00:01:40.649> line<00:01:40.679> is<00:01:41.039> for<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.789> most<00:01:41.880> part<00:01:42.739> and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:43.739 
racing line is for the most part and

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:46.879 
racing line is for the most part and
it's<00:01:44.099> got<00:01:44.219> a<00:01:44.279> really<00:01:44.689> satisfying<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:46.590> some

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
it's got a really satisfying in some

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.949 
it's got a really satisfying in some
ways<00:01:49.249> feel<00:01:50.249> to<00:01:50.609> the<00:01:50.700> actual<00:01:50.819> racing<00:01:51.209> so<00:01:51.719> when

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
ways feel to the actual racing so when

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.370 
ways feel to the actual racing so when
you're<00:01:52.079> playing<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.579> sort<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.609> beginners

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
you're playing in this sort of beginners

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.169 
you're playing in this sort of beginners
vehicle<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.889> actually<00:01:56.159> quite<00:01:56.309> satisfying

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
vehicle it's actually quite satisfying

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.019 
vehicle it's actually quite satisfying
because<00:01:57.959> you're<00:01:58.439> sort<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.649> floating<00:01:59.249> really

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.029 
because you're sort of floating really

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.149 
because you're sort of floating really
you're<00:02:00.209> sort<00:02:00.419> of<00:02:00.529> letting<00:02:01.529> gravity

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
you're sort of letting gravity

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.370 
you're sort of letting gravity
do<00:02:04.090> its<00:02:04.240> thing<00:02:04.329> you're<00:02:04.749> sort<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:04.990> pushing

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
do its thing you're sort of pushing

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.959 
do its thing you're sort of pushing
forward<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:05.950> then<00:02:06.069> seeing<00:02:06.369> where<00:02:06.579> you<00:02:06.700> go<00:02:06.850> and

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
forward and then seeing where you go and

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.639 
forward and then seeing where you go and
you're<00:02:07.090> constantly<00:02:07.719> fighting<00:02:08.229> against

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
you're constantly fighting against

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.280 
you're constantly fighting against
gravity<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:10.209> are<00:02:10.330> no<00:02:10.420> breaks<00:02:10.720> or<00:02:10.989> anything

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
gravity there are no breaks or anything

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.680 
gravity there are no breaks or anything
like<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.910> we<00:02:12.970> are<00:02:13.120> managed<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.569> get

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
like that now we are managed to get

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.339 
like that now we are managed to get
through<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:15.069> decent<00:02:15.459> enough<00:02:15.760> time<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:17.200> we'll

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
through the decent enough time and we'll

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.070 
through the decent enough time and we'll
hit<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.370> main<00:02:18.519> menu<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:19.030> what<00:02:19.690> here<00:02:19.930> is

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
hit to the main menu and what here is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.100 
hit to the main menu and what here is
the<00:02:20.470> loop<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.330> we've<00:02:22.450> got<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.660> least<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:23.019> know

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
the loop so we've got at least you know

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.910 
the loop so we've got at least you know
these<00:02:23.260> cool<00:02:23.470> tracks<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:23.980> stuff<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:25.739> like<00:02:26.739> so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
these cool tracks and stuff and like so

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.410 
these cool tracks and stuff and like so
the<00:02:27.040> whole<00:02:27.160> point<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:28.000> want<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.269> these

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the whole point is you want to get these

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.880 
the whole point is you want to get these
good<00:02:28.720> track<00:02:29.200> times<00:02:29.500> by<00:02:30.099> boosting<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.890> trying

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
good track times by boosting and trying

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.589 
good track times by boosting and trying
to<00:02:32.980> rush<00:02:33.519> through<00:02:33.549> as<00:02:33.849> fast<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.180> possible<00:02:34.239> and

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
to rush through as fast as possible and

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.720 
to rush through as fast as possible and
you<00:02:34.750> unlock<00:02:35.049> new<00:02:35.290> tracks<00:02:35.560> by<00:02:36.160> doing<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.549> you'll

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
you unlock new tracks by doing so you'll

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.949 
you unlock new tracks by doing so you'll
have<00:02:36.819> noticed<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.360> visuals<00:02:37.720> are

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
have noticed that the visuals are

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.009 
have noticed that the visuals are
absolutely<00:02:38.680> lovely<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.360> really<00:02:40.360> do<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.750> this

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
absolutely lovely I really do like this

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.289 
absolutely lovely I really do like this
look<00:02:41.290> too<00:02:41.470> it's<00:02:41.650> kind<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.129> hard<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.790> know<00:02:42.970> don't

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
look too it's kind of hard to know don't

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.050 
look too it's kind of hard to know don't
have<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.480> describe<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.959> very<00:02:44.140> basic<00:02:44.319> cartoon

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
have to describe a very basic cartoon

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.400 
have to describe a very basic cartoon
look<00:02:46.060> but<00:02:46.360> but<00:02:46.660> more<00:02:46.900> than<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.079> very

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
look but but more than that very

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.150 
look but but more than that very
stylized<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.829> handling

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
stylized and like so that the handling

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.309 
stylized and like so that the handling
model<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.549> pretty<00:02:51.879> good<00:02:52.150> with<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.840> caveat

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
model is pretty good with the caveat

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.369 
model is pretty good with the caveat
being<00:02:53.349> that<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.730> handling<00:02:55.629> is<00:02:55.780> pretty

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
being that the the handling is pretty

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.589 
being that the the handling is pretty
good<00:02:56.560> in<00:02:56.739> this<00:02:56.920> slower<00:02:57.370> vehicle<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.060> can<00:02:58.209> handle

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
good in this slower vehicle I can handle

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.270 
good in this slower vehicle I can handle
this<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:58.989> is<00:02:59.140> fine<00:02:59.379> but<00:03:00.010> you'll<00:03:00.129> have

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
this this is fine but you'll have

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.400 
this this is fine but you'll have
noticed<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.790> when<00:03:00.970> i<00:03:01.000> boosted<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:02.109> know<00:03:02.230> it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
noticed that when i boosted you know it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.559 
noticed that when i boosted you know it
kind<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.280> go<00:03:03.400> completely<00:03:03.819> out<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.150> control

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
kind of go completely out of control

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.559 
kind of go completely out of control
really<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.290> that's<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.400> little<00:03:06.730> bit<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.329> this

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
really and that's a little bit of this

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.650 
really and that's a little bit of this
game's<00:03:07.840> problem<00:03:08.349> at<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.620> moment<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.660> that's

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
game's problem at the moment and that's

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.449 
game's problem at the moment and that's
in<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.959> know<00:03:14.049> it's<00:03:14.230> very<00:03:14.290> difficult<00:03:14.590> to

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
in that you know it's very difficult to

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.240 
in that you know it's very difficult to
correct<00:03:16.030> any<00:03:16.569> mistakes<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.380> make<00:03:17.590> so

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
correct any mistakes that you make so

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.589 
correct any mistakes that you make so
you<00:03:18.310> might<00:03:18.519> say<00:03:18.760> oh<00:03:18.790> well<00:03:19.090> that's<00:03:19.239> cool<00:03:19.419> that's

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
you might say oh well that's cool that's

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.800 
you might say oh well that's cool that's
that's<00:03:19.959> cool<00:03:20.169> cool<00:03:20.739> gameplay<00:03:20.919> right<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:21.810> it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
that's cool cool gameplay right like it

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.420 
that's cool cool gameplay right like it
wants<00:03:23.049> YouTube<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.560> race<00:03:23.739> perfectly<00:03:24.280> every

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
wants YouTube to race perfectly every

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.220 
wants YouTube to race perfectly every
single<00:03:24.760> time<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.630> can<00:03:25.840> completely

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
single time and and I can completely

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.559 
single time and and I can completely
understand<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.160> approach<00:03:27.639> but<00:03:28.450> the

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
understand that that approach but the

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.589 
understand that that approach but the
same<00:03:28.720> time<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:30.130> very<00:03:30.549> punishing<00:03:30.880> in<00:03:31.389> that

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
same time it is very punishing in that

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.509 
same time it is very punishing in that
way<00:03:31.750> it's<00:03:31.900> very<00:03:32.079> unforgiving<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.340> when<00:03:33.430> you

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
way it's very unforgiving and when you

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.640 
way it's very unforgiving and when you
smash<00:03:33.819> up<00:03:34.030> against<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.419> side<00:03:34.599> of<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.870> side<00:03:35.620> of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
smash up against the side of the side of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.940 
smash up against the side of the side of
the<00:03:35.829> walls<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:38.019> know<00:03:38.049> I'm<00:03:38.410> gonna<00:03:38.590> do<00:03:38.799> that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
the walls you know I'm gonna do that

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.809 
the walls you know I'm gonna do that
just<00:03:39.130> now<00:03:39.190> no<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.780> know<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:41.079> sort<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.819> you

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
just now no you know it's sort of you

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.020 
just now no you know it's sort of you
know<00:03:42.849> quite<00:03:43.299> sort<00:03:43.569> of<00:03:44.639> jaggedy<00:03:45.639> when<00:03:45.910> you're

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
know quite sort of jaggedy when you're

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.210 
know quite sort of jaggedy when you're
smashing<00:03:46.480> against<00:03:46.750> it's<00:03:46.959> like<00:03:47.139> dude<00:03:47.919> it<00:03:47.950> is

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
smashing against it's like dude it is

like ping against the wall and it's not
very<00:03:56.230> it's<00:03:56.739> not<00:03:56.859> very<00:03:56.919> satisfying<00:03:57.549> it's<00:03:57.819> a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
very it's not very satisfying it's a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.699 
very it's not very satisfying it's a
little<00:03:58.120> bit<00:03:58.239> annoying<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.750> correcting<00:03:59.620> your

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
little bit annoying and correcting your

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.949 
little bit annoying and correcting your
own<00:03:59.859> mistakes<00:04:00.010> afterwards<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.849> is<00:04:01.359> extremely

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
own mistakes afterwards is is extremely

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.369 
own mistakes afterwards is is extremely
difficult<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:04.239> ah<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:05.139> see<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.319> just

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
difficult so ah so you see I just

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.900 
difficult so ah so you see I just
boosted<00:04:05.919> then<00:04:06.040> went<00:04:06.250> straight<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.669> the<00:04:06.730> wall

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
boosted then went straight to the wall

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.789 
boosted then went straight to the wall
and<00:04:07.090> just<00:04:07.269> kind<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.569> couldn't<00:04:08.079> really<00:04:08.530> do<00:04:08.769> a

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799

and just kind of couldn't really do a
whole<00:04:09.099> bunch<00:04:09.129> about<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.419> it's<00:04:10.870> very<00:04:11.169> very

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
whole bunch about it it's very very

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.569 
whole bunch about it it's very very
difficult<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:12.579> correct<00:04:13.359> your<00:04:13.870> own<00:04:14.049> mistakes

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
difficult to correct your own mistakes

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.420 
difficult to correct your own mistakes
afterwards

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
let's give the loop ago another go this

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.960 
let's give the loop ago another go this
one<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.110> much<00:04:45.289> faster<00:04:45.560> vehicle<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.310> you'll

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
one is a much faster vehicle and you'll

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.960 
one is a much faster vehicle and you'll
see<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.509> again<00:04:48.050> as<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.520> sort<00:04:49.910> of

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
see that it again as the the sort of

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.150 
see that it again as the the sort of
more<00:04:50.180> speed<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:50.930> are<00:04:51.050> sort<00:04:51.710> of<00:04:51.740> add<00:04:51.949> to

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
more speed that you are sort of add to

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.219 
more speed that you are sort of add to
the<00:04:52.280> equation<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:53.150> harder<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.660> thing<00:04:53.870> gets

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
the equation the harder the thing gets

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.230 
the equation the harder the thing gets
you'll<00:04:54.770> see<00:04:54.949> that<00:04:55.039> i'm<00:04:55.160> already<00:04:55.340> down<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.789> well
