offside trap
first<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.250> all<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> tutorial<00:00:12.870> about

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
first of all I have a tutorial about

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.950 
first of all I have a tutorial about
offside<00:00:13.889> trap<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.730> PES<00:00:14.910> 14<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
offside trap that is for PES 14 the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.290 
offside trap that is for PES 14 the
button<00:00:16.320> input<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.949> exactly<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> same<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
button input is exactly the same so the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
button input is exactly the same so the
links<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> description<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890

tutorial about this 14 offside trap
reason<00:00:22.590> why<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> didn't<00:00:22.980> make<00:00:23.100> another<00:00:23.369> one

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
reason why I didn't make another one

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.859 
reason why I didn't make another one
because<00:00:23.820> they're<00:00:24.300> input<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
because they're input and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.570 
because they're input and
exactly<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> same<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.010> want<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> check

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
exactly the same so you want to check

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.939 
exactly the same so you want to check
that<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> great<00:00:27.930> tutorial<00:00:28.199> tells<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that out it's a great tutorial tells you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.859 
that out it's a great tutorial tells you
when<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.250> offside<00:00:29.760> trap<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.240> how<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.720> it

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
when to offside trap and how to do it

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.069 
when to offside trap and how to do it
with<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> button<00:00:31.980> inputs<00:00:32.309> anyway<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.809> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
with the button inputs anyway so as you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
with the button inputs anyway so as you
can<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.710> match<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.250> guy<00:00:35.489> had<00:00:35.760> the

throughout<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> whole<00:00:36.989> match<00:00:37.230> because<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
throughout the whole match because I

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.729 
throughout the whole match because I
knew<00:00:38.850> he<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> predictable<00:00:39.719> 3<00:00:40.260> ball<00:00:40.440> spammer

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
knew he was a predictable 3 ball spammer

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
trap

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.200

he<00:01:19.890> knew<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.250> offside<00:01:20.610> trap<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.119> he

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
he knew I'm offside trap and so he

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
he knew I'm offside trap and so he
stopped<00:01:21.509> doing<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.990> he<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.560> actually<00:01:22.710> waiting

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
stopped doing so he was actually waiting

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
stopped doing so he was actually waiting
for<00:01:23.610> me<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:23.970> offside<00:01:24.299> trap<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.259> he

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
for me to do offside trap and then he

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.440 
for me to do offside trap and then he
was<00:01:25.530> doing<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> football<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.490> flanks<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
was doing the football to the flanks so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.980 
was doing the football to the flanks so

not<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.350> offside<00:01:31.770> trap<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.400> gonna

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
not do offside trap and if you're gonna

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
not do offside trap and if you're gonna

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
do it time it correctly because many

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
do it time it correctly because many
times<00:01:35.189> you're<00:01:35.400> doing<00:01:35.640> an<00:01:35.700> offside<00:01:36.030> trap<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
times you're doing an offside trap and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
times you're doing an offside trap and
you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> player<00:01:37.500> running<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you can see a player running on the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.800 
you can see a player running on the
flank<00:01:38.400> mind<00:01:39.060> your<00:01:39.240> players<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.780> Ronaldo

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
flank mind your players like Ronaldo

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.740 
flank mind your players like Ronaldo
Robin<00:01:40.799> Neymar<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.790> players<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.420> really

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
Robin Neymar these players are really

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
Robin Neymar these players are really
really<00:01:42.990> great<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> steal<00:01:43.799> themselves<00:01:44.280> from

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
really great to steal themselves from

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
really great to steal themselves from
the<00:01:44.520> defenders<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:45.600> hard<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.079> do

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the defenders so it's really hard to do

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.139 
the defenders so it's really hard to do
offside<00:01:46.590> trap<00:01:46.619> against<00:01:47.100> these<00:01:47.280> players<00:01:47.549> but

offside trap at the end you know it's
very<00:02:59.360> simple<00:02:59.599> for<00:03:00.290> example<00:03:00.349> if<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.430> are<00:03:01.579> a

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
very simple for example if you are a

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.180 
very simple for example if you are a
left<00:03:02.060> stick<00:03:02.360> user<00:03:02.630> then<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.380> d-pad<00:03:03.799> is<00:03:04.010> gonna

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
left stick user then the d-pad is gonna

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.580 
left stick user then the d-pad is gonna
be<00:03:04.370> your<00:03:04.519> input<00:03:04.849> offside<00:03:05.390> traps<00:03:05.720> there's<00:03:06.200> two

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
be your input offside traps there's two

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.650 
be your input offside traps there's two
methods<00:03:06.829> of<00:03:07.099> up<00:03:07.280> side<00:03:07.489> traps<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.269> can<00:03:08.299> either

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
methods of up side traps you can either

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.050 
methods of up side traps you can either
press<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.620> d-pad<00:03:09.799> twice<00:03:10.400> towards<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
press the d-pad twice towards the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.030 
press the d-pad twice towards the
opponent<00:03:11.510> goal<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:12.350> will<00:03:12.470> do<00:03:12.620> an<00:03:12.709> offside
