never done anything and the way that you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.199 
never done anything and the way that you
have<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.410> look<00:02:18.709> at<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.160> it's<00:02:19.730> kind<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:19.970> like

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
have to look at it it's kind of like

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:28.000 
have to look at it it's kind of like
planting<00:02:21.080> an<00:02:21.200> acorn<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:27.349> think<00:02:27.590> about<00:02:27.830> that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
planting an acorn you think about that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.860 
planting an acorn you think about that
acorn<00:02:28.370> turning<00:02:28.849> into<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.269> big<00:02:29.569> beautiful

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
acorn turning into this big beautiful

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.410 
acorn turning into this big beautiful
tree<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.860> an<00:02:30.980> acorn<00:02:31.370> can<00:02:31.700> turn<00:02:31.910> into<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.209> big

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
tree so an acorn can turn into a big
