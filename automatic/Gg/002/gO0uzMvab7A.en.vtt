00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 a guide to buying shellfish 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.709
 when you cook the scallops the prawns 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.510
 crabs or lobster purchased from 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.580
 fresh products and you won't go wrong 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.500
 I recommend you ask an advice 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.810
 expert is a bargain costs 20 pounds 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 the roger burton fishmonger knows everything 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.529
 on shellfish he said he wants to go 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.310
 I'm sorry at home, but stay with me 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.630
 in this field for over 35 years 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.460
 listen to his advice and not you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.820
 you will feel lost when you buy the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.310
 fish 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.800
 then these are the prawns that 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.100
 show look how many there are 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.050
 they must be beautiful and shiny if they are 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.950
 too soft the head begins to 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.910
 break away from the body and it is not a good one 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.210
 sign 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.670
 listen to me, let them stay age 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.620
 frame take a pan together i 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.820
 Shrimp Put the olive oil on turn 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.290
 for good and let them cook is and then they are 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.290
 absolutely fantastic 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.009
 because I love the shrimp need 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.060
 taste the different varieties 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.490
 here are my favorite gray shrimp are 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.289
 small but absolutely delicious to me 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.130
 like with spicy butter inside a 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.410
 an Atlantic prawn toast are 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.260
 very tasty perfect to prepare 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.810
 tapas or the correggio 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.100
 tiger prawns are great for preparing 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.070
 typical salads of the kitchen 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.110
 Asian or fried tiger prawns 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.870
 they are excellent marinated in a sauce based 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.830
 of garlic oil and chilli pepper and 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.830
 served with shell 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.659
 exchanges are my favorites you can 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.590
 brown them abolish them and serve them with one 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.590
 garlic mayonnaise 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.130
 once people ate 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.560
 littorine or canonical and today it is not 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.289
 they do more and it's a shame they should 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.750
 use more trust and do not love 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.180
 will be more like before 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.550
 these are the little littorinas what a marvel 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.800
 they smell of sea seasoned with some 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.950
 salt and pepper and a sprinkling of vinegar 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.340
 to exalt their taste in England there 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.890
 they are the best and oysters in the world 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.130
 I'm crazy about it when you bought it 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.030
 you will need to make sure they are closed if 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.910
 are open let it be 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.390
 adventurous taste everything who does not 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.530
 risica not rosica with the right recipe 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.530
 and fresh shellfish
