solar panels on is that and it's pretty

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.270 
solar panels on is that and it's pretty
neat<00:00:37.270> it's<00:00:38.270> not<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:38.480> great<00:00:38.840> like<00:00:39.290> it's<00:00:40.160> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
neat it's not that great like it's the

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.670 

I<00:00:44.090> was<00:00:44.540> getting<00:00:44.750> pretty<00:00:44.870> frustrated<00:00:45.470> with<00:00:45.590> how

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
I was getting pretty frustrated with how

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.740 
I was getting pretty frustrated with how
long<00:00:45.740> it<00:00:46.010> took<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.220> make<00:00:46.610> solar<00:00:47.030> panels<00:00:47.390> even

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
long it took to make solar panels even

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.710 
long it took to make solar panels even
with<00:00:47.900> a<00:00:47.930> Mach<00:00:48.380> 3<00:00:48.680> crafting<00:00:49.160> table<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.420> I

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
with a Mach 3 crafting table so I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.990 
with a Mach 3 crafting table so I
decided<00:00:51.200> to<00:00:51.350> make<00:00:52.040> this<00:00:52.190> which<00:00:52.730> does

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
decided to make this which does

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.030 
decided to make this which does
everything<00:00:53.300> for<00:00:53.630> me<00:00:53.809> more<00:00:54.410> or<00:00:54.500> less<00:00:54.530> it

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
everything for me more or less it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.620 
everything for me more or less it
requires<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.520> little<00:00:55.610> bit<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:55.850> maintenance<00:00:56.030> but

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
requires a little bit of maintenance but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.120 
requires a little bit of maintenance but
apart<00:00:56.809> from<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:57.380> pretty<00:00:57.650> much<00:00:57.770> about<00:00:58.070> a

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
apart from that it's pretty much about a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:06.880 
apart from that it's pretty much about a
minute<00:01:00.640> namely<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:02.510> needs<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.960> supply<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:05.890> EMC

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
minute namely it needs a supply of EMC

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.800 
minute namely it needs a supply of EMC
in<00:01:07.130> order<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.490> run<00:01:07.670> all<00:01:07.850> these<00:01:08.000> condensers<00:01:08.570> so

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
in order to run all these condensers so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.650 
in order to run all these condensers so
that<00:01:08.990> they<00:01:09.229> have<00:01:09.410> enough<00:01:10.300> so<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.330> they<00:01:11.540> have

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
that they have enough so that they have

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.200 
that they have enough so that they have
enough<00:01:11.900> matter<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.590> spin<00:01:13.250> into<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:13.670> huge

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
enough matter to spin into this huge

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.280 
enough matter to spin into this huge
mess<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.110> pipes<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.680> crafting<00:01:16.369> tables<00:01:17.290> got

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
mess of pipes and crafting tables got

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.160 
mess of pipes and crafting tables got
three<00:01:18.500> machines<00:01:18.860> as<00:01:19.009> well

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
three machines as well

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.620 
three machines as well
I<00:01:20.229> know<00:01:21.070> all<00:01:21.400> these<00:01:21.880> contents<00:01:22.299> are<00:01:22.420> sure<00:01:22.509> you

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
I know all these contents are sure you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.330 
I know all these contents are sure you
are<00:01:22.750> all<00:01:23.080> produced<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.619> needed<00:01:23.860> materials

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
are all produced the needed materials

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.330 
are all produced the needed materials
this<00:01:24.610> one<00:01:24.820> makes<00:01:25.030> my<00:01:25.270> room<00:01:25.950> pretty<00:01:26.950> low<00:01:27.159> action

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
this one makes my room pretty low action

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.289 
this one makes my room pretty low action
this<00:01:28.270> mattress<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.840> Tim<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:30.040> makes<00:01:30.430> coal<00:01:31.000> and

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
this mattress is Tim this makes coal and

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.730 
this mattress is Tim this makes coal and
so<00:01:31.479> on<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.720> produces<00:01:32.080> all<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.290> materials<00:01:32.710> that

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
so on it produces all the materials that

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.920 
so on it produces all the materials that
I<00:01:32.860> need<00:01:33.689> give<00:01:34.689> me<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.810> second<00:01:35.290> it's<00:01:35.409> a<00:01:35.500> craps<00:01:36.930> tak

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
I need give me a second it's a craps tak

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.620 
I need give me a second it's a craps tak
manner

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.370 

I<00:01:41.719> you<00:01:42.409> stock<00:01:42.740> matter<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.189> supply<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.549> machine

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
I you stock matter to supply the machine

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.030 
I you stock matter to supply the machine
it's<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.560> pretty<00:01:46.219> neat

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.050 

that<00:01:49.430> should<00:01:49.640> be<00:01:49.700> more<00:01:49.880> than<00:01:49.940> enough

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that should be more than enough

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.510 
that should be more than enough
that<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.869> makes<00:01:52.049> ayran<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:52.979> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that it just makes ayran and then just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.429 
that it just makes ayran and then just
distributes<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.600> Iranians<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
distributes the Iranians of the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.240 
distributes the Iranians of the
condensers<00:01:56.149> anyway

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
condensers anyway

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.340 
condensers anyway
that's<00:01:58.790> on<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:58.940> fielder's<00:01:59.300> here<00:01:59.600> as<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.960> narrated

right next to the furnace to the
condensers<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:04.960> filters<00:02:05.960> spit<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.620> but

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
condensers and the filters spit out but

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.249 
condensers and the filters spit out but
what's<00:02:07.610> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
what's the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.259 
what's the
they're<00:02:08.860> differently<00:02:09.340> configured<00:02:09.729> some<00:02:10.179> of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
they're differently configured some of

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.390 
they're differently configured some of
them<00:02:10.390> spill<00:02:10.689> out<00:02:10.810> like<00:02:10.840> eight<00:02:11.530> at<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.799> time<00:02:12.099> some

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
them spill out like eight at a time some

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.559 
them spill out like eight at a time some
of<00:02:12.519> them<00:02:12.610> spit<00:02:12.879> out<00:02:12.939> final<00:02:13.420> time<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.019> on

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
of them spit out final time and so on

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.319 
of them spit out final time and so on
it's<00:02:16.569> not<00:02:16.780> calibrated<00:02:17.700> 100%<00:02:18.700> correctly<00:02:19.150> so

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
it's not calibrated 100% correctly so

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.819 
it's not calibrated 100% correctly so
far<00:02:19.569> there<00:02:19.780> are<00:02:19.810> still<00:02:20.049> some<00:02:20.140> issues<00:02:20.349> with<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
far there are still some issues with the

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.740 
far there are still some issues with the
system<00:02:21.189> though<00:02:21.489> most<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.000> systems<00:02:22.390> remain

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
system though most of the systems remain

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.720 
system though most of the systems remain
in<00:02:22.989> some<00:02:23.920> piping<00:02:24.189> issues<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:26.730> actually

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
in some piping issues I I actually

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.809 
in some piping issues I I actually
spliced<00:02:28.569> some<00:02:28.930> pipes<00:02:29.140> together<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:29.829> that<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.129> I

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
spliced some pipes together so that I I

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.330 
spliced some pipes together so that I I
could<00:02:31.360> save<00:02:31.810> some<00:02:31.989> room<00:02:32.019> but<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.799> end<00:02:32.980> result

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
could save some room but the end result

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.309 
could save some room but the end result
is<00:02:33.549> that<00:02:33.579> some<00:02:34.090> some<00:02:34.750> parts<00:02:35.019> of<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.200> system

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
is that some some parts of the system

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.750 
is that some some parts of the system
don't<00:02:35.680> quite<00:02:35.980> work<00:02:36.190> without<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.579> bit<00:02:36.730> of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
don't quite work without a bit of

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.830 
don't quite work without a bit of
maintenance<00:02:37.000> it

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
maintenance it

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.890 
maintenance it
this<00:02:39.379> is<00:02:39.500> one<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.340> biggest<00:02:40.760> issues<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.629> far

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
this is one of the biggest issues so far

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.949 
this is one of the biggest issues so far
thus<00:02:42.410> chest<00:02:42.800> gathers<00:02:43.280> up<00:02:43.519> its<00:02:44.510> supposed<00:02:44.629> to

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
thus chest gathers up its supposed to

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.059 
thus chest gathers up its supposed to
gather<00:02:45.140> up<00:02:45.379> copper<00:02:45.709> cable<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:47.680> redstone<00:02:48.680> dust

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
gather up copper cable and redstone dust

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.420 
gather up copper cable and redstone dust
but<00:02:49.790> it's<00:02:50.360> gathering<00:02:50.989> up<00:02:51.349> all<00:02:51.590> kinds<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.340> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
but it's gathering up all kinds of a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.080 
but it's gathering up all kinds of a
pool

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
pool

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.860 
pool
so<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.989> kinds<00:02:55.349> of<00:02:55.410> things<00:02:55.590> right<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.690> need

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
so all kinds of things right so I need

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.309 
so all kinds of things right so I need
to<00:02:58.110> fix<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.849> how<00:02:59.849> BIG's<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.870> religious

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
to fix that how BIG's that I religious

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.520 
to fix that how BIG's that I religious
neat<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.540> really<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:03.720> need<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.019> second

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
neat I really just need the second

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.059 
neat I really just need the second
filter<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:06.319> don't<00:03:07.319> fix<00:03:07.560> half<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
filter on there don't fix half of the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.040 
filter on there don't fix half of the
issue<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.489> then<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> need<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:08.940> improve<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
issue and then I need to improve the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.380 
issue and then I need to improve the
piping<00:03:10.500> because<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:12.599> problem<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.349> this

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
piping because the problem is that this

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.850 
piping because the problem is that this
list<00:03:15.390> felder<00:03:15.840> supplies<00:03:16.230> cables<00:03:16.799> insulated

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
list felder supplies cables insulated

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.520 
list felder supplies cables insulated
which<00:03:19.860> then<00:03:20.160> goes<00:03:20.340> up<00:03:20.400> here<00:03:21.210> into<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.260> chest

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
which then goes up here into the chest

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.740 
which then goes up here into the chest
of<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.160> problem<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:23.970> also<00:03:24.090> spit<00:03:24.510> self

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
of the problem is that it also spit self

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.640 
of the problem is that it also spit self
this<00:03:25.020> way<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:27.390> another<00:03:27.690> crafting<00:03:28.140> table<00:03:28.500> this

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
this way to another crafting table this

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.150 
this way to another crafting table this
one<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.400> make<00:03:29.550> batteries<00:03:30.530> it's<00:03:31.530> pretty<00:03:31.860> dumb

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
one to make batteries it's pretty dumb

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.430 
one to make batteries it's pretty dumb
that<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.460> have<00:03:32.640> for<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.660> two<00:03:33.840> machine<00:03:34.170> that

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
that I have for the two machine that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440 
that I have for the two machine that
need<00:03:34.590> cover<00:03:34.830> cables<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.460> far<00:03:35.670> apart<00:03:35.790> well<00:03:36.330> no

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
need cover cables that far apart well no

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.760 
need cover cables that far apart well no
not<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.690> far<00:03:36.870> apart<00:03:36.990> but<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.470> know<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
not that far apart but you know the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.810 
not that far apart but you know the
Fighting's<00:03:38.150> retarded<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:40.250> need<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.430> need<00:03:41.550> to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
Fighting's retarded so I need I need to

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.210 
Fighting's retarded so I need I need to
move<00:03:41.970> them<00:03:42.150> closer<00:03:42.360> and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
move them closer and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.100 
move them closer and
that's<00:03:44.520> probably<00:03:44.850> what<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.060> have<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:45.330> do<00:03:45.480> that

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
that's probably what I have to do that

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.420 
that's probably what I have to do that
should<00:03:46.350> be<00:03:46.770> able<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.160> should<00:03:47.730> help<00:03:47.790> fix

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
should be able that should help fix

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.339 
should be able that should help fix
another<00:03:49.090> thing<00:03:49.269> i<00:03:49.390> could<00:03:49.510> do<00:03:49.629> is<00:03:49.659> just<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.170> put

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
another thing i could do is just to put

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.130 
another thing i could do is just to put
a<00:03:50.379> chest<00:03:50.620> up<00:03:50.799> here<00:03:51.269> with<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.299> filter<00:03:52.689> on<00:03:52.870> that

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
a chest up here with a filter on that

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.080 
a chest up here with a filter on that
would<00:03:53.409> also<00:03:53.650> fix<00:03:54.129> the<00:03:54.310> problem<00:03:54.670> but<00:03:54.969> that's

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
would also fix the problem but that's

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.240 
would also fix the problem but that's
kind<00:03:55.390> of<00:03:55.480> an<00:03:55.959> elegant<00:03:56.409> but<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.310> could<00:03:57.670> do<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
kind of an elegant but I could do I

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.630 
kind of an elegant but I could do I
originally<00:04:00.250> when<00:04:00.700> i<00:04:00.730> made<00:04:00.939> the<00:04:01.060> system<00:04:01.480> i<00:04:01.719> I

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
originally when i made the system i I

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.610 
originally when i made the system i I
place<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:04.000> condensers<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:05.079> order<00:04:05.379> so<00:04:05.590> that

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
place the condensers in order so that

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.500 
place the condensers in order so that
the<00:04:05.829> most<00:04:06.040> expensive<00:04:06.459> materials<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.329> ones

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
the most expensive materials the ones

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.530 
the most expensive materials the ones
requiring<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.230> most<00:04:08.459> EMC<00:04:09.459> was<00:04:09.909> over<00:04:10.209> here

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
requiring the most EMC was over here

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.420 
requiring the most EMC was over here
this<00:04:10.780> one's<00:04:11.019> man<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.650> like<00:04:11.889> that<00:04:12.159> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
this one's man and like that the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.009 
this one's man and like that the
cheapest<00:04:12.790> was<00:04:12.909> over<00:04:13.150> heels<00:04:13.389> with<00:04:13.659> /

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
cheapest was over heels with /

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.039 
cheapest was over heels with /
interested<00:04:14.980> goes<00:04:15.730> up

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.650 

and<00:04:22.630> yeah<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:25.270> different<00:04:26.270> just<00:04:26.389> fixed

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
and yeah it's a different just fixed

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.850 
and yeah it's a different just fixed
that<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.930> system<00:04:27.230> will<00:04:27.320> be<00:04:27.470> pretty<00:04:27.680> much

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
that the system will be pretty much

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.370 
that the system will be pretty much
entirely<00:04:28.190> yet<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:29.540> all<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.780> automatic<00:04:30.139> it's

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
entirely yet it's all the automatic it's

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.510 
entirely yet it's all the automatic it's
just<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.620> matter<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.830> working<00:04:31.040> out<00:04:31.250> all<00:04:31.400> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
just a matter of working out all the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.550 
just a matter of working out all the
math<00:04:31.699> and<00:04:31.729> then<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:32.510> will<00:04:32.630> be<00:04:32.810> running<00:04:33.380> on<00:04:33.530> its

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
math and then it will be running on its

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
I would you I figured I would just made

I would you I figured I would just made
this<00:05:21.240> video<00:05:21.450> to<00:05:21.570> shove<00:05:21.870> this<00:05:22.050> machine<00:05:23.210> I<00:05:24.210> spent

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
this video to shove this machine I spent

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.690 
this video to shove this machine I spent
the<00:05:24.720> whole<00:05:24.750> night<00:05:24.900> working<00:05:25.260> on<00:05:25.500> it<00:05:25.620> i'm<00:05:25.770> like

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
the whole night working on it i'm like

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.140 
the whole night working on it i'm like
five<00:05:27.000> hours<00:05:27.060> or<00:05:27.480> so<00:05:27.680> sir<00:05:28.730> it's<00:05:29.730> something<00:05:29.940> I've

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
five hours or so sir it's something I've

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.460 
five hours or so sir it's something I've
been<00:05:30.180> wanting<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.660> do<00:05:30.780> for<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:31.020> while<00:05:31.200> but<00:05:31.410> i

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
been wanting to do for a while but i

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.990 
been wanting to do for a while but i
never<00:05:31.530> really<00:05:31.920> got<00:05:32.040> around<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.460> doing<00:05:32.670> it<00:05:32.760> but

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
never really got around to doing it but

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.200 
never really got around to doing it but
now<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.480> did<00:05:33.780> and<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:35.400> was<00:05:35.520> actually<00:05:35.670> easier

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
now I did and it was actually easier

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.910 
now I did and it was actually easier
than<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:36.510> expected<00:05:36.890> although

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
than I expected although

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.520 
than I expected although
issues<00:05:39.910> i<00:05:40.150> could<00:05:40.270> probably<00:05:40.450> fix<00:05:40.750> those<00:05:41.020> by

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
issues i could probably fix those by

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.230 
issues i could probably fix those by
redesigning<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.310> machine<00:05:42.610> it'll<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:42.970> thought

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
redesigning the machine it'll I thought

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.490 
redesigning the machine it'll I thought
it<00:05:43.300> would<00:05:43.390> be<00:05:43.480> a<00:05:43.510> lot<00:05:43.690> more<00:05:43.750> complicated<00:05:44.170> to

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
it would be a lot more complicated to

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.400 
it would be a lot more complicated to
make<00:05:44.620> this<00:05:46.470> no<00:05:47.470> way<00:05:48.990> hopefully<00:05:49.990> somebody

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
make this no way hopefully somebody

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.390 
make this no way hopefully somebody
enjoyed<00:05:50.830> this<00:05:50.950> video<00:05:51.390> bye
