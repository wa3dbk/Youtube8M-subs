00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:13.260
 we are on board a volkswagen scirocco 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.529
 thanks to the mobility program we are a 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.840
 bolzano in a track we have a car with 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.820
 the accelerator circles the brake a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.920
 long arm is a certain friction for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.310
 be able to use the gearbox without 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.470
 use of the lower limbs 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.740
 we are on a track completely 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.170
 frozen 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.680
 and now let's try to run on the track 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.680
 here we go 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.720
 I would go after the black vault I would say yes 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720
 no 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:03.890
 ok you remember we play accelerator 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.519
 parts and very well you can 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.519
 it's the same as always 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.979
 prevent what we have to go to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.030
 do in correction so now there 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.030
 we prepare a possible 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.020
 we have to wait to remember the wheels 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.870
 aside 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.470
 we always want to go 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.470
 and then the gas 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.440
 we are in Madonna di Campiglio with the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.020
 match of the heart 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.320
 we are in the frozen lake and now 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.230
 we begin to do the driving test 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.710
 on snow ice and good luck 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.710
 birth 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:09.410
 we are with the instructor stefano faggioni 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:12.840
 which gives us the first solutions to drive 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.840
 safely on snow on ice 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.640
 the reading in front of him went into 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.640
 head tail for which we go very slowly 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.640
 let's never go 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.610
 we are at the wheel of a race 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:40.560
 was in 32 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.560
 on the snow of nice barrels genoa 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.010
 modica 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.430
 comics 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.890
 I got caught 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.890
 then 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.980
 of course 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.610
 let's see soccer 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.580
 certainly the wedding 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:46.690
 we are off road with stefano ours 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.479
 instructor that we have already seen in 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.710
 try our snow with ice 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.479
 instructor 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.159
 we are right in the center of the world in 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:59.379
 Campiglio to Madonna del Campiglio we are 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.639
 inside a chi quan e we are 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.759
 going off road 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:08.530
 the pilot is stefano of the person who 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:11.590
 yesterday he taught us technical documents 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:16.289
 on safety on snow and ice 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.289
 as you can see although there is a 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.330
 there is a lot of asphalt and yes 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.569
 they will see images of who they are 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.750
 the writers stefano some 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.580
 suggestion to always use when you are 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.550
 in the presence of ice snow either 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.620
 on the asphalt than on the dirt road and use 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.530
 always very careful at breakfast 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.849
 screamer than with the brake and above all a 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.550
 very important advice in the 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.409
 newspaper periods to become on 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.629
 thermal machine 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.059
 completely changes the answer of the 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.889
 car 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:06:00.719
 literally but above all at the level 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:03.110
 braking safety of insertions is 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:06.749
 always essential is to have a clean 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.909
 in all course changes either 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:11.580
 in acceleration than in braking 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.009
 yes accurate the accelerator you used with 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.969
 very cautiously slam and like a used one 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:20.759
 on multaq huntelaar train and then 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:21.869
 always try to drive very clean and 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.529
 however caution 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:28.259
 she who is a pilot is that she has seen them 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:31.259
 all the colors as they say outside 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:36.300
 always from the runway prudence 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:38.879
 caution I recommend you respect the 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.269
 snow mainly downhill use again 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:44.840
 much more caution too you know that with 

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:46.550
 the car should go there 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.590
 the braking distance is slightly longer 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.180
 because the biesse continues to read that 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.980
 then the car wants to brake for 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.990
 what I told you before to use it three 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.130
 reasons 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.350
 chapel cure low marches if you do 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.770
 steep descents and try to make go 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:06.090
 the car of an engine brake will have to 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:10.290
 pay the train very slowly 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.290
 thanks to the next
