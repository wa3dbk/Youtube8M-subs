 and how about from friends to climent 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.770
 and well today let's talk a 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:23.200
 subject that arouses much interest that 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.200
 Wake up a lot of water 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.259
 well it does not matter in the end the difference 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.890
 between a in Medellin and an idiot a 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.860
 fool 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.670
 ie to hear what the hell just that 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.160
 Title 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.190
 Well the truth, well, let me tell you 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.260
 more or less to what this comes I got to 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.149
 play good before before before 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.289
 before all the video happens I do not 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.820
 I'm saying it 's an e-mail and 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.800
 provides if there is not, they give me the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.019
 you are pure they will lead to the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.390
 and 9 what do you say m 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.960
 I never said to myself, I'm not telling myself 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.589
 the good jockey does not matter in the end 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.749
 long ago in halo reach I played in 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.620
 emilia did not get to the big leagues 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:09.100
 but I was in the bears 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.740
 and well there you played games and everything and 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.650
 win some lost others but the joke 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.340
 is that the items that I lost sorry that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.860
 yes I lost my opponent and always 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.720
 they sent me a message I almost do not know what 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.720
 what did he say 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.970
 congratulations or you played well wild wold 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.270
 trade I do not know the joke is that you 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.030
 they said you played well that's having attitude 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.890
 competitive gentlemen that is precisely 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.200
 access a gene level you are told 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.420
 be an emery I tell you to be professional 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.750
 do not 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.910
 be mature more than anything too 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.950
 well that was in the ml what I'm going to 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.900
 say now step on a livestream I do not 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.170
 agreement of who but it was in halo here 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.800
 in gilo 4 and it was something like that that left me 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.820
 so very very very surprised the joke is 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.820
 which were two types 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.250
 how good they said there, not that these are 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.470
 well emery that who sees what and if the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.590
 truth is that if they play very well 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.040
 it's true that they play pretty well 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.470
 but the problem lies here I was told 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.750
 that they were expelled because those those two 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.580
 guys were not subscribers they were friends 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.260
 then how the joke was to play with 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.970
 subscribers told me to expel 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.299
 these two by then if we had 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.030
 played a few games and one of them me 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:36.140
 they had killed like three or four times 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.900
 with the rifle good dad happens that the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.629
 he kicked out because I was the host of the lobby 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.000
 see see before the good street I 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.040
 he was the lobbyist's boss and he expelled them and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.319
 as at five minutes one sends me a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.230
 message there is a burning asshole who 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.030
 He knows you got mad because if you look 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.280
 with the rifle so who knows what 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.380
 the three minutes after that the other 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.270
 he sends me a message there is who knows 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.270
 that you're a newbie asshole that you do not know 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.870
 play and I like this they finished what I go in 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.310
 the gym 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.250
 we do not see very emery points 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.750
 in fact out of the subject I'm thinking 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.849
 in putting your gamer tax in the description 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.250
 and how do I know that you love me so much 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.620
 they are going to help me to denounce them so that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.590
 they go in xbox not by language 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.660
 offensive more than anything but well that 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.470
 I keep thinking that I still think maybe 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.720
 I did it 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.110
 Maybe I 'll finally do it, which one is 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.060
 the point of these gentlemen an e-mail and not 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.030
 necessarily distinguished by playing 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.340
 well good more like a professional in the 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.980
 game are not distinguished by playing well or 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.709
 for what he does neither for his skills nor 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.010
 none of that if you give titles bone yes yes 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.319
 if you give it as well as it stands out among the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.470
 others do not but the important thing is to have 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.410
 competitive attitude telethon especially 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.540
 when you are already participating at a level in 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.120
 the one who gets paid to play a level in the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.950
 they give you trophies and it's obvious that you win 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.200
 obviously there you already have to 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.050
 behave in a more mature way does not not 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.890
 you're going to lose and this one 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.960
 and who am a rookie camper and why 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.770
 I know many very many 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.930
 people much closer others who 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.480
 stay in the gym and you realize that 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.880
 they are not because when you kill them you click 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.850
 why do you want to be that and in the end not 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.890
 I was joking I was joking the point is 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.270
 sorry forgiveness my throat is going down 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:38.550
 try to imitate this voice pendejo 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.030
 Well the point is that attitude makes the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.520
 player no no you're not going to be there winning 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.320
 for example you do not you do not go you beat 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.200
 someone and sends his message saying no 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.200
 or newbie, what do I know, that's pretty 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.730
 stupid and mentally retarded there is no me to 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.190
 who do it to me I block it and what 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.460
 denounced because the truth then is a 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.340
 game and the fact of losing does not mean 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.500
 that you're going to lose forever maybe 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.680
 you lost for some extraordinary reason 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.830
 what do I know then you have to know also 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.960
 distinguish that not why why they 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.900
 I talk about this apart from that I wanted them 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.760
 bring a hayley gameplay and that 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.040
 obviously this talk was not going to 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.790
 agree with with a minecraft map or 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.500
 something like that 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.570
 because I'm talking about this, it's because 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.060
 lately heard many that I 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.070
 they are challenging not no on youtube in 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.050
 youtube if they are challenging me but in xbox 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.210
 Challengers send me messages like that 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.430
 have touched many eggs mamÃ©s and if 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.960
 you are very good, one against one 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:44.200
 who knows that an e-mail but does not 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.249
 that and we know that we know good I for 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.589
 at least I know about that 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.859
 or those those stupid are nothing else is 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:53.959
 get attention and it's almost always 

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:56.869
 for that sound before what it's called 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:06:00.849
 attention horse attention horse whores 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:03.360
 attention something like that then yes gentlemen 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:06.099
 the joke is that they learn to differentiate 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.459
 an e-mail that has a competitive attitude 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:12.759
 that respects that is mature that commands 

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:17.459
 they talk there is no if you click blowjobs and another 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.459
 thing is stupid an imbecile 

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:22.960
 to walk doing so discovered 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.020
 delayed 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.879
 good 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.599
 well that 's all I wanted to try 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:32.580
 with you in this video and remember not 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:36.030
 I'm saying that I am an e-mail and 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.590
 so I kick ass I'm the 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.190
 best of all I'm not saying that 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.700
 but what did you say you played in 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.330
 Google 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.529
 I'm not saying it's a professional 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.709
 100% ok 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:53.359
 but because I already know them she 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:55.429
 I know and I know that some are 

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:57.709

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:59.239
