00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.030
 rhodium 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.059
 This is us a new element of the factory ground 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.260
 primer good solvent check 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.330
 passed 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.060
 but the preparation process of preparation 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.480
 punch the house gave ogarttsy when the machine 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.820
 work 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.140
 it is as if not mowing can not say that 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.090
 it's a cant but 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.220
 as an option that you can do with it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.050
 you can just score on this thing and on top 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.900
 paint 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.449
 keeps himself not once so sinful though it is impossible 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.780
 but keeps proven but the best way 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.420
 as if not to prime completely 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.760
 items or are there guns to shout 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.220
 now the wing is ready just he 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.670
 degreased and just go through here it is 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.519
 only puff primer it is well my favorite 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.739
 ruler dropped cylinders at all 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:00.600
 material is chic now we pass 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.390
 rubbed zones to metal terrible 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.910
 nothing will be exactly in the process 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.039
 paint I show later on the first layer 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:14.880
 bases what's going on is well mixed and 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:17.509
 from a distance well like so centimeters 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.509
 25 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.100
 just covering up our task not to fill 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.080
 Against namely on her subscriptions if you 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.270
 see that there are some kind of droplets suddenly 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.870
 from the balloon flew and afraid that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.500
 the base is then manifest as it can 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.820
 will be super files or scotch-bright 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.040
 wipe again and move forward 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.740
 paint but if the balloon is well mixed 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.680
 how to sort out nothing primer 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.430
 so thin layer has that a 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.210
 you are the finger that lies 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.670
 can 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.830
 do not show it just sticky 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.050
 with a napkin to remove what 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.880
 lay on the surface there 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.880
 anyone not so loud wet walk up 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.760
 the most important as for me the main plus 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.150
 so effective is not like we 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.700
 cover up even the metal what if the color 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.049
 let's say you have white or red then 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.439
 it will be very difficult to block exactly 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.689
 this one line of metal lumen between one 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.209
 metal and primer when the primer is set on fire 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:34.329
 he covered namely it will be like this 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.370
 it is easier to block the paint will now dry 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.189
 I will wipe with a sticky napkin 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.889
 the first layer will show yes and another moment 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.720
 many forget that after the balloon 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.359
 use upside down just 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.849
 pickle until it leaves the tube 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.680
 which is in a balloon 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.710
 ground material you use 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.170
 otherwise dries up then sap bill lecture 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.040
 snot and balloon will be almost 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.040
 Iskander to pull out 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.500
 the ground has dried here literally minutes 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.750
 34 passed 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.550
 sticky napkin 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.540
 take off can be there 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.540
 nothing stuck 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.990
 either gray scotbright or super 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.990
 fine am pushing up the ground 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.360
 it all depends on what kind of primer 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.020
 In principle, here is what is not stuck 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.020
 there we gathered 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.770
 once again made out completely 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.630
 everything 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:57.210
 and show what happens 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:04:00.390
 when stealing an old man was different for those 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.580
 who worries about what thunder will give 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.580
 some jamb on paint the world namaze 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.080
 free 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.250
 all that we primed while wet for 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.250
 it is clear that nothing is visible 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.210
 it is most important 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.180
 I sat black 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.439
 Daria task
