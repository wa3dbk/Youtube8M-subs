00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.490
 today 

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.070
 In that Lego 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.520
 I tried to create a balance of dial-up 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:13.000
 I have to is any chocolate before I'd made a padlock 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:20.200
 I 'm not anxious , so this is it 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.980
 I will go and see the autumn First absolutely not 6 Kokui also had appropriate 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.980
 But this 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.000
 Oops 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.600
 First of all 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 Do pen orange then 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.360
 And about one-point 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 finally 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.270
 If you want to yellow but still professional 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.210
 It is moved 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.530
 like this 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.530
 It is open system 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:53.750
 This is also the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.750
 I think the port is a shoot enemy this year 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.120
 It is a mechanism that won't be rock young 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.660
 Properly 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.160
 going 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:19.490
 First, there is a ledge of here 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.890
 I have a bump and I will bump 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.690
 There is a gap 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.900
 Is 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.900
 After buying the scan 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.170
 There is also a gap here 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.170
 Place 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.650
 And then 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:52.610
 Here on the application also be reflected in it this scaffold can gap 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.920
 And if you do this, this protrusion will be retracted 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.890
 If there is a head in this 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.640
 this 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.640
 9 Anu 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.030
 This one 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.820
 Gar 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.619
 Do not open it caught using 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.860
 Just where do you go back 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.810
 It has become a gateway like this 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.810
 Thank you for seeing the last goodbye
