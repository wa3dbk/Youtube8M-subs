00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
maybe that was part of the problem I

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.339 
maybe that was part of the problem I
don't<00:04:03.120> know<00:04:03.269> but<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.560> was<00:04:04.769> sloppy<00:04:05.810> he<00:04:06.810> just

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
don't know but it was sloppy he just

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.709 
don't know but it was sloppy he just
chops<00:04:07.709> off<00:04:07.979> moves<00:04:08.370> he<00:04:08.699> just<00:04:08.909> doesn't<00:04:09.239> continue

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:09.719 
chops off moves he just doesn't continue

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.559 
chops off moves he just doesn't continue
through<00:04:10.169> with<00:04:10.349> them<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.709> just<00:04:10.949> it's<00:04:11.189> so<00:04:11.569> he

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
through with them it's just it's so he

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.890 
through with them it's just it's so he
doesn't<00:04:12.780> have<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.079> right<00:04:13.229> technique<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.979> guess

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
doesn't have the right technique I guess

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.770 
doesn't have the right technique I guess
