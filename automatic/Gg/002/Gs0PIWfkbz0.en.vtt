00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.430 
well like the hardest thing we'd done at
that<00:02:16.760> point<00:02:17.120> because<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.540> was<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.020> fast<00:02:18.319> and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
that point because it was so fast and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.309 
that point because it was so fast and
when<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.709> watch<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:18.920> back<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.520> looks<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.319> it

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
when you watch it back it looks so so it

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.410 
when you watch it back it looks so so it
doesn't<00:02:21.680> look<00:02:21.950> how<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.520> feels<00:02:22.790> yeah<00:02:23.180> that's

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
doesn't look how it feels yeah that's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.780 
doesn't look how it feels yeah that's
the<00:02:23.660> funny<00:02:23.900> thing<00:02:24.020> but<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.830> loved<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.490> really

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
the funny thing but I loved it I really

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.550 
the funny thing but I loved it I really
enjoyed<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.360> no<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.690> did<00:02:27.080> make<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.290> few

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.170

think as long as you learn by what they

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.679 
think as long as you learn by what they
say<00:02:31.400> that's<00:02:31.610> always<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.939> good<00:02:32.090> thing<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.510> like
