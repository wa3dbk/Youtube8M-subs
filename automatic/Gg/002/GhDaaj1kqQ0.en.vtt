way<00:02:06.720> let's<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.500> speaking<00:02:07.920> around<00:02:08.100> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
way let's see what speaking around that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.110 
way let's see what speaking around that
corner<00:02:13.100> obviously<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> few<00:02:14.640> enemies

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
corner obviously we have a few enemies

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.090 
corner obviously we have a few enemies
to<00:02:15.330> get<00:02:15.420> rid<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.500> might<00:02:16.740> need<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> bit

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
to get rid of and we might need a bit

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.030 
to get rid of and we might need a bit
more<00:02:17.130> animal<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.760> do<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.240> let's<00:02:18.450> get<00:02:18.660> some

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
more animal to do it so let's get some

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
more animal to do it so let's get some
all<00:02:20.040> right<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.250> think<00:02:20.400> we're<00:02:20.640> good<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.880> start

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
all right I think we're good to start

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:45.449 
all right I think we're good to start
our<00:02:21.210> assault

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.400 

so<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.700> was<00:02:46.879> a<00:02:46.910> purely<00:02:47.209> combat<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:48.050> approach

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
so this was a purely combat of approach

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.080 
so this was a purely combat of approach
something<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.129> can<00:02:49.280> employ<00:02:49.489> throughout<00:02:49.879> the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
something you can employ throughout the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.940 
something you can employ throughout the
game<00:02:50.300> she<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:50.930> also<00:02:51.080> mix<00:02:51.349> it<00:02:51.500> with<00:02:51.530> stealth

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
game she can also mix it with stealth

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.759 
game she can also mix it with stealth
which<00:02:52.280> we'll<00:02:52.489> see<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:52.940> next<00:02:53.300> playthrough

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
which we'll see in this next playthrough

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.910 
which we'll see in this next playthrough
Richard<00:02:58.660> since<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.170> stealth<00:03:00.590> approach

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
Richard since this is a stealth approach

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.339 
Richard since this is a stealth approach
will<00:03:01.700> use<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> non-lethal<00:03:02.480> takedown<00:03:03.019> on<00:03:03.200> this

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
will use a non-lethal takedown on this

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:12.980 
will use a non-lethal takedown on this
first<00:03:03.620> enemy

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.480 

we<00:03:13.990> want<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.320> be<00:03:14.410> stealthy<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.100> let's<00:03:15.280> also

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
we want to be stealthy so let's also

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:27.449 
we want to be stealthy so let's also
hide<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.940> body<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.450> loot<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.860> for<00:03:18.010> fun

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.860 

now<00:03:28.459> we<00:03:28.519> have<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.879> find<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.209> way<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.360> get<00:03:29.599> around

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
now we have to find a way to get around

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.229 
now we have to find a way to get around
these<00:03:30.140> enemies<00:03:30.590> without<00:03:30.950> being<00:03:31.159> seen<00:03:31.489> the

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
these enemies without being seen the

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.059 
these enemies without being seen the
best<00:03:32.450> way<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.629> go<00:03:32.840> about<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.319> is<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.650> explore

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
best way to go about this is to explore

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.920 
best way to go about this is to explore
so<00:03:34.549> let's<00:03:34.760> backtrack<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.450> see<00:03:35.659> what<00:03:35.810> was

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
so let's backtrack and see what was

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.190 
so let's backtrack and see what was
hiding<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.379> that<00:03:36.530> room<00:03:37.269> when<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.420> explore<00:03:38.870> you

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
hiding in that room when you explore you

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.050 
hiding in that room when you explore you
can<00:03:39.409> discover<00:03:39.739> alternate<00:03:40.430> paths<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.879> help

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
can discover alternate paths that help

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.600 
can discover alternate paths that help
you<00:03:41.180> go<00:03:41.360> around<00:03:41.629> major<00:03:41.870> obstacles<00:03:42.590> since<00:03:43.310> the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
you go around major obstacles since the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.220 
you go around major obstacles since the
level<00:03:43.879> design<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.390> Deus<00:03:44.720> Ex<00:03:44.870> Human<00:03:45.049> Revolution

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
level design in Deus Ex Human Revolution

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:54.850 
level design in Deus Ex Human Revolution
supports<00:03:46.069> many<00:03:46.310> different<00:03:46.730> approaches

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.530 

now<00:03:55.860> let's<00:03:56.130> use<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> cover<00:03:56.790> system<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.300> hide

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
now let's use the cover system to hide

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.630 
now let's use the cover system to hide
from<00:03:57.750> these<00:03:57.959> guys<00:03:58.200> well<00:03:59.040> wait<00:03:59.220> until<00:03:59.250> they

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
from these guys well wait until they

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.370 
from these guys well wait until they
finish<00:03:59.670> their<00:04:00.090> patrol<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:00.750> can<00:04:01.230> gain

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
finish their patrol and we can gain

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.020 
finish their patrol and we can gain
access<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.099> warehouse<00:04:02.400> without<00:04:02.790> being

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
access to the warehouse without being

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.610 
access to the warehouse without being
seen

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.080 

notice<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.920> coverage<00:04:12.220> system<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:12.820> used

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
notice that the coverage system is used

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.270 
notice that the coverage system is used
in<00:04:13.270> two<00:04:13.510> ways<00:04:13.720> first<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.920> survey<00:04:15.250> your

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
in two ways first to survey your

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.520 
in two ways first to survey your
surroundings<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.120> plan<00:04:16.390> your<00:04:16.570> approach<00:04:16.690> then

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
surroundings a plan your approach then

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.289 
surroundings a plan your approach then
second<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.130> physically<00:04:18.579> hide<00:04:18.820> yourself<00:04:19.239> from

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
second to physically hide yourself from

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.420 
second to physically hide yourself from
your<00:04:19.600> enemies<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.709> entirely<00:04:21.070> optional

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
your enemies this is entirely optional

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:38.280 
your enemies this is entirely optional
but<00:04:21.970> very<00:04:22.300> useful

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.270

explore and discover alternate paths
Pritchard<00:04:52.070> mentioned<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.520> roof<00:04:52.730> access<00:04:52.970> in<00:04:53.360> his

Pritchard mentioned a roof access in his
briefing<00:04:53.960> let's<00:04:54.620> try<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.920> get<00:04:55.100> inside<00:04:55.550> using

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
briefing let's try to get inside using

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.800 
briefing let's try to get inside using
it

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.939 

again<00:05:03.810> we'll<00:05:04.050> need<00:05:04.199> to<00:05:04.259> take<00:05:04.470> care<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.830> that

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
again we'll need to take care of that

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:17.110 
again we'll need to take care of that
sentry<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:05.910> we'll<00:05:06.090> use<00:05:06.240> another<00:05:06.540> takedown

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.460 

let's<00:05:18.120> hide<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.449> more<00:05:18.660> carefully<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.410> time

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
let's hide it more carefully this time

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:45.210 
let's hide it more carefully this time
just<00:05:20.100> for<00:05:20.280> fun

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.820 

the<00:05:45.850> layout<00:05:46.180> is<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.390> same<00:05:46.540> as<00:05:46.840> before<00:05:47.050> but<00:05:47.740> if

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
the layout is the same as before but if

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.830 
the layout is the same as before but if
you<00:05:47.860> look<00:05:48.190> carefully<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.790> might<00:05:49.330> find<00:05:49.660> a

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
you look carefully you might find a

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.500 
you look carefully you might find a
completely<00:05:50.320> different<00:05:50.470> route<00:05:54.090> you<00:05:55.090> may<00:05:55.300> even

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
completely different route you may even
