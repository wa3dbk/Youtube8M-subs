00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.720
 It is always difficult for a game to talk about others but have them 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.820
 have arrived in Munich feels quite obviously where else can you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.299
 the benefits on percent of the pitch does not bring this brings 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.619
 Percent they can understand so that for the renovation is now sour 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.480
 wants to play and say seven months 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.769
 Leonberg Ekberg or is that in the team announce 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.300
 at the TuS Laer 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.700
 25 man in only eleven can play it is a try would be necessary if the 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.060
 Coach would have the opportunity to play everything expectant mothers that 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.930
 should do that and 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 Percent I know many popular physical 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.590
 Vitis and and percent 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.950
 but one thing is clear, we have new ones 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.239
 Giant and performance brought as a team 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.070
 every single one and there isses harbor for the coach it for me 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.430
 interesting for 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540
 she also wanted to make decisions that she was happy to play 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.640
 I do not want to and should not give another position song anyway 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.510
 would like 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.930
 Percent but now comes the danger that ever bigger first leg neither have 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 especially more composer ll alright 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.490
 So one thing first we have to say the sweet 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.870
 being Timmermann gives in deep player moments and where to get one 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.870
 dissatisfied the woman in the area some cases 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.340
 would change or 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.830
 Percent would do better 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.260
 but percent 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.830
 there is stop moving and then you have to adapt and down 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.039
 who does that best, where does deer come from? 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.610
 whoever farthest 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.180
 they have been made so tight for Liege Syndicom are on 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.830
 They have come one of the purchases of everything is know them 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.310
 yes even about Luca Toni and about the lower and and about Klose percent was 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.400
 the kids wrote the numbers were extrapolated 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.740
 for Marcell Jansen ten million subjects Hamit Altintop 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.530
 you have already noticed that but not so highly acclaimed but it only plays 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.350
 an important 4 through 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.000
 not apart from the big stars is Hamit Altintop 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.640
 they have expected that they are so mist from the beginning 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.989
 So who is it only approx 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.849
 the forms 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.849
 Oliver wet and down from me and mine 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.969
 Consultant manager Bernt so Lenze also in very very good friend of mine 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.789
 well analyzed and that 's why I' ve taken such a step percent of the outside 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:29.209
 Altenau violence all previously talked about it or so at the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.709
 both at the Bauhaus talks like here I shot there I come 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:34.239
 tuned 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.230
 Many are said to be the thugs on the ground 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.149
 you will be embarrassed furniture 12 5 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.149
 Kylie Steinmeier Mr. Trittin 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.770
 So far we have been doing so in the dark 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.570
 and that one has you can analyze them and UL so I was very very 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.069
 optimistic also percent 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.849
 partly and my friends have told me just the boy had because it should 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.090
 already in good though 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.250
 how difficult it is he lacked the demands of the means there soft with partial 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.279
 a little sad 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.410
 that people just stopped thinking 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.000
 Percent would not sit back on the bench if that was the case 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.560
 about the readers so it will mean that you in the area one way or another 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.049
 it's just that you then also l percent 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.199
 In sum, the family in the structure of old age smoking should be adjusted too 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.439
 good to stand there and 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.189
 to be successful now I have to personally bring all the Tor back the way 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.769
 Nicola shards 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 that would be too easy 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.589
 a bit but already or 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:50.659
 and it belongs 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.140
 Of course, he already works that he is completely legal so would be yes 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.139
 Dangerous for the sake of the coach 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.469
 So brought in the Spree, yes, the team must put up the end 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.969
 was at that time 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.189
 Who has Magath he has exactly that's the problem that wanted to close 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.849
 then comes a new coach 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.289
 What did you think and why abnormal zones with the distinctive with the 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:13.779
 Hair dryer is everything discussed 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:16.699
 and now comes the Ilsfelder further from Giggs 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.699
 Percent think advice games I made the wrong decision 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.660
 All communities should be thoughtful in the shops as many 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.660
 but would still miss 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:41.919
 but why did it answer? 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.320
 The King of Pop is really very clear so now want to warn us a bit 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.319
 what to look for 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.090
 hall / berlin the numbers a bit high with the Turkey World Champion 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.550
 and that the most realistic wish 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.659
 If only the organ is a dream it's okay to need it all 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.550
 Naber should please beautiful and rheumatism and the other arid arid 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.919
 only on the Brauhausberg we have no dream or duty nervous 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.830
 after all, HergemÃ¶ller complains all the same because one, if that's the case 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.830
 Phase APA will be there 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.729
 path
