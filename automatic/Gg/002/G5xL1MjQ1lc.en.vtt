00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.460
 we got under that they subtracted a bit more 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.930
 I only summer is supposed to be tipping 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.380
 that's half the half of that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.190
 maximum 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.710
 random access memory

 by Manfred Kutsch 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.880
 the more you have to do a bath at the moment, you just have to make a new one 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.020
 Text documents 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.860
 To do this, he loads the right mouse button that works 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.350

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 Som usually bring text document that's what we call before 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.320
 my 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.780

 so with what ever now collects 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.040
 now 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.990
 go here now measures individuals write look there I write that 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.640

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.540
 gg 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.540
 So now I'm going to work more on complimenting that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.570
 of course the lamb does not mean what the passive one means 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.830
 who works here 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.659
 yes why and then - Dietz index and then 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.610
 thousands 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.660
 Pauses 536 like this 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.630
 you have to enter that 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.380
 there so that we no matter how many rank eleven on 10 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.799
 There is definitely a complicity in my strength when her husband is open 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.700
 Origin ab hardly protects IT girls with my strength 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.290

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.590
 In the so-called Dawson is definitely copied here 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.450
 and this is not a product that can be individual to everyone that would have to be 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 write quotation marks in quotation marks 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.329
 then you have to choose where my strength 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.899
 is stored or the 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.029
 Joder part he gets more the lizards I have here 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.400
 you can look for strength download punk band Left again a 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.939
 Description to find out 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.939
 where exactly that is not on properties 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.959
 Do you want the witch and so on 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.399
 and then the tribute will not 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.939
 tirelessly here 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.899
 that works too 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.599
 But I want to take it like Syria 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.219
 to take in the description 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.219
 yes, as more and more talents are still under 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.009
 Amazon 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.369
 yes I would have just take over if you have saved that in c 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.989
 the general often means things 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.989
 then just take over the cottage Byte Description Park 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:08.159
 Save Herff files 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.279
 under 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.819
 They are windows Geldof 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.199
 all files 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.199
 and write point wat 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:20.799
 just open the door 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.799
 to save 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:27.619
 TomTom Bartsch has been added to her 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.169
 and then you have this file 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.949
 after double-clicking on the file they have now come all one 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:35.939
 window 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.939
 it could take a few seconds 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.669
 and then it's coming soon 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.669
 that my head window 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.099
 if there is no such thing 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.219
 like that here now means that the defense is lame 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.219
 then it can be you 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:06.699
 and if not installed then you have to have both versions both 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.229
 the 32- and 64-bit version of yes-word 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.779
 I have conciliatory 32-bit it is synonymous in Hamburg, the solution of 82 have 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:20.269
 Percy I do not have 64-bit systems but Burki 32-bit version on it 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.870
 only because that works here 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.129
 SuS as proof that goes 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.819
 and that nothing works I write it in the comments I looked after Roma 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.740
 a solution 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.390
 In the city it was computer let out how much the device was too 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.990
 take a long time 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.849
