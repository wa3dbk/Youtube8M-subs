was looking down they got some great

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
was looking down they got some great
genetic<00:00:19.439> markers<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.070> double<00:00:20.520> strikes

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
genetic markers which double strikes

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.420 
genetic markers which double strikes
down<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.359> using<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> belly<00:00:22.350> area<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.949> well<00:00:23.369> as

down the using the belly area as well as
one<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.820> them's<00:00:24.060> got<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.539> site<00:00:25.170> bit<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> ringer

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
one of them's got a site bit of a ringer

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.460 
one of them's got a site bit of a ringer
on<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.269> so<00:00:27.269> let's<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.810> take<00:00:27.960> being<00:00:28.170> greater

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
on it so let's just take being greater

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.960 
on it so let's just take being greater
out<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> take<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> look<00:00:29.400> at<00:00:29.640> these<00:00:29.730> guys<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
out and take a look at these guys and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
out and take a look at these guys and
hopefully<00:00:30.689> next<00:00:30.990> time<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.349> will<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.500> looking

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
hopefully next time we will be looking

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:42.880 
hopefully next time we will be looking
at<00:00:31.800> some<00:00:31.830> actual<00:00:32.130> pie<00:00:32.309> wall<00:00:32.550> section<00:00:41.360> okay

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
at some actual pie wall section okay

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.930 
at some actual pie wall section okay
just<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.980> container<00:00:44.309> when<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.610> eggs<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:44.850> about

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
just a container when my eggs are about

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700 
just a container when my eggs are about
to<00:00:45.030> hatch<00:00:45.149> easy<00:00:45.539> I'll<00:00:45.750> take<00:00:45.930> them<00:00:46.079> out<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
to hatch easy I'll take them out of the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950 
to hatch easy I'll take them out of the
vermiculite<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.700> put<00:00:48.510> them<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> larger

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
vermiculite and put them in a larger

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.650 
vermiculite and put them in a larger
container<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.620> paper<00:00:49.800> towel<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.219> way

markings now you can't always assume
that<00:02:20.400> because<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:22.490> hat<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:23.640> pot<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.000> going

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
that because it's a hat for pot is going

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.580 
that because it's a hat for pot is going
to<00:02:24.210> have<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.510> marker<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.050> lot<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> them<00:02:25.440> do

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
to have that marker a lot of them do

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.150 
to have that marker a lot of them do
some<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.070> them<00:02:26.190> don't<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:27.660> clutch<00:02:28.040> seems<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
some of them don't this clutch seems to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.860 
some of them don't this clutch seems to
definitely<00:02:29.490> be<00:02:29.580> shown<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.420> genetic

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
definitely be shown that that genetic

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.370 
definitely be shown that that genetic
marker<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.210> last<00:02:33.420> guy<00:02:33.660> until<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.230> other

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
marker and the last guy until the other

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
marker and the last guy until the other
guy<00:02:34.500> hatches<00:02:34.920> out<00:02:35.070> like<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.310> witch<00:02:35.640> be<00:02:36.060> probably

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
guy hatches out like a witch be probably

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.590 
guy hatches out like a witch be probably
tonight<00:02:38.570> yeah<00:02:39.570> there<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:41.420> pretty<00:02:42.420> good

tonight yeah there you go pretty good
looking<00:02:42.840> babies<00:02:43.850> hopefully<00:02:44.850> have<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> section

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
looking babies hopefully have a section

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.980 
looking babies hopefully have a section
mint<00:02:46.050> hopefully<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.690> least<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.870> can

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
mint hopefully that the least if I can

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.570 
mint hopefully that the least if I can
get<00:02:49.080> some<00:02:49.140> mods<00:02:49.410> or<00:02:49.650> good<00:02:49.950> eyes<00:02:50.130> they'll<00:02:50.430> be
