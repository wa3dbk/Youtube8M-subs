00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
nine years old and at first I was really

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
but then once I got a little bit older I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.720 
but then once I got a little bit older I
realized<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.050> much<00:00:31.230> more<00:00:31.560> you

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.850 

know<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.090> Angus<00:00:36.390> business<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.620> so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
know the Angus business is just it's so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280 
know the Angus business is just it's so
it's<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.309> special<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.910> don't<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.960> sense

of<00:00:40.410> family<00:00:40.620> anywhere<00:00:41.309> else<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.730> think<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
of family anywhere else I think that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.049

that's what connects you is yeah it's
about<00:00:45.360> cattle<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.110> also<00:00:46.289> about<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
about cattle but it's also about the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.340 
about cattle but it's also about the
people<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> go<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.140> Nationals<00:00:49.140> or

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
people and when you go to Nationals or

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.100

ever since I was little I rode around

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.760 
ever since I was little I rode around
with<00:00:56.850> my<00:00:57.059> dad<00:00:57.270> checking<00:00:57.750> cows<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.289> that's

with my dad checking cows like that's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.770 
with my dad checking cows like that's
how<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.980> learned<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> count<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.910> counting<00:01:00.570> cows

by<00:01:20.520> three<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> could<00:01:21.990> tell<00:01:22.170> from<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
by three and you could tell from the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
by three and you could tell from the
minute<00:01:22.890> she<00:01:22.920> got<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.520> lamb<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
minute she got that lamb the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
minute she got that lamb the
responsibility<00:01:24.780> she<00:01:24.930> took<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.259> seriously<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
responsibility she took it seriously and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.520 
responsibility she took it seriously and
so<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.880> work<00:01:27.060> ethic<00:01:27.270> she<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:28.049> developed

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so that work ethic she really developed

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.649 
so that work ethic she really developed
and<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> responsibility<00:01:30.090> she<00:01:30.360> really

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and the responsibility she really

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.920 
and the responsibility she really
understood<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.930> something

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
understood that I think that something

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.840 
understood that I think that something
agriculture<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.530> offer<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.220> generation<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
agriculture can offer a generation of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.249 
agriculture can offer a generation of
children<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.329> understanding<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> work

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
children is understanding that work

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
children is understanding that work
ethic<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
ethic I think that that's one of the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.569 
ethic I think that that's one of the
reasons<00:01:39.810> why<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.320> am<00:01:40.500> Who<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.040> am<00:01:41.130> today<00:01:41.250> is

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
reasons why I am Who I am today is

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
reasons why I am Who I am today is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
because of my work ethic that was

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
different aspects of the industry are

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.840 
different aspects of the industry are
really<00:03:50.730> key<00:03:51.570> for<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:51.840> generation<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.850> think

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
really key for this generation I think

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.580 
really key for this generation I think
when<00:03:54.360> I'm<00:03:54.480> happiest<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.170> when<00:03:55.320> I'm<00:03:55.440> with<00:03:55.560> my

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
when I'm happiest is when I'm with my

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.070 
when I'm happiest is when I'm with my
family<00:03:56.160> at<00:03:56.280> home<00:03:56.310> just<00:03:56.850> going<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.959> checking

spending quality time with my family at
home<00:04:04.260> now<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.890> I'm<00:04:05.010> off<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.820> college<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.450> I

home now that I'm off in college I I

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.330 
home now that I'm off in college I I
feel<00:04:06.959> like<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.170> took<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.500> for<00:04:07.680> granted<00:04:07.860> for<00:04:08.280> a

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
feel like I took that for granted for a

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.210 
feel like I took that for granted for a
few<00:04:08.580> years<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.060> now<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.450> I'm<00:04:09.810> off<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:11.010> don't

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
few years and now that I'm off and don't

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.100 
few years and now that I'm off and don't
get<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.489> go<00:04:11.610> home<00:04:11.820> very<00:04:12.000> often<00:04:12.239> when<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.780> do<00:04:12.900> get

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
get to go home very often when I do get

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.569 
get to go home very often when I do get
to<00:04:13.230> go<00:04:13.350> home<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.650> try<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:13.950> take<00:04:14.070> advantage<00:04:14.310> of

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
to go home I try and take advantage of

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.589 
to go home I try and take advantage of
that<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.910> in<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.120> suit

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
that is in the suit

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.849 
that is in the suit
I<00:04:16.109> think<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.280> farmer<00:04:17.789> is<00:04:18.709> ultimately<00:04:19.709> a

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
I think the farmer is ultimately a

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.820 
I think the farmer is ultimately a
steward<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.579> land<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:21.150> it's<00:04:21.570> our<00:04:22.139> job<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
steward of the land and it's our job to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.860 
steward of the land and it's our job to
make<00:04:22.949> sure<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.270> cow<00:04:24.539> and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
make sure that that that that cow and

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.749 
make sure that that that that cow and
that<00:04:24.990> process<00:04:25.259> is<00:04:25.620> safe<00:04:25.889> and<00:04:26.220> that<00:04:26.280> it's

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
that process is safe and that it's

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.120 
that process is safe and that it's
efficient<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.389> that<00:04:27.979> we're<00:04:28.979> ultimately

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
efficient and that we're ultimately

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.180 
efficient and that we're ultimately
feeding<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.000> world
