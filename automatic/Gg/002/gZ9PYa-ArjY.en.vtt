00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
little bit a little bit less hot it's

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.050

get it hot enough to melt stainless
steel<00:02:22.190> well<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.459> first<00:02:23.670> thing<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.940> do<00:02:24.000> when

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
steel well the first thing I do when

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.670 
steel well the first thing I do when
getting<00:02:24.660> ready<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.020> cook<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.350> Dutch<00:02:25.380> oven

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
getting ready to cook with a Dutch oven

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.479 
getting ready to cook with a Dutch oven
with<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.700> actually<00:02:26.940> take<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.570> put<00:02:27.989> a

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
with this is actually take and put a

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.340 
with this is actually take and put a
some<00:02:29.489> heavy<00:02:29.640> duty<00:02:29.880> aluminum<00:02:30.300> foil<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
some heavy duty aluminum foil in the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.949 
some heavy duty aluminum foil in the
bottom<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.310> windscreen<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.630> fold<00:02:33.870> it

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
bottom of the windscreen and I fold it

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.479 
bottom of the windscreen and I fold it
in<00:02:34.020> half<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.350> there's<00:02:34.650> probably<00:02:34.800> four<00:02:35.220> layers

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
in half so there's probably four layers

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.360 
in half so there's probably four layers
of<00:02:36.739> aluminum<00:02:37.739> foil<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.100> there<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.280> that

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
of aluminum foil in there and that

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.840 
of aluminum foil in there and that
actually<00:02:38.520> helps<00:02:39.060> kind<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.840> keep<00:02:40.080> your<00:02:40.800> kind<00:02:41.790> of

helps keep your your coals in and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.340 
helps keep your your coals in and
typically<00:02:44.970> I'm<00:02:45.090> cooking<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.480> camp<00:02:46.170> fire

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
coals today I'm just cooking with

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.610 
coals today I'm just cooking with
regular<00:02:48.330> charcoal<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:48.959> normally<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.380> would

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
regular charcoal but normally I would

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.040 
regular charcoal but normally I would

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
helps keep it cold in so if you have to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.760 
helps keep it cold in so if you have to
actually<00:02:53.970> move<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.239> windscreen<00:02:54.900> around<00:02:55.230> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
one thing that I've noticed that if if

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.100 
one thing that I've noticed that if if
you're<00:03:10.380> using<00:03:10.640> coals<00:03:11.640> even<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.570> short<00:03:12.959> regular

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
you're using coals even in short regular

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.860 
you're using coals even in short regular
charcoal<00:03:13.709> or<00:03:13.950> you're<00:03:14.100> using<00:03:14.220> camp<00:03:14.550> fire<00:03:14.730> coals

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
charcoal or you're using camp fire coals

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.060 
charcoal or you're using camp fire coals
depending<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.110> wood<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.620> use<00:03:16.830> you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
depending on the wood that you use you

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.650 
depending on the wood that you use you
can<00:03:17.220> end<00:03:17.400> up<00:03:17.550> with<00:03:17.700> kind<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.090> resin<00:03:18.510> that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
can end up with kind of a resin that

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.990 
can end up with kind of a resin that
ends<00:03:18.930> up<00:03:19.050> by<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> bottom<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.550> ends<00:03:20.790> up<00:03:20.850> in

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
ends up by in the bottom it ends up in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.620 
ends up by in the bottom it ends up in
the<00:03:21.090> bottom<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:24.150> takes<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.450> lot<00:03:24.600> to

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
the bottom of this so it takes a lot to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.270 
the bottom of this so it takes a lot to
get<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.959> scrubbed<00:03:25.290> out<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.709> if<00:03:25.950> you're<00:03:26.100> using

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
get it scrubbed out and if you're using

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.860 
get it scrubbed out and if you're using
it<00:03:26.519> while<00:03:26.970> you're<00:03:27.239> out<00:03:27.359> for<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.570> few<00:03:27.690> days

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
it while you're out for a few days

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.270 
it while you're out for a few days
you're<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:28.230> using<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:28.890> kind<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:29.160> take

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
you're so using it can I kind of take

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.230 
you're so using it can I kind of take
you<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.459> make<00:03:29.609> your<00:03:29.760> food<00:03:29.880> taste

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
you to make your food taste

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.420 
you to make your food taste
a little<00:03:30.450> bit<00:03:30.570> funky<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.170> what<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:31.950> do<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.190> solve

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
a little bit funky so what I do to solve

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.120 
a little bit funky so what I do to solve
that<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.600> take<00:03:33.750> another<00:03:34.020> piece<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.440> aluminum

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
that is I take another piece of aluminum

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.860 
that is I take another piece of aluminum
foil<00:03:35.370> they<00:03:35.790> just<00:03:36.000> make<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> small<00:03:36.480> little<00:03:36.720> bowl

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
foil they just make a small little bowl

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.310 
foil they just make a small little bowl
with<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.290> put<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.100> there<00:03:38.280> okay<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:40.200> now

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
d-ring and the stick makes it a whole

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.610 
d-ring and the stick makes it a whole
lot<00:03:58.410> easier<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:59.340> move<00:03:59.970> stuff<00:04:00.180> around<00:04:00.300> in<00:04:00.750> I'm

actually turn and it's a little bit
difficult<00:05:15.780> with<00:05:16.110> this<00:05:16.380> because<00:05:16.860> of<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:18.000> way

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
wish we had smell-o-vision because it

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.600

take care of the hot spots is actually
kind<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:28.980> go<00:05:29.100> through<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.720> just<00:05:30.720> adjust<00:05:31.050> that

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
kind of go through and just adjust that

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.010 
kind of go through and just adjust that
way<00:05:31.640> and<00:05:32.640> if<00:05:32.790> you're<00:05:32.940> using<00:05:33.150> camp<00:05:33.810> fire<00:05:33.990> coals

that<00:05:39.780> too<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.229> that<00:05:40.710> helps<00:05:41.280> keep<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.520> hot

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610
