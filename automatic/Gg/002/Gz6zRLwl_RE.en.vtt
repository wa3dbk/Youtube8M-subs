 equipped with sim hand 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.079

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.969

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.559
 law or market available 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.359

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.600

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.609
 assured that it still has a duration 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.479
 very high thanks to some details 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:57.550
 technologies that have been used 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:02.440
 the technical characteristics are the same 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.829

 in short, the features are i 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.229
 same in s6 and there is therefore it is useless 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.780
 to reiterate it but I must say that the 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.820
 build quality now really 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 as they also said last night premium 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.100

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.399
 high is really very light we talk 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.850

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.740
 speech 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.720
 all type of aluminum and glass must 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.159
 to say that they are not absolutely many 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.920
 we have a bit like we can here too 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.619

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.300
 fox and anything else to say is a 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.160
 I had taken a big step forward 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.280
 finally they even bet 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.740
 to aesthetics and above all to materials 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.330
 yes it is true there could be some 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.979
 similarities however in fact also 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.620
 donating last night with friends 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.050
 Competitor company was told that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.570
 now it is difficult to invent something 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.770
 in short, we say new to him here 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.470
 they had to fix it for a moment let's say to the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.750
 plastic king of the s5 and I must say that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.010
 they did it in an excellent way 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.120
 then maybe in the next few days we'll see 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.940

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.530
 photo believes to get the colors because 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.620
