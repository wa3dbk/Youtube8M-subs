00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.799

 it gets more fluid and our garlic 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.690
 Do not be surprised how many 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 garlic cloves have this kobalia 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.460
 garlic is the manager 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:21.909
 Now we know the clove of garlic 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:25.879
 disturbed the potatoes are to be inserted 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:28.730
 rhythmic the wise is the mix 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:33.049
 Patience and we will get the emotion 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.940
 a combination of olive oil and vinegar 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.599
 olive oil vinegar and then it comes to it 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:51.430
 to give consistent 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:55.840
 These ground almonds as you notice 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.190
 vinegar makes the whole thing liquid 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.190
 amused and creamy again 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:19.410

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.410
 set crowing even more restrained now exactly 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.500
 what we want us cordelia is like that 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.050
 I typically get that and it works 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.560
 as an appetizer small butcher 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.980

 then we have it ready 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.720
 then we want to test a bit if 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:20.130
 Adding a little salt is considered 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.660
 decoration pines very well in color 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.660
