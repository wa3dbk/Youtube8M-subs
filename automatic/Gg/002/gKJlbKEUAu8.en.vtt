00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
dat so the big question over there may

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.740 
dat so the big question over there may
be<00:02:55.629> changes<00:02:56.169> but<00:02:56.379> here<00:02:56.680> we<00:02:56.829> are<00:02:56.859> Daniel<00:02:57.750> Kieran

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
this kind of thing but after that the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.520 
this kind of thing but after that the
vibe<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.389> team<00:03:52.599> is<00:03:52.870> interesting<00:03:53.439> but

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
vibe of the team is interesting but

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.679 
vibe of the team is interesting but

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
almost pushes things a little too for

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.080 
almost pushes things a little too for
the<00:03:55.870> team<00:03:56.109> may<00:03:56.409> not<00:03:56.620> be<00:03:56.769> totally<00:03:56.949> happy<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.939> be

the team may not be totally happy to be
together<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.720> that's<00:03:58.930> great<00:03:59.229> for<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.530> little

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
together and that's great for a little

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.460 
together and that's great for a little
touch<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.459> realism<00:04:00.849> no<00:04:01.419> team<00:04:01.659> or<00:04:01.840> group<00:04:01.900> should

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
