00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.670
 hello my dear subscribers today 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.460
 We will consider the map of the lower steppe cut 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.310
 I remind you that this is the best place in the hospital 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.830
 Now we will consider as always one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.669
 sweet spot here on this map 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:38.370
 if you are a heavy tank like this i am now 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:39.600
 you need to go exactly here and here 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.899
 how are these tanks 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.539
 they already backed up the account further we 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:52.579
 we will not go unsuccessful 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.760
 the exit got as semi as it should 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.219
 But even when these tanks did not reach 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.489
 up to this place and being able between the tanks 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.489
 rival 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.220
 beautiful worth even if they come here yet 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.929
 did not have time to drive anyway further 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.090
 you should not go because there is a square 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.530
 eg 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.619
 but for the sake of h1 square there still arrives 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.869
 tanks but it's best to get there 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.600
 one or two tank all the rest should 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.200
 stand here something this bump after all 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.979
 covers from artillery in general from damage 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.119
 here you can only aim there 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.329
 I pull out my corner abdullah 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.600
 shooting well the whole I've been left alone and 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:51.590
 need to take advantage of terrain 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:57.469
 These classes here have the same gun 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:02.619
 like me they are very easy for me 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:07.269
 punch I drove on from i ran the stat 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:12.709
 I'll tell you honestly, the tank is playable 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:16.549
 ok but he he doesn't drag he can 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.819
 fill the bulk of the damage here but 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:24.290
 drag it did not specify that the light 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:27.680
 I mean ambassador drags drags like t29 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.329
 But if you climbed on t29 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.299
 inee you will understand that from not drag then 29 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:39.430
 drags left alone against five 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.740
 enemies well from will get practically 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.320
 every time t-22 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:51.820
 maybe only tank towers here 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:55.480
 Well, it's not about tanks but this 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:00.160
 beautiful place here where you can like this 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.850
 here use the terrain if 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.620
 strongly presses here in principle almost 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.360
 I stood alone graham 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.540
 terrain 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:19.180
 I managed to survive well then of course 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.460
 thank you allies place this 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.910
 really good you already 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.670
 the main thing said here they go no further 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.450
 worth it anyway here and here i am 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.050
 brought the enemy already three enemies I want to fill 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.550
 more 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.350
 and here I think that su-100 is this place 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.070
 can not shoot through the tubercle 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.900
 wanna go down but warri 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.590
 here it turns out he is very good here 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.250
 shooting through I was still in the light 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:58.410
 leg so that's such a sadness of course 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.380
 I was upset very well, nothing terrible 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.080
 he also had to fill two 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.860
 fraga was I would be the third we have 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.870
