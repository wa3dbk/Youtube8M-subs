 90s to go assist 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 strong to base the qatari situations 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 which are complex concerning them 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 had parties in batches between 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.620
 that we manage to save ourselves by taking 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.080
 charge of the situation when must have 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.180
 really water that defines by the mud 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.830
 she has to lie on a defined day 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.739
 the team is setting up 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.489
 has different components what a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.570
 shutter to start with operations 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.260
 the actual combo to be 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.770
 planning to know what is this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 we will do 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.650
 logistics or for whom surrounds all 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.900
 the teams of combos and more oxo must 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.420
 also look at the mediocre water 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.489
 are around the two wheels quebec which 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.320
 happens the account of the situations of life 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.150
 civil security complexes that adds 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.220
 so staff when they are 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.220
 infected dynamo seven years 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.630
 a narrative so-called system of 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.550
 command of the intervention it's a 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.440
 system that is standardized there is a 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.020
 level or at canadian leads america and 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.850
 even outside america 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.740
 it's a common way of working 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.190
 on emergency situations only 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.590
 on the facts different from the normans 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.420
 that happens to tornadoes in the material 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.770
 without any adaptation system that all the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.410
 world can adapt everyone can 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.400
 to enter the in an organization in 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.620
 knowing of advanced 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.540
 what do we swallow in the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.509
 planning for a forest fire the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.100
 planning for earthquake 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.790
 floods it remains that it's from the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.790
 planning 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.610
 the exchanges will be much more 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.130
 easy to do between bases in the province 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.440
 and even between states have had to the fact 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.850
 that every job must be well known 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.620
 every job must be well known to 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.110
 speakers so got into nick etc 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.750

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.930
 daily are never alike and 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.440
 yet something different 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.340
 the challenges are as much a surprise of a 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.370
 situation will therefore have to intervene 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.570
 on a fire was never the same 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.920
 we are going to do so we have all the time 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.030
 tried to innovate our ways of doing things 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.130
 to be able to fulfill the mandate 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.050
 on which we are 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.120

 outside to be on the lookout for 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.470
 last methods used these teams 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.510
