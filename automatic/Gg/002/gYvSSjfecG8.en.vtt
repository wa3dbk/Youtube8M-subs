00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
library we're gonna start just by

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.430 
library we're gonna start just by
loading<00:00:22.950> a<00:00:23.160> figure<00:00:23.520> into<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.940> scene<00:00:24.350> when<00:00:25.350> you

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
loading a figure into the scene when you

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.210 
loading a figure into the scene when you
open<00:00:25.770> poser<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.730> normally<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.420> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the scene while we're looking at the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
the scene while we're looking at the
library<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.500> take<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> look<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
library let's take a look at some of the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.660 
library let's take a look at some of the
new<00:01:14.700> features<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.540> library<00:01:16.400> first<00:01:17.400> I'm

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
new features in the library first I'm

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.929 
new features in the library first I'm
gonna<00:01:17.820> drag<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> library<00:01:18.749> out<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.670> undock<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
gonna drag the library out and undock it

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.580 
gonna drag the library out and undock it
so<00:01:21.149> that<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.539> expand<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.109> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.259> bit

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
so that we can expand it a little bit

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.660 
so that we can expand it a little bit
here<00:01:23.749> if<00:01:24.749> this<00:01:25.649> layout<00:01:26.039> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.219> library

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
here if this layout of the library

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.149 
here if this layout of the library
doesn't<00:01:26.850> suit<00:01:27.179> your<00:01:27.359> needs<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.229> okay<00:01:28.649> you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
doesn't suit your needs that's okay you

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
doesn't suit your needs that's okay you
have<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.609> choices<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.450> how<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
have a lot of choices as to how the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.709 
have a lot of choices as to how the
library<00:01:31.319> is<00:01:31.469> configured<00:01:32.390> click<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> little

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
library is configured click the little

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.719 
library is configured click the little
handle<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.319> the<00:01:34.409> bottom<00:01:34.649> of<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> library<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
handle at the bottom of the library and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.179 
handle at the bottom of the library and
you'll<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.539> there<00:01:36.719> are<00:01:36.749> a<00:01:36.899> lot<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> options

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you'll see there are a lot of options

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.020 
you'll see there are a lot of options
for<00:01:38.280> how<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> library<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.450> displayed<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
for how the library can be displayed the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.539 
for how the library can be displayed the
way<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.139> library<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.369> have

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
way that I like the library is to have

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.349 
way that I like the library is to have
the<00:01:44.759> list<00:01:44.999> panel<00:01:45.329> display<00:01:45.960> beside<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.619> tree
