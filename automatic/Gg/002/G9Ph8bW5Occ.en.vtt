00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.390
 here we are on the beach actually nai beach 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.650
 harn has long been non-tourist 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.830
 but now he is getting more 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.380
 popular including among 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 Russian tourists our guys here in 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.700
 difference from the previous two beach already 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.320
 you can calmly swim here 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.140
 nice and very sandy white and soft 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.659
 sand and the bottom of the sea, too, in principle 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.390
 shortbread is why the beach is not suitable 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.340
 for snorkeling but out of season here 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.280
 quite strong waves so here 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.939
 you can even slightly sunbathe and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.310
 here lives a huge amount of them exactly 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.420
 I do not remember the prices like 100 baht per lie 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.450
 what basically can come here 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.079
 relax just kind of cool 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.789
 on the sea 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.880
 beautiful islands are here too

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.150
 very cool for just 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.290
 for a photo let's say behind me like 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.540
 times if the view is a windmill 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.820
 is she sleeping just on the cape which 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.790
 called promteh one of the most southerly 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.190
 points of the island in principle it is such a very 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.920
 quiet place fits don't know for 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.860
 such a relaxing stay around here 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.860
 mountains and palms I will show you right now 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.200
 Now the sea ​​is calm I am right now 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.750
 the end is the very end of January in the courtyard and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.270
 you absolutely have no waves to confuse and how 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.280
 time is a separate complexes 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.850
 I represent which one of them 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.620
 probably opens very cool but also 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.290
 mountains mountains we can practically say 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.900
 in the Urals only 140 on these mountains 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.810
 grow over it at the entrance to the water here 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.570
 calm then there are no corals 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.700
 there is no such thing at the bottom white soft 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.450
 the sand here now I do not even fall 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.840
 sand on his feet and he is so nice and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.849
 here already, by the way, even with bikes, everything 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.610
 fenced too principle for swimming 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.010
 children fit wonderful beach not 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.019
 the same long so get one 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.920
 side of the hotel, I stand and here there is just 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.840
 already starting tired and there too me 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.989
 it seems for being so quiet there 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.610
 and fewer tourists for here in principle not 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.160
 so many tourists that is for the season 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.560
 there is almost empty if we want to compare 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.590
 some kind of baron or patong here 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.239
 just silence no one at all and the most 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.569
 which is nice and there is no 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.620
 entertainment wadi on water bikes and 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.840
 so nothing for swimming 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.940
 interferes not interfere you can calmly 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.940
 come kids and swim 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.950
 north of the beach nai harn where 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.930
 is just rocks right here 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.780
 such a canal with fresh water flows in 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.000
 straight to the sea and according to the temperature he should 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.710
 be my cool looking for an excuse 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.150
 did not climb it yes that's so clever when 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.310
 fresh water combines with salty and 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.530
 feast in this channel ok children frolic 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.540
 or swims and adults and to 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.470
 go to the side in time for the rocks where 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.560
 we will go now 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.430
 just need to go through this water 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.430
 through the canal 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.590
 we got to the part where 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.569
 just rocks, I basically alien to them 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.659
 they are sharp enough but for 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:38.690
 photo shoots are just perfect 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:42.250
 here in this part is just very very 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.879
 few people and she is so wilder 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:49.729
 I think it's perfect to spend time here 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.979
 in peace and quiet that is can be removed 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.680

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.629
