00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.420
Let's go huh?

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.260
Hello Internet! I'm the Slow Mo Boy, aka Experimentboy! [THIS IS A PARODY]

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.640
And today, we're gonna play a little with water balloons.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.380
But not just 1 balloon...

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.480
2 water balloons, yeah!

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.480
But these are way too lame.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.040
Instead, we'll use...

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.740
...some real guys' water balloons.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.020
This!

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.620
So we found some really big balloons, and we're gonna play around a bit.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.180
Bordel de merde.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.340
Here we go.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.700
Ok, time for serious stuff, I will take this tarp,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.960
and lay it down right here on the jardin,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960
then we'll inflate the balloons...

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.720
...with two water hoses, that will fill them up.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.380
With water.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.620
It's as simple as that, actually.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.500
VoilÃ .

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.800
And of course, all of this will be filmed in slow-motion,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.600
at four thou... 480 frames per second.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
Sorry, we don't have a Phantom camera.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.620
And because this is The Slow Mo Boy, I will shove my feet in the balloons

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.620
and then inflate them with water.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.400
That's totally useless, but it's gonna be fun.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.820
Ok, so I remove my safety shoes...

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.600
Bring on the two hoses to the balloons...

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.120
We can go now.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.900
We're ready folks, I think we can go now, I've got cameras everywhere.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.600
And the most important...

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.980
The lubricant.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.980
And once you're all lubed...

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.255
We're ready for some Science!

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.700
Ok, I'm ready now..!

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.440
Maintenant, on attend.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.820
Right now, I feel like I'm wearing size 30 shoes!

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360
Aaah, we've got a nice ham there.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.000
Oh crap, a vision from hell!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Guys, check that out!

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.300
I think I'll cut it here and get out of the balloons,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300
and let them inflate on their own.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.340
Ok I got it!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.900
Guys, we've got a huge bleeding here!

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.079
Give me that!

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.360
[Cue the freshness moment...]

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.740
Is it good?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.400
Wow, damn!

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.520
[BONES CRACKING]

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.460
Well friends, our balloons have a pretty good size now

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.460
so now we'll get some fireworks, stick one in-between, and light it up.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.200
And everything should blow up.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.860
Otherwise, that wouldn't be Experimentboy, dammit! Here we go !

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.860
Safety is off..!

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.880
Fireworks on water balloons!

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.620
In 3...

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.425
2...

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:12.925
1...

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.400
Trigger!

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.480
Well, that was a clear success so we'll keep going with the second balloon,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.520
and this time...

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.680
We'll triple the charge.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.320
Thank you all for watching,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.320
don't forget to follow us on Twitter!

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.360
And see you next time, for Science!

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.660
God dammit...
