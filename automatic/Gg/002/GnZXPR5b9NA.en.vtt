00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.029
 welcome on strawberry i would also like 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.620
 show how you can enter the mode 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:14.370
 selfdiagnosis on ford explorer 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.260
 2008 in this case so the Europeans 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.529
 not European Americans on not so the essence 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.060
 it is important to show the keys we stuck 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.609
 clamp two buttons set squat 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.340
 at the same time you need to turn further 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.800
 Ignition position well, either start 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.800
 car hands are missing so sorry 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.680
 we start the car 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.110
 five 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.110
 here is an urine test engineer we jump out 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.510
 they are very good can see an hour to try 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.510
 focus here 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.649
 on it we divide the dessert with a button 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.649
 click and run through the menu items 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.530
 arrow test 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.520
 it is so you him little screen 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.010
 all garlands 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.010
 egorov 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.740
 north of them 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.860
 then we can see 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.600
 check on the validity of the software 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.220
 according to his version of the game you can 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.570
 watch this 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.930
 dad compare true check 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.100
 so release be but it is most likely for before 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.030
 software release 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.030
 And this is the date of production, I like the wine 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.770
 pierced the devil for a long time and learn February 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.840
 2008 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.350
 so this is an abracadabra to me completely 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.350
 unclear 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.630
 speed we stand 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.630
 mentor 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.890
 so the rest of the fuel 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.440
 vs 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.670
 it is incomprehensible to him something important 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.640
 so your let-ka almost made it up 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.620
 on the counter which we will teach 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.159
 request 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.159
 voltage 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.020
 of all 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.410
 specialists may be interested 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.090
 tell me what it means 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.090
 it is well and here we go in a circle 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.510
 this learn thousands 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.800
 did not see something where is the screen here or 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.150
 menu item 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.140
 for error codes error 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.140
 probably not 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.049
 you can steam for everything
