happening in twenty eighteen or twenty
nineteen<00:01:13.869> eleven<00:01:14.020> changes<00:01:14.500> for<00:01:14.679> a<00:01:14.710> second<00:01:15.159> Oh

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
nineteen eleven changes for a second Oh

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.139 
nineteen eleven changes for a second Oh
2019<00:01:17.799> it's<00:01:18.219> gonna<00:01:18.490> be<00:01:18.729> 20<00:01:19.090> 19<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.530> uh<00:01:20.829> it's<00:01:21.549> it

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149

2019 it's gonna be 20 19 so uh it's it
just<00:01:22.450> makes<00:01:22.719> my<00:01:22.990> theory<00:01:23.530> even<00:01:24.429> war<00:01:24.880> it's<00:01:25.240> going

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
just makes my theory even war it's going

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.870 
just makes my theory even war it's going

to happen in a profile and fifth of

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:37.139 
to happen in a profile and fifth of
april<00:01:28.570> fifth<00:01:30.210> 2019<00:01:32.460> okay<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:35.729> 2019<00:01:36.729> it's<00:01:37.090> a
