 hello that such friends welcome to this 

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.160
 video tutorial of how to download and 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.820
 install tree 10 max on any of 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.910
 his last three versions 2014 2015 or 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.550
 2016 my name is germÃ¡n vidal and we give 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.499
 start to this tutorial before starting 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.539
 with the installation we must verify the 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.909
 processor architecture of our 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.710
 computer in windows 8 we do what 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.989
 next we go to the part of 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.060
 configuration and we click on the part 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.979
 it says pc information here 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.260
 we verify where it says type of 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:35.410
 system that is an operating system of 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.210
 64 bits in windows 7 we are going to start 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.760
 and we right click where it says 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.710
 team and we select properties are 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.960
 will open the same window that we saw in 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.450
 windows 8 and again verify that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.040
 be a 64-bit operating system 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.500
 unfortunately in the new versions 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.000
 of 310 max are no longer available for 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.040
 the operating systems with a 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.110
 32-bit architecture once 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.360
 verified the type of architecture of 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.010
 our computer's processor we 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.020
 we go to the link that I left in the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.539
 description of this video will open us the 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.159
 3ds max download page with one 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.840
 Student version 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.119
 start let's create an account 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.259
 we fill in the boxes each of the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.259
 data that you request 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.859
 we write our name and our 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.859
 Surname 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.380
 We are also going to create our name 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380
 user 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.670
 we enter our email address 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.330
 electronic twice and our 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.470
 password again twice 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.840
 finally we select the three 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.840
 last boxes and we click on next 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 we will get a message that our 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.850
 account has not yet been activated for 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.159
 activate it we have to open our 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.030
 email and verify the mail 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.430
 that autodesk has sent us 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.750
 we open the mail and click on the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.750
 confirmation link 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.230
 we will get a message that our 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.739
 account has been activated we click on no 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.910
 thank you and we close the dialog box 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.310
 we closed the tab that we already had 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.400
 open and we can start with the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.349
 first step we click on enter e 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.569
 we enter our email 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.069
 and the password that we previously made 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.080
 now we select the version of 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.610
 max trailers that we're going to download myself 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.069
 I recommend the most recent is the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.780
 2016 later we select the 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.879
 language that would be English since there is no 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.709
 Spanish and finally we selected the 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.290
 operating system architecture that 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.480
 as you can see it's only 64 bits we 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.430
 a check popcorn will appear 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.980
 Now all that remains is to click on the button 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.810
 install now we accept the terms and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.299
 we click on install open the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.530
 file that was just downloaded or else 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.530
 we click on execute 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.280
 we wait for it to finish downloading 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.280
 install the assistant 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.070
 we click on install 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.890
 if we click on the tab we can 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.110
 verify all the components that are 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.660
 they will install by default they all come 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.010
 we selected the well and give 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.230
 click on install 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.629
 now we have to wait for it to finish 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.370
 download and install the software by 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.680
 it usually takes more or less two hours 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.909
 if you tell them that 7 hours do not worry 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.909
 it does not really take that long 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.250
 Once the process is concluded we click 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.570
 in finalizing now it will indicate to us that there is 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.640
 have to restart the computer to be able to 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.160
 verify the changes we are going to 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.320
 click on not as we can see it is already 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.320
 tree icon on the desktop 10 max 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.480
 now I'm going to restart the computer 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.390
 come back in a moment 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.780
 Now come back we double click on the icon 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.780
 of tree 10 max and we wait for it to open 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.780
 we accept 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.639
 if the following table does not appear 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.129
 click on yes 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.039
 We wait a moment and click on 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:25.590
 activate if the following table appears 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.590
 we click on next if we not only wait 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.520
 to activate once activated we give 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.520
 click on final 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.389
 we wait a moment and select the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.389
 classic theme and we click continue 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.909
 we click on ok 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.100
 We waited some more until 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.310
 finally the program opens this is 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.770
 the welcome window 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.770
 we close in the upper right corner 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.160
 finally we click on the edge of the 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.260
 next frame and we drag it towards 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.180
 the center in order to be able to close it 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.580
 we have all our space ready to 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.660
 start working now let's create 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.660
 a test box 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.490
 with the previous test we can verify 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.490
 that the software works 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.339
 well for me this has been all in 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.379
 this video tutorial waiting for them 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.669
 has been very useful and help them 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.800
 Any doubt or suggestion 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.719
 any problem they have at the time 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.119
 of software installation please 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:53.800
 directly here in comments I am 

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:53.800
