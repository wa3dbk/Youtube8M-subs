00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello everyone with you freaks i think all of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.730
 we got into this situation we 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.940
 somewhere we run away kill us and we 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 Immediately run on the search for my belongings I 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.380
 decided to make a mechanism to help what 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.449
 run away not completely naked because 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 it happens that we run 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.200
 Things kill us too I did the mechanics 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.030
 more precisely two of its varieties 1 more 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.829
 costly but faster and more convenient 2 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 same 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.620
 less costly but mono first 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.810
 disposable that is after every time 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.930
 we have to do it 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:58.500
 two times she no longer reliably cannot 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.500
 not enough this reliable cynicism and he 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.380
 he 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.450
 pain will make a dream and faster 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.610
 well and as i said stranger so 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.050
 watch me in the hands there is nothing 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.360
 Imagine that all these 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.340
 comparators with Petrov and so on too 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.890
 there is nothing 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.460
 I 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.229
 so i'm running into even a button 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.229
 and I look in diamond armor 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.330
 now i'm drawing 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.960
 to 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.960
 well , the sword is in my hands 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.780
 me this simpler brains mechanism 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.450
 we run and here we are all the same only 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.659
 without sword 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 and it works as heard 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.770
 a little longer 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.170
 so choose from them you choose 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.549
 now he is a circle of hell menstruation 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.549
 they are built very simply 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.189
 it's like an arch for beauty here go on 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.350
 2 hands 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.540
 who distributes chapter 2 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.380
 in the distribution for example we throw the bottom 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.180
 in this we throw our world 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.290
 here on our 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.640
 and court timber 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.800
 but 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.180
 here by the knife this boots were on no matter 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.790
 from there constantly waiting for the rubik 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.790
 put a block here and a button on it 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.390
 and it's very simple 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.700
 like this we carry out the blocks himself sudari peter 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.700
 here and here like that once again for dust 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.350
 so takes our 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.590
 diamond armor 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.590
 as 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.420
 the roof can be closed 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.020
 all click on the button 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.400
 all honor and implicit success 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.900
 the second mechanism is built more simply 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.989
 skill fear it already said 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.989
 not 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.159
 in short, he's just 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.350
 it is scheduled 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.170
 more advantages of such me not you 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.840
 it's just a little bit here we put distribution 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.710
 By the way, in the new version of minecraft, I forgot 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.250
 say that you can put the sensors in time 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.270
 upright he so here so chick 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.130
 example and so on and they can immediately 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.130
 put the armor on 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.830
 may apply all sorts of bone meal gone 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.970
 grown on and so forth 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.040
 so 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.780
 here we put the dangerous 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.350
 then put here 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.290
 dirty block a piece of 1 ton they are this 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.580
 reef just not 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.770
 so the court set comporator 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.770
 listen button 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.970
 and court 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.270
 our 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.270
 things 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.600
 armor 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.370
 everything 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.880
 armor on the spot 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.490
 The fact is that 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.880
 at distributor comparator renders four 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:29.590
 shots shorter distribution will go away 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.590
 from him sent a comparator 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.960
 what will eat why is it 1 because 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.960
 what if for example we fix it 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.120
 what else 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.890
 buy right here and ticks an example 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.610
 So 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.750
 I have to repeat which is profitable here first 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.400
 four hours 2 4 thing 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.400
 and i am dressed 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.950
 then I have 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.050
 padded 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.050
 4 at random and what have I dropped 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.260
 second pants 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.969
 but she did not fall boots 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.459
 that's why they 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.879
 it is awkward here we can 

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:23.900
 put in a boot there up pants and movies 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.110
 there 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.740
 his 2 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.740
 she works for us 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.230
 dollars 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.700
 I think you understand the meaning of what to choose and 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.220
 called you outfitter choose you 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.260
 if you like the equipment put 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.520
 likes subscribe to my channel with you 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.520
 have been freaks yet
