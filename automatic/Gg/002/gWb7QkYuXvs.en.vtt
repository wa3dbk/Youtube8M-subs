00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hello YouTube so today I'm going to be

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.820 
hello YouTube so today I'm going to be
doing<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.730> tutorial<00:00:02.939> ish<00:00:03.570> about<00:00:04.380> how<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.589> solve

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
doing a tutorial ish about how to solve

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.870 
doing a tutorial ish about how to solve
the<00:00:04.980> infamous<00:00:06.049> 12-sided<00:00:07.049> megaminx<00:00:07.710> cube<00:00:08.220> well

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
the infamous 12-sided megaminx cube well

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.140 
the infamous 12-sided megaminx cube well
it's<00:00:09.059> not<00:00:09.150> really<00:00:09.330> cube<00:00:09.690> but<00:00:10.230> whatever<00:00:10.580> so<00:00:11.580> I'm

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
it's not really cube but whatever so I'm

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.220 
it's not really cube but whatever so I'm
gonna<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.599> teaching<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:14.630> balance<00:00:15.630> method

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
gonna be teaching you the balance method

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.439 
gonna be teaching you the balance method
I'm<00:00:17.100> not<00:00:17.340> sure<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.640> has<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> real<00:00:18.000> name<00:00:18.150> but

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
I'm not sure if it has a real name but

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.109 
I'm not sure if it has a real name but
anyways<00:00:19.250> I'm<00:00:20.250> pretty<00:00:20.640> sure<00:00:20.789> that's<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.060> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
anyways I'm pretty sure that's what I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.769 
anyways I'm pretty sure that's what I
used<00:00:21.390> uh<00:00:22.340> it<00:00:23.510> seems<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:24.960> he<00:00:25.109> uses<00:00:26.779> um

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
used uh it seems to be what he uses um

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.669 
used uh it seems to be what he uses um
yeah<00:00:28.609> to<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.510> able<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> follow<00:00:31.410> this

yeah to know to be able to follow this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
yeah to know to be able to follow this
tutorial<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.399> must<00:00:32.520> learn<00:00:33.059> well<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.110> must

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
tutorial you must learn well you must

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.400 
tutorial you must learn well you must
know<00:00:34.850> intuitive<00:00:35.850> f2l<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.630> how<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> solve<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
know intuitive f2l so how to solve the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
know intuitive f2l so how to solve the
first<00:00:37.620> two<00:00:37.829> layers<00:00:38.059> with<00:00:39.059> Crofts<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> then

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
first two layers with Crofts and then

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.959 
first two layers with Crofts and then
the<00:00:40.110> each<00:00:40.350> pairs<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.920> stuff<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> don't

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the each pairs and stuff if you don't

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.880 
the each pairs and stuff if you don't
know<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.050> still<00:00:43.230> use<00:00:43.440> layer<00:00:43.710> by

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
know that and you still use layer by

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.190 
know that and you still use layer by
layer<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:44.250> something<00:00:44.539> then<00:00:45.539> you'd<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
layer or something then you'd have to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.950 
layer or something then you'd have to
either<00:00:46.710> learn<00:00:47.250> into<00:00:47.969> two<00:00:48.120> feft<00:00:48.329> well<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:50.570> if<00:00:51.570> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
either learn into two feft well or if I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.270 
either learn into two feft well or if I
get<00:00:52.020> enough<00:00:52.320> requests<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.770> might<00:00:52.949> make<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> video

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
get enough requests I might make a video

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.470 
get enough requests I might make a video
about<00:00:53.520> how<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:54.050> megaminx<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:56.420> um<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
about how to do megaminx with um you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
about how to do megaminx with um you
know<00:00:57.840> layer<00:00:58.649> by<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> hairstyle<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.260> recommend

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
know layer by a hairstyle so I recommend

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.490 
know layer by a hairstyle so I recommend
learning<00:01:02.280> megaminx<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:03.600> only<00:01:03.870> because<00:01:04.140> it's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
learning megaminx not only because it's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.730 
learning megaminx not only because it's
a<00:01:04.589> fun<00:01:04.769> puzzle<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.549> also<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.500> since<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a fun puzzle but also because since the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.109 
a fun puzzle but also because since the
megaminx<00:01:08.100> has<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.909> many<00:01:09.090> pieces<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.659> stuff<00:01:09.900> um

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
megaminx has so many pieces and stuff um

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
megaminx has so many pieces and stuff um
do<00:01:12.119> megaminx<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.320> help<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.680> eft

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
do megaminx can actually help your eft

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.270 
do megaminx can actually help your eft
well<00:01:14.159> look<00:01:14.400> ahead<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.909> 3x3<00:01:15.950> because<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> really

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
well look ahead on 3x3 because it really

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
well look ahead on 3x3 because it really
trains<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> look<00:01:18.000> ahead<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.509> there's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
trains you to look ahead because there's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.490 
trains you to look ahead because there's
so<00:01:18.810> many<00:01:18.900> pieces<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:21.110> there<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> few

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
so many pieces so there are a few

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.480 
so many pieces so there are a few
distinct<00:01:23.130> steps<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.659> method<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.400> I'm

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
distinct steps in this method so I'm

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
distinct steps in this method so I'm
going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.790> doing<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.500> three

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
going to be doing about I think three

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
going to be doing about I think three
parts<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.360> first<00:01:30.600> part<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> be

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
parts so the first part is going to be

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.310 
parts so the first part is going to be
for<00:01:31.829> f2l<00:01:32.570> because<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> first<00:01:33.990> step<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
for f2l because that's the first step of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.819 
for f2l because that's the first step of
the<00:01:34.380> method

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the method

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.450 
the method
well<00:01:35.549> cross<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.720> F's<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
well cross and F's well and then the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.660 
well cross and F's well and then the
next<00:01:38.700> video<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.479> about<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.670> next

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
next video is going to be about the next

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.359 
next video is going to be about the next
layers<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.750> how<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.189> method

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
layers so how we do that in this method

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.190 
layers so how we do that in this method
is<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:45.479> create<00:01:45.869> block<00:01:46.470> things<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.810> here<00:01:48.810> here

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
is we create block things here here here

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.219 
is we create block things here here here
here<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.479> fill<00:01:52.110> in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
here like this and then we just fill in

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.609 
here like this and then we just fill in
the<00:01:52.320> blanks<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.920> an<00:01:53.460> f2<00:01:53.820> well<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.619> solve

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
the blanks like an f2 well and solve

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.060 
the blanks like an f2 well and solve
each<00:01:56.369> pair<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:57.350> until<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.890> last

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
each pair here until we get to the last

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.880 
each pair here until we get to the last
layer<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.640> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> other

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
layer and this is going to be the other

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.030 
layer and this is going to be the other
part<00:02:01.890> 3<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.509> first<00:02:03.509> off<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.320> solve<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> oil

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
part 3 so first off you solve the oil

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.600 
part 3 so first off you solve the oil
and<00:02:05.280> two<00:02:05.369> steps<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:07.439> PLL<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.129> two

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and two steps and then the PLL in two

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.780 
and two steps and then the PLL in two
steps<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.770> now<00:02:10.770> I'm<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.400> doing

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
steps so now I'm just going to be doing

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.179 
steps so now I'm just going to be doing
quick<00:02:13.000> walkthrough<00:02:13.450> solve<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.799> give<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.069> an

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
quick walkthrough solve to give you an

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.240 
quick walkthrough solve to give you an
even<00:02:15.400> better<00:02:15.519> idea<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.739> method<00:02:18.099> is

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
even better idea of what this method is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.149 
even better idea of what this method is
and<00:02:18.609> if<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.780> want<00:02:20.469> to<00:02:20.620> learn<00:02:21.659> from<00:02:22.659> it<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:23.769> bit

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
and if you want to learn from it a bit

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.720 
and if you want to learn from it a bit
about<00:02:24.359> my<00:02:25.390> megaminx<00:02:25.930> solving<00:02:26.469> I<00:02:26.730> averaged

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
about my megaminx solving I averaged

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.380 
about my megaminx solving I averaged
about<00:02:27.849> one<00:02:28.150> minute<00:02:28.299> 15<00:02:28.750> seconds<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:30.390> my

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
about one minute 15 seconds and my

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.500 
about one minute 15 seconds and my
personal<00:02:32.379> best<00:02:32.560> average<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.189> 12<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:36.129> lo<00:02:36.760> 113

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
personal best average of 12 is a lo 113

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.390 
personal best average of 12 is a lo 113
so<00:02:38.579> approximately<00:02:39.579> 113<00:02:40.540> 27<00:02:41.079> I<00:02:41.139> think<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.530> my

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
so approximately 113 27 I think and my

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.429 
so approximately 113 27 I think and my
personal<00:02:42.760> best<00:02:42.969> average<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.450> five<00:02:43.629> is<00:02:43.900> one<00:02:44.409> oh

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
personal best average of five is one oh

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.759 
personal best average of five is one oh
nine<00:02:44.650> point<00:02:45.040> ninety<00:02:45.250> six<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.260> first<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.650> got

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
nine point ninety six so first you got

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.399 
nine point ninety six so first you got
to<00:02:47.799> start<00:02:48.040> off<00:02:48.189> with<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.579> cross<00:02:48.909> I<00:02:49.359> still<00:02:50.290> have

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
to start off with the cross I still have

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.770 
to start off with the cross I still have
a<00:02:50.470> bit<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.620> trouble<00:02:50.799> with<00:02:51.099> this<00:02:51.250> because<00:02:51.780> you

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
a bit of trouble with this because you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.360 
a bit of trouble with this because you
have<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.079> track<00:02:53.560> down<00:02:53.769> all<00:02:53.889> the<00:02:53.980> pieces<00:02:54.159> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
have to track down all the pieces and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.140 
have to track down all the pieces and
stuff<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.200> way<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.709> do<00:02:56.859> it<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.189> first<00:02:57.909> find

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
stuff so the way I do it I first find

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.789 
stuff so the way I do it I first find
all<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.419> pieces<00:02:58.599> make<00:02:59.379> sure<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.560> know<00:02:59.709> where

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
all the pieces make sure I know where

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:07.879 
all the pieces make sure I know where
they<00:03:00.220> are<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:01.060> then<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:01.209> start<00:03:01.739> building<00:03:02.739> on

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.369 

so<00:03:08.889> now<00:03:09.010> I've<00:03:09.099> got<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.459> cross<00:03:10.000> done<00:03:10.269> next<00:03:11.230> step

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
so now I've got the cross done next step

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.110 
so now I've got the cross done next step
is<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.739> f2l<00:03:12.220> as<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.639> said<00:03:12.849> so<00:03:13.750> I'd<00:03:13.840> go<00:03:15.120> filling

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
is the f2l as I said so I'd go filling

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.189 
is the f2l as I said so I'd go filling
in<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.389> blanks<00:03:19.919> and<00:03:21.599> creating<00:03:22.599> pairs<00:03:22.870> like

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199 
in the blanks and creating pairs like

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:36.979 
in the blanks and creating pairs like
this<00:03:23.409> one

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.559 

now<00:03:37.989> once<00:03:38.200> you're<00:03:38.349> done<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.500> f2l<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:40.330> create

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
now once you're done the f2l you create

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.220 
now once you're done the f2l you create
a<00:03:40.599> little<00:03:40.810> block<00:03:41.140> things<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.690> first<00:03:43.900> solve

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
a little block things so you first solve

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.540 
a little block things so you first solve
like<00:03:44.530> an<00:03:44.650> edge<00:03:44.800> here<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.989> then<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:48.040> pair<00:03:48.459> up

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
like an edge here and then you pair up

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.420 
like an edge here and then you pair up
the<00:03:48.670> other<00:03:48.819> two<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:50.010> then<00:03:51.010> put<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.310> into

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
the other two and then put it into

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:23.340 
the other two and then put it into
create<00:03:51.880> like<00:03:52.030> let<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.720> block<00:03:52.900> things

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.650 

so<00:04:24.350> now<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:24.650> solved<00:04:24.980> a<00:04:25.040> little<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:26.420> block

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
so now it's solved a little the block

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.820 
so now it's solved a little the block
things<00:04:26.960> here<00:04:27.290> now<00:04:28.160> I'm<00:04:28.520> going<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:29.560> finish<00:04:30.560> in

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
things here now I'm going to finish in

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.120 
things here now I'm going to finish in
the<00:04:30.920> pair's<00:04:31.250> here<00:04:31.880> like<00:04:32.350> do<00:04:33.350> Paris<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:33.920> put<00:04:34.070> it

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
the pair's here like do Paris and put it

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:50.800 
the pair's here like do Paris and put it
in<00:04:47.860> now<00:04:48.860> we've<00:04:49.070> done<00:04:49.220> all<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:50.450> pairs<00:04:50.720> that

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
in now we've done all the the pairs that

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.810 
in now we've done all the the pairs that
are<00:04:51.050> left<00:04:51.230> here<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:51.980> now<00:04:52.160> I'm<00:04:52.280> going<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.520> do<00:04:52.610> the

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
are left here so now I'm going to do the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:01.120 
are left here so now I'm going to do the
ll<00:04:53.240> I<00:04:58.300> don't<00:04:59.300> know<00:04:59.390> this<00:04:59.650> Alex<00:05:00.650> oh<00:05:00.830> I'm<00:05:00.920> going

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
ll I don't know this Alex oh I'm going

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.020 
ll I don't know this Alex oh I'm going
to<00:05:01.190> look<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:02.440> now<00:05:03.440> once<00:05:03.590> I'm<00:05:03.710> done<00:05:03.800> o<00:05:03.920> ll<00:05:04.190> it's<00:05:04.490> P

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
to look it now once I'm done o ll it's P

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.550 
to look it now once I'm done o ll it's P
ll<00:05:05.270> start<00:05:05.840> with<00:05:05.900> edge<00:05:06.230> permutation<00:05:06.920> and<00:05:08.560> then

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
ll start with edge permutation and then

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.450 
ll start with edge permutation and then
corner<00:05:09.980> permutation<00:05:13.660> there<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.750> have<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:15.460> so

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
corner permutation there you have it so

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.490 
corner permutation there you have it so
I'm<00:05:16.820> going<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.030> be<00:05:17.180> doing<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.930> next<00:05:18.140> parts

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
I'm going to be doing the next parts

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.880 
I'm going to be doing the next parts
very<00:05:18.890> soon<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:20.290> that's<00:05:21.290> about<00:05:21.440> it<00:05:21.530> for<00:05:21.680> the
