think you know things need to come into
focus<00:02:05.880> people<00:02:06.300> need<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.540> decide<00:02:06.870> if<00:02:07.170> they're

impact<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.130> our<00:02:11.250> peers<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.910> seen

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
impact on our peers but I have seen

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.690 
impact on our peers but I have seen
quite<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.990> bit<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.230> analysis<00:02:13.440> both<00:02:14.100> internally

Cowan<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:16.920> company<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.220> think<00:02:17.250> released<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
Cowan and company I think released a

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.850 
Cowan and company I think released a
report<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.750> know<00:02:18.960> ghost<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.470> still<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
report that you know ghost is still the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.530 
report that you know ghost is still the
the<00:02:20.160> most<00:02:20.340> pre-ordered<00:02:20.610> game<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.300> top<00:02:21.510> of

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the most pre-ordered game and on top of

the most pre-ordered game and on top of
the<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.960> heap<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.160> know<00:02:23.280> relative<00:02:23.700> to

the the heap and you know relative to

the the heap and you know relative to
the<00:02:24.840> marketplace<00:02:25.140> that's<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.680> ask

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the marketplace that's all we can ask

the marketplace that's all we can ask
for

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.260 

actually<00:02:35.980> if<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.100> look<00:02:36.160> statistically<00:02:37.060> at

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
actually if you look statistically at

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.420 
actually if you look statistically at
past<00:02:37.720> console<00:02:38.380> transition<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> biggest

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
past console transition it's the biggest

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.430 
past console transition it's the biggest
franchises<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.150> actually<00:02:40.510> fared<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
franchises that have actually fared the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.880 
franchises that have actually fared the
best<00:02:41.650> through<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.310> transition<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.710> last<00:02:44.710> time

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
best through the transition so last time

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.350 
best through the transition so last time
was<00:02:45.040> actually<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.490> more<00:02:45.610> statistical

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
was actually the more statistical

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.960 
was actually the more statistical
anomaly<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.110> we<00:02:47.260> were<00:02:47.590> able<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:48.850> know

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
anomaly that we were able to you know

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.090 
anomaly that we were able to you know
use<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.720> console<00:02:50.050> transition<00:02:50.470> as<00:02:50.590> an

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
use the console transition as an

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.740 
use the console transition as an
opportunity<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.640> really<00:02:51.910> grow<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.420> by<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
opportunity to really grow and by the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.290 
opportunity to really grow and by the
way<00:02:52.900> call<00:02:53.410> duty<00:02:53.620> didn't<00:02:53.950> really<00:02:54.490> grow<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.820> the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
way call duty didn't really grow to the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.200 
way call duty didn't really grow to the
phenomenon<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.320> until<00:02:56.740> probably<00:02:57.210> you

phenomenon that it is until probably you

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.390 
phenomenon that it is until probably you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
know caught for Modern Warfare probably

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.650 
know caught for Modern Warfare probably
was<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.580> first<00:03:00.640> one<00:03:00.970> that's<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.270> if<00:03:01.450> memory

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
was the first one that's like if memory

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
was the first one that's like if memory
serves<00:03:01.750> that's<00:03:02.080> probably<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.380> first<00:03:02.410> one<00:03:02.620> to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
serves that's probably the first one to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.380 
serves that's probably the first one to
crack<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.400> 10<00:03:03.580> million<00:03:03.820> mark<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.240> really

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
crack the 10 million mark and really

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.780 
crack the 10 million mark and really
become<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.530> thing<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.040> today

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
become that that thing that it is today

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.370 
become that that thing that it is today
and<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.570> didn't<00:03:07.750> happen<00:03:07.810> for<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.050> few<00:03:08.080> years

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
and that didn't happen for a few years

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.130 
and that didn't happen for a few years
into<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:09.280> console<00:03:10.150> cycle<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.570> you<00:03:11.050> know

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
into the the console cycle so you know

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.710 
into the the console cycle so you know
if<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:11.530> look<00:03:11.740> if<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.820> past<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.510> best

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
if you look if the past is the best

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.470 
if you look if the past is the best
indicator<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.290> future<00:03:14.590> sometimes<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.190> is

indicator to the future sometimes it is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
statistical analysis I care about is

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.220 
statistical analysis I care about is
that<00:03:24.010> what<00:03:24.670> works<00:03:24.940> for<00:03:25.060> us<00:03:25.209> year<00:03:25.959> in<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.200> year

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
that what works for us year in and year

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.560 
that what works for us year in and year
out<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.590> making<00:03:26.860> a<00:03:26.920> great<00:03:27.100> game<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.570> providing

out is making a great game and providing

our fans with an awesome experience
with<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.480> right<00:03:31.660> balance<00:03:31.870> between<00:03:32.080> making

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
with the right balance between making

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.870 
with the right balance between making
the<00:03:32.680> game<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:33.010> everyone<00:03:33.220> knows<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.670> loves

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
the game that everyone knows it loves

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.940 
the game that everyone knows it loves
but<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:34.840> has<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.019> lot<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.290> new<00:03:35.470> ideas<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.920> a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
but that has a lot of new ideas and a

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.920 
but that has a lot of new ideas and a
lot<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.100> fresh<00:03:36.430> thinking<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.450> you

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
lot of fresh thinking in it so that you

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.540 
lot of fresh thinking in it so that you
want<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.290> come<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.739> experience<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.400> play

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
want to come and experience it and play

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.410 
want to come and experience it and play
it<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.820> think<00:03:39.940> that's<00:03:40.090> what<00:03:40.330> we've

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
it so I think that's what we've

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.090 
it so I think that's what we've
delivered<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:40.870> ghosts<00:03:41.200> certainly<00:03:41.800> what<00:03:41.920> we've

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
delivered in ghosts certainly what we've

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.770 
delivered in ghosts certainly what we've
delivered<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:43.150> past<00:03:43.360> few<00:03:43.510> years<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.720> that's

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
delivered the past few years and that's

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.870 
delivered the past few years and that's
why<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:43.989> think<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.230> franchise<00:03:44.560> has<00:03:44.709> been<00:03:44.880> able

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
why I think the franchise has been able

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.430 
why I think the franchise has been able
to<00:03:46.090> continue<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.600> grow<00:03:46.870> even<00:03:47.140> though<00:03:47.290> it's

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
to continue to grow even though it's

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.840 
to continue to grow even though it's
already<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:48.100> know<00:03:48.220> sort<00:03:48.519> of<00:03:48.550> at<00:03:48.760> an

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
already you know sort of at an

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.090 
already you know sort of at an
unprecedented<00:03:49.150> size<00:03:49.989> compared<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.950> rest

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
unprecedented size compared to the rest

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.910 
unprecedented size compared to the rest
of<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.250> industry

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.190 

the<00:03:56.920> driving<00:03:57.280> force<00:03:57.430> behind<00:03:57.489> us<00:03:57.849> bringing

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
the driving force behind us bringing

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.369 
the driving force behind us bringing
those<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.590> the<00:04:00.040> Wii<00:04:00.220> U<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.239> same<00:04:01.450> as<00:04:01.689> every

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
business that's you know that's been our

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.720 
business that's you know that's been our
strategy<00:04:11.560> in<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:11.980> past<00:04:12.189> we've<00:04:12.370> been<00:04:12.459> a<00:04:12.489> very

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
strategy in the past we've been a very

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.050 
strategy in the past we've been a very
kind<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.450> platform<00:04:13.900> agnostic<00:04:14.280> company<00:04:15.280> we

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
kind of platform agnostic company we

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.879 
kind of platform agnostic company we
generally<00:04:16.870> try<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.079> be<00:04:17.259> wherever<00:04:17.440> our<00:04:17.680> gamers

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
generally try to be wherever our gamers

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.219 
generally try to be wherever our gamers
want<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.280> play<00:04:18.459> so<00:04:18.519> we<00:04:19.479> thought<00:04:19.989> if<00:04:20.109> our

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
want to play so we thought if our

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.710 
want to play so we thought if our
content<00:04:20.769> can<00:04:21.039> help<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:22.120> Wii<00:04:22.270> U<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.630> Nintendo

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
content can help the Wii U and Nintendo

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.779 
content can help the Wii U and Nintendo
gained<00:04:23.410> some<00:04:23.590> momentum<00:04:23.650> then<00:04:24.370> we<00:04:24.520> wanted<00:04:24.729> to

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
gained some momentum then we wanted to

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:35.250 
gained some momentum then we wanted to
do<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.300> new<00:04:34.479> engine<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:35.110> know<00:04:35.229> I

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
do that it is a new engine you know I

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.500 
do that it is a new engine you know I
think<00:04:35.470> every<00:04:36.039> engine<00:04:36.789> that's<00:04:36.940> building<00:04:37.330> on

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
think every engine that's building on

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.960 
think every engine that's building on
you<00:04:37.990> know<00:04:38.110> an<00:04:38.289> existing<00:04:38.800> platform<00:04:39.639> has<00:04:39.760> some

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
you know an existing platform has some

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.490 
you know an existing platform has some
legacy<00:04:40.389> code<00:04:40.600> somewhere<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.139> it<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.410> this

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
legacy code somewhere in it and this

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.580 
legacy code somewhere in it and this
one's<00:04:41.740> no<00:04:41.889> different<00:04:42.090> but<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:44.050> know<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.229> can

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
one's no different but you know you can

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.760 
one's no different but you know you can
see<00:04:44.800> hopefully<00:04:45.430> on<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.580> screen<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:47.260> results

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
see hopefully on the screen the results

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.589 
see hopefully on the screen the results
you<00:04:47.889> know<00:04:47.979> it's<00:04:48.099> a<00:04:48.160> very<00:04:48.190> different<00:04:48.699> engine

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
you know it's a very different engine

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.060 
you know it's a very different engine
that<00:04:49.750> allows<00:04:50.229> you<00:04:50.620> know<00:04:50.710> very<00:04:50.889> different

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
that allows you know very different

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.379 
that allows you know very different
