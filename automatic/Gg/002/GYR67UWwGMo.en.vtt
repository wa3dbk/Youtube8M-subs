right in and now I'm just going to cut

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.959 
right in and now I'm just going to cut
down<00:00:31.500> two<00:00:31.769> areas<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.309> video<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:32.820> not

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
down two areas of the video that I'm not

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:42.139 
down two areas of the video that I'm not
gonna<00:00:33.120> use<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:37.250> probably<00:00:40.640> I'll<00:00:41.640> start<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
gonna use so probably I'll start to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.590 
gonna use so probably I'll start to
affect<00:00:42.210> something<00:00:42.629> right<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> let's

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
affect something right there so let's

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
affect something right there so let's
select<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.930> footage<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.980> gonna<00:00:47.070> press

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
select your footage you're gonna press

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.619 
select your footage you're gonna press
tracked<00:00:47.940> camera<00:00:49.760> what<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:50.940> gonna<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.420> is

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
tracked camera what that's gonna do is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.200 
tracked camera what that's gonna do is
it's<00:00:51.930> gonna<00:00:52.710> start<00:00:53.039> tracking<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.730> your

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's gonna start tracking all your

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
it's gonna start tracking all your
camera<00:00:54.629> movements<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.129> you're<00:00:56.250> gonna<00:00:56.340> go<00:00:56.489> into

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
camera movements so you're gonna go into

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.170 
camera movements so you're gonna go into
the<00:00:57.149> Advanced<00:00:57.480> section<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.859> under<00:00:59.789> solve

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the Advanced section and under solve

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
the Advanced section and under solve
method<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.870> gonna<00:01:00.989> go<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.440> select<00:01:01.559> tripod

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
method you're gonna go and select tripod

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.990 
method you're gonna go and select tripod
pan<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.719> what<00:01:03.719> tripod<00:01:04.110> pen<00:01:04.320> does<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
pan and what tripod pen does is it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.080 
pan and what tripod pen does is it
basically<00:01:06.150> tells<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> camera<00:01:07.260> tracker<00:01:07.619> that

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
basically tells the camera tracker that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.520 
basically tells the camera tracker that
the<00:01:09.090> camera<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.630> moving<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.049> 3d<00:01:10.320> space

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the camera is not moving in 3d space

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.760 
the camera is not moving in 3d space
it's<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.310> staying<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.720> spot<00:01:12.770> but

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
it's just staying in one spot but

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.310 
it's just staying in one spot but
panning<00:01:14.159> around<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> after<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:18.990> it's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
panning around so after you do that it's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
panning around so after you do that it's
gonna<00:01:19.439> continue<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.070> analyze<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
gonna continue to analyze all the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.420 
gonna continue to analyze all the
background<00:01:22.280> movements<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> motions<00:01:25.369> ok<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
background movements and motions ok so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.560 
background movements and motions ok so
now<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> camera<00:01:28.009> movement<00:01:29.009> data<00:01:29.570> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
now we have the camera movement data and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.100 
now we have the camera movement data and
you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.259> dots<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> now

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you can see all the little dots so now

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.600 
you can see all the little dots so now
basically<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.950> you're<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.490> you're

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

basically what you're gonna do is you're
gonna<00:01:35.670> select<00:01:36.170> part<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> video<00:01:37.619> you're

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
gonna select part of the video you're

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.800 
gonna select part of the video you're
gonna<00:01:39.829> zoom<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.570> you're<00:01:42.689> gonna

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
create a circle around a couple dots in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.330 
create a circle around a couple dots in
the<00:01:52.200> area<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.710> want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.479> attract<00:01:55.040> once<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.159> do

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the area you want to attract once you do

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.340 
the area you want to attract once you do
that<00:01:56.549> you're<00:01:57.090> gonna<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.509> click<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.079> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that you're gonna right click and you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.770 
that you're gonna right click and you
can<00:01:58.380> go<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> create<00:01:59.040> solid<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.850> camera

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.139 

now<00:02:04.780> that's<00:02:04.960> basically<00:02:05.350> going<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.799> create<00:02:06.070> a

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
now that's basically going to create a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.490 
now that's basically going to create a
solid<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:08.590> 3d<00:02:08.920> camera<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:10.230> once<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.349> do

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
solid and a 3d camera and once you do

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.610 
solid and a 3d camera and once you do
that<00:02:12.180> you're<00:02:13.180> you're<00:02:13.510> solid<00:02:13.959> might<00:02:14.140> be<00:02:14.349> two

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that you're you're solid might be two

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.759 
that you're you're solid might be two
bigs<00:02:14.890> or<00:02:15.069> gonna<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.400> scale<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.760> down<00:02:16.769> so

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
bigs or gonna have to scale it down so

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.320 
bigs or gonna have to scale it down so
just<00:02:18.160> shrink<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.489> down<00:02:18.610> until<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.120> make<00:02:19.299> it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
just shrink it down until you make it

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.150 
just shrink it down until you make it
like<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> small<00:02:20.049> little<00:02:20.620> box<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:23.160> don't

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
like a small little box you don't

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.979 
like a small little box you don't
actually<00:02:24.430> need<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.000> solid<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.870> can

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
actually need the solid you just you can

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.110 
actually need the solid you just you can
make<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.230> invisible<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.739> won't<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:28.000> is

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
make it invisible it won't but this is

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.150 
make it invisible it won't but this is
to<00:02:28.299> test<00:02:28.569> if<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.110> actually<00:02:29.500> sticks<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:30.040> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
to test if it actually sticks to the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.690 
to test if it actually sticks to the
scene

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.070 

so<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:39.060> screw<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.480> through<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> timeline

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
so just screw up through the timeline

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.070 
so just screw up through the timeline
and<00:02:40.500> see<00:02:40.740> if<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.920> sticks<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.490> scene<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.390> if

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
and see if it sticks to the scene and if

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.320 
and see if it sticks to the scene and if
it<00:02:43.230> doesn't<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.860> do<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.640> because<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.000> did<00:02:45.210> it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
it doesn't it do it because it did it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:54.410 
it doesn't it do it because it did it
wrong<00:02:45.510> or<00:02:46.230> your<00:02:46.530> footage<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.010> too<00:02:47.220> shaky<00:02:53.420> but

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
wrong or your footage is too shaky but

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.960 
wrong or your footage is too shaky but
right<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.930> seems<00:02:55.110> like<00:02:55.230> it's<00:02:55.470> working<00:02:55.970> so

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
right now it seems like it's working so

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.520 
right now it seems like it's working so
now<00:02:57.090> basically<00:02:57.330> what<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.080> do<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.350> this

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
now basically what you can do with this

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.620 
now basically what you can do with this
is<00:02:59.060> you<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.210> make<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.480> solid<00:03:00.690> invisible<00:03:01.460> and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
is you can make the solid invisible and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.160 
is you can make the solid invisible and
you<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:03.780> parent<00:03:04.290> other<00:03:04.620> objects<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:06.170> so

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
you can parent other objects to it so

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.960 
you can parent other objects to it so
let's<00:03:07.470> say<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:08.100> want<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.570> put<00:03:09.570> some<00:03:09.810> smoke<00:03:13.970> what

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
let's say we want to put some smoke what

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.170 
let's say we want to put some smoke what
we<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.240> do<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.510> import<00:03:15.960> some<00:03:16.260> smoke<00:03:16.650> footage

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
we can do is import some smoke footage

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.100 
we can do is import some smoke footage
and<00:03:19.250> after<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.370> import<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.930> make

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
and after you import it you have to make

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.340 
and after you import it you have to make
into<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> 3d<00:03:22.770> layer<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.540> do<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.870> by<00:03:25.080> going

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
into a 3d layer and you do that by going

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.450 
into a 3d layer and you do that by going
and<00:03:25.770> pressing<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.310> total<00:03:26.820> switches<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.330> modes

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
and pressing on total switches and modes

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.330 
and pressing on total switches and modes
and<00:03:29.460> it<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.640> gonna<00:03:29.760> bring<00:03:30.030> up<00:03:30.180> more<00:03:30.330> options

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
and it is gonna bring up more options

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.390 
and it is gonna bring up more options
and<00:03:32.340> after<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.770> enable<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.370> 3d

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
and after that you have to enable the 3d

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.930 
and after that you have to enable the 3d
and<00:03:36.240> you<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.050> by<00:03:37.260> pressing<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.070> naval<00:03:38.550> 3d

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
and you do that by pressing the naval 3d

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.560 
and you do that by pressing the naval 3d
button<00:03:39.380> which<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.680> little<00:03:41.010> cube<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:42.360> now

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
button which is a little cube and now

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.300 
button which is a little cube and now
since<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.080> 3d<00:03:43.380> layer<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.830> might<00:03:44.010> be<00:03:44.160> out<00:03:44.280> of

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
since it's a 3d layer it might be out of

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.400 
since it's a 3d layer it might be out of
position<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.360> we<00:03:45.510> have<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.690> reposition<00:03:45.960> where

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
position so we have to reposition where

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.860 
position so we have to reposition where
you<00:03:46.500> want<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.890> smoke<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.220> be<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.790> after<00:03:48.600> you

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
you want the smoke to be and after you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.810 
you want the smoke to be and after you
do<00:03:49.020> that<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.920> parent<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.490> the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
do that you have to parent it to the

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.680 
do that you have to parent it to the
solid<00:03:52.070> that<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.130> made

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.229 

so<00:03:58.690> as<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:59.050> can<00:03:59.170> see<00:03:59.489> the<00:04:00.489> smoke<00:04:00.700> sticks<00:04:01.090> to

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
so as you can see the smoke sticks to

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.320 
so as you can see the smoke sticks to
the<00:04:01.360> scene<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:03.250> obviously<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:03.880> can<00:04:03.940> do<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.150> lot

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
the scene now obviously you can do a lot

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.440 
the scene now obviously you can do a lot
of<00:04:04.360> different<00:04:04.840> things<00:04:05.050> with<00:04:05.290> this<00:04:05.470> technique

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
of different things with this technique

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.790 
of different things with this technique
