you lanyard looped over like that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.020 
you lanyard looped over like that
to<00:00:43.890> start<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.570> then<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.809> longer<00:00:46.469> piece<00:00:47.030> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to start with then a longer piece and

to start with then a longer piece and
get<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> even<00:00:49.850> like<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.800> then<00:00:53.120> started<00:00:54.120> not

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
get it even like so then started not

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
get it even like so then started not
just<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:58.399> put<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.550> knot<00:00:59.730> over<00:01:00.140> and

so you go over the front underneath
round<00:01:11.330> like<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:13.939> then<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> next<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.600> goes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
round like that then the next one goes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.570 
round like that then the next one goes
from<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.890> side<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.820> front<00:01:18.650> round<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
from that side over the front round and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179 
from that side over the front round and
underneath<00:01:21.350> trying<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> keep<00:01:22.590> them<00:01:22.770> tight<00:01:22.979> as

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
underneath trying to keep them tight as

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
underneath trying to keep them tight as
you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.460> every<00:01:23.580> time<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> tighten<00:01:25.350> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you can every time it's the tighten this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.690 
you can every time it's the tighten this
is<00:01:25.590> what's<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> neatness<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:28.040> again<00:01:29.040> over

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
is what's the neatness and again over

is what's the neatness and again over
the<00:01:29.939> front<00:01:30.439> round<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.220> underneath<00:01:33.979> it's<00:01:34.979> as

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the front round and underneath it's as

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.999 
the front round and underneath it's as
simple<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:37.250> right<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.460> front<00:01:40.009> across

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
simple as that right in the front across

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.420 
simple as that right in the front across
the<00:01:41.280> front<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.970> underneath<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
the front of that one underneath and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.300 
the front of that one underneath and
round<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.210> keeping<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.720> tight<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.159> we

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
round so keeping it tight you can see we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
round so keeping it tight you can see we
starting<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> pattern<00:01:48.149> there<00:01:48.360> across<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
starting the pattern there across the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
starting the pattern there across the
front<00:01:49.880> underneath<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> old<00:01:52.880> it

front underneath and for the old it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
front underneath and for the old it
really<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.390> simple<00:01:54.600> once<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.290> how<00:01:57.740> round

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
really is simple once you know how round

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.880 
really is simple once you know how round
now

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
now

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.330 
now
through<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:02.390> right<00:02:02.630> sugar<00:02:03.620> you'll<00:02:04.010> get<00:02:04.250> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
through and right sugar you'll get the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.690 
through and right sugar you'll get the
idea<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:04.850> thing

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.059 

and<00:02:13.700> round<00:02:14.349> show<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.409> a<00:02:15.470> couple<00:02:15.650> more<00:02:15.799> times

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
and round show you a couple more times

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.920 
and round show you a couple more times
and<00:02:16.280> we'll<00:02:16.430> our<00:02:16.549> speed<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> video<00:02:17.209> up<00:02:17.390> as<00:02:17.810> I'm

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
and we'll our speed the video up as I'm

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.809 
and we'll our speed the video up as I'm
sure<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:19.069> don't<00:02:19.190> want<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.370> watch<00:02:19.459> we<00:02:19.610> do<00:02:19.730> it
