At this point in the game bosses become difficult to hold down with traditional physical combos. So I needed to work my way in slowly with ranged attacks. 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:23.040
Here is the opening I was waiting for. Thanks to MR's high stun rate I was able to get some OTG techs off and get Flynn close enough to begin "combos" which is loosely used here. 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.190
That df to ks was a poor attempt at reading the df pick-up. Since it didn't I naturally missed. It happens. Normally after 2-3 knockdown cycles df typically picks up. Back to stage 1

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
After a few otg cycles enemy tension is abnormally high. So bosses going ovl during this solo is rather frequent. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.190
At this point I'm more or less trying to plan another avenue of approach. Since Flynn is limited in comparison to say Yuri I have to rely on the tried and true, but void attack and tech outs are a concern.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:13.000
While I don't use the technique until much later in the run rf - semi-auto - hp eventually works wonders with zoning and repositioning. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:25.190
This was actually intentional. Like I mentioned in descriptions before Vesperia has awkward delay input on top of controller issues. Many of my Vesperia runs have been handicapped by this limitation. Literally a "challenge" run. So I was testing my controls mid-battle.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:02:05.110
After so many runs in the past TP management is hardly of a concern to me. I was consciously aware that I was running low, but it was of little concern. Especially with my intentions to use OVL 4 soon.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.240
This is what I referred to earlier. My inputs for tiger rage was completely ignored either by the game or the controller. This is common throughout the run with OVL.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.090
That cure was intentional. After getting trolled in earlier attempts I felt like "styling" on Belius. More or less an insult to the boss. Mind of Clip is...a strange place to be.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.030
