00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.070 
here's why it doesn't matter
because<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.880> don't<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.570> use<00:02:15.720> your<00:02:15.930> own

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
because you don't have to use your own

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.680 
because you don't have to use your own
money<00:02:16.320> anyway<00:02:16.920> when<00:02:17.700> most<00:02:17.910> people<00:02:18.330> ask<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
money anyway when most people ask the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.600 
money anyway when most people ask the
question<00:02:18.720> how<00:02:19.380> much<00:02:19.560> does<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.860> cost<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.430> start

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
question how much does it cost to start

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.980 
question how much does it cost to start
a<00:02:20.760> restaurant<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:21.510> they're<00:02:21.690> really

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
a restaurant what they're really

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.410 
a restaurant what they're really
thinking<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:24.000> enough<00:02:24.270> money

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
thinking about is do I have enough money

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.800 
thinking about is do I have enough money
to<00:02:24.690> start<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.050> restaurant<00:02:25.940> chances<00:02:26.940> are<00:02:27.120> you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
to start a restaurant chances are you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.800 
to start a restaurant chances are you
don't<00:02:28.020> but<00:02:29.010> even<00:02:29.250> if<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.520> did<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.360> doesn't

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
don't but even if you did it doesn't

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.470 
don't but even if you did it doesn't
matter<00:02:31.020> because<00:02:31.680> either<00:02:32.190> way<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.090> don't<00:02:33.390> have

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
matter because either way you don't have

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.300 
matter because either way you don't have
to<00:02:33.690> use<00:02:33.960> your<00:02:34.110> own<00:02:34.290> money<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.950> start<00:02:35.220> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
than most people and you're able to say

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.640 
than most people and you're able to say
save<00:02:55.470> ten<00:02:56.340> thousand<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.940> year<00:02:57.320> it's<00:02:58.320> going<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
save ten thousand a year it's going to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.800 
save ten thousand a year it's going to
take<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.010> 20<00:02:59.370> years<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.700> save<00:03:00.030> up<00:03:00.240> enough<00:03:00.360> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
take you 20 years to save up enough and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.880 
take you 20 years to save up enough and
by<00:03:00.930> then<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.230> won't<00:03:01.320> cost<00:03:01.620> two<00:03:01.860> hundred

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
by then it won't cost two hundred

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.590 
by then it won't cost two hundred
thousand<00:03:02.490> dollars<00:03:02.700> anymore<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.300> will<00:03:03.360> cost

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
thousand dollars anymore it will cost

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.100 
thousand dollars anymore it will cost
half<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.080> million<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.430> saving<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.150> not<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.990> way

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
half a million so saving is not the way

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.350 
half a million so saving is not the way
to<00:03:07.170> get<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.770> opening<00:03:08.580> your<00:03:08.610> own<00:03:08.820> restaurant<00:03:10.010> so

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
that's going to get you to where you

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.710 
that's going to get you to where you
want<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.740> be<00:03:16.890> then<00:03:17.820> you'll<00:03:18.000> know<00:03:18.150> how<00:03:18.180> much<00:03:18.390> you

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
want to be then you'll know how much you

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.300 
want to be then you'll know how much you
need<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.350> can<00:03:19.500> go<00:03:19.590> out<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.860> get<00:03:20.010> it

need and you can go out and get it
so<00:03:20.850> rather<00:03:21.090> than<00:03:21.270> worrying<00:03:21.540> about<00:03:21.660> how<00:03:22.080> much

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
so rather than worrying about how much

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.860 
so rather than worrying about how much
you<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.709> versus<00:03:23.340> how<00:03:23.459> much<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.790> costs<00:03:24.209> work

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
you have versus how much it costs work

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.870 
you have versus how much it costs work
