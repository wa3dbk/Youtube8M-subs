00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.369
 good today we're going to make our kit 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 red agate camouflage rice code 99 65 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.980
 for this camÃ¡ndula we are going to need 4 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.980
 meters of leather core of a millimeter 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 flat coffee separators 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:45.350
 a day cross a ring in the rangel 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:50.680
 separators and ovals in agate roots 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.680
 Well, let's start with the cord 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.449
 let's take the ironwork 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.449
 and let's go 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.509
 return 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.190
 on this side 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.840
 let's make a sequence 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.840
 of 5 units 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.250
 of ram and the separator and 5 units 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.230
 of red agate then by both 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.490
 separators 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:37.010
 sorry for the two hides I have put the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.470
 separator now for a leather 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.470
 I'm going to put in the cat 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.070
 I'm going to do this procedure 5 times 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.280
 and we are having a sequence 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.019
 and we already have a sequence of 5 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.450
 on all fours and five separators now let's go 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.750
 to insert two flat separators 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.630
 for the two games 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.620
 and we will continue doing the same 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.620
 sequence 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.290
 and the cat 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.790
 then the separator 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.920
 five times 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.909
 until you get to have 4 times 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.909
 this same procedure 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.400
 here I'm going, we're going to do the same 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.640
 sequence 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.250
 and when we have 5 on all fours and 5 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.080
 we followed separators 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.460
 to insert the two separator units 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.330
 flat 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.330
 here I am doing assembling leds 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.110
 until I get to have dad I'm going to 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.000
 to show 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:58.380
 already completed the sequence of 5 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.750
 separators followed by the cat after 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.560
 of the 5 we are going to cancel the 2 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.080
 flat separators followed again 5 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.490
 separators and so on until you have 4 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:16.830
 times flat separators 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:19.600
 and here we take another double cord and only 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.920
 we put a separator 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.320
 and the two on their hands 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.320
 and finally we assembled the cross 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.630
 so 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.330
 This is our red agate camandula kit 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.330
 rise code 99 65 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.890
 and
