00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.179
 for this work he used two fabrics 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.610
 Synthetic patent leather on one for the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.530
 outside and inside the other to 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.509
 placed now backwards with backhand to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 determine the size of the bag I will use 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.010
 This plastic mesh which I will seal 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 between the two fabrics this is going to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.170
 determine the size of the cap 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
 of the bag and will also give you rigidity 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.800
 next step will be folding the fabrics 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.380
 inward by matching the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.899
 edges one with the other being careful 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.030
 that the measurement matches the mesh 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.420
 plastic remember that this will be our 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 Standard measurement of the bag once 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 hold the two fabrics you must fold 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 inward the rectangle that contains 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.210
 the plastic mesh then fold the other 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 rectangle that will form the lid and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.010
 we will have thus formed the bag 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.870
 before sewing to open close you must 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.870
 put an image brooch 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.720
 which we are going to place it between the two 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.350
 fabrics one on the lid and one on the body 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.350
 from the bag 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.000
 now it will be necessary to know all 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.280
 the edges of the bags and once 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.979
 you have sewn the bag by all its edges 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.380
 and united them just as it is due 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.929
 you should get a box of fruit 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.450
 We're going to need three of your tables 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.670
 for that you must unlock the once 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.640
 that you have the tables you must remove the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.890
 excess to leave the exact measurement of the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.370
 lid of the bag you can use a 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.470
 hacksaw 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.490
 in this case the size of the lid 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.490
 requires three tables 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.250
 so now I'm going to paint them for that 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.990
 I 'm going to help with wood ink 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.990
 to paint two in a dark tone 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.470
 and a third one in a redder tone for 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.470
 give thus a more interesting design 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 and once painted the three tables will be 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.030
 necessary to varnish 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.460
 varnished then now if it will be 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.130
 necessary to form the lid of the bag 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.900
 we are going to place you abundant glue of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.900
 contact on the wrong side 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.000
 and now if it will be necessary to seal the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.000
 the stage 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.750
 in this case I left a little bit of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.180
 separation between table and table 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.580
 and in that separation I'm going to place a 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.080
 leather woven ribbon to give you a 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.080
 most interesting design 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.200
 there is always the option of putting a handle 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.859
 and turn it into a handbag 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.150
 you will simply need some rings 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.189
 hold it on each side and 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.189
 you can hold it in this way 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.110
 and finally we will have finished like this 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:22.319
 our kind of wood as you know the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.120
 classes are very fashionable are very handbags 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.830
 thin in which you can export 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.370
 just your key is an emergency kit 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.739
 Makeup your credit card does not 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.720
 I know but good that they are accessories that 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.060
 they are looking very much like they are a 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.410
 perfect complement for your outfit and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.450
 that now you can use it in 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.130
 any time and for why incido 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.680
 Well, well, you can also 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.049
 make and use it as a cover for 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.390
 a laptop even if you're a man 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.130
 bet made and you can use it 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.799
 a laptop 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.630
 even for a tablet thanks for your 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.630
 time for reproduction by the 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.019
 subscription that you're fine until the 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.019
 next
