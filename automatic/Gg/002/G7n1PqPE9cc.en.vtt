Maya file with exactly how they did it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.819 
Maya file with exactly how they did it
on<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> show<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.500> give<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
on the show and then I can give that to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.499 
on the show and then I can give that to
one<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> my<00:01:32.100> animators<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.360> can

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
one of my animators and then they can

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.940 
one of my animators and then they can
like<00:01:33.689> break<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.049> apart<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.470> figure<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.770> okay

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
like break that apart to figure out okay

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.800 
like break that apart to figure out okay
how<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.220> make<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:36.030> worked<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> TV

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
how do we make what worked in the TV

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.140 
how do we make what worked in the TV
show<00:01:36.960> work<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> game<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
show work in the game we have to think a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.170 
show work in the game we have to think a
whole<00:01:39.329> tool<00:01:39.630> set<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.500> 2d<00:01:41.250> animation<00:01:41.670> so

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
whole tool set for 2d animation so

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.300 
whole tool set for 2d animation so
because<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.689> our<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> engine

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
because we have our we have the engine

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670 
because we have our we have the engine
that<00:01:44.399> obsidian<00:01:44.850> made<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.270> they're<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:46.500> at

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that obsidian made that they're on at

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.530 
that obsidian made that they're on at
the<00:01:46.799> onyx<00:01:47.100> engine<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.640> made<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.090> Dungeon

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the onyx engine that we made for Dungeon

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.050 
the onyx engine that we made for Dungeon
Siege<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.799> came<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.939> had

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
Siege that just came out but then we had

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.300 
Siege that just came out but then we had
to<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.360> twist<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.259> engine<00:01:52.590> around<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.100> get

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to like twist that engine around to get

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
to like twist that engine around to get
it<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.520> work<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:53.700> southpark<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it to work for southpark so we had to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.350 
it to work for southpark so we had to
figure<00:01:55.439> out<00:01:55.590> how<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.710> make<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.159> rig<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> do

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
figure out how to make a rig like you do

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.139 
figure out how to make a rig like you do
in<00:01:57.479> 3d<00:01:57.780> games<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> skeleton<00:01:59.790> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
in 3d games like with the skeleton and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
in 3d games like with the skeleton and
how<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> character<00:02:01.530> art<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.890> fit

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
how you get the character art to fit

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.520 
how you get the character art to fit
onto<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.180> 3d<00:02:03.509> rig<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.020> had<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
onto the 3d rig so we had to get the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
onto the 3d rig so we had to get the
same<00:02:04.740> idea<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.399> could<00:02:05.520> make<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> walk<00:02:05.939> cycle

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
same idea so we could make a walk cycle

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.570 
same idea so we could make a walk cycle
and<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.560> all<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.340> main

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and then we can make like all the main

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.880 
and then we can make like all the main
kids<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.239> Stan<00:02:09.569> Kyle<00:02:09.869> Cartman<00:02:10.289> Kenny<00:02:10.679> all

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
kids like Stan Kyle Cartman Kenny all

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.870 
kids like Stan Kyle Cartman Kenny all
fit<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.430> same<00:02:11.700> rig<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.629> take

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
fit on the same rig and then we take

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.190 
fit on the same rig and then we take
that<00:02:13.000> Reagan<00:02:13.270> would<00:02:13.330> make<00:02:13.480> tons<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.960> tons<00:02:13.990> of

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
that Reagan would make tons and tons of

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.050 
that Reagan would make tons and tons of
animations<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.010> sometimes<00:02:15.820> I'll<00:02:15.940> go<00:02:16.030> a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
animations for it sometimes I'll go a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.880 
animations for it sometimes I'll go a
little<00:02:16.240> overboard<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.840> trying<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.620> mimic

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
little overboard and trying to mimic

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.530 
little overboard and trying to mimic
things<00:02:18.130> we're<00:02:18.520> trying<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.760> mimic<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.120> TV<00:02:19.360> show

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
things we're trying to mimic the TV show

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.360 
things we're trying to mimic the TV show
and<00:02:19.780> it's<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:20.500> they<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.740> 15<00:02:21.040> years<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.310> the

what it is and to the story you know so
with<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> walk<00:02:33.550> cycles<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.150> was<00:02:34.270> there<00:02:34.630> walk

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
with the walk cycles I was there walk

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.870 
with the walk cycles I was there walk
cycles<00:02:35.200> are<00:02:35.380> two<00:02:35.770> frames<00:02:36.010> down<00:02:36.220> two<00:02:36.430> frames<00:02:36.670> up

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
cycles are two frames down two frames up

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.990 
cycles are two frames down two frames up
two<00:02:37.450> firms<00:02:37.660> down<00:02:38.100> but<00:02:39.100> there<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.670> they

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
two firms down but there and they

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.700 
two firms down but there and they
animate<00:02:40.270> their<00:02:40.420> show<00:02:40.540> on<00:02:40.570> 24<00:02:41.050> frames<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.320> second

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
animate their show on 24 frames a second

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.470 
animate their show on 24 frames a second
so<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.340> couldn't<00:02:42.520> get<00:02:42.670> our<00:02:42.760> engine<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.240> run

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
so we couldn't get our engine to run

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.940 
so we couldn't get our engine to run
dirt<00:02:43.630> render<00:02:43.960> at<00:02:44.050> 24<00:02:44.410> frames<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.680> second

dirt render at 24 frames a second

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.110 
dirt render at 24 frames a second
because<00:02:45.040> who<00:02:45.220> wants<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.430> play<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.640> game<00:02:45.700> that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
because who wants to play a game that

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.450 
because who wants to play a game that
runs<00:02:46.510> at<00:02:46.630> 24<00:02:46.660> frames<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.230> second<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.740> know<00:02:48.220> so

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
runs at 24 frames a second you know so

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.190 
runs at 24 frames a second you know so
everybody<00:02:48.970> wants<00:02:49.240> 60<00:02:49.480> frames<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.810> second<00:02:50.080> but

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
everybody wants 60 frames a second but

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.690 
everybody wants 60 frames a second but
we<00:02:50.290> went<00:02:50.500> up<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.620> 60<00:02:50.950> frames<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.220> second<00:02:51.520> on<00:02:51.580> our

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
we went up to 60 frames a second on our

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.280 
we went up to 60 frames a second on our
game<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.150> looked<00:02:52.300> like<00:02:52.540> nothing<00:02:53.020> like<00:02:53.050> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
game and it looked like nothing like the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.980 
game and it looked like nothing like the
show<00:02:53.500> at<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:54.040> was<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.400> weird<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.690> was<00:02:55.750> just

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
show at all it was so weird it was just

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.390 
show at all it was so weird it was just
strange<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.470> combat<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:56.980> stuff<00:02:57.130> everybody

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
strange like combat and stuff everybody

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.630 
strange like combat and stuff everybody
was<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.030> super<00:02:58.480> smooth<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.080> sliding<00:02:59.640> so

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
was like so super smooth and sliding so

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.970 
was like so super smooth and sliding so
we<00:03:01.300> tried<00:03:01.510> kicking<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.930> down<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.170> 24<00:03:02.650> which<00:03:02.830> we

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
we tried kicking it down to 24 which we

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.230 
we tried kicking it down to 24 which we
kind<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.310> got<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.490> good<00:03:03.580> result<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.090> there<00:03:04.210> a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
kind of got a good result but there a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.490 
kind of got a good result but there a
lot<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.480> situations<00:03:04.720> when<00:03:05.200> you're<00:03:05.350> like

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
lot of situations when you're like

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.810 
lot of situations when you're like
pressing<00:03:05.740> buttons<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.370> stuff<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:06.730> you're

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
pressing buttons and stuff and you're

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.220 
pressing buttons and stuff and you're
not<00:03:06.850> getting<00:03:07.240> you're<00:03:07.750> not<00:03:07.780> getting<00:03:07.900> his

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
not getting you're not getting his

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.140 
not getting you're not getting his
accurate<00:03:08.530> as<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.650> can<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.610> went<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.850> 30

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
accurate as you can so we we went to 30

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.810 
accurate as you can so we we went to 30
but<00:03:10.930> then<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.260> had<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.410> problem<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.640> walk

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
but then we had the problem of the walk

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.580 
but then we had the problem of the walk
cycle<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.270> not<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.540> right<00:03:13.660> speed<00:03:14.020> as<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.320> show

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
cycle is not the right speed as a show

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.560 
cycle is not the right speed as a show
and<00:03:14.740> like<00:03:14.890> Matt<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.130> Trey<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.700> very<00:03:16.150> particular

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
and like Matt and Trey a very particular

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.530 
and like Matt and Trey a very particular
about<00:03:16.600> how<00:03:17.020> their<00:03:17.230> walk<00:03:17.740> cycle<00:03:18.070> works<00:03:18.540> so

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
about how their walk cycle works so

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.450 
about how their walk cycle works so
South<00:03:20.050> Park<00:03:20.260> studios<00:03:20.470> actually<00:03:21.010> took<00:03:21.220> their

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
South Park studios actually took their

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.660 
South Park studios actually took their
walk<00:03:22.300> cycle<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:22.960> then<00:03:23.440> they<00:03:23.650> they<00:03:24.040> went<00:03:24.490> back

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
walk cycle and then they they went back

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.220 
walk cycle and then they they went back
and<00:03:24.700> forth<00:03:24.850> we<00:03:25.120> freemen<00:03:25.390> Trey<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:25.870> they<00:03:25.960> ended

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
and forth we freemen Trey and they ended

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.510 
and forth we freemen Trey and they ended
up<00:03:26.350> figuring<00:03:26.650> out<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:26.980> they<00:03:27.130> can<00:03:27.280> do<00:03:27.370> two

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
up figuring out that they can do two

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.610 
up figuring out that they can do two
frames<00:03:27.790> down<00:03:27.970> three<00:03:28.720> frames<00:03:28.960> up<00:03:29.140> two<00:03:29.380> frames

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
frames down three frames up two frames

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.250 
frames down three frames up two frames
down<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:30.100> kind<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:31.020> incorporate<00:03:32.020> like

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
down to kind of like incorporate like

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.250 
down to kind of like incorporate like
the<00:03:32.440> 3:2<00:03:32.770> pulldown<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.730> happens<00:03:34.180> from<00:03:34.450> film

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the 3:2 pulldown that happens from film

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.620 
the 3:2 pulldown that happens from film
when<00:03:35.530> film<00:03:35.770> goes<00:03:35.920> onto<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.190> television<00:03:36.580> show<00:03:36.760> so

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
when film goes onto a television show so

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.000 
when film goes onto a television show so
they<00:03:37.750> kind<00:03:37.990> of<00:03:38.080> incorporated<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:38.980> our

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
they kind of incorporated that so our

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.670 
they kind of incorporated that so our
engine<00:03:39.400> would<00:03:39.550> render<00:03:39.880> with<00:03:40.060> their<00:03:40.390> with<00:03:41.320> we

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
engine would render with their with we

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.199 
engine would render with their with we
could<00:03:41.860> we<00:03:42.010> could<00:03:42.130> animate<00:03:42.400> everything<00:03:42.790> as<00:03:43.150> a

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
could we could animate everything as a

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.080 
could we could animate everything as a
3:2<00:03:43.780> pulldown<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.950> fake<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.400> 24<00:03:45.820> frames<00:03:46.000> a

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
3:2 pulldown to fake the 24 frames a

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.840 
3:2 pulldown to fake the 24 frames a
second<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.660> 30<00:03:46.870> frames<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.530> second<00:03:48.130> show<00:03:48.280> so

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
second in the 30 frames a second show so

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.730 
second in the 30 frames a second show so
like<00:03:49.030> everything<00:03:49.600> we<00:03:49.840> animate<00:03:50.200> we<00:03:50.350> always<00:03:50.560> go

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
like everything we animate we always go

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.150 
like everything we animate we always go
like<00:03:50.920> 2<00:03:51.760> frames<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.300> help<00:03:53.050> pose<00:03:53.260> three<00:03:53.890> fingers

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
like 2 frames of help pose three fingers

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.280 
like 2 frames of help pose three fingers
of<00:03:54.250> help<00:03:54.459> pose<00:03:54.640> two<00:03:55.060> frames<00:03:55.360> of<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.900> help<00:03:56.050> pose

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
of help pose two frames of a help pose

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.590 
of help pose two frames of a help pose
but<00:03:56.890> that's<00:03:57.070> kind<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.280> like<00:03:57.430> super<00:03:58.330> like

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
but that's kind of like super like

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.070 
but that's kind of like super like
in-depth<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.800> studying<00:04:00.810> studying<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> show

and the style and all that stuff if you

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.780 
and the style and all that stuff if you
do<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.420> RPG<00:04:04.780> there's<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> lot<00:04:05.140> of<00:04:05.260> lines<00:04:05.790> and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
do it RPG there's a lot of lines and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.180 
do it RPG there's a lot of lines and
with<00:04:07.270> with<00:04:07.540> southpark<00:04:07.750> in<00:04:08.050> order<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.350> kind<00:04:09.100> of

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
with with southpark in order to kind of

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.670 
with with southpark in order to kind of
make<00:04:09.850> it<00:04:09.880> feel<00:04:10.120> like<00:04:10.150> South<00:04:10.450> Park<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:10.900> like<00:04:11.350> the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
make it feel like South Park is like the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.520 
make it feel like South Park is like the
the<00:04:12.640> vo<00:04:12.850> like<00:04:13.480> all<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.810> other<00:04:14.020> wise<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.440> it's

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
the vo like all the other wise and it's

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.229 
the vo like all the other wise and it's
all<00:04:14.650> Matt<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.010> Trey's<00:04:15.190> writing<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:16.120> know

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
all Matt and Trey's writing you know

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.539 
all Matt and Trey's writing you know
they<00:04:16.600> do<00:04:16.660> all<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.989> vo<00:04:17.140> for<00:04:17.440> everything<00:04:17.770> so<00:04:17.980> we

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
they do all the vo for everything so we

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.030 
they do all the vo for everything so we
had<00:04:18.640> to<00:04:18.730> have<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.880> way<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.620> efficiently<00:04:20.620> get<00:04:20.799> all

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
had to have a way to efficiently get all

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.780 
had to have a way to efficiently get all
their<00:04:21.460> lines<00:04:22.000> into<00:04:22.419> our<00:04:22.570> game<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.550> get<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.669> in

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
their lines into our game and get it in

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.490 
their lines into our game and get it in
there<00:04:24.910> quickly<00:04:25.270> so<00:04:25.450> we<00:04:25.600> used

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
there quickly so we used

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.680 
there quickly so we used
procedural<00:04:27.010> dialogue<00:04:27.700> generation<00:04:28.180> tool<00:04:28.390> is

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
procedural dialogue generation tool is

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.600 
procedural dialogue generation tool is
pretty<00:04:28.900> common<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.530> games<00:04:30.040> but<00:04:30.280> we<00:04:30.400> had<00:04:30.520> to

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
pretty common in games but we had to

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.370 
pretty common in games but we had to
make<00:04:30.730> it<00:04:30.760> work<00:04:31.000> for<00:04:31.180> South<00:04:31.390> Park<00:04:31.420> so<00:04:32.200> South

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
shapes so we went in and took our

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.180 
shapes so we went in and took our
procedural<00:04:46.870> dialogue<00:04:47.350> tools<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.830> we<00:04:47.920> used

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
procedural dialogue tools that we used

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.700 
procedural dialogue tools that we used
on<00:04:48.370> like<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> protocol<00:04:49.330> or<00:04:49.600> new<00:04:49.720> vegas<00:04:50.050> or

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
on like a protocol or new vegas or

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.230 
on like a protocol or new vegas or
judgin<00:04:51.100> see<00:04:51.250> jenni<00:04:51.550> we<00:04:51.640> were<00:04:51.730> like<00:04:51.850> okay<00:04:52.030> lets

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
judgin see jenni we were like okay lets

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.970 
judgin see jenni we were like okay lets
me<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.600> then<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.840> just<00:04:52.990> kind<00:04:53.140> of<00:04:53.260> got<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.860> to

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
me and then we just kind of got it to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.550 
me and then we just kind of got it to
map<00:04:54.160> onto<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.820> South<00:04:55.030> Park<00:04:55.270> mouth<00:04:55.480> shapes<00:04:55.810> so

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
map onto the South Park mouth shapes so

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.890 
map onto the South Park mouth shapes so
when<00:04:57.340> we<00:04:57.550> work<00:04:57.940> directly<00:04:58.180> with<00:04:58.360> South<00:04:58.660> Park

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
when we work directly with South Park

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.480 
when we work directly with South Park
like<00:04:59.050> we<00:04:59.169> show<00:04:59.410> us<00:04:59.560> we<00:04:59.890> show<00:05:00.040> them<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.250> first

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
like we show us we show them the first

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.110 
like we show us we show them the first
version<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.860> generated<00:05:02.860> lip<00:05:03.190> lip<00:05:03.880> sync

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
version of the generated lip lip sync

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.000 
version of the generated lip lip sync
and<00:05:04.270> stuff<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.660> then<00:05:04.780> they'd<00:05:04.900> be<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.200> that's

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
and stuff and then they'd be like that's

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.580 
and stuff and then they'd be like that's
cool<00:05:06.340> but<00:05:07.120> this<00:05:07.750> mouth<00:05:07.990> shapes<00:05:08.200> not<00:05:08.350> right

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
cool but this mouth shapes not right

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.250 
cool but this mouth shapes not right
here<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.070> okay<00:05:09.640> so<00:05:09.700> we<00:05:09.970> changed<00:05:10.450> some<00:05:10.570> sudden

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
here and okay so we changed some sudden

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260 
here and okay so we changed some sudden
like<00:05:11.380> procedural<00:05:12.100> animation<00:05:12.460> generation

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
like procedural animation generation

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.820 
like procedural animation generation
rules<00:05:13.480> from<00:05:13.690> our<00:05:13.870> tools<00:05:14.080> guys<00:05:14.320> we'd<00:05:14.590> be<00:05:14.650> like

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
rules from our tools guys we'd be like

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.350 
rules from our tools guys we'd be like
we<00:05:15.010> would<00:05:15.130> need<00:05:15.220> this<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.520> change<00:05:15.730> and<00:05:16.060> he'll

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
we would need this to change and he'll

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.850 
we would need this to change and he'll
think<00:05:16.510> about<00:05:16.840> it<00:05:16.990> he<00:05:17.110> was<00:05:17.200> like<00:05:17.260> all<00:05:17.530> right<00:05:17.560> so

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
think about it he was like all right so

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.790 
think about it he was like all right so
he'll<00:05:18.220> draw<00:05:18.400> he<00:05:18.880> has<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:19.180> crazy<00:05:19.800> complicated

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
he'll draw he has this crazy complicated

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.370 
he'll draw he has this crazy complicated
like<00:05:20.980> sheet<00:05:21.790> of<00:05:21.970> like<00:05:22.150> this<00:05:22.360> phony<00:05:22.630> matches<00:05:23.230> to

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
like sheet of like this phony matches to

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.650 
like sheet of like this phony matches to
this<00:05:23.530> mouth<00:05:23.800> shape<00:05:24.100> but<00:05:24.730> if<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:24.940> see<00:05:25.180> this

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
this mouth shape but if you see this

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.300 
this mouth shape but if you see this
phoneme<00:05:26.110> it'll<00:05:26.290> use<00:05:26.410> this<00:05:26.620> mouth<00:05:26.860> shape<00:05:27.130> but

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
phoneme it'll use this mouth shape but

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.740 
phoneme it'll use this mouth shape but
if<00:05:27.400> this<00:05:27.520> mouth<00:05:27.760> shape<00:05:28.000> was<00:05:28.150> right<00:05:28.330> before<00:05:28.480> it

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
if this mouth shape was right before it

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.960 
if this mouth shape was right before it
it'll<00:05:28.960> show<00:05:28.990> this<00:05:29.620> mouth<00:05:29.830> shape<00:05:30.040> instead<00:05:30.460> to

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
it'll show this mouth shape instead to

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.340 
it'll show this mouth shape instead to
kind<00:05:31.150> of<00:05:31.270> like<00:05:31.950> fake<00:05:32.950> as<00:05:33.190> quickly<00:05:33.580> as<00:05:33.760> possible

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
kind of like fake as quickly as possible

kind of like fake as quickly as possible
hand<00:05:35.350> kita<00:05:35.590> animation<00:05:36.160> I<00:05:36.310> went<00:05:36.640> into

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
hand kita animation I went into

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.580 
hand kita animation I went into
animation<00:05:37.270> because<00:05:37.330> that's<00:05:37.570> love<00:05:38.020> animation

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
animation because that's love animation

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.460 
animation because that's love animation
so<00:05:38.800> like<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.750> ability<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:41.140> go<00:05:41.440> through

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
so like the the ability to go through

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.830 
so like the the ability to go through
the<00:05:42.160> sequence<00:05:42.460> of<00:05:42.640> animation<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.300> watch<00:05:43.660> it

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
the sequence of animation and watch it

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.570 
the sequence of animation and watch it
and<00:05:43.990> enjoy<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.560> then<00:05:44.770> go<00:05:44.979> back<00:05:45.160> and<00:05:45.190> watch
