 the inscription on the mount freeman sends 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.900

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.810
 protracted creepy stories you should 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.810
 try pin die 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.940
 By the way, yes, here we will continue 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.940
 heartbeat marathon game 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.940
 scp-087 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.470
 scp-087 is a descent simulator 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.200
 the stairs yes you heard right in 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.330
 the original scp-087 we are about 10 minutes 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.070
 just go down in the dark for gloomy 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.560
 ladder listening to mysterious sounds 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.170

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.600
 apotheosis I will not leave you to try 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.050
 have fun with goat traction but victory 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.970
 about the fact that there is a remake of this horror 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.250
 scp-087 b and very interesting game with 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.800
 called scp containment breach and we 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.140
 walking through the scp organization complex 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:43.580
 and steam into various abnormal 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:45.470
 appearances in the face of friendly monsters in 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.840
 the game has a cool feature namely 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 eye blinking indicator in the fact 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.290
 that one of the friendly monsters 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.750
 remains motionless and if on him 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.880
 look worth turning away or blinking 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.640
 and you are a corpse that's really something 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.470
 original + game map every time 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.100
 generated in a new way pleasant 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.100
 blinking 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.159
 so that I once again did the top about the most 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.450
 scary games well nafig by the way yes 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:22.370
 third place with us 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:24.830
 slender indie horror slender based on 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.080
 Internet users' folklore 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.360
 thin man without a face dressed in 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.730
 funeral suit with his long arms 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.010
 love to kidnap children in the forest we play 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.829
 for police kate once again this 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.110
 case in the hands of a flashlight around the darkness of the forest 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.359
 sometimes coming across a truck with 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.269
 volvo emblems but superficially similar to 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:49.280
 Old Latvian Rafiki have no eyes 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.970
 This we learn in take here and begins 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.090
 dance 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.220
 the goal of the game is to collect 8 notes and of course 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.019
 avoid slender as much as you can 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.940
 armed then all you have to do is 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.980
 run away and in no case 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.709
 turn around by the way now 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:18.380
 I am not sitting in my cozy room either. 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:19.090
 I advise you to turn around in the second 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:27.229
 month 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:29.750
 interior game classic martian 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:34.030
 base something went wrong machine gun in hand 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.030
 devils attack perfectly 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.690
 the coolest thing about doom 3 in my opinion 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.729
 this is the beginning when nothing else 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.250
 happens but you know something will happen 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.020
 walk around the base you meet the staff 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.449
 you chat like that I liked in 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.490
 half-life and similar was in the area when 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.900
 we arrived a mental hospital but have not yet seen 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.900
 hell going on there 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.930
 in house 3 this is implemented wildly cool well 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.310
 and when the blockage comes, then yours is already there 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.350
 your gun is all 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.570
 and another flashlight which is in the first version 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.220
 the game was uncomfortable needed separately 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.040
 switch to it staying 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.900
 unarmed it fixed it I look 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.030
 a tear of nostalgia is back on yours 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.720
 to the eyes of mosquitoes what is the same time recycle 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.720
 doom 3 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.570
 noticed that the horror of the last years is almost 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.979
 always first person to me i'm nothing 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.410
 I don't mind but honestly 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.199
 fed up with the view from the eyes of the corridors 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.419
 video camera mobile as an option tired 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.729
 I miss the third person look like 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.009
 It was in the riza Kelly sound gil therefore 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.889
 really looking forward to coming in october stated in and 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.020
 daddy son resident evil shinji mikami 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.360
 judging by the trailers and gameplay video 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.199
 game like the old sand hill and and 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.300
 residents 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.850
 plus we see our protagonist and 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.220
 better feel his story looking at him 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.960
 emotions from the side and what horror waiting 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.960
 you come first 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.990
 outlast 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.390
 she sent him a letter to us in one 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.900
 psychiatric hospital over patients 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.360
 put cruel experiments we of course 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.120
 we are going to investigate this matter alone 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.910
 at night taking with you only a video camera 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.770
 all according to the laws of the genre well, and then full 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.770
 thrash and waste and dismemberment 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.910
 the game feature is our camcorder 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.010
 which can switch to mode 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.140
 night vision and reveals to us 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.060
 unseen in the darkness someone thoughtfully 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.070
 laid out the batteries for the camera all over 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.170
 the hospital therefore has nothing to worry 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:57.200
 unless you play high 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:59.450
 difficulty level the degree of green in 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.850
 outlast and perhaps the tallest sight 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.800
 some games youâ€™ll cut off two fingers 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.680
 drop all the content after that 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.540
 your stomach and in dlc weights blower you 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.640
 will want to cut off personal belongings with which 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.480
 You are added by going to the brothers 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.970
 jolly 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.260
 but in general the whole essence of autlast is 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.260
 here in this frame 

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:26.649
 such affairs were with you and him 

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:29.019
 no more subscribe to the channel 

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:33.129
