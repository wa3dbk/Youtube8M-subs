00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.750
 here 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.720
 there is no more Galician dessert than pineapples 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.490
 but what we are going to do is the most 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.260
 big and the greediest that is the 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.350
 affinity of milk we have a liter of 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.350
 milk 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.280
 4 eggs 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.609
 a touch of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.960
 a pinch of salt and flour in this case 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.189
 about 200 grams and we're going to fail you can 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.750
 add a little bit of a touch of cinnamon 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.750
 a little vanilla 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.480
 and avoid getting to the target that if not 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.950
 it's going to make us bitter, and we do what 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.580
 same with the orange 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.220
 speakers of let's say all the 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.320
 ingredients together but that are given to 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.660
 know now is to beat with a little bit and 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.550
 then vice rising without there being any 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.000
 group you can do it with the blender 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.000
 as well 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.730
 you see we have thick cream what 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.590
 we have to do now is leave it 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.020
 rest a half hour better in cold 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.390
 Spend in the fridge will be all many 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 thank you very well as you can see it has already happened 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.380
 half hour of rest that we are going to do 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.510
 with these curious we are going to do two or 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.610
 three so you can see the step by step and 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.900
 then fill in some of what 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.020
 you want from the one who likes the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.910
 chocolate cream skimmed honey 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.040
 what you earn what you like the most 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.660
 here we are going to do simple with a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.910
 little bit of candy and we're going to 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.770
 crystallize with a torch because 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.760
 we have set at maximum temperature to 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.890
 our figueira 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.229
 let's open a few drops of oil and 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.659
 our cream that you see is fine 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.200
 thick 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.100
 the perfect mass we had a ladle 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.100
 here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.740
 a spoonful enough to put it 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.200
 all over the surface we will cover 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.969
 those places where it has remained hollow and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.689
 you see that it is already on what to turn around 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.689
 with the fork 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.870
 is that it is separating by the sides and 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.290
 once it starts to take off 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.290
 we turn around 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.980
 we would have already done what we did 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.800
 how it goes here well is almost done already 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.800
 we would have irak and pass it to the plate 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.280
 we have our facts 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.290
 we leave them here and I'll show you how 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.650
 Place 1 freshly made that is like more 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:59.549
 like we put a little sugar and 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:01.409
 we make a handkerchief watching and we put them 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.290
 so that they look nice we're going to 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.420
 do now it's caramelize for it 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.159
 we add above and so in a way 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.159
 generous and a blowtorch that this is there in 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.420
 all retained or stores and it would be 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.420
 form a kind of candy 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.080
 and we finish 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 here you have the pancakes I'm going to try 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.010
 how it crunches 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.190
 good
