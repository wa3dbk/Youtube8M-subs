now<00:02:10.479> let's<00:02:10.719> suppose<00:02:11.019> I<00:02:11.260> wanted<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.739> more

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
now let's suppose I wanted a more

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.520 
now let's suppose I wanted a more
interesting<00:02:12.280> grid<00:02:12.760> arrangement<00:02:13.359> with<00:02:14.349> any

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
interesting grid arrangement with any

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.319 
interesting grid arrangement with any
other<00:02:14.769> plugin<00:02:15.219> I'd<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.790> start<00:02:16.090> again

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
other plugin I'd have to start again

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.869 
other plugin I'd have to start again
with<00:02:16.390> new<00:02:16.900> versions<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.439> the<00:02:17.560> effect<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.640> with

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
with new versions of the effect but with

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.179 
with new versions of the effect but with
Auto<00:02:19.150> split<00:02:19.540> all<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.870> have<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.469> do<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.859> make<00:02:21.159> a

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
Auto split all I have to do is make a

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.240 
Auto split all I have to do is make a
few<00:02:21.519> quick<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:22.090> easy<00:02:22.420> adjustments<00:02:23.109> and<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.950> no

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
few quick and easy adjustments and in no

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.099 
few quick and easy adjustments and in no
time<00:02:24.519> at<00:02:24.670> all<00:02:24.819> I've<00:02:25.090> got<00:02:25.689> something

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
time at all I've got something

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:33.340 
time at all I've got something
completely<00:02:26.950> different

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.870 

one<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> great<00:02:34.770> features<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.160> Auto<00:02:35.490> split

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
one of the great features of Auto split

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.030 
one of the great features of Auto split
is<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.660> there's<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.990> box<00:02:37.290> shape<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.860> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
is that if there's a box shape that you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.550 
is that if there's a box shape that you
use<00:02:38.250> frequently<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.630> use<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.020> presets

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
use frequently you can use the presets

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.450 
use frequently you can use the presets
loader<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.310> save<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.760> off<00:02:41.910> for<00:02:42.270> later<00:02:42.450> use<00:02:43.460> okay

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
loader to save it off for later use okay

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.090 
loader to save it off for later use okay
now<00:02:44.850> for<00:02:44.910> some<00:02:45.270> animation<00:02:45.990> here's<00:02:46.770> where<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
now for some animation here's where the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.460 
now for some animation here's where the
real<00:02:47.340> power<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.730> Auto<00:02:48.180> split<00:02:48.540> comes<00:02:48.870> into<00:02:49.170> play

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
real power of Auto split comes into play

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.280 
real power of Auto split comes into play
because<00:02:50.160> all<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.060> do<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.480> select<00:02:51.930> an

because all you have to do is select an
arrive<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.920> depart<00:02:53.310> option<00:02:53.940> from<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> pop-up

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.130 
arrive and depart option from the pop-up
menus<00:02:55.530> meaning<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.640> can<00:02:56.820> instantly<00:02:57.330> add<00:02:57.720> or

menus meaning you can instantly add or
change<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.980> animation<00:02:59.340> without<00:03:00.270> having<00:03:00.600> to

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
change in animation without having to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.980 
change in animation without having to
think<00:03:00.900> about<00:03:01.110> key<00:03:01.590> framing<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:03.600> can<00:03:03.780> have

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
think about key framing and you can have

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.670 
think about key framing and you can have
any<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.440> your<00:03:04.650> boxes<00:03:05.130> fade<00:03:05.520> in<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.000> or<00:03:06.510> out<00:03:06.930> by

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
any of your boxes fade in and or out by

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.150 
any of your boxes fade in and or out by
checking<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.370> fade<00:03:08.790> options<00:03:09.920> setting<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:11.040> a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
checking the fade options setting up a

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.510 
checking the fade options setting up a
complex<00:03:11.640> animation<00:03:12.300> couldn't<00:03:12.900> be<00:03:13.050> simpler

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.160 

now<00:03:17.520> let's<00:03:17.790> take<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> quick<00:03:18.360> look<00:03:18.600> at<00:03:18.810> Auto

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
now let's take a quick look at Auto

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.650 
now let's take a quick look at Auto
split<00:03:19.620> extended<00:03:20.370> which<00:03:20.880> gives<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.300> wide

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
split extended which gives you a wide

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.930 
split extended which gives you a wide
range<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.140> custom<00:03:22.620> shapes<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.400> making<00:03:23.730> some

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
range of custom shapes for making some

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.720 
range of custom shapes for making some
really<00:03:24.360> great<00:03:24.690> looking<00:03:25.050> split<00:03:25.470> screens<00:03:25.830> I'll

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
really great looking split screens I'll

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.090 
really great looking split screens I'll
apply<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.360> effect<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> my<00:03:28.020> clip<00:03:28.320> which<00:03:28.860> gives

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
apply the effect to my clip which gives

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.699 
apply the effect to my clip which gives
me<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.490> default<00:03:30.060> shape<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.200> can<00:03:31.410> easily

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
me this default shape but I can easily

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.710 
me this default shape but I can easily
go<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.100> shape<00:03:32.490> selection<00:03:33.120> menu<00:03:33.510> and

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
go to the shape selection menu and

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.890 
go to the shape selection menu and
choose<00:03:34.410> from<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.890> wide<00:03:35.250> range<00:03:35.580> of<00:03:35.700> options

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.740 

I'll<00:03:40.590> then<00:03:41.220> fill<00:03:41.519> in<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.790> grid<00:03:42.030> using<00:03:42.420> the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
I'll then fill in the grid using the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.039 
I'll then fill in the grid using the
appropriate<00:03:43.080> shapes<00:03:44.299> which<00:03:45.299> I'll<00:03:45.510> flip<00:03:45.840> and

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
appropriate shapes which I'll flip and

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.339 
appropriate shapes which I'll flip and
flop<00:03:46.500> as<00:03:46.709> necessary<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:48.090> make<00:03:48.330> them<00:03:48.540> fit<00:03:48.810> the
