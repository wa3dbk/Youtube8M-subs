00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.890

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.070

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.580
 Welcome 80,000 times a day is the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.440
 not great 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.210
 this was probably not by nancy crafter 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.369
 menzi crafter does not know that 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.020
 pronounce covered and this day is 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.700
 the minecraft will take these questions 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.590
 Of course, I do not even theirs 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.870
 answer or so are of course all 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.030
 meant seriously and I would say so 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.590
 We do not start right away either 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.720
 in the background only in the innerkrems 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.949
 either in front of me or from suri 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.260
 i think i have no search 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.629
 I do not know when I have to look up 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.809
 every case as first question as you are old 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.059
 you 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.860
 what has that got to do with minecraft 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.070
 nothing strong in this main too 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.350
 lose or be lost do so 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.330
 Secondly, the question is proven 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.199
 michael summer on a scale from 0 to 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.690
 10 80 13 million 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.510
 3 how did you come to minecraft? 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.049
 the same fourth since which version 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:15.820
 play to minecraft 10 beta 3 million 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.710
 5 what else should you call block i 6 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.990
 why did you start with lÃ¤tz place 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.110
 he is very clear because I have money 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:28.030
 If you wanted 717 last place no 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.039
 Of course not, of course I am the one 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.710
 only the boss is yes and that's why 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.600
 You can only look at me but me 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.259
 of course the hottest displays makes 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.390
 Eighth, what do you think of the singleplayer 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.280
 singleplayer first boss because known 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.229
 always meeting friends and so on 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.789
 is load access to house build and 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.189
 so well what is dangerous place 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.810
 or change does not mean either 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.460
 me, of course, what do you want ? 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.549
 place or an endermann against mine 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.310
 colossal oversized cavernous body 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.140
 yes, nothing at all works out 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.570
 trouble for the life passing tenth what 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.149
 with better pumpkin or normal cake 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.790
 your month would have 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.140
 do you know us agent privately no idea 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.490
 how that is 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.230
 I know the private around 12 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.420
 many people you know privately the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.020
 play minecraft 10 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.340
 3 10 13 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.230
 what is most important in minecraft yourself 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.810
 from soya 14 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.840
 do you like to have to if not why not 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.700
 if yes why and which I'm sorry 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.220
 that ask me too many at once 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.620
 yes that was the whole day I have people 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.200
 said the questions are not 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.180
 I would say ironically 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.160
 This week will probably be 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.510
 a day video come know these questions 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
 I still do not know if I do not the office 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.550
 I'll answer that's how it works 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.989
 not so good but yes until then 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.069
 a good bridge, of course 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.630
 because I have no project at the moment 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.090
 but then work again project 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.060
 hopefully and then there will be again 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.620
 less text why so shit yes 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.940
 no idea people if you like it 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.700
 is a rating as I expect 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.680
 at least 100000 likes of you and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.959
 10,000 comments as the least 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:24.100
 if you can not do it, then yes, exactly 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.140
 and the other one knows so well 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.049
 if that does not work then yes 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.049
 Hope I hope you liked it and 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.170
 Yes
