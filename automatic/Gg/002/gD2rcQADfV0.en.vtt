00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.370
 very good keepers who are so welcome to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.259
 everyone in this video tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.589
 explain how to improve performance 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.619
 of the sims 3 good first thing 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.900
 we have to do is go to start my 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.630
 electronic arts documents 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.849
 the sims 3 here we will appear a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.189
 bunch of files and folders engine 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.400
 the folders that end in cache point 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.699
 bakaye we eliminate them all ok this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.409
 these files appear to us whenever 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.870
 we start the game and they stay saved 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.250
 in this folder you can delete it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.140
 How many times do you want it does not happen 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.989
 nothing but now us and also 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.329
 sorry in the screenshot folder that are 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.010
 the images that we took in the jb the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.989
 eliminates is because we are quite lage 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 in the game and not long ago it does not 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.010
 nothing is missing or the fourth and another folder 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.289
 but here it eliminates them, it's worth 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 let's go back and escape 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.859
 the file that is inside the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.649
 folders of that backup and that cache 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.629
 never but you will never receive them because 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 they are very important files for the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.430
 game and it can give you problems and the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.360
 criminals then we were here what 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.660
 next we have to do 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.140
 is to go for the control ok system and 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.760
 security system and here on the left 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.370
 says configuration to system bag 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.530
 first of all to do before doing 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.770
 this is going to explain why this happens 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.630
 windows threw program that is for the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.479
 security of the games then this 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.190
 program is quite detrimental to 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.840
 the sims 3 because it was not fabric 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.540
 so now I'm going to explain to you 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.890
 remove it once done what I told you 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.090
 that would be for the control if I had 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.830
 security system and to the left 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.479
 advanced system configuration 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.090
 we have to give performance 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.280
 configuration 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.619
 we give the little eye is up 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.740
 which says prevention of execution of 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.569
 data here will leave you marked this 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.149
 box is ok but we do not have to 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.189
 uncheck and put this active art to 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.619
 all programs and services except 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.259
 those who choose ok here what 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.840
 we have to do is give it to add and 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.119
 pink the folder to the system sorry 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.580
 program files ok 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.319
 electronic arts and these are the games 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.840
 that you have installed I have for 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.150
 example the sims 3 small family and the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.849
 to fall the night in each one we have that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.700
 looking for the exe file would be the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.099
 industrial for example that I saw and the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.940
 exe file that would be east west or 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.860
 we give it to open we continue and we go to 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.829
 back again let's give the same with the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.680
 next games we give to this gay vi 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.829
 in file mute xx this and so we continue 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.480
 with all once done done this if not 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.239
 you have marked almost to the marks 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.599
 let's apply and accept and until this 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.579
 program is not going to annoy the bad 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.810
 gaming experience now the following 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.780
 what we have to do is 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.800
 pink the short game here and I tell you now 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.770
 what we have to do in the game 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.270
 we say now good guys 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.860
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.140
 go to the game 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.090
 it does not matter if it is within a family or 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.370
 outside we have to give him the three 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.430
 dots open options 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.489
 ok we give options once here 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.550
 where it says graphics if you have your 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.830
 computer that is a bit powerful what 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.750
 do you put in the lowest quality I 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.450
 I have it with this one and the truth is that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.670
 pretty good ok ok from the game 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.049
 complete here tells us to activate the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.120
 hiding objects 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.220
 You can leave this as you want to me 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.220
 it gives me exactly the same and the truth this 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.319
 nothing happens reflections quality 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.700
 this is for the reflections of the dose in 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.830
 the water I put to I want because 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.769
 not interest me much is the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.810
 edge softening is for the edges 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.280
 of the houses I think that and all that I 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.230
 I give little underneath because it does not interest 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.780
 pretty visual effects I put it in 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.360
 half because it's not a thing that I 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.650
 I noticed too much lighting and shadows 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.569
 you put it also in the middle but also 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.519
 you can put the bass very low 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.859
 detail of trees and that has the place 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.540
 here butt is very high but I put it 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.790
 always on bass because I'm not interested 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.579
 do not see the trees either because 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.469
 nonsense trace distance down low 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.450
 high detail solar also under 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.200
 all detail medium textures and details 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.180
 to say art 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.609
 and this would basically be about the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.340
 graphics I have it like that if you want 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.620
 copy leave them a little while and cut the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.800
 video I do not know but well I'll leave it 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.720
 been fluid does not leave me with anything of irak and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.720
 Well, I'll leave that for a little while 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.590
 I think it far ok now 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.479
 we have to go to general adjustments and what 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.310
 what we have to do is self-displace 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.370
 to the parameters but if you have 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.749
 problems because you wake up here I'm going 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.969
 to leave marked what to activate 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:48.219
 reminder notification this please 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.279
 it deactivates it is because the truth that is 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:53.590
 a shit that she did and good what 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:56.169
 you remove because I know so much that in the neighborhood 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.539
 and everything piles up because I do not know one 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.099
 pretty weird question here throw a lot 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.870
 Store time you can feel it if 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.639
 want and activate lessons too what 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.669
 I have already deactivated because I do not like 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.300
 no I do not speculate facebook or anything 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.860
 that but good 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.629
 ok ok I think that's how it's worth 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.190
 also low in the quality of the catch 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:19.639
 of the video in case you want to download it because 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.000
 if you want to record forgiveness and good 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.220
 Well basically that's not 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.440
 and that's it, then we're going to apply 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.290
 changes and I think we already have the game 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.240
 without the sandy and bbva well so like 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.730
 guys I hope you help has helped 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.960
 sorry very much this video already 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.170
 you know that everything you have in the 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.760
 description and good see you in another 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.760
 goodbye video guys
