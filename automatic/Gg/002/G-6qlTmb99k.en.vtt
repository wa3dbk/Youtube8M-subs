oh<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.060> know<00:02:15.209> what<00:02:15.590> if<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.680> move<00:02:17.099> had

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
oh and you know what if that move had

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.869 
oh and you know what if that move had

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.000 
think he would have won it
I<00:02:25.520> think<00:02:26.330> he<00:02:26.420> would<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:26.630> won<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.770> think

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
I think he would have won it and I think

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.040 
I think he would have won it and I think
he<00:02:28.130> knows<00:02:28.310> he<00:02:28.490> would<00:02:28.640> have<00:02:28.730> won<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.780> that's

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
he knows he would have won it and that's

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.800 
he knows he would have won it and that's
why<00:02:30.260> he's<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:30.620> upset
