00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
kind of came up with the idea to make my

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.499 
kind of came up with the idea to make my
own<00:01:37.290> filter<00:01:37.829> cartridge<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> pretty

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
own filter cartridge and so you pretty

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.359 
own filter cartridge and so you pretty
much<00:01:39.630> cut<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.049> sponge<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> size<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.310> your

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
much cut the sponge to the size of your

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.810 
much cut the sponge to the size of your
filter<00:01:42.200> super<00:01:43.200> easy<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.610> can

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
filter super easy to do and you can

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.319 
filter super easy to do and you can
reuse<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:47.040> lasts<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> pretty

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
reuse this and it lasts for a pretty

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.539 
reuse this and it lasts for a pretty
long<00:01:48.479> time<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:50.070> don't<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> keep

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
long time so you don't have to keep

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340 
long time so you don't have to keep
switching<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> out<00:01:51.180> although<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
