00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:10.019
 to make this banner so with 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.380
 needles three and a half we will go up 60 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.380
 miles 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.680
 then we will make the first row 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.680
 so knitting says maya place 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.960
 this 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.570
 and then we're going to do this mesh to 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.600
 the back side and in fact we're going to do 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:58.879
 so under the so says says mesh to 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:01:01.850
 the place is said mesh upside down and 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.489
 so we figured on Tuesday mesh to 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 backwards and we will start again 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.810
 so to every rock by image in 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.640
 image rights antwerp up to the office 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.399
 just have until we have the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.399
 height I wanted when one has 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.289
 reaches the required size 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.130
 so in fact to do that measure you 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.860
 as and when around the head 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.750
 we will stop the stitches so in 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.750
 knitting the very place 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.840
 dad 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.950
 so when our band is over 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.950
 we will go back 10 miles 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.510
 then we're going to do so a strip of 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:18.019
 jersey so by making a rank to 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.019
 the place 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.670
 then a row upside down so we will repeat 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:38.690
 always it's from oran for 6 cm so 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.690
 a rank at the place a world upside down 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:49.040
 so when we did another 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.040
 bank of 6 cm we will stop the stitches 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.060
 so now we have more than 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.150
 do the assembly so in a first 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.780
 time we're going to sew the little band so 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.590
 on the wrong side we will put it back 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.510
 to be able to slip without galley 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.180
 then we are going to sew the big 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.180
 bandeau across the width 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.830
 so here's how to get this headband 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.700
 once he is sewn so with a 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.590
 effect three new points of tar 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.500
 so in much bigger traits very 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.430
 simple and very quick to realize it takes 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.430
 less than a ball
