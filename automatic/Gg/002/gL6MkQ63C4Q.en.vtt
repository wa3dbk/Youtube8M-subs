cool<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.799> all<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.189> an<00:01:48.310> assumption<00:01:48.700> but

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
cool this is all just an assumption but

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.109 
cool this is all just an assumption but
it's<00:01:49.179> really<00:01:49.750> pretty<00:01:49.960> much<00:01:50.200> out<00:01:50.439> there<00:01:50.469> that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
your own rules imagine taking that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.990 
your own rules imagine taking that
concept<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:15.550> having<00:03:16.170> them<00:03:17.370> being<00:03:18.370> controlled

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
concept and having them being controlled

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.310 
concept and having them being controlled
by<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:21.720> now<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.780> question<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.800> is<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:25.360> just<00:03:26.020> a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
by that now the question is is it just a

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.440 
by that now the question is is it just a
really<00:03:27.250> cool<00:03:27.550> mix<00:03:28.620> attracted<00:03:29.620> or<00:03:30.270> is<00:03:31.270> it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
really cool mix attracted or is it

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.530 
really cool mix attracted or is it
actually<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.550> action<00:03:33.940> figures<00:03:34.270> were

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
actually like the action figures were

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.070 
actually like the action figures were
alive<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:36.610> know<00:03:36.760> what<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:36.940> mean<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.360> don't

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
alive you know what I mean I don't

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.400 
alive you know what I mean I don't
necessarily<00:03:38.980> think<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.550> it<00:03:40.180> was<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.080> her<00:03:41.260> in

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
necessarily think so it was on her in

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.200 
necessarily think so it was on her in
her<00:03:41.620> in<00:03:41.890> her<00:03:41.950> money<00:03:42.460> you<00:03:42.790> see<00:03:42.970> what<00:03:43.090> I'm<00:03:43.180> saying

her in her money you see what I'm saying
I<00:03:43.720> think<00:03:43.780> that's<00:03:44.230> what<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.620> all<00:03:44.770> was

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
I think that's what it all was

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.730 
I think that's what it all was
everything<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.360> we<00:03:46.570> did<00:03:46.990> was<00:03:47.950> in<00:03:48.250> her<00:03:48.550> mug

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
everything that we did was in her mug

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.760 
everything that we did was in her mug
part<00:03:50.740> of<00:03:50.980> her<00:03:51.130> father<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.690> know<00:03:52.810> was<00:03:53.380> in<00:03:53.590> that

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
part of her father you know was in that

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.110 
part of her father you know was in that
story<00:03:54.190> dr.<00:03:54.970> Richtofen<00:03:55.330> was<00:03:55.900> in<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.290> story<00:03:57.120> so

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
story dr. Richtofen was in that story so

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.300 
story dr. Richtofen was in that story so
we<00:03:58.480> can<00:03:58.660> only<00:03:58.780> assume<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.590> this<00:03:59.710> was<00:03:59.860> all<00:04:00.100> in

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
we can only assume that this was all in

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.610 
we can only assume that this was all in
