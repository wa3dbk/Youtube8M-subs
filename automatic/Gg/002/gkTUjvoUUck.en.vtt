00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
first off we have this set of MSR

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.849 
first off we have this set of MSR
Evolution<00:00:18.060> handguards<00:00:18.570> now<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.199> ordered<00:00:19.710> these

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
Evolution handguards now I ordered these

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.700 
Evolution handguards now I ordered these
originally<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> set<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.359> MSR<00:00:21.900> handlebars

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
originally with a set of MSR handlebars

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.070 
originally with a set of MSR handlebars
but<00:00:22.830> they're<00:00:23.460> not<00:00:23.550> designed<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> fit<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.630> MSR

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
but they're not designed to fit the MSR

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.290 
but they're not designed to fit the MSR
handlebars<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.430> went<00:00:26.609> back<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> rental

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
handlebars so we went back to the rental

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.660 
handlebars so we went back to the rental
bars<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.619> fit<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> I'm<00:00:29.429> really

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
bars and now these fit and I'm really

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.220 
bars and now these fit and I'm really
glad<00:00:29.849> because<00:00:30.150> these<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.779> actually<00:00:31.109> become

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
glad because these have actually become

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
glad because these have actually become
one<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.769> favorite<00:00:32.309> hand<00:00:32.669> guards<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.120> I'm<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
one of my favorite hand guards and I'm a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.660 
one of my favorite hand guards and I'm a
handguard<00:00:33.719> snob<00:00:34.190> basically<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> mounting

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
handguard snob basically the mounting

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.450 
handguard snob basically the mounting
system<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:37.260> solid<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.280> has<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
system is really really solid it has a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
system is really really solid it has a
certain<00:00:38.790> contour<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.600> which<00:00:39.809> allows<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
certain contour to it which allows it to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.910 
certain contour to it which allows it to
get<00:00:40.920> around<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:42.239> cables<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.590> allows<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
get around your cables and it allows you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.740 
get around your cables and it allows you
to<00:00:44.040> position<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.579> where<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.239> need<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
to position it where you need it to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500 
to position it where you need it to
guard<00:00:46.410> against<00:00:46.620> brush<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.340> crashing<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.300> bar

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
guard against brush and crashing the bar

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
guard against brush and crashing the bar
clamp<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.989> contoured<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.129> also<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.579> drilled<00:00:51.000> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
clamp is contoured it also is drilled so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
clamp is contoured it also is drilled so
it's<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.660> bit<00:00:51.840> lighter<00:00:52.129> all-around

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it's a little bit lighter all-around

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's a little bit lighter all-around
it's<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> really<00:00:53.610> well<00:00:53.820> designed<00:00:54.000> piece<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
it's a really well designed piece and I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
it's a really well designed piece and I
will<00:00:55.350> definitely<00:00:55.649> order<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> future

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
will definitely order more in the future

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
will definitely order more in the future
couple<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> features<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.739> these

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
couple of features I like about these

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.459 
couple of features I like about these
hand<00:00:59.430> guards<00:00:59.760> first<00:01:00.359> off<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.930> doesn't<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
dip in it with a lot of guys kind of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.640 
dip in it with a lot of guys kind of
freak<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.629> about<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:04.500> wanna

get your hand trapped if you go over the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060 
get your hand trapped if you go over the
bars<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.900> you're<00:01:07.020> coming<00:01:07.320> into<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.560> crashing

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
bars or if you're coming into a crashing

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.910 
bars or if you're coming into a crashing
situation<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.299> these<00:01:10.020> bars<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> really

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
situation but these bars have a really

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
situation but these bars have a really
nice<00:01:11.070> bevel<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.700> them<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.299> helps<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> get

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
nice bevel on them that helps you get

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.390 
nice bevel on them that helps you get
your<00:01:13.049> hand<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.740> without<00:01:13.950> having<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
your hand in and out without having to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
your hand in and out without having to
rub<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> sharp<00:01:15.360> corner<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.920> little

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
rub on a sharp corner it's just a little

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.590 
rub on a sharp corner it's just a little
bit<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.369> comfortable<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> rider<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> it's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
bit more comfortable as a rider and it's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.210 
bit more comfortable as a rider and it's
actually<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.110> bit<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> safety<00:01:19.650> factor

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
actually a little bit of a safety factor

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.649 
actually a little bit of a safety factor
considering<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> straight<00:01:21.450> bar

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
considering that it's a straight bar

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.440 
considering that it's a straight bar
secondly<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.070> aluminum<00:01:23.549> itself<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> black

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
secondly the aluminum itself is black

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
secondly the aluminum itself is black
which<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> stylistic

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
which I really like it's a stylistic

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.370 
which I really like it's a stylistic
thing<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> looks<00:01:27.900> sharp

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
thing and it looks sharp

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.530 
thing and it looks sharp
third<00:01:29.040> thing<00:01:29.280> about<00:01:29.490> these<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.360> hand

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
third thing about these is the hand

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020 
third thing about these is the hand
guards<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.170> actual<00:01:31.619> plastic<00:01:32.100> brush<00:01:32.700> guards

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
guards the actual plastic brush guards

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
guards the actual plastic brush guards
one<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> things<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.650> included<00:01:35.100> with

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
one of the things that was included with

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.100 
one of the things that was included with
the<00:01:35.280> instructions<00:01:35.850> was<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> tip<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.630> put<00:01:36.869> some

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the instructions was a tip to put some

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
the instructions was a tip to put some
silicone<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.340> channel<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.850> fits<00:01:39.270> over

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
silicone in the channel that fits over

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.109 
silicone in the channel that fits over
the<00:01:39.600> aluminum<00:01:40.170> guard<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.460> makes<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> super

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the aluminum guard it makes it super

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.240 
the aluminum guard it makes it super
tight<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.899> bolts<00:01:43.229> don't<00:01:43.409> back<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.920> due<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
tight the bolts don't back out due to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.190 
tight the bolts don't back out due to
vibration<00:01:44.909> there's<00:01:45.420> no<00:01:45.600> noise<00:01:45.810> due<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
vibration there's no noise due to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
vibration there's no noise due to
vibration<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.640> little<00:01:47.850> trick<00:01:48.060> I'm

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
vibration that's a little trick I'm

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
vibration that's a little trick I'm
going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.450> use<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.290> my<00:01:49.350> hand<00:01:49.740> guards<00:01:50.040> from

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
going to use on all my hand guards from

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.310 
going to use on all my hand guards from
now<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.970> MSR<00:01:51.360> brand<00:01:51.659> in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
now on not just the MSR brand in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.840 
now on not just the MSR brand in
addition<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> protection<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.369> also<00:01:53.579> did<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
addition to the protection I also did a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.010 
addition to the protection I also did a
little<00:01:53.970> bit<00:01:54.149> more<00:01:54.360> tweaking<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
little bit more tweaking with the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.560 
little bit more tweaking with the
carburetor<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.310> let's<00:01:56.490> check<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:56.880> one

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
carburetor so let's check that out one

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.940 
carburetor so let's check that out one
of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> things<00:01:57.899> about<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> 250x

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
of the things about the 250x

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.499 
of the things about the 250x
is<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.340> not<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.700> cleanest<00:02:00.180> running

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
is that it's not the cleanest running

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
is that it's not the cleanest running
motorcycle<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.560> jetting<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> little<00:02:02.219> off

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
motorcycle the jetting is a little off

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.789 
motorcycle the jetting is a little off
had<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> lot<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.420> smog<00:02:03.719> equipment<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.380> we've

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
had a lot of smog equipment on it we've

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.770 
had a lot of smog equipment on it we've
continued<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.549> try<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> improve<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> we've

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
continued to try to improve it and we've

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.990 
continued to try to improve it and we've
done<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.110> by<00:02:07.259> adding<00:02:07.469> an<00:02:07.860> adjustable<00:02:08.759> fuel

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
done that by adding an adjustable fuel

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.240 
done that by adding an adjustable fuel
mixture<00:02:09.479> screw<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.170> another<00:02:10.410> MSR<00:02:10.950> part

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
mixture screw this is another MSR part

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.160 
mixture screw this is another MSR part
that<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.459> got<00:02:11.610> from<00:02:11.700> their<00:02:11.879> catalog<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.540> base

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
that we got from their catalog and base

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.170 
that we got from their catalog and base
what<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.740> does<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.459> allows<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
what that does is it allows you to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.479 
what that does is it allows you to
actually<00:02:15.720> get<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.740> adjust<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.340> fuel

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
actually get to and adjust the fuel

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.920 
actually get to and adjust the fuel
mixture<00:02:17.880> while<00:02:18.360> you're<00:02:18.510> out<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> trail

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
mixture while you're out on the trail

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.350 
mixture while you're out on the trail
what<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.739> found<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.880> does<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.209> really

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
what we found is that it does a really

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.080 
what we found is that it does a really
good<00:02:21.780> job<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.020> actually<00:02:22.920> tuning<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> bike<00:02:23.459> one

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
good job of actually tuning the bike one

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.640 
good job of actually tuning the bike one
thing<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.360> did<00:02:24.510> notice<00:02:24.720> though<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
thing I did notice though is that it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.260 
thing I did notice though is that it
sort<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.040> created<00:02:26.489> an<00:02:26.670> issue<00:02:26.790> with<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
sort of created an issue with the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.390 
sort of created an issue with the
mid-range<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.989> it's<00:02:28.230> still<00:02:28.500> not<00:02:28.680> perfect<00:02:29.010> but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
mid-range so it's still not perfect but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.370 
mid-range so it's still not perfect but
definitely<00:02:30.300> having<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.750> there<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.140> nice

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
definitely having it on there is nice

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.949 
definitely having it on there is nice
because<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.860> allows<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.640> opportunity<00:02:32.959> to

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
because it allows you the opportunity to

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.660 
because it allows you the opportunity to
at<00:02:34.170> least<00:02:34.319> get<00:02:34.560> your<00:02:34.620> fingers<00:02:35.069> on<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.430> thing

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
at least get your fingers on that thing

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.180 
at least get your fingers on that thing
and<00:02:35.880> start<00:02:36.060> tinkering<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:37.040> pretty<00:02:38.040> much

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
and start tinkering with it pretty much

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.190 
and start tinkering with it pretty much
