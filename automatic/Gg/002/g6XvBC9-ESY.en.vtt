your handheld gaming and really not not
move<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.479> head<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.799> did<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.220> an

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
move my head and then you did get an

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.060 
move my head and then you did get an
effect<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> was<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.330> fact<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.930> i<00:01:22.200> felt<00:01:22.979> i

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
effect but it was in fact that i felt i

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.420 
effect but it was in fact that i felt i
was<00:01:23.100> also<00:01:23.340> kind<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> fighting<00:01:23.939> through<00:01:24.360> yeah

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
was also kind of fighting through yeah

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.260 
was also kind of fighting through yeah
definitely<00:01:26.430> doesn't<00:01:26.580> enhance<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
definitely doesn't enhance the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.179 
definitely doesn't enhance the
experience<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.229> also<00:01:28.350> seems<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> add<00:01:28.979> at

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
experience but it also seems to add at

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.010 
experience but it also seems to add at
least<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.400> mental<00:01:29.759> complication<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
least a mental complication that it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
least a mental complication that it
really<00:01:31.229> does<00:01:31.380> doesn't<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> yeah<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.520> like

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
really does doesn't it yeah it's like

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.890 
really does doesn't it yeah it's like
you're<00:01:32.790> trying<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> play<00:01:33.119> brain<00:01:33.390> age<00:01:33.420> while

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you're trying to play brain age while

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.350 
you're trying to play brain age while
your<00:01:34.290> brain<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.680> being<00:01:34.799> rewired<00:01:35.189> yeah<00:01:35.670> cuz<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
your brain is being rewired yeah cuz it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.969 
your brain is being rewired yeah cuz it
for<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> moment<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.439> clicks<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
for there a moment when it clicks in it

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
for there a moment when it clicks in it
looks<00:01:38.100> good<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.090> there's<00:01:39.270> any<00:01:39.479> sort

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
looks good and then if there's any sort

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.210 
looks good and then if there's any sort
of<00:01:39.810> movement<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.229> sort<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
of movement it sort of is is that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
of movement it sort of is is that
tracking<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.880> becomes<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.180> bird<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.540> yeah

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
tracking and it becomes a bird but yeah

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
tracking and it becomes a bird but yeah
I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.950> other<00:01:44.100> part<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.579> whether<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I think the other part of whether it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.010 
I think the other part of whether it
works<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.930> something

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
works or not because this is something

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.210 
works or not because this is something
that<00:01:46.140> may<00:01:46.290> improve<00:01:46.470> over<00:01:46.710> time<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:47.070> other

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
that may improve over time with other

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.460 
that may improve over time with other
software<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:48.360> doesn't<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.049> yet<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
software it doesn't I have yet to see a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.170 
software it doesn't I have yet to see a
game<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.009> lauren<00:01:50.280> July<00:01:50.430> night<00:01:50.610> where<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
game in this lauren July night where it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.149 
game in this lauren July night where it
brings<00:01:51.540> anything<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> experience<00:01:52.799> other

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
brings anything to the experience other

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.340 
brings anything to the experience other
than<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.520> initial<00:01:54.000> sort<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.299> wow<00:01:54.570> factor<00:01:54.600> now

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
than that initial sort of wow factor now

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.690 
than that initial sort of wow factor now
one<00:01:55.619> thing<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:55.979> enjoyed<00:01:56.369> though<00:01:56.520> with

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
one thing I really enjoyed though with

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.819 
one thing I really enjoyed though with
the<00:01:56.729> alternate<00:01:57.210> reality<00:01:57.600> mini-games<00:01:57.990> yeah<00:01:58.619> I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the alternate reality mini-games yeah I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.350 
the alternate reality mini-games yeah I
thought<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.280> cool<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> shows<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
thought that was cool it shows that the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.700 
thought that was cool it shows that the
system<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.869> least<00:02:00.990> capable<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.500> something

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
system is at least capable of something

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.230 
system is at least capable of something
more<00:02:02.009> than<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.490> sort<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.729> 3d<00:02:03.030> half

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
more than just the sort of 3d half

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.700 
more than just the sort of 3d half
you're<00:02:03.450> right<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.750> what's<00:02:04.500> happening

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you're right you know what's happening

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.749 
you're right you know what's happening
there<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.159> you're<00:02:05.310> kind<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.549> looking

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
there it's like you're kind of looking

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.760 
there it's like you're kind of looking
through<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> camera<00:02:07.259> at<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.530> real

through it with the camera at the real
world<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.310> subtly<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> creates<00:02:09.330> 3d<00:02:09.660> images<00:02:10.020> in

comes<00:02:18.299> in<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.200> system<00:02:19.829> so<00:02:20.430> come<00:02:20.670> pretty

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
comes in with the system so come pretty

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.240 
comes in with the system so come pretty
much<00:02:21.269> is<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.569> demo<00:02:22.019> it's<00:02:22.799> kind<00:02:23.159> of

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
much is like a demo it's kind of

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.649 
much is like a demo it's kind of
distressing<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.909> me<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.480> most

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
distressing to me that the most

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.270 
distressing to me that the most
impressive<00:02:25.140> aspect<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.620> technology<00:02:26.129> is

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
impressive aspect of the technology is

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.140 
impressive aspect of the technology is
not<00:02:26.430> something<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:26.849> be<00:02:26.909> incorporated

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
not something that can be incorporated

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.390 
not something that can be incorporated
into<00:02:27.540> an<00:02:27.659> honest<00:02:27.930> game<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.409> I<00:02:28.590> think<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.370> our

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
into an honest game and I think with our

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.860 
into an honest game and I think with our
experience<00:02:29.939> with<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> wheel<00:02:30.329> like<00:02:30.689> they

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
experience with the wheel like they

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.449 
experience with the wheel like they
could<00:02:31.170> incorporate<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.859> and<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
could incorporate this and to and

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.009 
could incorporate this and to and
honestly<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.060> hasn't<00:02:33.329> been<00:02:33.540> done<00:02:33.810> yet<00:02:33.870> I

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
honestly it just hasn't been done yet I

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.119 
honestly it just hasn't been done yet I
I<00:02:34.140> think<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:34.680> we're<00:02:34.769> looking<00:02:34.920> at<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.069> a

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
I think what we're looking at is a

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.440 
I think what we're looking at is a
situation<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.819> we<00:02:36.060> have<00:02:36.239> seen<00:02:36.359> with

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
situation here that we have seen with

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.190 
situation here that we have seen with
the<00:02:36.569> wii<00:02:36.689> with<00:02:36.810> there's<00:02:36.989> something<00:02:37.170> that

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the wii with there's something that

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.839 
the wii with there's something that
initially<00:02:37.739> as<00:02:37.859> a<00:02:37.890> piece<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.099> technology<00:02:38.670> that

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
initially as a piece of technology that

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.059 
initially as a piece of technology that
does<00:02:39.030> work<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:39.689> impressive<00:02:40.109> but<00:02:40.769> we<00:02:40.890> don't

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
does work is so impressive but we don't

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.679 
does work is so impressive but we don't
know<00:02:41.189> if<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> creative<00:02:41.879> community<00:02:42.060> out<00:02:42.480> there

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
know if the creative community out there

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.750 
know if the creative community out there
that<00:02:42.840> makes<00:02:43.140> games<00:02:43.470> knows<00:02:44.159> what<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.549> do<00:02:44.670> with

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
that makes games knows what to do with

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.460 
that makes games knows what to do with

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
that's clearly what's moving these

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.119 
that's clearly what's moving these
things<00:04:02.970> like<00:04:03.120> hotcakes<00:04:03.299> it's<00:04:04.290> not<00:04:04.709> pretty

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.800 
for I am the first one I want to talk
about<00:04:09.829> steel<00:04:10.829> divers<00:04:11.519> okay<00:04:11.970> on<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.540> one<00:04:12.750> I

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
about steel divers okay on this one I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.649 
about steel divers okay on this one I
think<00:04:12.930> it's<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.620> Nintendo<00:04:14.010> title<00:04:14.489> original<00:04:15.269> IP

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
think it's a Nintendo title original IP

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.420 
think it's a Nintendo title original IP
which<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.049> original<00:04:16.470> IP<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:16.979> it's<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:17.220> okay

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
which is original IP so it's like okay

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.500 
which is original IP so it's like okay
this<00:04:17.549> might<00:04:17.699> be<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.909> one<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.120> defines<00:04:18.329> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
this might be the one that defines the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.620 
this might be the one that defines the
system<00:04:18.959> um<00:04:19.729> you<00:04:20.729> need<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.060> see<00:04:21.209> what<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.419> lower

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
system um you need to see what the lower

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.209 
system um you need to see what the lower
screen<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.139> like<00:04:22.349> because<00:04:22.710> it's<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:22.919> lot<00:04:23.099> of

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
screen is like because it's a lot of

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.680 
screen is like because it's a lot of
sliders<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.180> kind<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.389> sudden<00:04:24.630> you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
sliders in like kind of sudden you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.140 
sliders in like kind of sudden you
rotate<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.050> does<00:04:25.620> this<00:04:25.800> with<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.370> tilt

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
rotate it does this with the tilt

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.120 
rotate it does this with the tilt
okay<00:04:27.870> some<00:04:28.169> real<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.530> pitch<00:04:28.710> control<00:04:29.040> the

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
okay some real the pitch control the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.860 
okay some real the pitch control the
dive<00:04:29.280> I'm<00:04:29.610> assuming<00:04:29.970> they<00:04:30.090> play<00:04:30.120> tested<00:04:30.750> this

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
dive I'm assuming they play tested this

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.960 
dive I'm assuming they play tested this
at<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.169> widget<00:04:31.650> factory<00:04:32.040> because<00:04:32.610> those<00:04:32.820> are

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
at a widget factory because those are

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.310 
at a widget factory because those are
the<00:04:33.000> only<00:04:33.180> people<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.750> might<00:04:33.930> actually<00:04:34.080> have

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
the only people that might actually have

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.689 
the only people that might actually have
found<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.830> fun<00:04:34.979> experience<00:04:35.070> and

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
found this to be a fun experience and

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:36.980 
found this to be a fun experience and
once<00:04:35.940> again<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.330> doesn't<00:04:36.479> do<00:04:36.690> anything<00:04:36.870> with

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
once again it doesn't do anything with

the perspective of looking out the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.710 
the perspective of looking out the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
submarine and have this it's a very very

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.860 
submarine and have this it's a very very
strange<00:04:52.530> not<00:04:52.889> fun<00:04:53.130> game<00:04:53.340> very<00:04:53.910> quickly<00:04:53.970> super

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
strange not fun game very quickly super

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.420

street fighter 4 and pilot wings are

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.129 
street fighter 4 and pilot wings are
those<00:04:56.580> super<00:04:57.000> street<00:04:57.150> fighter<00:04:57.180> 4<00:04:57.600> is<00:04:57.840> very

those super street fighter 4 is very
impressive<00:04:58.380> especially<00:04:58.740> if<00:04:59.100> you<00:04:59.250> don't<00:04:59.490> have

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
impressive especially if you don't have

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.340 
impressive especially if you don't have
the<00:04:59.820> 3d<00:05:00.120> on<00:05:00.270> because<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.690> can<00:05:00.840> see<00:05:01.080> that

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
the 3d on because you can see that

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.320 
the 3d on because you can see that
clearly<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.250> graphic<00:05:02.580> processor<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.180> this

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
clearly the graphic processor in this

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.450 
clearly the graphic processor in this
system<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.810> hugely<00:05:04.590> superior<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:05.190> in

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
system is a hugely superior to that in

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.640 
system is a hugely superior to that in
the<00:05:05.490> DS<00:05:05.729> with<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.449> 3d<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.960> can't<00:05:07.229> affect<00:05:07.350> frame

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
the DS with the 3d it can't affect frame

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.290 
the DS with the 3d it can't affect frame
rate<00:05:07.830> okay<00:05:08.250> now<00:05:08.400> because<00:05:08.580> is<00:05:08.669> processing<00:05:09.150> more

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
rate okay now because is processing more

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.390 
rate okay now because is processing more
and<00:05:09.570> it<00:05:10.080> just<00:05:10.289> is<00:05:10.410> not<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.620> good<00:05:10.889> version<00:05:11.130> of

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
and it just is not a good version of

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.920 
and it just is not a good version of
street<00:05:11.669> fighter<00:05:11.880> alright<00:05:12.210> we're<00:05:12.600> on<00:05:12.630> time<00:05:12.810> but
