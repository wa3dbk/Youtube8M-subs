00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.530 

I<00:00:01.610> had<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.790> flame<00:00:03.300> started<00:00:03.840> now<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:05.330> at<00:00:06.330> this

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
I had the flame started now and at this

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.459 
I had the flame started now and at this
point<00:00:06.899> it's<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:07.770> warming<00:00:08.309> up<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.519> little<00:00:08.760> bit

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
point it's just warming up a little bit

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.870 
point it's just warming up a little bit
it<00:00:10.469> seems<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.860> operate<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.250> little<00:00:11.370> better<00:00:11.639> when

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
it seems to operate a little better when

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
it seems to operate a little better when
that<00:00:13.070> little<00:00:14.070> cake<00:00:14.400> spout<00:00:14.759> there<00:00:15.120> actually

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that little cake spout there actually

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.170 
that little cake spout there actually
heats<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.289> quite<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> bit<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.160> they<00:00:17.850> give<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
heats up quite a bit so they give it a

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.700 
heats up quite a bit so they give it a
few<00:00:18.359> minutes<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.750> kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.020> come<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.529> heat

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
few minutes to kind of come to some heat

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
few minutes to kind of come to some heat
there<00:00:20.029> you<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.480> already<00:00:21.660> starting

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
there you can see it's already starting

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.870 
there you can see it's already starting
to

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.400 
to
develop<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.810> nice<00:00:24.990> little<00:00:25.230> flame<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.340> there

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
develop a nice little flame on there

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.260 
develop a nice little flame on there
that'll<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:28.529> quite<00:00:28.770> a<00:00:28.800> bit<00:00:28.950> better<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:30.150> have

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
that'll get quite a bit better you have

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.299 
that'll get quite a bit better you have
the<00:00:30.480> air<00:00:30.810> control<00:00:31.199> down<00:00:31.410> pretty<00:00:31.860> far<00:00:32.099> right

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the air control down pretty far right

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
the air control down pretty far right
now<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.820> we'll<00:00:32.940> increase<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:33.720> in<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
now but we'll increase that here in a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.310 
now but we'll increase that here in a
minute<00:00:35.510> actually<00:00:36.510> kind<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.900> turn<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.200> down

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
minute actually kind of turn it down

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.229 
minute actually kind of turn it down
here<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.829> little<00:00:37.920> bit<00:00:39.440> that'll<00:00:40.440> let<00:00:40.620> this

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
here just a little bit that'll let this

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
here just a little bit that'll let this
air<00:00:42.239> out<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.949> there's<00:00:43.949> two<00:00:44.100> different<00:00:44.280> ways

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
air out some there's two different ways

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.660 
air out some there's two different ways
to<00:00:44.550> adjust<00:00:44.790> this<00:00:45.680> turn<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.160> bit<00:00:47.309> until

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to adjust this turn this up a bit until

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.260 
to adjust this turn this up a bit until
it's<00:00:47.850> increasing<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> oxygen<00:00:48.690> flow

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.450 

and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:54.900> reaching<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.590> vet<00:00:55.740> back<00:00:55.920> behind<00:00:56.130> me

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and then reaching the vet back behind me

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.480 
and then reaching the vet back behind me
this<00:00:56.580> is<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.680> natural<00:00:58.680> gas<00:00:58.860> line<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.220> I<00:00:59.430> have

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
this is a natural gas line that I have

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.700 
this is a natural gas line that I have
here<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.120> hooked<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.630> to<00:01:00.810> the<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.680> my

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
here just hooked right up to the to my

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.710 
here just hooked right up to the to my
heater<00:01:02.040> it<00:01:02.940> already<00:01:03.120> had<00:01:03.360> an<00:01:03.480> emergency

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
heater it already had an emergency

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.610 
heater it already had an emergency
shutoff<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.980> tapped<00:01:05.160> right<00:01:05.280> into<00:01:05.550> that

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
shutoff so I just tapped right into that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
shutoff so I just tapped right into that
we're<00:01:07.620> just<00:01:07.770> hoping<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.190> up<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.610> little

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
we're just hoping that up just a little

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.130 
we're just hoping that up just a little
bit<00:01:08.910> more<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> will<00:01:09.480> naturally<00:01:09.990> just

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
bit more and that will naturally just

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.940 
bit more and that will naturally just
let<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:12.020> natural<00:01:13.020> gas<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:13.620> in<00:01:13.740> there

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
let more natural gas go right in there

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.100 
let more natural gas go right in there
so<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.790> open<00:01:14.910> that<00:01:15.060> all<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.840> until

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
so we can open that all the way up until

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.770 
so we can open that all the way up until
we<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.260> a<00:01:16.290> huge<00:01:16.620> flame<00:01:16.920> coming<00:01:17.190> out<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.460> there

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
we have a huge flame coming out of there

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.980 
we have a huge flame coming out of there
so<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.140> obviously<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.340> want<00:01:20.550> for<00:01:20.990> for

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
so and that's obviously we want for for

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.650 
so and that's obviously we want for for
brewing<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.560> we're<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:23.660> leave

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
brewing what we're going to do leave

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.070 
brewing what we're going to do leave
that<00:01:24.870> about<00:01:25.140> midway<00:01:25.590> there<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:27.930> even

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that about midway there and then even

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.219 
that about midway there and then even
though<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.380> flame<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:29.479> going<00:01:30.479> quite<00:01:30.840> big<00:01:31.110> on

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
though that flame is going quite big on

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.840 
though that flame is going quite big on
the<00:01:31.350> top<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.800> see<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.160> all<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> orange<00:01:32.700> we

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the top there see with all the orange we

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:44.470 
the top there see with all the orange we
just<00:01:33.030> increased<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> oxygen

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.230 

kind<00:01:44.870> of<00:01:44.990> turn<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.230> into<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.650> nice

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.399 

right<00:01:52.720> there

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.700 

see<00:01:59.950> now<00:02:00.130> we<00:02:00.189> got<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.490> nice<00:02:00.700> torch<00:02:01.149> going<00:02:01.420> there

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:22.339 

a<00:02:04.740> little<00:02:05.220> bit<00:02:05.310> more

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.619 

so<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:22.829> we<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.280> burners<00:02:24.030> nice<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.420> warm

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
so now we have the burners nice and warm

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.170 
so now we have the burners nice and warm
and<00:02:24.959> I've<00:02:25.200> got<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.530> cake<00:02:25.739> back<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.189> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
and I've got the cake back on the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.470 
and I've got the cake back on the
stand<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.439> pig<00:02:29.709> on<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.950> stand

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.759 

you<00:02:32.629> see<00:02:32.810> folks<00:02:33.019> look<00:02:33.260> at<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.650> see<00:02:33.739> how

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
you see folks look at that and see how

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:44.940 
you see folks look at that and see how
it's<00:02:34.010> looking<00:02:34.069> underneath

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.650 

here<00:02:45.520> I<00:02:45.580> have<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.879> flavor<00:02:46.120> button<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.599> a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
here I have the flavor button just a

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.780 
here I have the flavor button just a
little<00:02:46.870> bit<00:02:46.959> lower<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:48.370> really<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
little bit lower it's really the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.070 
little bit lower it's really the
adjustment<00:02:49.269> on<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
adjustment on the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.920 
adjustment on the
the<00:02:50.440> air<00:02:51.070> valve<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.970> got<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> lot<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.420> gas<00:02:52.630> going

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
the air valve you got a lot of gas going

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.840 
the air valve you got a lot of gas going
through<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.320> just<00:02:53.470> turn<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.520> oxygen

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
through it you just turn that the oxygen

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.820 
through it you just turn that the oxygen
down<00:02:55.150> or<00:02:55.390> basically<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.050> turned<00:02:56.680> their

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
down or basically in the turned their

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.800 
down or basically in the turned their
little<00:02:57.010> fan<00:02:57.190> motor<00:02:57.460> down<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.180> that'll<00:02:58.780> just

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
little fan motor down and that'll just

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.490 
little fan motor down and that'll just
that'll<00:02:59.530> just<00:03:00.690> more<00:03:01.690> gas<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.140> goes<00:03:02.290> through

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
that'll just more gas that goes through

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.660 
that'll just more gas that goes through
them<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.860> get<00:03:02.980> much<00:03:03.160> more<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.460> an<00:03:03.550> oxygen

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.880 

so<00:03:07.060> then<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:07.840> go<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.170> crank<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.620> gas

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
so then you just go to crank the gas

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.260 
so then you just go to crank the gas
down<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.460> little<00:03:09.490> bit<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:09.940> it'll<00:03:10.060> tighten

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
down just a little bit and it'll tighten

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.640 
down just a little bit and it'll tighten
that<00:03:10.510> flame<00:03:10.750> back<00:03:10.930> up<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.170> little<00:03:11.260> bit<00:03:11.470> you'll

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
that flame back up a little bit you'll

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.290 
that flame back up a little bit you'll
end<00:03:11.830> up<00:03:11.890> with<00:03:11.980> something<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.310> this

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.790 

that<00:03:18.720> would<00:03:18.840> be<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.960> good<00:03:19.140> flame<00:03:19.410> for<00:03:19.620> just

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
that would be a good flame for just

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.830 
that would be a good flame for just
maintaining<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.490> oil<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.030> have<00:03:21.210> kind

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
maintaining the oil that you have kind

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.800 
maintaining the oil that you have kind
of<00:03:21.930> regulating<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> little<00:03:22.740> bit<00:03:23.570> I'll<00:03:24.570> show<00:03:24.720> you

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
of regulating a little bit I'll show you

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.870 
of regulating a little bit I'll show you
what<00:03:24.960> this<00:03:25.110> looks<00:03:25.290> like

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
what this looks like

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.000 
what this looks like
there's<00:03:27.390> no<00:03:27.570> oxygen<00:03:27.870> going<00:03:28.350> through<00:03:28.650> there<00:03:28.830> or

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
there's no oxygen going through there or

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:40.630 
there's no oxygen going through there or
just<00:03:29.040> minimal<00:03:29.610> oxygen

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.610 

see<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.330> flame<00:03:41.540> just<00:03:41.750> turns<00:03:41.960> all<00:03:42.170> orange<00:03:42.500> you

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
see that flame just turns all orange you

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.170 
see that flame just turns all orange you
looking<00:03:42.950> going<00:03:43.280> up<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.550> side<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:43.880> keg<00:03:44.060> you

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
looking going up the side of the keg you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.850 
looking going up the side of the keg you
don't<00:03:44.300> want<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.480> do<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.660> too<00:03:44.870> much<00:03:45.020> so<00:03:45.350> we'll

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
don't want to do that too much so we'll

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.110 
don't want to do that too much so we'll
just<00:03:45.980> move<00:03:46.130> crease<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.520> right<00:03:46.730> off<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.880> bat

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
just move crease that right off the bat

00:03:47.120 --> 00:04:16.720 
just move crease that right off the bat
there

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.940 

and<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.090> have<00:04:17.240> no<00:04:17.390> idea<00:04:17.750> how<00:04:17.870> many<00:04:18.020> BTUs<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.770> is

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
and I have no idea how many BTUs that is

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.010 
and I have no idea how many BTUs that is
but<00:04:19.190> that's<00:04:19.310> quite<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.030> bit<00:04:20.300> our<00:04:20.810> emergency

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
but that's quite a bit our emergency

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.730 
but that's quite a bit our emergency
shut<00:04:21.500> off<00:04:21.710> and<00:04:21.950> everything<00:04:22.250> shuts<00:04:22.580> down

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
shut off and everything shuts down

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.790 
shut off and everything shuts down
diseases<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.890> it's<00:04:25.130> just<00:04:25.340> shut<00:04:25.640> up
