00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.710
 Instant soup and 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 A little 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.769

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.840

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.430
 Same as 3

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.380

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.700

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 Small rain canceled 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.740
 Always low 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.410
 Sunday after 1110 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.410

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 I understood 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.250
 Originally 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.250
 The car is wrecked 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 I have done my account closing 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.109
 2 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.109
 I think in the same large campus 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.490
 It must be possible 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.769
 Future outlook 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.769

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.159
 Up 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.069

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.469
 I have the ability 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.469

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.799

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.659

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.569
 Second base 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.199
 It seems to be going 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.359
 It feels like I went to the riverside to play 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.399
