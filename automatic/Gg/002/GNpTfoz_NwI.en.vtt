00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
but if not what it is is you don't just

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.380 
but if not what it is is you don't just
pick<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.250> games<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.210> win

once<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.230> pick<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> games<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.460> rank<00:00:38.850> them

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
once you pick the games you rank them

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.819 
once you pick the games you rank them
based<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.570> how<00:00:39.629> conference<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> are<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
based on how conference you are and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.380 
based on how conference you are and
who's<00:00:41.190> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> win<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.730> ball<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.270> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.540 
who's going to win that ball get that
ball<00:00:42.600> game<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> were<00:00:43.770> very<00:00:43.950> confident

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
ball game so if you were very confident

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
ball game so if you were very confident
in<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> game<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.600> rank<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.960> higher<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
in a game you will rank that higher and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.380 
in a game you will rank that higher and
put<00:00:46.649> more<00:00:46.770> points<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> line<00:00:47.489> whereas<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
put more points on the line whereas the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.940 
put more points on the line whereas the
games<00:00:48.600> where<00:00:48.960> you're<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.200> quite<00:00:49.440> sure<00:00:49.469> you'll

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
games where you're not quite sure you'll

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
games where you're not quite sure you'll
rank<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.370> lower<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.420> kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> fun

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
rank them lower and so it's kind of fun

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.319 
rank them lower and so it's kind of fun
deal<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.800> who<00:00:53.039> picks<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> most<00:00:54.000> games

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
deal that's not who picks the most games

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.880 
deal that's not who picks the most games
right<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.140> whoever<00:00:55.530> gets<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> most

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
right it's whoever gets the most

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.849 
right it's whoever gets the most
confidence<00:00:56.430> points<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.210> always<00:00:57.390> fine

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
confidence points so this is always fine

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.410

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
no real prize in life is pretty much if

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090 
no real prize in life is pretty much if

regardless but to play that pitiful and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.070 
regardless but to play that pitiful and
put<00:02:26.020> your<00:02:26.140> defense<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.620> such<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.860> hole<00:02:27.930> made<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
put your defense in such a hole made it

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
probably should have been but they

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.260 
probably should have been but they
dominated<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:33.220> that's<00:02:33.370> what<00:02:33.490> happened<00:02:33.850> now

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270
