00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.180
 very good girls very good guys today 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.580
 we are in a new news I want 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.700
 clarify the previous news this takes 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.769
 totally erased we are people 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.530
 human and sometimes we are wrong 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.750
 I am amused to see the 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.640
 comments from people who never support 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.100
 so it does not support at all that I 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.440
 that I could be wrong or that I have not 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.020
 given all the complete information by 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.780
 X motives and then they attack me 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.020
 those people for me personally spare my 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.630
 channel because it does not support me do not support me a 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.120
 canon therefore I am a bad myself 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.070
 I make mistakes and sometimes it costs watching 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.900
 incomplete information but when 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.720
 happens in these cases I do not drop those 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.000
 rings by erasing the video and going back to 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.090
 explain the information the news 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.670
 was about order in 1886 that 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.890
 youtuber has completed it in just one 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.870
 little bit more than 5 hours but you have to 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.579
 clarify how good I had seen it 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.320
 I had seen the club I had seen 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.489
 several details of the gameplay not what 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.560
 I wanted to see it whole because I do not want 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.080
 neither can you do much 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.320
 but he had not said what is happening in 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.140
 five hours in an easy way and without dying 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.450
 and without examining the scenarios that is 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.830
 if it does not die if it does not go strictly to 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.710
 story thread you're going to pass on 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.480
 about five hours and a little bit not the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.660
 duration of the title had been debate 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.400
 during the last days but I the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.920
 previous news did not say that only 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.600
 had passed in easy mode without dying and 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.250
 without examining the scenarios yes what 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.740
 had put all the cinematics and that 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.080
 had put everything but had gone to the wire 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.760
 of the matter has not been a user of 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.000
 youtube that already has the version 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.650
 preliminary game as discussed in 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.660
 the comments of the previous video 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.320
 they say that there were even missing chapters in 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.330
 said what trick I do not know either the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.890
 I passed game to know but I ask 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.300
 apologies 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.640
 the truth is that we have to say that good 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.310
 I have gone from the easy level and that 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.369
 it is unlikely that the duration 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.250
 normal of this work so do not go to 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.350
 be 5 hours but good the title of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.480
 ready at dawn has been watched with magnifying glass 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.150
 since it was announced last year that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.400
 it's true and there are many people who attack it 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.239
 not to me truly when there was 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.250
 seen the yellow news - good crashed 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.590
 not quite so today he has put very 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.989
 strong because if the game lasts five 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.840
 hours or between five and six hours I 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.060
 It seems very strong that it lasts that I have that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.420
 duration, that's not why I put that 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.280
 tweet not so I apologize if 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.209
 someone has been offended by the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.910
 previous news and nothing else you know 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.850
 when I'm wrong, I do not have to 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.250
 attacks directly to the people that I 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.500
 want to see wrong or just say 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.290
 tell me or on twitter watching you have 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.000
 wrong this has happened and the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.510
 news and it is rectified because we are 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.980
 human persons 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.500
 humans are wrong and I the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.340
 first so a thousand apologies 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.220
 there is the news, what is easy without 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.170
 die and it seems that they have said 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.209
 for missing some chapters 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.049
 there is the news thanks to all and 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.049
 see you in the next
