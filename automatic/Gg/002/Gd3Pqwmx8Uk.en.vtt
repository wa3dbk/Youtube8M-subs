00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
very standard this year but that's not

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.510 
very standard this year but that's not
fun<00:01:09.350> hey<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.560> least<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.979> don't<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
fun hey at least they don't have the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
fun hey at least they don't have the
back<00:01:11.729> vo<00:01:12.000> Mega<00:01:12.420> Man's<00:01:12.689> used<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.409> where

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
back vo Mega Man's used to have where

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.679 
back vo Mega Man's used to have where
you<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:14.549> weapons<00:01:14.939> which<00:01:15.150> fall<00:01:15.360> off<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you with weapons which fall off the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
you with weapons which fall off the
ladder<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.470> that's<00:01:16.650> probably<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.130> because

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
ladder so that's probably just because

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.469 
ladder so that's probably just because
you<00:01:17.670> don't<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.939> an<00:01:18.240> animation<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:20.479> now

the<00:02:10.330> walls<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.920> very<00:02:12.190> strange<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.569> like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
the walls that's very strange so like

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.229 
the walls that's very strange so like
I'm<00:02:13.840> pushing<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.140> button<00:02:14.470> letting<00:02:15.069> go

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
I'm pushing the button letting go

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.559 
I'm pushing the button letting go
letting<00:02:16.239> go<00:02:19.110> quirky<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.260> say<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> least<00:02:21.569> so

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
letting go quirky to say the least so

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.479 
letting go quirky to say the least so
that<00:02:22.750> was<00:02:22.900> pointless<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.590> as<00:02:23.830> said<00:02:24.069> I'm<00:02:24.220> going

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
that was pointless but as said I'm going

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.610 
that was pointless but as said I'm going
to<00:02:24.610> show<00:02:24.760> off<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.180> top<00:02:25.390> 5<00:02:25.690> later<00:02:25.989> on<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.440> I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
to show off the top 5 later on and I

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.740 
to show off the top 5 later on and I
could<00:02:27.310> again<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:27.640> ignored<00:02:28.150> these<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.750> guess

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
could again have ignored these I guess

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.440 
could again have ignored these I guess
well<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.440> want<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.769> mean<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.819> guess<00:02:34.120> these

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
well if you want to mean I guess these

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.280 
well if you want to mean I guess these
could<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.349> longer<00:02:35.650> timer<00:02:37.019> again<00:02:38.019> a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
could have have a longer timer again a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.170 
could have have a longer timer again a
room<00:02:38.620> with<00:02:38.799> mats<00:02:39.099> which<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:39.730> doesn't<00:02:39.849> really

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
room with mats which just doesn't really

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.569 
room with mats which just doesn't really
fit<00:02:40.480> into<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.900> stages<00:02:41.290> theme<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.950> get<00:02:42.430> the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
fit into the stages theme I get the

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.580 
fit into the stages theme I get the
feeling<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.000> they<00:02:43.360> are<00:02:43.599> using<00:02:43.630> these<00:02:44.230> just

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
feeling that they are using these just

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.670 
feeling that they are using these just
as<00:02:44.739> fillers<00:02:45.129> at<00:02:45.730> least<00:02:46.030> mets<00:02:46.840> are<00:02:47.140> like<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
as fillers at least mets are like the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.809 
as fillers at least mets are like the
mascot<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.459> makes<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.819> little<00:02:48.940> sense<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.160> is

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
mascot so it makes a little sense so is

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.369 
mascot so it makes a little sense so is
this<00:02:52.030> going<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.329> work<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.690> same<00:02:52.840> way<00:02:52.900> as<00:02:53.230> it

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
this going to work the same way as it

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.140 
this going to work the same way as it
did<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.829> original<00:02:53.860> know<00:02:54.579> this<00:02:54.790> one<00:02:54.970> turn

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
did in the original know this one turn

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.610 
did in the original know this one turn
show<00:02:56.340> when<00:02:57.340> did<00:02:57.549> that<00:02:57.670> jump<00:02:58.000> again<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.569> have<00:02:59.379> no

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
show when did that jump again I have no

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.009 
show when did that jump again I have no
idea<00:02:59.769> in<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.190> middle<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.519> screen<00:03:01.019> can't

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
idea in the middle of the screen can't

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.039 
idea in the middle of the screen can't
jump<00:03:02.290> them<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:03.160> that's<00:03:03.340> fair<00:03:03.730> are<00:03:04.660> they<00:03:04.870> still

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
jump them so that's fair are they still

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.270 
jump them so that's fair are they still
immune<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.500> metal<00:03:05.799> blades<00:03:07.980> no<00:03:08.980> they're<00:03:09.160> not

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
immune to metal blades no they're not

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.699 
immune to metal blades no they're not
holy<00:03:10.350> okay<00:03:13.049> yeah<00:03:14.049> that's<00:03:14.440> that's

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
holy okay yeah that's that's

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.730 
holy okay yeah that's that's
slightly<00:03:15.099> unfair<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.849> poor<00:03:16.030> chickens

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.060 

I<00:03:20.390> haven't<00:03:21.390> mentioned<00:03:21.810> yet<00:03:21.840> how<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.860> game

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
I haven't mentioned yet how the game

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.610 
I haven't mentioned yet how the game
doesn't<00:03:23.340> pause<00:03:23.700> when<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.030> put<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.620> collect

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
doesn't pause when you put a collect

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.070 
doesn't pause when you put a collect
weapon<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.340> or<00:03:26.640> life<00:03:26.910> pickups<00:03:27.450> which<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.840> kind

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
weapon and or life pickups which is kind

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.630 
weapon and or life pickups which is kind
of<00:03:28.170> strange<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.680> can<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:29.010> used<00:03:29.040> as<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> little

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
of strange and can be used as a little

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.700 
of strange and can be used as a little
exploit<00:03:30.000> later<00:03:30.270> on<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:31.230> yeah<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.530> was<00:03:31.680> a

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
exploit later on but yeah that was a

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.280 
exploit later on but yeah that was a
stage<00:03:32.070> at<00:03:32.790> least<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.690> difficulty

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
stage at least the difficulty

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.110 
stage at least the difficulty
progression<00:03:34.830> safe<00:03:35.040> for<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> water<00:03:35.610> state

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
progression safe for the water state

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.280 
progression safe for the water state
part<00:03:36.900> was<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.710> bit<00:03:38.160> more<00:03:38.400> sensible<00:03:39.290> especially

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
part was a bit more sensible especially

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.530 
part was a bit more sensible especially
in<00:03:40.890> which<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.280> compare<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.820> first<00:03:42.150> stretch<00:03:42.480> of

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
in which to compare the first stretch of

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.230 
in which to compare the first stretch of
level<00:03:42.870> with<00:03:43.560> just<00:03:43.860> enemies<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:45.030> last

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
level with just enemies and the last

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.210 
level with just enemies and the last
stretch<00:03:45.510> with<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:46.110> enemies<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.980> because

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
stretch with just enemies just because

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.980 
stretch with just enemies just because
the<00:03:47.370> chickens<00:03:47.550> are<00:03:47.910> far<00:03:48.180> harder<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.750> dodge

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
the chickens are far harder to dodge

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.110 
the chickens are far harder to dodge
unless<00:03:49.860> you're<00:03:50.040> using<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.550> even<00:03:50.940> more

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
unless you're using the even more

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.570 
unless you're using the even more
overpowered<00:03:51.780> metal<00:03:52.080> blades<00:03:52.290> on<00:03:52.500> them<00:03:52.650> in

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
overpowered metal blades on them in

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.790 
overpowered metal blades on them in
comparison<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.410> others<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:56.840> wow<00:03:57.840> that's

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
comparison to the others and wow that's

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.220 
comparison to the others and wow that's
suddenly<00:03:59.280> far<00:03:59.880> easy<00:04:00.210> to<00:04:00.480> judge<00:04:00.660> if<00:04:00.840> it's<00:04:00.990> just

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
suddenly far easy to judge if it's just

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.070 
suddenly far easy to judge if it's just
three<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.500> them<00:04:02.300> which<00:04:03.300> i<00:04:03.480> guess<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.690> nice

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
three of them which i guess is nice

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.230 
three of them which i guess is nice
because<00:04:04.730> for<00:04:05.730> isn't<00:04:06.240> it<00:04:07.580> yeah<00:04:08.580> because<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:09.060> was

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
because for isn't it yeah because it was

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.790 
because for isn't it yeah because it was
pretty<00:04:09.840> shitty<00:04:10.380> fight<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.890> begin<00:04:11.070> with<00:04:11.460> and

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
pretty shitty fight to begin with and

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.930 
pretty shitty fight to begin with and
okay<00:04:14.660> still<00:04:15.660> not<00:04:15.960> really<00:04:16.500> hard<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:17.340> fact<00:04:17.700> the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
okay still not really hard in fact the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.720 
okay still not really hard in fact the
extreme<00:04:18.720> opposite<00:04:19.170> of<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.470> but<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.400> won't

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
extreme opposite of it but I won't

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.700 
extreme opposite of it but I won't
complain<00:04:20.940> for<00:04:21.360> a<00:04:21.450> blind<00:04:21.720> run<00:04:21.959> so<00:04:22.290> i<00:04:22.320> don't<00:04:22.620> have

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
complain for a blind run so i don't have

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.680 
complain for a blind run so i don't have
to<00:04:22.890> bore<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.340> with<00:04:23.370> thousands<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.060> deaths<00:04:24.330> but

to bore you with thousands of deaths but
well<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:25.920> level<00:04:26.190> was<00:04:26.310> again<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.610> cake<00:04:26.940> working

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580

really<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.610> he<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.910> big<00:04:39.030> problem<00:04:39.390> with<00:04:39.480> the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
really is he the big problem with the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.440 
really is he the big problem with the
game<00:04:39.750> is<00:04:39.930> it's<00:04:40.110> not<00:04:40.290> incredibly<00:04:41.010> bad<00:04:41.940> it<00:04:42.300> is

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
game is it's not incredibly bad it is

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.170 
game is it's not incredibly bad it is
still<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.780> megaman<00:04:43.470> game<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.340> have<00:04:44.970> to

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
still a megaman game and you have to

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.420 
still a megaman game and you have to
work<00:04:45.390> very<00:04:45.420> hard<00:04:45.900> on<00:04:46.740> up<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.040> basic

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
work very hard on up the basic

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.790 
work very hard on up the basic
formula<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:48.570> problem<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:49.050> have<00:04:49.230> with<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.560> is

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
formula the problem I have with it is

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.490 
formula the problem I have with it is
just<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.220> it's<00:04:50.460> really<00:04:50.940> boring<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.840> there

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
just that it's really boring and there

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.250 
just that it's really boring and there
is<00:04:52.620> nothing<00:04:53.040> of<00:04:53.430> real<00:04:53.700> consequence<00:04:54.660> in<00:04:55.050> these

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
is nothing of real consequence in these

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.020 
is nothing of real consequence in these
levels<00:04:55.530> like<00:04:55.770> there<00:04:55.950> is<00:04:56.100> no<00:04:56.130> challenge<00:04:56.550> in<00:04:56.910> it

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
levels like there is no challenge in it

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.390 
levels like there is no challenge in it
there<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.600> no<00:04:57.780> cleverness<00:04:58.230> in<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.860> I

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
there is no cleverness in it and I

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.580 
there is no cleverness in it and I
suspect<00:04:59.610> we're<00:05:00.090> going<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.480> see<00:05:00.690> more<00:05:01.530> of

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
suspect we're going to see more of

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.550 
suspect we're going to see more of
nothing<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.640> later<00:05:03.210> on<00:05:03.540> for<00:05:04.080> now<00:05:04.230> thank
