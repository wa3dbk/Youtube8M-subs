00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.049
 and follow the boy welcome to a 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.120
 new video my name of josh in 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.090
 images occasions I will show a 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.350
 application that is quite interesting 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.500
 The function of this application is 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.310
 replace whatever is green by 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.470
 an image that the application has 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.990
 so then we have two 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.300
 images we have one that is from the city 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.050
 of Sydney which is what you are 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.570
 seeing right now and one that is in the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.660
 field then we could 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.760
 put one of these two funds or if you already 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.730
 we want to choose one of the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.970
 gallery then we would have to pay 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.970
 a dollar with 99 also this application 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.400
 it allows us to record but even a certain 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.350
 time if we want to record the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.920
 time we want we have to 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.660
 spend a dollar on this application as well 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.360
 so that this application will remain 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.329
 perfection with all of the law 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.369
 then we would have to invest 3 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.980
 dollars you only have 2 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.860
 backgrounds and they also have objects like 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.040
 this and then it does not need or configure 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.050
 they only need a green cloth 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.330
 how should they take into account that the 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.740
 lighting that they have on the fabric or in 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.900
 the cardboard or whatever they are using 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.870
 as a background have an illumination 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.170
 even the light that you see in the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.570
 part of there must be the same as it is 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.060
 here, it must be well lit 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.180
 scenario between more lit up are going to 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.790
 get better results so 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.310
 good remember that the application I'm going 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.450
 to leave in the description of the video it 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.880
 Llama gs mx only available 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.180
 for devices with ios 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.340
 unfortunately I have not found 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.070
 no application that has these 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.930
 features for android so 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.490

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.380
