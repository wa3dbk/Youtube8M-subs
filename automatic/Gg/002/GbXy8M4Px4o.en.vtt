at<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.869> kind<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.380> boiled<00:01:31.920> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
at all it's kind of more boiled but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.640 
at all it's kind of more boiled but
typically<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.990> want<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.560> about
