00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
cover when it shatters because of the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.770 
cover when it shatters because of the
pressure<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:36.090> space<00:03:36.450> it'll<00:03:37.410> shatter<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:38.180> in<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
pressure in space it'll shatter in in a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.930 
pressure in space it'll shatter in in a
lot<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.709> lot<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:40.920> pieces<00:03:41.310> now<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:46.940> he's

when it no no I mean I'm sorry it's not
more<00:04:14.880> durable<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:16.229> when<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:17.660> shatters

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
more durable but when this shatters

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.480 
more durable but when this shatters
it'll<00:04:20.760> shatter<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:21.359> big<00:04:21.930> pieces<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:23.039> doesn't

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
it'll shatter in big pieces it doesn't

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.390 
it'll shatter in big pieces it doesn't
it<00:04:24.330> doesn't<00:04:24.389> break<00:04:25.020> into<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.560> into<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.160> lot<00:04:26.370> of
