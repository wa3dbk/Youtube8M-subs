00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.470
 Talk that guys are the wagner branches of the 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.150
 channel wr kits 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.850
 This is the second part of the third 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.420
 season of the robots series this piece here 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.900
 donate fayfi let's show how we did 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.779
 machining from the raw material 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.090
 plastic a piece like this that you 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.430
 See here I'll show the step to 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.120
 step so you can do 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.280
 handmade in your home also without 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.770
 I will not show any problems either. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.200
 Tools, but as you go 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.770
 using the tools for machining I 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.990
 I'm going to comment with you. It 's very simple and 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.080
 very practical to carry out the construction 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.780
 of a robotic arm seems difficult but 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.500
 it is not we will then show in detail 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.189
 More things about the mechanics here of the arm 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.360
 fayfi for you to check so let's go 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:12.880
 then starting with the raw material 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.190
 here we take a plastic piece from a 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 her old stereo 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 resistance and is very easy to work with 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.420
 Let's initially clean 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:29.950
 in it with a flannel and then mark 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.020
 the lines for cutting the piece with ruler 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.690
 with overhead marker pen 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.060
 these lines in the desired dimensions will 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.420
 use approximately 16 centimeters 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.580
 by three and a half centimeters and let 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.490
 making the mark here as you 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.380
 they are seeing markup ready now it's time 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.240
 to cut the part 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.270
 for this we will use an arc of 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.220
 and support the party on our bench. 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.770
 Let's try to follow the line well. 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.909
 so the cut came out better 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.970
 possible 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.000
 we will do this on all four sides of the piece 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.390
 that we want until we get the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.670
 the fully trimmed part now 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.710
 clean your fingers by pulling 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.000
 excess dirt with the pocketknife 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:23.140
 the burrs and then with a 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.750
 we will make the finishing piece 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.540
 fully cut we will perform the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.180
 marking for holes 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.850
 first a center line here in the piece 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.390
 this one the accessory of a deer motor 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 that we will use 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.830
 let's use the circumference of a 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.510
 stack to round the corners of the part 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.010
 give a more visual finish 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.370
 interesting for her 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.100
 then we will do it in the same period with 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.620
 bench drill and exchange of 3,5 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.100
 we will make four holes here in 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.110
 party at the accessory for the Serbian showed 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.540
 two for attachment to the part we are 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.190
 building and two others to cut 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.110
 more easily he 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.120
 after drilling the holes in the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.220
 servo motor let's take advantage of them to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.170
 make the mark on the part we are 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.190
 building to facilitate the calculation 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.190
 her 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.280
 we will also mark central courses for 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.430
 the fixing of spacers and other holes 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.769
 extra with the soldering iron let's dial 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.330
 these holes so that the drill does not 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.330
 slide at the time of counting 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.920
 marking we will carry out the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.010
 Bench drilling machine 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.010
 again with the 3.5mm drill bit 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.890
 and there is the piece totally stuck with 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.560
 we will finish the work now for 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.870
 make the corners of the piece for a 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.870
 most interesting visual aspect 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.360
 always remembering to take care when 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:07.350
 handle heavier tools 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.350
 Let's make circular motions. 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.840
 and there is the piece already with the songs 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.840
 rounded 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.660
 now with the new bench drill 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.110
 let's widen two holes of 3.5 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.910
 millimeters to 7mm one to one 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.540
 central hole for only one aspect 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.270
 and another to secure the part of the 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.460
 servo motor which has this diameter 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.450
 let's remember with the pliers the excesses 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.760
 here from the servo motor cross and with 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:49.540
 screws and nuts will make the fixing 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:52.130
 the piece we built and finally 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.470
 we fixed two screws of five 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.500
 centimeters and stop sometimes 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.780
 spacers so we can fix it 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.120
 a second part forming the structure 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.360
 of an arm joint 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.920
 robotic and the structure will be 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.650
 finished here 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.860
 built by us ready to add 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.330
 to the robotic arm 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.090
 remembering that each of the pieces of the year 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.250
 fay were machined in this way with this 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.620
 step by step that I demonstrated in this video 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.560
 then just repeat the process for each 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.310
 one of the pieces of this arm and go riding 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.470
 he you at home and then for today it is 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.140
 This folks are going to stay here. 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.120
 This was Part 2 of Season Three 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.790
 from the robots series 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.820
 Let's build the earth and then let's go 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.680
 program it if left unanswered questions 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.530
 those in various shows 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.140
