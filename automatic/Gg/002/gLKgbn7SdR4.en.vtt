00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
good morning everyone and they comment

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.350 
good morning everyone and they comment
that<00:00:08.559> I<00:00:08.680> got<00:00:08.920> and<00:00:10.740> on<00:00:11.740> my<00:00:12.070> last<00:00:12.250> video<00:00:12.610> of<00:00:13.150> the

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
that I got and on my last video of the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.470 
that I got and on my last video of the
jello<00:00:13.809> so<00:00:14.709> the<00:00:15.459> cylinder<00:00:15.879> head<00:00:16.059> should<00:00:16.270> be<00:00:16.299> the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
jello so the cylinder head should be the

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.310 
jello so the cylinder head should be the
other<00:00:16.869> way<00:00:17.199> round<00:00:17.550> because<00:00:18.550> of<00:00:18.699> the<00:00:19.320> cooling

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
other way round because of the cooling

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.680 
other way round because of the cooling
fins<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.970> I<00:00:22.000> thought<00:00:22.270> I'd<00:00:22.390> make<00:00:22.420> a<00:00:22.600> little

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
fins so I thought I'd make a little

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.800 
fins so I thought I'd make a little
video<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.820> show<00:00:25.030> the<00:00:25.240> inside<00:00:25.570> of<00:00:25.630> the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
video and just show the inside of the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.549 
video and just show the inside of the
piston<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:28.380> first<00:00:29.380> we<00:00:29.710> have<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:31.050> take<00:00:32.050> off<00:00:32.320> the

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
piston so first we have to take off the

00:00:32.559 --> 00:01:52.000 
piston so first we have to take off the
throttle<00:00:33.160> offender

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:30.790 

then<00:01:52.610> there's<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.150> fuel<00:01:53.360> taco

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:03:23.989 

sorry<00:02:31.800> guys

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:23.999 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:31.780 

and<00:03:24.999> then<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.420> was<00:03:25.510> enough

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.700 

and<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.060> I'll<00:03:33.510> start<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.140> head<00:03:34.290> bolts

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
and then I'll start on the head bolts

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.800 
and then I'll start on the head bolts
I'll<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.580> cut<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.850> video<00:03:35.970> short<00:03:36.150> for<00:03:36.510> you

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
okay say the head bolts are all undone

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:48.160 
okay say the head bolts are all undone
and<00:03:45.560> goes<00:03:46.560> understood

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
port over there my dink exhaust port

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:16.999 
port over there my dink exhaust port
here<00:05:03.159> and<00:05:14.310> that's<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.580> really

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.550 
change his head well turn this head
around<00:05:37.180> so<00:05:37.539> it's<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:41.710> way<00:05:41.919> with<00:05:43.560> cooling

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
around so it's that way with cooling

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.379 
around so it's that way with cooling
fins<00:05:44.830> because<00:05:45.159> it<00:05:45.310> was<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.909> wrong<00:05:46.090> way

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
fins because it was the wrong way

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:58.740 
fins because it was the wrong way
apparently<00:05:47.009> but<00:05:49.229> really<00:05:54.719> like<00:05:55.719> that<00:05:56.669> so<00:05:57.750> yeah

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
that's just the view of inside the jello

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.990 
that's just the view of inside the jello
and<00:06:04.599> then<00:06:04.900> hope<00:06:05.500> you<00:06:05.650> enjoyed<00:06:06.009> it<00:06:06.219> and<00:06:06.370> then

and then hope you enjoyed it and then
I'll<00:06:07.389> put<00:06:07.630> it<00:06:07.719> back<00:06:07.810> together

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.860 

I'm<00:06:40.350> feeling<00:06:40.770> and<00:06:41.010> a<00:06:42.000> lot<00:06:42.240> more<00:06:42.450> air<00:06:42.660> coming

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
I'm feeling and a lot more air coming

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.790 
I'm feeling and a lot more air coming
through<00:06:43.230> here<00:06:43.500> so<00:06:44.460> I<00:06:44.490> think<00:06:45.530> that's<00:06:46.530> really

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
through here so I think that's really

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.720 
through here so I think that's really
worked<00:06:47.100> it<00:06:47.310> out<00:06:47.490> and<00:06:48.890> then<00:06:49.890> when<00:06:50.340> you<00:06:50.430> made<00:06:50.580> it

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
worked it out and then when you made it

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.220 
worked it out and then when you made it
one<00:06:50.850> a<00:06:50.880> bit<00:06:51.120> better<00:06:52.130> well<00:06:54.110> thanks<00:06:55.110> for

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
one a bit better well thanks for

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:03.890 
one a bit better well thanks for
