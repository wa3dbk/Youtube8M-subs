00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.660
 and very good to all of you how are you? 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.580
 and welcome to the youtube channel of 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.070
 sana goltv in this video we are going to do 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.230
 the complete analysis of a cydia tweet 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.990
 new is called video paint as you are 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.670
 watching is paid has a price of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.130
 US $ 1.99 and is 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.650
 available in the beatbox repository 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.920
 and do what you are seeing we can 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.050
 have a floating reel video of 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.180
 youtube of netflix of practically 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.550
 any application that plays 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.140
 video to note that we can move it from 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.360
 this way we can give the play to 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.830
 reproduce it is spectacular as os 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.510
 I say this video here is a video that 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.040
 he went up on instagram that had him in the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.290
 reel reel videos 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.790
 you can play like this but it's 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.769
 that also note that this is going to 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.390
 close let's go to youtube because 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.799
 also videos from youtube we're going 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.870
 to be able to see in this way and this is 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.370
 It seems very interesting because it has two 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.049
 good things let's find my channel that 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.610
 we have it down here you 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.989
 I find as I said you have two things 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.170
 good the first good thing is that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.090
 we can see a floating video worth but 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.979
 another good thing is that we can also 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.420
 listen to it in the background when 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.890
 we listen to a podcast in 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.300
 youtube then we have to have the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.340
 open application or used 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.860
 some tweet of the many that you already 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.720
 I have spoken but with this tweet in addition to 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.550
 see it suspended out there on screen 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.180
 In addition we will hear in second 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.860
 flat 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.780
 this is very interesting let's cut 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.670
 to produce the last video that came up from 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.290
 huanta flow a pretty application 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.700
 we are going to give to the like is the law 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.260
 guys who will be a little more with 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.640
 thank you very much and good what 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.880
 we have to do is simply do 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.680
 a double in the hour to get this 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.670
 floating video if a double cap on the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.650
 Time now let's go to settings 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.780
 I'm going to show you how to configure it but 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.640
 integrates with activator I have a position 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.860
 a double paper now worth we make a 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.390
 double is here and notice that here I 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.440
 the video appears and you start to 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.600
 play 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.430
 I can work normally I can go 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.080

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.430
 write a tweet then nothing from here 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.720
 I could write a super tweet 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.670
 easily agree and the video what 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.110

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.750
 let's find the tweet that is called 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.910
 video paint that as you have seen is of 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.310
 payment but that is worth your purchase 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.570
 At least I bought it myself 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.230
 very nice to see that these 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.730

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.700
 that has the application does not have 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.140
 much more activation by activator 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.120

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.890
