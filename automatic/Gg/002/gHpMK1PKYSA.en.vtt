years<00:03:41.359> ago<00:03:41.709> well<00:03:42.709> that<00:03:42.829> that's<00:03:42.950> not<00:03:43.159> the<00:03:43.340> case

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
years ago well that that's not the case

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.910

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
with me I just bought this thing and it

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.440 
with me I just bought this thing and it
works<00:03:46.069> perfectly<00:03:46.549> printing<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.269> copying

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
works perfectly printing and copying

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.530 
works perfectly printing and copying
couldn't<00:03:48.049> be<00:03:48.349> better<00:03:48.739> but<00:03:49.609> for<00:03:49.879> some<00:03:50.060> reason<00:03:50.359> I

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
couldn't be better but for some reason I

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.759 
couldn't be better but for some reason I
cannot<00:03:50.900> scan<00:03:51.260> anything<00:03:51.769> on<00:03:52.219> to<00:03:52.489> my<00:03:52.639> PC<00:03:53.769> from

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
cannot scan anything on to my PC from

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.210 
cannot scan anything on to my PC from
the<00:03:54.950> printer<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.090> had<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.859> find<00:03:57.859> a<00:03:58.010> loophole

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
the printer so I had to find a loophole

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.409 
the printer so I had to find a loophole
around<00:03:58.760> this<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:01.010> order<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.459> do<00:04:01.609> this<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.209> for

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
around this in order to do this and for

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.330 
around this in order to do this and for
some<00:04:02.480> reason<00:04:02.959> it's<00:04:03.109> not<00:04:03.230> recognizing<00:04:04.159> my

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
some reason it's not recognizing my

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.979 
some reason it's not recognizing my
scanners<00:04:04.849> so<00:04:05.090> let<00:04:05.359> me<00:04:05.419> go<00:04:05.540> ahead<00:04:05.599> and<00:04:05.810> close

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
scanners so let me go ahead and close

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.050 
scanners so let me go ahead and close
this<00:04:06.169> window<00:04:06.379> and<00:04:06.799> try<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:07.639> again

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
this window and try that again

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.610 
this window and try that again
open<00:04:08.389> scanner<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.989> always<00:04:12.230> want<00:04:12.409> to<00:04:12.439> make

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
open scanner you always want to make

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.640 
open scanner you always want to make
sure<00:04:12.799> your<00:04:13.389> USB<00:04:14.389> port<00:04:14.719> is<00:04:14.870> plugged<00:04:15.169> in<00:04:15.349> all<00:04:15.590> the

sure your USB port is plugged in all the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.670 
sure your USB port is plugged in all the
way<00:04:16.070> back<00:04:16.759> so<00:04:19.389> it<00:04:20.389> still<00:04:20.690> says<00:04:20.959> no<00:04:20.989> scanner

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
way back so it still says no scanner

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.930 
way back so it still says no scanner
selected<00:04:23.830> well<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> got<00:04:25.220> your<00:04:25.400> scanner<00:04:25.669> right

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.999 

shutting<00:04:33.669> down<00:04:33.699> see<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.539> we'll<00:04:35.380> turn<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:35.770> back

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
shutting down see and we'll turn it back

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:49.939 
shutting down see and we'll turn it back
on<00:04:37.199> seabed<00:04:38.199> hills<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:47.250> here<00:04:48.250> we<00:04:48.370> go

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
on seabed hills and here we go

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.219 
on seabed hills and here we go
notice<00:04:50.949> how<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.220> window<00:04:51.849> nurses<00:04:52.360> frisk<00:04:52.870> and

scan scanner is warming up awesome so

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.070 
scan scanner is warming up awesome so
that<00:05:04.960> means<00:05:05.199> it's<00:05:05.470> going<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:05.800> work
