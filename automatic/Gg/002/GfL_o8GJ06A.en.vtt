we've<00:00:17.810> got<00:00:17.930> three<00:00:18.110> two<00:00:18.230> look<00:00:18.380> at<00:00:18.500> that<00:00:18.650> I<00:00:18.680> use

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
we've got three two look at that I use

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.520 
we've got three two look at that I use
regularly<00:00:19.370> Union<00:00:19.970> in<00:00:20.120> all<00:00:20.240> games<00:00:20.420> FIFA<00:00:21.260> so<00:00:21.440> you

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
regularly Union in all games FIFA so you

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.779 
regularly Union in all games FIFA so you
thought<00:00:21.950> we'd<00:00:22.070> take<00:00:22.220> a<00:00:22.280> look<00:00:22.400> at<00:00:22.520> those<00:00:22.610> step

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
thought we'd take a look at those step

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.760 
thought we'd take a look at those step
by<00:00:22.880> step<00:00:23.060> now<00:00:23.539> going<00:00:23.840> step<00:00:24.020> by<00:00:24.050> step<00:00:24.410> is<00:00:24.560> a<00:00:24.590> good

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
by step now going step by step is a good

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.160 
by step now going step by step is a good
idea<00:00:24.890> because<00:00:25.310> at<00:00:25.430> least<00:00:25.520> for<00:00:25.670> me<00:00:26.060> I<00:00:26.390> find<00:00:26.869> that

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
idea because at least for me I find that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.109 
idea because at least for me I find that
scoring<00:00:27.800> free<00:00:28.070> kicks<00:00:28.340> is<00:00:28.520> a<00:00:28.610> bit<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:28.850> a<00:00:28.910> dark

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
scoring free kicks is a bit of a dark

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:29.620 
scoring free kicks is a bit of a dark
heart

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
heart

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.600 
heart
so<00:00:30.080> what<00:00:30.350> tips<00:00:30.529> if<00:00:30.650> you<00:00:30.710> car<00:00:30.920> yeah<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:31.520> is

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
so what tips if you car yeah it is

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.979 
so what tips if you car yeah it is
difficult<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.059> I'd<00:00:32.149> have<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.419> say<00:00:32.570> first<00:00:32.809> off

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
difficult and I'd have to say first off

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.329 
difficult and I'd have to say first off
I<00:00:33.140> don't<00:00:33.199> score<00:00:33.440> them<00:00:33.530> every<00:00:33.679> single<00:00:33.859> time<00:00:34.039> but

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339 
I don't score them every single time but

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:35.410 
I don't score them every single time but
I<00:00:34.370> think<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.640> three<00:00:34.789> that<00:00:34.909> we've<00:00:35.030> got<00:00:35.210> here

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
I think the three that we've got here

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.119 
I think the three that we've got here
certainly<00:00:35.989> increase<00:00:36.440> your<00:00:36.559> chances<00:00:36.859> although

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
certainly increase your chances although

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.860 
certainly increase your chances although
if<00:00:37.190> they<00:00:37.309> seem<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.640> for<00:00:37.819> me<00:00:37.879> anyway<00:00:38.149> and<00:00:38.780> the

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
if they seem to for me anyway and the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.299 
if they seem to for me anyway and the
first<00:00:39.079> one<00:00:39.260> is<00:00:39.379> my<00:00:39.559> favourite<00:00:39.859> free<00:00:40.010> kick<00:00:40.190> in

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
first one is my favourite free kick in

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.130 
first one is my favourite free kick in
in<00:00:40.489> FIFA<00:00:40.670> 14<00:00:40.850> which<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.269> smashed<00:00:41.659> free

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
in FIFA 14 which is the smashed free

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.930 
in FIFA 14 which is the smashed free
kick<00:00:42.350> right<00:00:42.979> so<00:00:43.129> this<00:00:43.249> is<00:00:43.309> just<00:00:43.579> putting<00:00:43.729> a<00:00:43.819> lot

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
kick right so this is just putting a lot

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.160 
kick right so this is just putting a lot
of<00:00:43.999> power<00:00:44.210> in<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:44.569> then<00:00:44.690> getting<00:00:44.839> it<00:00:44.929> over<00:00:45.079> the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
of power in and then getting it over the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.660 
of power in and then getting it over the
wall<00:00:45.319> is<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:45.559> or<00:00:45.679> is<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:45.859> around<00:00:46.069> the<00:00:46.190> wall<00:00:46.339> yeah

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
wall is it or is it around the wall yeah

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.369 
wall is it or is it around the wall yeah
it's<00:00:46.850> over<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.149> wall<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.749> you<00:00:47.839> do<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.079> from<00:00:48.260> I

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
it's over the wall and you do it from I

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.869 
it's over the wall and you do it from I
find<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:48.710> works<00:00:48.829> best<00:00:49.100> from<00:00:49.249> anywhere<00:00:49.519> sort<00:00:49.789> of

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
find it works best from anywhere sort of

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.099 
find it works best from anywhere sort of
the<00:00:49.940> edge<00:00:50.089> of<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.300> D<00:00:50.449> level<00:00:50.749> with<00:00:50.839> you<00:00:50.929> at<00:00:50.989> the

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
the edge of the D level with you at the

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.629 
the edge of the D level with you at the
edge<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.559> day<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:52.010> kind<00:00:52.219> of<00:00:52.309> distance

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
edge of the day that kind of distance

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:55.779 
edge of the day that kind of distance
you<00:00:52.879> want<00:00:53.389> to<00:00:53.510> hold<00:00:53.659> lb<00:00:54.139> and<00:00:55.100> aim<00:00:55.370> your<00:00:55.519> shot

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
you want to hold lb and aim your shot

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.329 
you want to hold lb and aim your shot
and<00:00:56.329> keep<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.839> left<00:00:57.170> stick<00:00:57.440> pushed<00:00:58.039> forward

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
and keep the left stick pushed forward

00:00:58.339 --> 00:00:59.799 
and keep the left stick pushed forward
while<00:00:58.549> holding<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.940> beat<00:00:59.239> as<00:00:59.299> you<00:00:59.449> can<00:00:59.600> rub

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
while holding a beat as you can rub

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.169 
while holding a beat as you can rub
yourself<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.039> you<00:01:01.159> go<00:01:01.309> for<00:01:01.579> around<00:01:01.760> three

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
yourself and you go for around three

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.000 
yourself and you go for around three
bars<00:01:02.389> of<00:01:02.539> power<00:01:02.690> seems<00:01:03.019> to<00:01:03.170> be<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:03.769> sort<00:01:03.979> of

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
bars of power seems to be that sort of

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.550 
bars of power seems to be that sort of
optimal<00:01:04.610> sort<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:04.940> selection<00:01:05.390> there<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:06.409> then

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
optimal sort of selection there and then

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.690 
optimal sort of selection there and then
usually<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:06.890> should<00:01:06.950> find<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.399> if<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:07.579> hit

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
usually you should find that if you hit

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.399 
usually you should find that if you hit
the<00:01:07.789> target<00:01:07.969> then<00:01:08.360> no<00:01:08.539> the<00:01:08.719> power<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
the target then no the power and the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.660 
the target then no the power and the
speed<00:01:09.649> of<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:09.860> board<00:01:10.039> is<00:01:10.130> moving<00:01:10.399> at<00:01:10.520> what

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
speed of the board is moving at what

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.789 
speed of the board is moving at what
will<00:01:10.820> take<00:01:10.969> it<00:01:11.180> straight<00:01:11.899> past<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.289> keeper<00:01:12.409> or

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
will take it straight past the keeper or

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.350 
will take it straight past the keeper or
and<00:01:13.070> even<00:01:13.219> hit<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.670> keeper<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:13.969> then<00:01:14.090> go<00:01:14.210> in

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
and even hit the keeper and then go in

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.730 
and even hit the keeper and then go in
because<00:01:14.539> it's<00:01:14.689> moving<00:01:14.899> too<00:01:15.110> quickly<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.469> stop

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
because it's moving too quickly to stop

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.590 
because it's moving too quickly to stop
now<00:01:16.070> whereabouts<00:01:16.460> are<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:16.729> actually<00:01:17.000> aiming

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
now whereabouts are you actually aiming

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.840 
now whereabouts are you actually aiming
the<00:01:17.780> ball<00:01:17.810> here<00:01:18.170> in<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.619> go<00:01:18.799> yes<00:01:19.219> I'm<00:01:19.430> lining<00:01:19.670> it

up but you can see in this clip just
between<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.039> the<00:01:22.280> biggest<00:01:22.609> gap<00:01:22.789> between<00:01:23.060> the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
between the the biggest gap between the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.249 
between the the biggest gap between the
goalkeeper<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:23.899> post

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
goalkeeper and the post

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.289 
goalkeeper and the post
I'm<00:01:24.590> not<00:01:24.859> lining<00:01:25.159> it<00:01:25.340> up<00:01:25.399> directly<00:01:25.969> with<00:01:26.090> the

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
I'm not lining it up directly with the

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.910 
I'm not lining it up directly with the
this<00:01:26.600> sort<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.930> corner<00:01:27.229> because<00:01:27.649> I<00:01:27.770> want

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
this sort of the corner because I want

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.230 
this sort of the corner because I want
to<00:01:27.979> allow<00:01:28.189> for<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.460> little<00:01:28.729> bit<00:01:28.820> of<00:01:28.880> movement<00:01:29.060> on

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
to allow for a little bit of movement on

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.310 
to allow for a little bit of movement on
the<00:01:29.299> ball<00:01:29.420> which<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.630> which<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:29.990> does<00:01:30.140> happen

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
the ball which is which it does happen

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.840 
the ball which is which it does happen
with<00:01:30.859> this<00:01:31.009> mastery<00:01:31.369> kick<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:31.640> know<00:01:31.670> you're

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
with this mastery kick you know you're

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.880 
with this mastery kick you know you're
putting<00:01:31.969> that<00:01:32.119> much<00:01:32.299> power<00:01:32.509> on<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.530> bullet<00:01:33.799> it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
putting that much power on the bullet it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.319 
putting that much power on the bullet it
that<00:01:34.039> it<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.280> move<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.520> little<00:01:34.850> bit<00:01:35.000> from<00:01:35.210> side

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
that it can move a little bit from side

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.940 
that it can move a little bit from side
to<00:01:35.390> side<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:35.750> I'm<00:01:36.259> playing<00:01:36.469> it<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.649> little<00:01:36.799> bit

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
to side so I'm playing it a little bit

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.380 
to side so I'm playing it a little bit
safe<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.340> just<00:01:37.490> going<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:37.969> for<00:01:38.179> where<00:01:38.299> the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
safe and just going for it for where the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.819 
safe and just going for it for where the
biggest<00:01:38.659> gap<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:39.020> now<00:01:39.350> are<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.649> paying

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
biggest gap is now are you paying

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.740 
biggest gap is now are you paying
attention<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.340> also<00:01:40.670> what<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.090> defending

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
attention to also what the defending

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.209 
attention to also what the defending
team<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:42.020> doing<00:01:42.259> as<00:01:42.350> well<00:01:42.500> in<00:01:42.619> terms<00:01:42.649> of<00:01:43.009> their

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
team is doing as well in terms of their

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.649 
team is doing as well in terms of their
wall<00:01:43.429> the<00:01:43.670> heights<00:01:43.909> of<00:01:43.999> their<00:01:44.149> players<00:01:44.450> where

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
wall the heights of their players where

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.969 
wall the heights of their players where
the<00:01:44.749> physician<00:01:45.109> only<00:01:45.289> plays<00:01:45.499> around<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.859> wall

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
the physician only plays around the wall

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.260 
the physician only plays around the wall
as<00:01:46.130> well<00:01:46.280> yeah<00:01:46.549> a<00:01:46.579> little<00:01:46.880> bit<00:01:46.999> I<00:01:47.030> mean<00:01:47.149> if

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
as well yeah a little bit I mean if

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.700 
as well yeah a little bit I mean if
they've<00:01:47.420> got<00:01:47.600> giants<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.109> the<00:01:48.350> wall<00:01:48.469> and<00:01:48.619> it's

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
they've got giants in the wall and it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.319 
they've got giants in the wall and it's
gonna<00:01:48.829> be<00:01:49.009> tougher<00:01:49.399> to<00:01:49.609> get<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.119> ball<00:01:50.299> over

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
gonna be tougher to get the ball over

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.510 
gonna be tougher to get the ball over
them<00:01:50.719> and<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.200> tend<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.890> sort<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.189> aim<00:01:52.280> for

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
them and so I tend to sort of aim for

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.819 
them and so I tend to sort of aim for
the<00:01:53.210> smaller<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.630> players<00:01:53.899> if<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.380> but

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
the smaller of the players if I can but

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:55.959 
the smaller of the players if I can but
the<00:01:54.950> most<00:01:55.100> important<00:01:55.490> thing<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.789> that<00:01:55.820> a

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
the most important thing is that a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.999 
the most important thing is that a
keeper<00:01:56.509> will<00:01:56.780> be<00:01:56.869> pressed<00:01:57.140> down<00:01:57.200> keep<00:01:57.679> left

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
keeper will be pressed down keep left

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.830 
keeper will be pressed down keep left
stick<00:01:58.189> pushed<00:01:58.429> up<00:01:58.579> as<00:01:58.729> as<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.240> shot<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.539> taking

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
stick pushed up as as the shot is taking

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.660 
stick pushed up as as the shot is taking
place<00:01:59.960> now<00:02:00.380> your<00:02:00.649> second<00:02:01.009> free-kick<00:02:01.369> you've

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
place now your second free-kick you've

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.370 
place now your second free-kick you've
got<00:02:01.819> fries<00:02:02.030> that's<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.390> bit<00:02:02.569> more<00:02:02.899> useful<00:02:03.079> if

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
got fries that's a bit more useful if

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.929 
got fries that's a bit more useful if
you're<00:02:03.530> actually<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.829> bit<00:02:03.950> closer<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.759> goal

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
you're actually a bit closer to the goal

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.190 
you're actually a bit closer to the goal
and<00:02:05.240> not<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.450> edge<00:02:05.539> of<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.689> D<00:02:05.810> but<00:02:05.960> actually

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and not the edge of the D but actually

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.359 
and not the edge of the D but actually
on<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.350> edge<00:02:06.469> of<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.619> penalty<00:02:06.710> area<00:02:06.979> itself

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
on the edge of the penalty area itself

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.340 
on the edge of the penalty area itself
exactly<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:08.360> you've<00:02:08.479> got<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.840> yeah<00:02:09.020> once<00:02:09.200> you

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
exactly if you've got that yeah once you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.020 
exactly if you've got that yeah once you
are<00:02:09.650> sort<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.010> edge<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.460> area<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.880> can

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
are sort of edge of the area you can

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.340 
are sort of edge of the area you can
still<00:02:11.240> score<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.720> powerful<00:02:11.930> free-kick

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
still score with the powerful free-kick

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.840 
still score with the powerful free-kick
and<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.040> do<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.250> pretty<00:02:13.460> much<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> same

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
and you do it in pretty much the same

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.800 
and you do it in pretty much the same
ways<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.210> just<00:02:14.390> talked<00:02:14.570> about

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
ways we just talked about

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.260 
ways we just talked about
but<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:15.590> time<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:16.099> don't<00:02:16.550> hold<00:02:16.849> over<00:02:17.000> you

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
but this time you don't hold over you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.000 
but this time you don't hold over you
just<00:02:17.450> keep<00:02:17.630> up<00:02:17.840> how<00:02:18.200> down<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> left<00:02:18.830> stick

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
just keep up how down on the left stick

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.070 
just keep up how down on the left stick
and<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.790> want<00:02:19.970> around<00:02:20.360> sort<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.840> two

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
and then you want around sort of two

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.570 
and then you want around sort of two
bars<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.410> power<00:02:21.590> generally<00:02:22.069> from<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.340> kind

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
bars of power generally from that kind

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.729 
bars of power generally from that kind
of<00:02:22.640> distance<00:02:22.900> should<00:02:23.900> should<00:02:24.230> take<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.530> again

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
of distance should should take it again

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.410 
of distance should should take it again
over<00:02:24.980> over<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.310> wall<00:02:25.430> under<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> bar<00:02:25.910> you're

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
over over the wall under the bar you're

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.940 
over over the wall under the bar you're
not<00:02:26.540> holding<00:02:26.720> Elbe<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.319> time<00:02:27.530> what<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.830> that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
not holding Elbe this time what is that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.800 
not holding Elbe this time what is that
actually<00:02:28.220> doing<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.940> ball<00:02:29.090> well<00:02:29.480> when<00:02:29.750> you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
actually doing to the ball well when you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.300 
actually doing to the ball well when you
hold<00:02:29.959> Elbe<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.590> sort<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:30.860> them<00:02:31.069> gets

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
hold Elbe that that sort of them gets

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.890 
hold Elbe that that sort of them gets
your<00:02:31.400> player<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.910> really<00:02:32.120> smash<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.780> then

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
your player to really smash it and then

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.180 
your player to really smash it and then
you'll<00:02:33.200> notice<00:02:33.349> that<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.800> give<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.160> a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
you'll notice that if you give it a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.710 
you'll notice that if you give it a
lower<00:02:34.670> power<00:02:34.910> when<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.239> when<00:02:35.330> he<00:02:35.390> strikes<00:02:35.630> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
lower power when it when he strikes the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.420 
lower power when it when he strikes the
ball<00:02:35.900> then<00:02:36.019> it'll<00:02:36.170> be<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> much<00:02:36.620> lower<00:02:36.860> freaking

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
ball then it'll be a much lower freaking

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.610 
ball then it'll be a much lower freaking
I'm<00:02:38.030> almost<00:02:38.300> hit<00:02:38.540> on<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.110> ground<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.440> some

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
I'm almost hit on the ground in some

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.890 
I'm almost hit on the ground in some
cases<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.730> by<00:02:40.910> overpowering<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.690> that

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
cases so by overpowering that that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.330 
cases so by overpowering that that
that's<00:02:42.050> what<00:02:42.260> gets<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.590> into<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.920> air<00:02:43.040> and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
that's what gets it into the air and

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.890 
that's what gets it into the air and
keeps<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.700> moving<00:02:43.819> really<00:02:44.120> quickly<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:44.780> when

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
keeps it moving really quickly so when

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.210 
keeps it moving really quickly so when
attempting<00:02:45.110> free<00:02:45.440> kicks<00:02:45.709> there's<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.040> couple

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
attempting free kicks there's a couple

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.620 
attempting free kicks there's a couple
of<00:02:46.370> options<00:02:46.459> you've<00:02:46.819> got<00:02:46.940> power<00:02:47.180> but<00:02:47.510> you've

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
of options you've got power but you've

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.270 
of options you've got power but you've
also<00:02:47.780> got<00:02:48.080> curling<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.650> ball<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:48.980> actually

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
also got curling the ball and actually

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.559 
also got curling the ball and actually
using<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.610> bit<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.819> finesse<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.269> get<00:02:50.390> around

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
using a bit of finesse to get around

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.420 
using a bit of finesse to get around
cake<00:02:50.780> yeah<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.080> do<00:02:51.470> still<00:02:51.739> use<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.250> code

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
cake yeah I do still use that the code

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.280 
cake yeah I do still use that the code
free-kick<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.030> really<00:02:53.510> nice<00:02:53.660> one<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.140> mean

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
free-kick is a really nice one I mean

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.780 
free-kick is a really nice one I mean
it's<00:02:54.380> usually<00:02:54.650> quite<00:02:55.010> reliable<00:02:55.430> for<00:02:55.580> at<00:02:55.670> least

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
it's usually quite reliable for at least

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.509 
it's usually quite reliable for at least
hitting<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.630> target<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:57.319> this<00:02:58.069> time<00:02:58.250> if<00:02:58.400> I'm

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
hitting the target so this time if I'm

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.160 
hitting the target so this time if I'm
trying<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.850> curl<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.150> ball<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.019> right

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
trying to curl the ball to the right

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.990 
trying to curl the ball to the right
around<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.680> wall<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:01.130> will<00:03:01.610> use<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.760> right

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
around the wall I will use a right

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.150 
around the wall I will use a right
footed<00:03:02.299> player<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:03.019> I'm<00:03:03.200> aiming<00:03:03.590> around<00:03:03.950> sort

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
footed player and I'm aiming around sort

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.309 
footed player and I'm aiming around sort
of<00:03:04.220> two<00:03:04.430> players<00:03:04.670> with<00:03:04.970> passed<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.810> pipe<00:03:06.019> so

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
of two players with passed the pipe so

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.630 
of two players with passed the pipe so
I'm<00:03:06.500> actually<00:03:06.590> lining<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.069> ball<00:03:07.220> up<00:03:07.400> off

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
I'm actually lining the ball up off

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.699 
I'm actually lining the ball up off
target<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.299> then<00:03:08.810> I'm<00:03:08.900> curling<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.349> back<00:03:09.530> in

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
target and then I'm curling it back in

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.380 
target and then I'm curling it back in
by<00:03:09.920> holding<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> left<00:03:10.700> stick<00:03:10.849> completely<00:03:11.269> to

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
by holding the left stick completely to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.089 
by holding the left stick completely to
the<00:03:11.480> left<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.140> selecting<00:03:12.650> about<00:03:12.830> one<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.040> a

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
the left and selecting about one and a

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.890 
the left and selecting about one and a
half<00:03:13.280> hours<00:03:13.519> of<00:03:13.640> power<00:03:13.849> which<00:03:14.060> should<00:03:14.660> usually

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
half hours of power which should usually

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.720 
half hours of power which should usually
be<00:03:15.080> enough<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.590> keep<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.190> ball<00:03:16.280> moving<00:03:16.459> fast

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
be enough to keep the ball moving fast

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.070 
be enough to keep the ball moving fast
enough<00:03:16.819> while<00:03:17.090> still<00:03:17.330> allowing<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.720> time<00:03:17.900> for

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
enough while still allowing the time for

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.750 
enough while still allowing the time for
it<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.230> spin<00:03:18.410> back<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.799> so<00:03:19.280> obviously<00:03:19.640> there

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
it to spin back in so obviously there

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.310 
it to spin back in so obviously there
are<00:03:19.850> some<00:03:19.940> step-by-step<00:03:20.570> processes<00:03:21.019> within

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
are some step-by-step processes within

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.020 
are some step-by-step processes within
taking<00:03:21.859> these<00:03:21.950> free<00:03:22.100> kicks<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.670> guess<00:03:22.880> it's

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
taking these free kicks but I guess it's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.069 
taking these free kicks but I guess it's
just<00:03:23.060> best<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.390> go<00:03:23.510> into<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.810> arena<00:03:23.870> and

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
just best to go into the arena and

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.449 
just best to go into the arena and
practice<00:03:24.410> isn't<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.739> yeah<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.130> mean<00:03:25.340> it

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
practice isn't it yeah I mean it

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.130 
practice isn't it yeah I mean it
especially<00:03:25.700> helps<00:03:26.120> with<00:03:26.329> working<00:03:26.930> on<00:03:27.019> how

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
especially helps with working on how

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.479 
especially helps with working on how
long<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.410> need<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.590> hold<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.160> shoot<00:03:28.340> button

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
long you need to hold the shoot button

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.430 
long you need to hold the shoot button
down<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.970> for<00:03:29.120> each<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.359> these<00:03:29.450> week<00:03:30.109> it<00:03:30.319> you

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
down to it for each of these week it you

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.479 
down to it for each of these week it you
know<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.620> can<00:03:31.100> see<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.370> they're<00:03:31.459> all

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
know you can see that they're all

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.520 
know you can see that they're all
slightly<00:03:31.790> different<00:03:31.940> ones<00:03:32.329> 3<00:03:32.540> bar<00:03:32.720> 2<00:03:32.900> bar<00:03:33.140> 1/2

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
slightly different ones 3 bar 2 bar 1/2

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.530 
slightly different ones 3 bar 2 bar 1/2
bar<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.640> timing<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.030> obviously

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
bar and the timing is obviously

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.990 
bar and the timing is obviously
different<00:03:35.930> for<00:03:36.380> each<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.650> those<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.160> even<00:03:37.910> if

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
different for each of those so even if

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.190 
different for each of those so even if
you<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:38.209> work<00:03:38.390> on<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.600> in<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.959> arena<00:03:39.140> and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
you just work on that in the arena and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.180 
you just work on that in the arena and
that's<00:03:39.350> really<00:03:39.560> going<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.709> help<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:39.980> when<00:03:40.130> you

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
that's really going to help you when you

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.590 
that's really going to help you when you
get<00:03:40.310> into<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.519> game<00:03:40.670> situation<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.390> you've<00:03:41.480> got

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
get into a game situation and you've got

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.490 
get into a game situation and you've got
one<00:03:41.720> chance<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:42.140> get<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.350> right

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
one chance to get it right

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.080 
one chance to get it right
great<00:03:43.190> that's<00:03:43.400> all<00:03:43.459> we're<00:03:43.579> gonna<00:03:43.670> cover<00:03:43.910> on
