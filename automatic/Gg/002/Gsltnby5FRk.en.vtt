00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
let's see now I found this spot I don't

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.740 
let's see now I found this spot I don't
I<00:02:05.310> mean<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> third<00:02:06.360> date<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
I mean it's like the third date is the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.510 
I mean it's like the third date is the
games<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.680> don't<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.099> anyone<00:02:08.399> else

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
games for now I don't think anyone else

games for now I don't think anyone else
has<00:02:08.700> found<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> spot<00:02:10.129> basically<00:02:11.129> how<00:02:11.220> it

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
has found the spot basically how it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.130 
has found the spot basically how it
would<00:02:11.520> work<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.270> were<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.870> plant

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
would work if you would were to plant

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.370 
would work if you would were to plant
the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.350

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
bond right here you've been playing it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.510 
bond right here you've been playing it
on<00:02:15.450> top<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> two<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.890> as<00:02:17.100> far<00:02:17.400> away

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
on top of the two or like as far away

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.310 
on top of the two or like as far away
from<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:17.940> possible<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.930> then<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.200> were

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
from it as possible and then you were

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.310 
from it as possible and then you were
run<00:02:19.830> over<00:02:19.860> here<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:21.120> actually<00:02:21.330> jump<00:02:22.020> up<00:02:22.110> right

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
run over here you actually jump up right

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.050 
run over here you actually jump up right
here<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:25.190> strafe<00:02:26.190> jump<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.940> this

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
here and then strafe jump on to this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.570 
here and then strafe jump on to this
rail<00:02:27.560> move<00:02:28.560> back<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> little<00:02:28.980> bit<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.550> can

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
rail move back a little bit and you can

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.570 
rail move back a little bit and you can
actually<00:02:29.940> see<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.720> bomb<00:02:31.130> perfectly<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.370> don't

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
actually see the bomb perfectly I don't

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.640 
actually see the bomb perfectly I don't
wanna<00:02:32.730> fall<00:02:33.060> off<00:02:33.300> but<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.780> see<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> edge<00:02:34.560> of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
wanna fall off but you see the edge of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.900 
wanna fall off but you see the edge of
the<00:02:34.740> bottle<00:02:34.950> right<00:02:35.040> there<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.490> see<00:02:35.520> it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the bottle right there you can see it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.060 
the bottle right there you can see it
perfectly<00:02:36.120> say<00:02:37.020> all<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.830> jump

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
perfectly say all you have to do is jump

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.590 
perfectly say all you have to do is jump
up<00:02:38.220> every<00:02:38.490> few<00:02:38.640> seconds<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.120> check<00:02:39.360> out<00:02:39.450> their

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
up every few seconds to check out their

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.540 
up every few seconds to check out their
diffusing<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.230> they<00:02:40.350> are<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.460> I

diffusing and if they are you can I
throw<00:02:41.700> your<00:02:41.910> stun<00:02:43.010> yeah<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.850> pretty

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
throw your stun yeah and so it's pretty

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.280 
throw your stun yeah and so it's pretty
good<00:02:45.240> protection<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.780> what's<00:02:45.900> really<00:02:46.140> going

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
good protection on what's really going

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.860 
good protection on what's really going
to<00:02:46.350> look<00:02:46.470> back<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.330> also<00:02:48.330> if<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.720> want

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
crosshair somewhere in the middle to be

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.820 
crosshair somewhere in the middle to be
prepared<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.900> they're<00:03:01.410> not<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.740> to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
and this is I going to be a main route

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.910 
and this is I going to be a main route
for<00:03:16.220> SMD<00:03:17.510> competitive<00:03:18.510> players<00:03:18.750> as<00:03:19.410> they<00:03:19.470> can

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
for SMD competitive players as they can

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.650 
for SMD competitive players as they can
see<00:03:20.160> right<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.640> they<00:03:20.820> can<00:03:20.970> see<00:03:21.150> over<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.450> box
