00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.490
 device we always thought about design 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.490
 which is more than just a way 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:23.980
 creations we do is to have this something 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.759
 performed on many different levels 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.759
 defend good 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.210
 ultimately design determines 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 a huge part 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 from our perception 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.180
 offender visa and i think that depth 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:01:00.010
 beauty lies in the simplicity of connectivity 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:03.140
 and efficiency true beauty 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.720
 formed from much more than 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.600
 only absence from ordinary jewelry 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:18.710
 this is ordering uncertainty 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:25.250
 and his 7 is a clear view of these 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.950
 goals she has a completely new 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.960
 clear structure 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.860
 applied throughout the system after 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.860
 infosys 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.610
 and at the end we thought through all the smallest 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.700
 details for example reworked fonts be 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 larger sizes are also larger 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.390
 items for example new design a silicone 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.330
 ok system development allowed us 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.320
 achieve much greater harmony between 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.720
 we also implemented individual elements 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.720
 completely new color palette 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.970
 various functional their own allows 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.970
 set high resolution and order 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.030
 using transparency gives 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.150
 meaningful meaning 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.100
 mapping this solution in conjunction with 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.459
 new approaches to animation 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.330
 hand movement create a sense of depth and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.330
 reality 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.690
 iphone responds to your movement in 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.530
 in many ways creating a completely new 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.530
 depth impression 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.630
 in many ways we are trying to create 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.099
 interface which is more 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:13.470
 unobtrusive and differential it's on 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.220
 in fact, the design increases 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.260
 easy access to content 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.750
 changing wallpaper 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.730
 has a very noticeable impact but you 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.040
 correctly combined with the whole system 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.040
 iphone os ring my sister 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.300
 and his 7 is brand new 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.200
 system and therefore for us it was very 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.200
 it's important to make it recognizable quickly . 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.530
 wanted to take operating experience which 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.690
 people themselves know very well and create 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.690
 his 10 feet and nicer 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.440
 add to redesigned interface 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:06.250
 rs7 came some brand new 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.920
 interesting features now items 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.250
 quick access controls oh collected in 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.760
 one convenient place called control 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.650
 Center Shinsa killed a lot with one swipe 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.550
 any screen opens the panel 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.890
 of management 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.790
 and the notification center is now available 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.050
 immediately from the lock screen 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.030
 multitasking allows you to transition 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.120
 from application to application 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.400
 much more intuitive actually 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.230
 she pays attention to which applications 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.290
 you use more often 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.280
 and automatically updates their background 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:45.520
 In the program mode, the camera has also been updated. 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.860
 there are filters for taking pictures and 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.860
 new square shooting mode 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.790
 iphone photo application uses 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.400
 location information 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.400
 for the competent organization of albums 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.950
 now maclaud photo sharing friends and 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.770

 thousands of apps from the appstore 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.380
 the world's largest application store 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.200
 ios 7 now shows popular next 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.810

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:31.740
 based on your current 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:33.750

 single field makes it easy to search and have your 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.080
 bookmarks 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:17.730
 now the new species matched also the new 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.130
 way to view siri's contribution now and yet 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.470
 more useful and informative with 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.990
 integrated twitter and wikipedia

 strength sounds better than ever 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.470
 sphere can help with new ways 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:38.040
 For example, changing the settings of your ios 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.919
 aytyuns radio devices are a great way 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.380
 find new music we created a lot 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.960
 popular stations consisting of the best 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.250
 children's songs you can easily create 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.620
 own station 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.790
 and if you hear the song you want 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.240
 buy it done in our one 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.220
 those file 7 brings with it the most 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.500
 significant change that we 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:05.100
 done for the user interface 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.100
 photo since the introduction of the very first ais 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.800
 to create it we have collected a spectrum 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.620
 knowledge from design to engineering 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:18.250
 designing together we were able to achieve 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.710
 and all that we see in ios 7 and this 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.080
 is the beginning of a new important 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.860
 directions and in many ways it is 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.860
 with beginnings
