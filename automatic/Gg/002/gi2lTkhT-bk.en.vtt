up<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.820> I'm<00:00:18.060> hoping<00:00:18.300> that's<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.380> problem

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
up and I'm hoping that's not a problem

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.790 
up and I'm hoping that's not a problem
because<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:21.119> would<00:00:21.300> suck<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
because it would suck if it is and I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
because it would suck if it is and I
don't<00:00:23.070> know<00:00:23.250> at<00:00:24.000> least<00:00:24.060> something<00:00:24.750> my<00:00:25.050> sister

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199

don't know at least something my sister
I<00:00:25.500> don't<00:00:25.830> know<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.250> true<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.670> but

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
I don't know this is true or not but

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.759 
I don't know this is true or not but
this<00:00:27.060> person<00:00:27.390> says<00:00:27.539> up<00:00:27.660> there<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:28.500> wasn't

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
this person says up there this wasn't

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.470 
this person says up there this wasn't
like<00:00:28.949> blood<00:00:29.310> clotted<00:00:29.699> up<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> cold

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
like blood clotted up and just a cold

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.030 
like blood clotted up and just a cold
that<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:30.929> had<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.500> start<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
that and they had to get it to start to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.069 
that and they had to get it to start to
bleed<00:00:32.340> again<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.600> caught<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.960> again

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
bleed again for that get caught up again

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.920 
bleed again for that get caught up again
I'm<00:00:34.710> hoping<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.719> case

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I'm hoping that that is not the case

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.150 
I'm hoping that that is not the case
with<00:00:37.140> me<00:00:37.910> everything<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.059> fine<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> dandy

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
with me everything is fine and dandy

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.510 
with me everything is fine and dandy
so<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.940> stuck<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.770> wasn't<00:00:46.370> anyways<00:00:47.370> I'm

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
so it's stuck if it wasn't anyways I'm

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
so it's stuck if it wasn't anyways I'm
really<00:00:47.730> tired<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.570> hungry<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.890> should
