hi my name is Larry Jordan and welcome

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi my name is Larry Jordan and welcome
to<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.510> powerup<00:00:03.959> tutorial<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.830> creating

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
to this powerup tutorial on creating

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.740 
to this powerup tutorial on creating
motion<00:00:06.089> menus<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:06.839> DVDs<00:00:07.400> using<00:00:08.400> motion<00:00:08.760> we've

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
motion menus for DVDs using motion we've

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.870 
motion menus for DVDs using motion we've
done<00:00:09.990> menus<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:10.860> DVDs<00:00:11.219> for<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.490> long<00:00:11.639> time

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
done menus for DVDs for a long time

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.509 
done menus for DVDs for a long time
inside<00:00:12.240> Photoshop<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.500> now<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.190> start<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
inside Photoshop but now we can start to

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
inside Photoshop but now we can start to
add<00:00:14.639> motion<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.299> them<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.690> there's<00:00:15.839> lots<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
add motion to them and there's lots of

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.960 
add motion to them and there's lots of
different<00:00:16.410> applications<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.100> allow<00:00:17.220> us<00:00:17.550> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
different applications that allow us to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000 
different applications that allow us to
add<00:00:18.119> motion<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.810> our<00:00:18.930> menus<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
add motion to our menus but one of the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.880 
add motion to our menus but one of the
best<00:00:20.310> ones<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:21.090> motion<00:00:21.660> itself<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.680> problem

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
best ones is motion itself the problem

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.710 
best ones is motion itself the problem
is<00:00:23.160> motion<00:00:23.609> has<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> different<00:00:24.180> interface<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
is motion has a different interface and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.509 
is motion has a different interface and
sometimes<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.260> difficult<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.830> learn<00:00:25.980> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
sometimes it's difficult to learn so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.429 
sometimes it's difficult to learn so
what<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> want<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.240> today<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.019> walk<00:00:28.260> you

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
what I want to do today is to walk you

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.890 
what I want to do today is to walk you
through<00:00:28.650> two<00:00:29.279> different<00:00:29.670> processes<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.630> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
through two different processes one is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.500 
through two different processes one is
the<00:00:31.080> process<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> creating<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.399> menu<00:00:33.030> inside

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the process of creating a menu inside

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.360 
the process of creating a menu inside
motion<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.140> getting<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> DVD<00:00:34.950> Studio<00:00:35.280> Pro

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
motion and getting in a DVD Studio Pro

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.880 
motion and getting in a DVD Studio Pro
and<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> second<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.140> create<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.649> very

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and the second is to create a very

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.190 
and the second is to create a very
nice-looking<00:00:38.329> motion<00:00:39.329> menu<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:39.840> you've<00:00:39.989> got

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
nice-looking motion menu when you've got

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.220 
nice-looking motion menu when you've got
0<00:00:40.680> design<00:00:41.190> skills<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.910> no<00:00:42.420> resources<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.079> work

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
0 design skills and no resources to work

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.750 
0 design skills and no resources to work
with<00:00:43.440> except<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.160> comes<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.640> the

with except that which comes with the
motion<00:00:45.120> library<00:00:45.840> itself<00:00:46.260> there's<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> lot<00:00:47.280> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
motion library itself there's a lot of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.860 
motion library itself there's a lot of
stuff<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> cover<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.239> looking<00:00:48.510> forward

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
stuff to cover and I'm looking forward

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.690 
stuff to cover and I'm looking forward
to<00:00:48.930> showing<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.370> let's<00:00:50.579> get

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to showing it to you so let's get

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.630 
to showing it to you so let's get
ourselves<00:00:50.820> started<00:00:51.800> why<00:00:52.800> should<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.100> even<00:00:53.280> use

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
ourselves started why should we even use

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
ourselves started why should we even use
motion<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.300> DVD<00:00:54.660> menus

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
motion for DVD menus

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.680 
motion for DVD menus
well<00:00:55.530> motion<00:00:56.039> easily<00:00:56.460> creates<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.239> combines

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
well motion easily creates and combines

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.619 
well motion easily creates and combines
audio<00:00:58.350> video<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.370> graphic<00:00:59.910> elements<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.449> a

audio video and graphic elements in a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.900 
audio video and graphic elements in a
single<00:01:01.020> file<00:01:01.260> other<00:01:02.039> applications<00:01:02.789> can

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
single file other applications can

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.719 
single file other applications can
combine<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.719> motion<00:01:04.470> creates<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.400> well

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
combine them motion creates them as well

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.270 
combine them motion creates them as well
and<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.600> easy<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> round<00:01:07.229> trip<00:01:07.560> between<00:01:07.770> DVD

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and it's easy to round trip between DVD

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
and it's easy to round trip between DVD
Studio<00:01:08.580> Pro<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.119> motion<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.869> making

Studio Pro and motion for making
adjustments<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> files<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.670> create

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
adjustments to the files that we create

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.080 
adjustments to the files that we create
there's<00:01:12.960> no<00:01:13.170> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> render<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.189> export<00:01:14.880> our

movie files all we have to do is to save

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
movie files all we have to do is to save
the<00:01:17.880> motion<00:01:18.240> project<00:01:18.689> which<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> far<00:01:19.380> smaller

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the motion project which is far smaller

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.190 
the motion project which is far smaller
than<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.130> movie<00:01:20.430> file<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.689> easily<00:01:21.869> create

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
than a movie file we can easily create

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.340 
than a movie file we can easily create
DVD<00:01:22.710> menu<00:01:23.040> button<00:01:23.340> overlays<00:01:23.820> inside<00:01:24.420> motion

DVD menu button overlays inside motion

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.980 
DVD menu button overlays inside motion
and<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.100> easily<00:01:26.310> set<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.000> modify<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> DVD

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and we can easily set and modify the DVD

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929 
and we can easily set and modify the DVD
menu<00:01:28.140> loop<00:01:28.560> point<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
menu loop point now I'm not going to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.060 
menu loop point now I'm not going to
define<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> DVD<00:01:31.110> menu<00:01:31.229> loop<00:01:31.590> point<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
define what the DVD menu loop point is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.160 
define what the DVD menu loop point is
for<00:01:32.400> right<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:33.630> define<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
for right now but I will define it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.740 
for right now but I will define it
