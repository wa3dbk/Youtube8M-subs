driving following the road signs to
fleet<00:00:15.960> Vince<00:00:16.960> I'm<00:00:17.110> looking<00:00:17.439> ahead<00:00:17.560> trying<00:00:18.070> to

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
fleet Vince I'm looking ahead trying to

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.400 
fleet Vince I'm looking ahead trying to
keep<00:00:18.310> an<00:00:18.460> eye<00:00:18.550> out<00:00:18.580> for<00:00:18.730> signs<00:00:19.110> even<00:00:20.110> on<00:00:20.290> my

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
keep an eye out for signs even on my

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.750 
keep an eye out for signs even on my
mirrors<00:00:20.710> regularly<00:00:21.070> as<00:00:21.130> well<00:00:21.160> so<00:00:21.430> I<00:00:21.460> can<00:00:21.610> see<00:00:21.730> a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
mirrors regularly as well so I can see a

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.220 
mirrors regularly as well so I can see a
triangle<00:00:22.060> sign<00:00:22.360> for<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.599> roundabout<00:00:22.900> something

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
triangle sign for a roundabout something

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.200 
triangle sign for a roundabout something
check<00:00:23.380> my<00:00:23.470> mirror<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:23.740> ease<00:00:23.830> off<00:00:24.060> looking<00:00:25.060> for

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
check my mirror and ease off looking for

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.729 
check my mirror and ease off looking for
direction<00:00:25.329> of<00:00:25.660> science<00:00:25.900> I<00:00:25.960> can't<00:00:26.169> see<00:00:26.380> any<00:00:26.529> I

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
direction of science I can't see any I

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.280 
direction of science I can't see any I
can't<00:00:27.430> see<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.579> mini<00:00:27.820> roundabout<00:00:28.180> side<00:00:28.419> so

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
can't see a mini roundabout side so

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.630 
can't see a mini roundabout side so
there<00:00:29.590> probably<00:00:29.619> aren't<00:00:30.070> any<00:00:30.160> so<00:00:30.430> I'm<00:00:30.489> going

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
there probably aren't any so I'm going

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.970 
there probably aren't any so I'm going
to<00:00:30.669> follow<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:31.090> road<00:00:31.210> ahead<00:00:31.360> so<00:00:32.290> checking<00:00:32.829> my

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
to follow the road ahead so checking my

can<00:00:35.380> see<00:00:35.530> if<00:00:35.620> it's<00:00:35.770> clear<00:00:35.920> or<00:00:36.160> not

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
can see if it's clear or not

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.190 
can see if it's clear or not
yeah<00:00:37.120> it's<00:00:37.270> all<00:00:37.360> clear<00:00:37.570> for<00:00:37.660> me<00:00:37.780> just<00:00:37.960> checking

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
yeah it's all clear for me just checking

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.710 
yeah it's all clear for me just checking
for<00:00:38.230> Bob<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.649> Tom<00:00:38.770> as<00:00:38.920> we<00:00:39.010> make<00:00:39.160> progress<00:00:39.720> home

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720

remember to have a double following

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.070 
remember to have a double following
distance<00:00:51.250> so<00:00:51.970> four<00:00:52.270> seconds<00:00:52.720> instead<00:00:53.020> of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
distance so four seconds instead of

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.740 
distance so four seconds instead of

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.800 

and<00:04:01.490> you<00:04:01.790> rate<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.150> mirrors<00:04:02.420> making<00:04:02.690> sure

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
and you rate the mirrors making sure

it's safe to get up to speed as a 40

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.120 
it's safe to get up to speed as a 40
right<00:04:06.140> now<00:04:06.170> it's<00:04:06.530> like<00:04:06.650> making<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.950> little<00:04:07.040> bit

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
right now it's like making a little bit

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.370 
right now it's like making a little bit
more<00:04:07.250> progress<00:04:07.700> from<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.090> safety<00:04:08.570> now<00:04:09.230> we're

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
more progress from the safety now we're

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.460 
more progress from the safety now we're
still<00:04:09.500> following<00:04:09.710> the<00:04:09.950> fleet<00:04:10.160> signs
