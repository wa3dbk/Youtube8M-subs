00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.710 

let's<00:00:01.260> learn<00:00:01.650> about<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:02.580> band<00:00:02.970> theory<00:00:03.449> of

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
let's learn about the band theory of

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.970 
let's learn about the band theory of
solids<00:00:04.440> okay<00:00:05.359> let's<00:00:06.359> just<00:00:06.600> say<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:07.140> have<00:00:07.529> two

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
solids okay let's just say I have two

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.250 
solids okay let's just say I have two
hydrogen<00:00:08.940> atoms<00:00:09.150> okay

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
hydrogen atoms okay

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.459 
hydrogen atoms okay
these<00:00:10.710> hydrogen<00:00:11.639> atoms<00:00:11.820> are<00:00:12.389> at<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.410> moment

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
these hydrogen atoms are at this moment

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.450 
these hydrogen atoms are at this moment
very<00:00:14.250> far<00:00:14.730> from<00:00:15.210> each<00:00:15.450> other<00:00:15.719> okay<00:00:16.100> so<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
very far from each other okay so this is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.349 
very far from each other okay so this is
your<00:00:17.609> nuclei<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:19.039> your<00:00:20.119> electron<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
your nuclei and your electron is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.220 
your nuclei and your electron is
orbiting<00:00:21.930> around<00:00:22.260> your<00:00:22.970> nucleus<00:00:23.970> okay<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.170> you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
orbiting around your nucleus okay so you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.040 
orbiting around your nucleus okay so you
have<00:00:25.560> two<00:00:25.920> hydrogen<00:00:26.730> atoms<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.869> know

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
have two hydrogen atoms and we know

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.109 
have two hydrogen atoms and we know
hydrogen<00:00:28.769> atom<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.189> having<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.640> single

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
hydrogen atom is having a single

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.340 
hydrogen atom is having a single
electron<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.769> gonna<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:33.120> s<00:00:33.450> energy

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
electron so it's gonna be one s energy

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.920 
electron so it's gonna be one s energy
level<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.219> your<00:00:35.820> electron<00:00:36.420> would<00:00:36.690> be

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
level in which your electron would be

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.280 
level in which your electron would be
orbiting<00:00:37.860> around<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.670> nuclei<00:00:39.660> okay

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
orbiting around the nuclei okay

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.740 
orbiting around the nuclei okay
so<00:00:40.680> electron<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.000> guy<00:00:42.270> would<00:00:42.570> be

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
so electron in this guy would be

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.959 
so electron in this guy would be
orbiting<00:00:43.050> around<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.770> nucleus<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.730> one

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
orbiting around the nucleus for this one

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.750 
orbiting around the nucleus for this one
at<00:00:45.149> awareness<00:00:45.750> level<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.370> similarly<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
at awareness level and similarly for the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.290 
at awareness level and similarly for the
other<00:00:48.030> hydrogen<00:00:48.510> atom<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.530> well<00:00:50.219> okay<00:00:50.610> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
other hydrogen atom as well okay you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
other hydrogen atom as well okay you
already<00:00:51.719> must<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.110> knowing<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:53.370> are

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
already must be knowing that there are

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.779 
already must be knowing that there are
well-defined<00:00:54.329> energy<00:00:54.960> levels<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.610> an

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
well-defined energy levels that an

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.349 
well-defined energy levels that an
electron<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.739> take<00:00:58.739> okay<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.030> have

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
electron can take okay so you have

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.800 
electron can take okay so you have
energy<00:01:00.870> levels<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.789> 1s<00:01:02.789> 2s<00:01:04.010> 2p<00:01:05.010> 3s<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.479> on

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
energy levels like 1s 2s 2p 3s and so on

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.730 
energy levels like 1s 2s 2p 3s and so on
so<00:01:07.560> within<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:08.010> 2p<00:01:08.670> also<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.869> 3

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
so within your 2p also you have your 3

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.120 
so within your 2p also you have your 3
sub<00:01:11.220> levels<00:01:11.640> ok<00:01:12.080> 2p<00:01:13.080> basically<00:01:13.590> corresponds

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
sub levels ok 2p basically corresponds

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.120 
sub levels ok 2p basically corresponds
to<00:01:14.189> what<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.700> corresponds<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.509> n<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.650> equal<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
to what it corresponds to n is equal to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.789 
to what it corresponds to n is equal to
2<00:01:17.400> L<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.570> equal<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.790> 1<00:01:20.790> ok<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.080> whenever<00:01:22.350> you

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
2 L is equal to 1 ok so whenever you

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
2 L is equal to 1 ok so whenever you
have<00:01:23.009> L<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.790> equal<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.450> whatever<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:25.740> are

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
have L is equal to whatever you are

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.020 
have L is equal to whatever you are
going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.610> 12<00:01:27.450> plus<00:01:27.869> 1<00:01:28.740> sub<00:01:29.250> levels<00:01:29.700> in

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
going to have 12 plus 1 sub levels in

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.319 
going to have 12 plus 1 sub levels in
that<00:01:31.020> energy<00:01:31.619> level<00:01:31.920> okay<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.150> your

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that energy level okay so over here your

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.960 
that energy level okay so over here your
L<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> equal<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.020> 1<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.890> 2<00:01:35.460> into<00:01:35.790> 1

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
L is equal to 1 so you have 2 into 1

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.630 
L is equal to 1 so you have 2 into 1
plus<00:01:36.210> 1<00:01:36.540> 3<00:01:37.320> sub<00:01:37.650> levels<00:01:38.040> within<00:01:38.659> 2p<00:01:39.659> okay<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
plus 1 3 sub levels within 2p okay and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.210 
plus 1 3 sub levels within 2p okay and
our<00:01:41.640> electrons<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.570> filled<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.079> from<00:01:43.470> top<00:01:44.189> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
our electrons are filled up from top to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.179 
our electrons are filled up from top to
bottom<00:01:44.810> fashion<00:01:45.810> okay<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.799> lowest

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
bottom fashion okay from the lowest

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.999 
bottom fashion okay from the lowest
energy<00:01:47.520> level<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> highest<00:01:49.259> energy<00:01:49.979> level

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
energy level to the highest energy level
over<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.149> since<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.750> only<00:01:52.140> one

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
over here since we have only one

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.069 
over here since we have only one
electron<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.130> gonna<00:01:53.369> take<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.079> 1s

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
electron it's gonna take up the 1s

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.300 
electron it's gonna take up the 1s
energy<00:01:56.070> level<00:01:56.939> okay<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:58.200> when<00:01:59.040> these

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
energy level okay now when these

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.999 
energy level okay now when these
electrons<00:02:00.149> are<00:02:00.420> very<00:02:00.750> far<00:02:01.110> away<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.740> have

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
electrons are very far away they have

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.389 
electrons are very far away they have
their<00:02:02.670> own<00:02:02.880> 1s<00:02:03.600> energy<00:02:04.200> level<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.680> which<00:02:04.860> they

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
their own 1s energy level in which they

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.859 
their own 1s energy level in which they
are<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.060> orbiting<00:02:06.990> okay<00:02:07.849> however

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
are going to be orbiting okay however

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.970 
are going to be orbiting okay however
when<00:02:09.869> these<00:02:11.239> atoms<00:02:12.239> are<00:02:12.540> brought<00:02:13.230> closer

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
when these atoms are brought closer

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.900 
when these atoms are brought closer
together<00:02:14.340> okay<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.989> when<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.920> happens<00:02:17.489> when

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
together okay so when this happens when

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.449 
together okay so when this happens when
the<00:02:18.180> distance<00:02:18.750> between<00:02:19.050> their<00:02:19.560> nucleus<00:02:20.069> is

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
the distance between their nucleus is

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.430 
the distance between their nucleus is
comparable<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.870> size<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.069> atom<00:02:23.640> then

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
comparable to the size of the atom then

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.670 
comparable to the size of the atom then
interesting<00:02:25.440> things<00:02:25.830> happen<00:02:26.400> okay<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:28.530> you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
interesting things happen okay then you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.339 
interesting things happen okay then you
have<00:02:28.920> two<00:02:29.310> possibilities<00:02:29.879> okay<00:02:30.660> your

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
have two possibilities okay your

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.360 
have two possibilities okay your
electron<00:02:32.250> orbitals<00:02:33.120> they<00:02:33.690> overlap<00:02:34.470> when<00:02:35.069> your

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
electron orbitals they overlap when your

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.960 
electron orbitals they overlap when your
atoms<00:02:36.019> come<00:02:37.019> together<00:02:37.410> okay<00:02:38.220> when<00:02:38.459> they<00:02:38.640> start

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
atoms come together okay when they start

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.699 
atoms come together okay when they start
to<00:02:39.209> make<00:02:39.360> bonds<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:41.069> over<00:02:41.700> here<00:02:42.060> my<00:02:43.019> two

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
to make bonds so over here my two

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.800 
to make bonds so over here my two
possibilities<00:02:44.670> are<00:02:44.940> something<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.450> this

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
possibilities are something like this

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.460 
possibilities are something like this
you<00:02:46.290> may<00:02:46.470> have<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> possibility<00:02:47.220> where<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:49.230> is

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
you may have a possibility where this is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.339 
you may have a possibility where this is
the<00:02:49.680> case<00:02:49.709> okay<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.330> your<00:02:51.599> nuclei<00:02:52.019> over

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
the case okay you have your nuclei over

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.309 
the case okay you have your nuclei over
here<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.150> your<00:02:54.510> electronic

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
here and this is your electronic

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.830 
here and this is your electronic
orbitals<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:56.880> electrons<00:02:57.420> are<00:02:57.660> now

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
orbitals so your electrons are now

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.800 
orbitals so your electrons are now
orbiting<00:02:58.440> around<00:02:58.650> both<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.610> these<00:02:59.970> nucleus

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
orbiting around both of these nucleus

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.860 
orbiting around both of these nucleus
and<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:02.130> probability<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.150> finding<00:03:03.480> an

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
and the probability of finding an

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.120 
and the probability of finding an
electron<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.769> higher<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.970> these<00:03:06.569> regions<00:03:07.200> okay

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
electron is higher in these regions okay

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.539 
electron is higher in these regions okay
the<00:03:08.700> other<00:03:09.000> possibility<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.370> something<00:03:11.370> like

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
the other possibility is something like

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.800 
the other possibility is something like
this<00:03:11.870> in<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.319> case<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.599> possibility<00:03:15.599> of

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
this in this case the possibility of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.349 
this in this case the possibility of
finding<00:03:16.410> an<00:03:16.739> electron<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.370> higher<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:18.030> this

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
finding an electron is higher in this

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.460 
finding an electron is higher in this
region<00:03:18.780> between<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.709> two<00:03:20.130> nucleons<00:03:20.870> okay<00:03:21.870> so

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
region between the two nucleons okay so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.550 
region between the two nucleons okay so
when<00:03:22.859> your<00:03:23.310> electron<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.120> over<00:03:24.989> here<00:03:25.260> between

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
when your electron is over here between

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.539 
when your electron is over here between
the<00:03:25.920> two<00:03:25.950> nucleus<00:03:26.760> then<00:03:27.660> obviously<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:29.190> is

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
the two nucleus then obviously it is

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.900 
the two nucleus then obviously it is
being<00:03:30.299> affected<00:03:30.989> by<00:03:31.170> both<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:32.069> nucleus<00:03:32.579> and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
being affected by both the nucleus and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.229 
being affected by both the nucleus and
it's<00:03:33.030> going<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.359> be<00:03:33.480> more<00:03:33.840> stable<00:03:34.680> okay<00:03:35.400> more

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
it's going to be more stable okay more

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.840 
it's going to be more stable okay more
stable<00:03:37.049> configuration<00:03:37.859> corresponds<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.639> a

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
stable configuration corresponds to a

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.020 
stable configuration corresponds to a
lesser<00:03:39.329> energy<00:03:39.900> configuration<00:03:40.470> okay<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.760> in

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
lesser energy configuration okay so in

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.830 
lesser energy configuration okay so in
this<00:03:42.299> case<00:03:42.600> your<00:03:43.200> electron<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:44.010> having<00:03:44.400> a

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
this case your electron is having a

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.069 
this case your electron is having a
lesser<00:03:45.840> energy<00:03:46.200> okay<00:03:47.130> why<00:03:47.819> in<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.389> other<00:03:48.660> case

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
lesser energy okay why in the other case

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.039 
lesser energy okay why in the other case
where<00:03:49.680> there<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.069> no<00:03:50.850> possibility<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.690> finding

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
where there is no possibility of finding

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.259 
where there is no possibility of finding
an<00:03:52.380> electron<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.519> region<00:03:53.880> between<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
an electron in the region between the

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.039 
an electron in the region between the
two<00:03:54.600> nucleus<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.069> a<00:03:56.670> higher<00:03:57.389> energy

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
two nucleus you have a higher energy

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.970 
two nucleus you have a higher energy
okay<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.459> what<00:03:59.700> you're<00:03:59.910> seeing<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.569> when<00:04:01.560> two

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
okay so what you're seeing is when two

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
okay so what you're seeing is when two
hydrogen<00:04:02.280> atoms<00:04:03.560> they<00:04:04.560> form<00:04:04.889> a<00:04:05.010> molecule<00:04:05.730> or

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
hydrogen atoms they form a molecule or

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.740 
hydrogen atoms they form a molecule or
they<00:04:06.239> interact<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.230> come<00:04:07.859> close<00:04:08.280> together

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
they interact and come close together

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.159 
they interact and come close together
your<00:04:09.750> 1s<00:04:10.549> energy<00:04:11.549> level<00:04:11.940> basically<00:04:12.569> splits

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
your 1s energy level basically splits

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.000 
your 1s energy level basically splits
into<00:04:13.500> two<00:04:14.340> energy<00:04:14.940> levels<00:04:15.269> one<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.349> a<00:04:16.650> higher

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
into two energy levels one is a higher

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.479 
into two energy levels one is a higher
energy<00:04:17.489> level<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.329> other<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:19.560> lovo

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
energy level and the other is the lovo

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.940 
energy level and the other is the lovo
energy<00:04:21.150> level<00:04:21.450> we<00:04:21.959> are<00:04:22.049> talking<00:04:22.409> about<00:04:22.500> higher

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
energy level we are talking about higher

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.610 
energy level we are talking about higher
and<00:04:23.280> lower<00:04:23.550> as<00:04:23.909> compared<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.500> 1s<00:04:26.010> and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
and lower as compared to the 1s and

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.990 
and lower as compared to the 1s and
G<00:04:26.770> level<00:04:27.160> okay<00:04:27.729> so<00:04:28.419> your<00:04:29.139> higher<00:04:29.949> energy<00:04:30.699> level

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
G level okay so your higher energy level

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.520 
G level okay so your higher energy level
which<00:04:31.210> you've<00:04:31.449> seen<00:04:31.479> over<00:04:31.960> here<00:04:32.169> this

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
which you've seen over here this

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.060 
which you've seen over here this
corresponds<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.400> an<00:04:34.410> antibonding<00:04:35.760> orbital

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
corresponds to an antibonding orbital

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.340 
corresponds to an antibonding orbital
okay<00:04:39.660> your<00:04:40.660> lower<00:04:41.260> energy<00:04:42.180> configuration

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
okay your lower energy configuration

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.189 
okay your lower energy configuration
corresponds<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.410> your<00:04:45.030> bonding<00:04:46.030> orbital<00:04:47.490> okay

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
corresponds to your bonding orbital okay

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.850 
corresponds to your bonding orbital okay
so<00:04:50.199> just<00:04:50.800> see<00:04:51.490> what<00:04:51.729> is<00:04:51.880> happening<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:53.530> have

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
so just see what is happening you have

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.510 
so just see what is happening you have
your<00:04:54.190> one<00:04:54.490> is<00:04:54.699> energy<00:04:55.360> level<00:04:55.720> okay<00:04:56.199> when<00:04:56.919> your

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
your one is energy level okay when your

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.410 
your one is energy level okay when your
atoms<00:04:58.389> are<00:04:58.660> far<00:04:59.139> apart
