tree<00:00:41.190> great<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> solid<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.559> try<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
tree great in the solid and we try and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.470 
tree great in the solid and we try and
propagate<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.520> many<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.789> these<00:00:44.879> plants<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.360> we

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
propagate as many of these plants as we

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900 
propagate as many of these plants as we
can<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.440> our<00:00:46.620> forest<00:00:46.950> garden<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
can in our forest garden this is a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.160 
can in our forest garden this is a
really<00:00:48.120> cool<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> grow<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
really cool one because it can grow in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
really cool one because it can grow in
complete<00:00:49.770> shade<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.760> still<00:00:50.969> produces

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
complete shade and it still produces

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.920 
complete shade and it still produces
fruit<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.260> these<00:00:52.410> little<00:00:52.710> green<00:00:53.059> berries<00:00:54.059> go

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
fruit so these little green berries go

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
fruit so these little green berries go
brown<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.680> end<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.129> gorgeous

a countryside that has been denuded of
woodland<00:01:41.040> which<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.930> bit<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> hotly

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
woodland which and a bit of a hotly

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
woodland which and a bit of a hotly
debated<00:01:44.460> thing<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.060> idea<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> UK

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
debated thing this the idea that the UK

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.499 
debated thing this the idea that the UK
was<00:01:46.200> once<00:01:46.380> completely<00:01:46.799> forest<00:01:47.250> people<00:01:48.119> are

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
was once completely forest people are

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.999 
was once completely forest people are
now<00:01:48.659> saying<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> wasn't<00:01:49.740> just

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
now saying actually it wasn't just

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.380 
now saying actually it wasn't just
forests<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:50.790> they<00:01:50.909> weren't<00:01:51.060> there<00:01:51.270> were

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
forests you know they weren't there were

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.210 
forests you know they weren't there were
grazing<00:01:52.290> animals<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> would<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.009> kept

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
grazing animals that would have kept

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.679 
grazing animals that would have kept
certain<00:01:53.460> bits<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.119> free<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.540> would

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
certain bits of it free and you would

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.139 
certain bits of it free and you would
have<00:01:54.810> had<00:01:54.930> more<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> mixture<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.670> but

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
have had more of a mixture going on but

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
have had more of a mixture going on but
even<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.079> look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> countryside

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
even so when you look at the countryside

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.530 
even so when you look at the countryside
now<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.460> isn't<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.790> natural<00:01:59.939> thing

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
now this isn't a natural thing

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.050 
now this isn't a natural thing
this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.230> a<00:02:01.260> desert<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.060> and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this is a this is a desert you know and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
this is a this is a desert you know and
even<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> hedgerows<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.050> are<00:02:04.200> incredibly

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
even the hedgerows that are incredibly

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.260 
even the hedgerows that are incredibly
biodiverse<00:02:05.280> even<00:02:05.610> those<00:02:05.790> are<00:02:05.970> getting

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
biodiverse even those are getting

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.850 
biodiverse even those are getting
removed<00:02:07.020> which<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.500> remain<00:02:07.770> real<00:02:08.250> shame<00:02:08.570> I

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
removed which is a remain real shame I

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.190 
removed which is a remain real shame I
mean<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.009> way<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.730> growing<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.210> is<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.720> 50

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
mean this way of growing is is just 50

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.110 
mean this way of growing is is just 50
million<00:02:13.440> times<00:02:13.590> better<00:02:13.860> than<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.280> you've

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
million times better than that you've

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.890 
million times better than that you've
got<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.630> new<00:02:16.230> relationship<00:02:16.710> with<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.010> insects

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
got a new relationship with the insects

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.840 
got a new relationship with the insects
we<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.440> mean<00:02:19.590> there<00:02:19.710> are<00:02:19.740> bees<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.220> site<00:02:20.520> so

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
we have I mean there are bees on site so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.640 
we have I mean there are bees on site so
we<00:02:21.000> definitely<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:21.990> try<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.320> grow

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
we definitely you know try and grow

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.800 
we definitely you know try and grow
stuff<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.100> they<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:23.670> frankly<00:02:24.660> what

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
stuff that they like but frankly what

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.840 
stuff that they like but frankly what
we're<00:02:24.960> growing<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.470> beneficial<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.520> insects

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
we're growing is beneficial for insects

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.280 
we're growing is beneficial for insects
anyway<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.330> buy<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.660> because<00:02:27.810> we've<00:02:28.140> got

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
anyway just buy it because we've got

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.950 
anyway just buy it because we've got
that<00:02:28.350> diversity<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.100> stuff<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.660> mean

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
that diversity of stuff so then I mean

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.949 
that diversity of stuff so then I mean
it<00:02:31.080> we've<00:02:31.440> never<00:02:31.470> had<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.220> Yelp<00:02:32.520> generally<00:02:33.120> yeah

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
there are issues with over spraying or

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.170 
there are issues with over spraying or
the<00:02:36.630> monocultures<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:38.250> not<00:02:38.820> being<00:02:39.030> very

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the monocultures just not being very

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.030 
the monocultures just not being very
helpful<00:02:39.390> for<00:02:39.780> insects<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.470> mean<00:02:40.940> yeah<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:41.970> mean

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
helpful for insects I mean yeah I mean

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
helpful for insects I mean yeah I mean
it's<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.370> very<00:02:44.490> when<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.540> look<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.959> the

it's a very when you look going to the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.380 
it's a very when you look going to the
soil<00:02:46.380> here<00:02:46.590> or<00:02:46.800> just<00:02:47.400> look<00:02:47.640> around<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.150> you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
attacked by one particular insect

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.590 
attacked by one particular insect
because<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.000> way<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.270> they're<00:03:00.390> growing

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
because of the way that they're growing

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600 
because of the way that they're growing
I<00:03:00.720> mean<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.989> look<00:03:01.140> outside<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.459> your

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
I mean if you look outside this is your

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.030 
I mean if you look outside this is your
traditional<00:03:03.000> monoculture<00:03:03.750> here<00:03:04.230> where

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
traditional monoculture here where

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.290 
traditional monoculture here where
you've<00:03:05.190> got<00:03:05.340> loads<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.610> brassicas<00:03:06.090> growing

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
you've got loads of brassicas growing

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.360 
you've got loads of brassicas growing
together<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.840> course<00:03:07.080> how<00:03:07.800> easy<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.340> it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
together and of course how easy is it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.860 
together and of course how easy is it
for<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.670> cabbage<00:03:08.970> white<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.390> say<00:03:09.540> oh<00:03:09.570> look

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
for a cabbage white to say oh look

for a cabbage white to say oh look
there's<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.470> lunch<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:11.370> know<00:03:11.489> how<00:03:11.640> easy<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:12.090> it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
there's my lunch you know how easy is it

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240 
there's my lunch you know how easy is it
for<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.900> pigeon<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.500> come<00:03:13.620> along<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:13.950> pack<00:03:14.130> all

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
for a pigeon to come along and pack all

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.190 
for a pigeon to come along and pack all
the<00:03:14.370> leaves<00:03:14.519> off<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.300> extremely<00:03:15.780> easy<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the leaves off it's extremely easy and

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.949 
the leaves off it's extremely easy and
then<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.860> soil<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.670> completely<00:03:18.120> bare<00:03:18.450> so

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
then the soil here is completely bare so

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.229 
then the soil here is completely bare so
when<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.950> rains<00:03:20.100> all<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.489> nutrients<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.120> just

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
when it rains all the nutrients and just

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.570 
when it rains all the nutrients and just
get<00:03:21.360> washed<00:03:21.540> away<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:23.070> water<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.489> evaporate

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
get washed away the water can evaporate

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.340 
get washed away the water can evaporate
out<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.269> soil<00:03:24.540> really<00:03:24.660> easily<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.080> mean<00:03:25.260> this

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
out the soil really easily I mean this

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.979 
out the soil really easily I mean this
is<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.650> complete<00:03:26.370> opposite<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.820> what<00:03:27.209> we're

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
is the complete opposite of what we're

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.280 
is the complete opposite of what we're
kind<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.590> trying<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.100> do<00:03:29.310> which<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.820> create<00:03:30.570> not

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
kind of trying to do which is create not

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.500 
kind of trying to do which is create not
a<00:03:31.320> closed-loop<00:03:31.890> system<00:03:32.489> but<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.820> more<00:03:33.120> stable

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
a closed-loop system but a more stable

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.780

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
with what's going on under the ground

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.210

nutrients and things getting passed

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.530 
nutrients and things getting passed
around<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.640> not<00:03:50.820> something<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.299> plan

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
around so this is not something you plan

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.170 
around so this is not something you plan
to<00:03:51.570> do<00:03:51.959> no<00:03:52.320> no<00:03:52.560> no<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.640> kind<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.060> this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
to do no no no this is a kind of this

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.910 
to do no no no this is a kind of this
isn't<00:03:54.450> more<00:03:54.570> traditional<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:55.290> gardening

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
isn't more traditional and gardening

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.710 
isn't more traditional and gardening
approach<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.640> kind<00:03:56.880> of<00:03:57.030> gardening<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.570> we

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
approach the kind of gardening that we

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.289 
approach the kind of gardening that we
advocate<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.709> very<00:03:59.459> low<00:03:59.610> maintenance<00:03:59.820> type

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
advocate is a very low maintenance type

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.260 
advocate is a very low maintenance type
of<00:04:00.420> farming<00:04:00.780> for<00:04:00.989> forest<00:04:01.350> gardening

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
of farming for forest gardening

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.400 
of farming for forest gardening
and<00:04:02.990> forest<00:04:03.500> gardening<00:04:03.950> is<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:05.410> polyculture

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
and forest gardening is a polyculture

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.570 
and forest gardening is a polyculture
which<00:04:06.560> means<00:04:06.770> you've<00:04:06.920> got<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.100> mixture<00:04:07.460> of

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
which means you've got a mixture of

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.430 
which means you've got a mixture of
different<00:04:07.700> plants<00:04:08.210> rather<00:04:08.780> than<00:04:09.110> having<00:04:09.260> the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
different plants rather than having the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.340 
different plants rather than having the
same<00:04:09.680> drug<00:04:09.980> being<00:04:10.370> repeated<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:12.050> a<00:04:12.140> poly

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
same drug being repeated and it's a poly

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.730 
same drug being repeated and it's a poly
culture<00:04:12.800> that<00:04:12.920> includes<00:04:13.340> trees<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.410> goes<00:04:15.410> all

teeth tree here well we're teaching

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.110 
teeth tree here well we're teaching
people<00:04:24.680> about<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.280> kinds<00:04:25.610> of<00:04:25.760> plants<00:04:26.060> that

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
people about the kinds of plants that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
people about the kinds of plants that
you<00:04:26.210> would<00:04:26.390> include<00:04:26.750> in<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.050> forest<00:04:27.350> garden<00:04:27.620> so

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
you would include in a forest garden so

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.660 
you would include in a forest garden so
generally<00:04:30.140> they're<00:04:30.320> edible<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.430> they<00:04:31.550> have

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
generally they're edible so they have

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.800 
generally they're edible so they have
edible<00:04:31.880> fruits<00:04:32.720> or<00:04:32.990> leaves<00:04:33.320> or<00:04:33.590> or<00:04:34.600> berries<00:04:35.600> or

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
edible fruits or leaves or or berries or

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.400 
edible fruits or leaves or or berries or
all<00:04:36.470> stems<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:38.210> they're<00:04:38.810> generally<00:04:39.200> low

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
all stems and they're generally low

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.930 
all stems and they're generally low
maintenance<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:40.160> they're<00:04:40.580> generally

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
maintenance and they're generally

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.030 
maintenance and they're generally
perennial<00:04:41.480> which<00:04:42.170> means<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:42.620> once<00:04:42.830> you've

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
perennial which means that once you've

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.620 
perennial which means that once you've
planted<00:04:43.280> them<00:04:43.580> they<00:04:43.730> stay<00:04:44.000> there<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.510> don't

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
planted them they stay there you don't

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.060 
planted them they stay there you don't
have<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.930> keep<00:04:45.020> on<00:04:45.140> digging<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.560> ground<00:04:45.800> to

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
have to keep on digging the ground to

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.740 
have to keep on digging the ground to
put<00:04:46.220> new<00:04:46.370> plants<00:04:46.730> in<00:04:46.820> every<00:04:46.910> year<00:04:47.270> you've<00:04:47.720> got

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
put new plants in every year you've got

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.750 
put new plants in every year you've got
something<00:04:48.320> that's<00:04:48.500> going<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.730> know

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
something that's going to you know

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.130 
something that's going to you know
become<00:04:50.150> stronger<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.570> stronger<00:04:50.720> every<00:04:50.900> year

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
become stronger and stronger every year

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.420 
become stronger and stronger every year
so<00:04:51.800> it<00:04:52.010> carries<00:04:52.280> well<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.920> don't<00:04:55.010> think<00:04:55.280> I

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
so it carries well and I don't think I

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.220 
so it carries well and I don't think I
don't<00:04:55.490> know<00:04:55.640> if<00:04:55.730> cavemen<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.570> suppose<00:04:56.840> early

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
don't know if cavemen I suppose early

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.510 
don't know if cavemen I suppose early
hunter-gatherers<00:04:57.920> would<00:04:58.070> have<00:04:58.160> used<00:04:58.310> this

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
hunter-gatherers would have used this

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.430 
hunter-gatherers would have used this
gardening<00:04:59.060> approach<00:04:59.360> yeah<00:04:59.900> because<00:05:00.230> they

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
gardening approach yeah because they

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.900 
gardening approach yeah because they
would<00:05:00.560> have<00:05:00.650> just<00:05:00.680> used<00:05:01.280> what<00:05:01.550> was<00:05:01.700> there<00:05:01.880> I

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
would have just used what was there I

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.540 
would have just used what was there I
mean<00:05:02.150> it's<00:05:02.300> it's<00:05:02.660> mimicking<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.680> garden<00:05:04.220> a

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
mean it's it's mimicking a garden a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.160 
mean it's it's mimicking a garden a
natural<00:05:05.360> garden<00:05:05.630> II<00:05:05.690> would<00:05:05.810> guess<00:05:05.960> at<00:05:06.080> the

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
natural garden II would guess at the

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.260 
natural garden II would guess at the
edge<00:05:06.260> of<00:05:06.410> a<00:05:06.500> woodland<00:05:06.890> so<00:05:07.550> we're<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:07.880> woodland

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
edge of a woodland so we're a woodland

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.300 
edge of a woodland so we're a woodland
where<00:05:08.720> one<00:05:08.930> habitat<00:05:09.440> meets<00:05:09.710> of<00:05:09.920> the<00:05:10.070> next

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
where one habitat meets of the next

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.620 
where one habitat meets of the next
habitats<00:05:10.790> that's<00:05:11.060> where<00:05:11.270> you<00:05:11.360> get<00:05:11.480> the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
habitats that's where you get the

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.690 
habitats that's where you get the
greatest<00:05:12.170> range<00:05:12.950> of<00:05:13.160> different<00:05:13.460> species

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
greatest range of different species

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.220 
greatest range of different species
because<00:05:14.390> of<00:05:14.630> that<00:05:14.690> sudden<00:05:15.110> light

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
because of that sudden light

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.370 
because of that sudden light
availability<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:17.180> at<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.480> edge<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:17.870> forest

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
availability so at the edge of a forest

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.440 
availability so at the edge of a forest
that's<00:05:19.220> what<00:05:19.370> you're<00:05:19.490> kind<00:05:19.670> of<00:05:19.700> copying<00:05:20.090> here

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
that's what you're kind of copying here

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.350 
that's what you're kind of copying here
so<00:05:21.350> typically<00:05:21.830> on<00:05:22.010> a<00:05:22.160> in<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.580> forest<00:05:22.880> garden<00:05:23.240> you

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
so typically on a in a forest garden you

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.960 
so typically on a in a forest garden you
had<00:05:23.480> put<00:05:23.690> taller<00:05:24.440> trees<00:05:24.800> taller<00:05:25.370> species<00:05:25.820> like

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
had put taller trees taller species like

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.270 
had put taller trees taller species like
trees<00:05:26.240> at<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:26.960> north<00:05:27.230> end<00:05:27.530> of<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.710> site<00:05:27.920> and

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
trees at the north end of the site and

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.550 
trees at the north end of the site and
then<00:05:28.850> you<00:05:28.880> would<00:05:29.120> have<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.570> heights<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:30.200> the

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
then you would have the heights the the

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.900 
then you would have the heights the the
plants<00:05:30.860> getting<00:05:31.160> lower<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.520> lower<00:05:31.640> in

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
plants getting lower and lower in

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.850 
plants getting lower and lower in
Heights<00:05:32.210> as<00:05:32.780> they<00:05:32.960> go<00:05:33.080> towards<00:05:33.440> where<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.620> Sun

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
Heights as they go towards where the Sun

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.130 
Heights as they go towards where the Sun
is<00:05:34.240> unless<00:05:35.240> of<00:05:35.420> course<00:05:35.450> you're<00:05:35.930> growing

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
is unless of course you're growing

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.080 
is unless of course you're growing
plants<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.620> want<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.040> shade<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.550> then<00:05:38.000> you

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
plants that want the shade and then you

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.490 
plants that want the shade and then you
would<00:05:38.240> switch<00:05:38.690> things<00:05:38.990> around<00:05:41.020> most<00:05:42.020> things

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
would switch things around most things

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.890 
would switch things around most things
that<00:05:42.650> we

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
that we

the spring they're just they're likely
I've<00:06:07.960> got<00:06:08.110> my<00:06:08.230> root<00:06:08.380> system<00:06:08.740> I'm<00:06:08.890> just<00:06:09.100> going

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
I've got my root system I'm just going

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.980 
I've got my root system I'm just going
to<00:06:09.250> start<00:06:09.460> growing<00:06:09.640> straightaway<00:06:10.330> really

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
to start growing straightaway really

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.290 
to start growing straightaway really
really<00:06:11.170> difficult<00:06:11.320> even<00:06:11.770> some<00:06:12.040> coriander<00:06:12.910> so

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
really difficult even some coriander so

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.790 
really difficult even some coriander so
we're<00:06:13.420> doing<00:06:13.510> software<00:06:13.780> cuttings<00:06:14.350> which<00:06:14.590> is<00:06:14.770> a

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
we're doing software cuttings which is a

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.880 
we're doing software cuttings which is a
way<00:06:14.920> of<00:06:14.950> propagating<00:06:15.490> certain<00:06:16.120> plants<00:06:16.630> and

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
way of propagating certain plants and

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.010 
way of propagating certain plants and
what<00:06:17.890> your<00:06:18.010> homework<00:06:18.370> is<00:06:18.520> going<00:06:18.640> to<00:06:18.730> be<00:06:18.850> is<00:06:19.090> you

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
what your homework is going to be is you

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.620 
what your homework is going to be is you
can<00:06:20.200> choose<00:06:20.500> between<00:06:20.770> either<00:06:21.420> telling<00:06:22.420> me

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
can choose between either telling me

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.690 
can choose between either telling me
what<00:06:22.840> plants<00:06:23.230> you<00:06:23.350> can<00:06:23.440> propagate<00:06:23.700> by

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
what plants you can propagate by

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.310 
what plants you can propagate by
software<00:06:25.180> cuttings<00:06:25.600> and<00:06:25.720> do<00:06:25.870> a<00:06:25.900> little<00:06:26.080> bit<00:06:26.260> of

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
software cuttings and do a little bit of

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.990 
software cuttings and do a little bit of
research<00:06:26.710> and<00:06:27.010> that<00:06:27.490> could<00:06:27.640> be<00:06:27.730> any<00:06:27.850> of<00:06:27.940> the

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
research and that could be any of the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.610 
research and that could be any of the
plants<00:06:28.300> that<00:06:28.360> we<00:06:28.600> we're<00:06:29.020> studying<00:06:29.380> or<00:06:29.590> just

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
plants that we we're studying or just

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.010 
plants that we we're studying or just
other<00:06:30.070> plants<00:06:30.640> as<00:06:30.790> well<00:06:30.970> just<00:06:31.540> like<00:06:31.690> Generic

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
other plants as well just like Generic

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.510 
other plants as well just like Generic
what<00:06:32.290> plants<00:06:32.680> can<00:06:32.800> be<00:06:32.830> propagates<00:06:33.250> in<00:06:33.400> this

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
what plants can be propagates in this

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.120 
what plants can be propagates in this
way<00:06:33.670> so<00:06:34.360> what<00:06:34.630> can<00:06:34.960> you<00:06:35.020> use<00:06:35.170> from<00:06:35.650> this<00:06:35.860> course

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
way so what can you use from this course

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.550 
way so what can you use from this course
that<00:06:36.370> you're<00:06:36.490> learning<00:06:36.640> on<00:06:36.880> this<00:06:37.000> course<00:06:37.560> lots

things in shade and under trees and
there<00:06:45.640> are<00:06:45.700> a<00:06:45.730> lot<00:06:45.970> of<00:06:46.000> urban<00:06:46.750> trees<00:06:47.110> in<00:06:47.470> parks

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
there are a lot of urban trees in parks

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.140 
there are a lot of urban trees in parks

things you can eat as well which is
fantastic<00:06:56.380> so<00:06:57.130> when<00:06:57.910> I<00:06:57.940> work<00:06:58.240> in<00:06:58.450> my<00:06:58.570> community

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
fantastic so when I work in my community

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.590 
fantastic so when I work in my community
garden<00:06:59.170> I<00:06:59.830> talk<00:07:00.370> to<00:07:00.550> people<00:07:00.700> about<00:07:00.970> what<00:07:01.210> they

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600 
garden I talk to people about what they

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.030 
garden I talk to people about what they
can<00:07:01.660> eat<00:07:01.960> that<00:07:02.170> they<00:07:02.320> wouldn't<00:07:02.650> have<00:07:02.830> thought

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
can eat that they wouldn't have thought

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.630 
can eat that they wouldn't have thought
to<00:07:03.250> be<00:07:03.400> eating<00:07:03.840> so<00:07:04.840> I'm<00:07:05.620> thinking<00:07:06.160> differently

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
to be eating so I'm thinking differently

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.450 
to be eating so I'm thinking differently
about<00:07:06.730> how<00:07:07.180> they<00:07:07.300> use<00:07:07.510> their<00:07:07.840> land<00:07:08.460> rather

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
about how they use their land rather

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.670 
about how they use their land rather
than<00:07:09.670> thinking<00:07:10.210> that's<00:07:10.900> just<00:07:11.050> a<00:07:11.380> bit<00:07:11.530> of

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
than thinking that's just a bit of

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.330 
than thinking that's just a bit of
London<00:07:12.840> bit<00:07:13.840> under<00:07:14.230> a<00:07:14.260> tree<00:07:14.620> that<00:07:14.860> nobody's

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
London bit under a tree that nobody's

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.780 
London bit under a tree that nobody's
going<00:07:15.610> to<00:07:15.820> use<00:07:16.290> and<00:07:17.290> it's<00:07:17.500> using<00:07:17.770> bits<00:07:18.400> of<00:07:18.610> land

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:18.790 
going to use and it's using bits of land

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.120 
going to use and it's using bits of land
to<00:07:19.240> grow<00:07:19.450> things<00:07:19.750> that<00:07:20.080> we<00:07:20.200> wouldn't<00:07:20.440> choose

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
to grow things that we wouldn't choose

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.640 
to grow things that we wouldn't choose
to<00:07:21.160> do<00:07:21.610> you<00:07:22.600> know<00:07:22.720> now<00:07:22.870> I<00:07:22.900> know<00:07:23.020> I<00:07:23.170> can<00:07:23.530> identify

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
to do you know now I know I can identify

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.530 
to do you know now I know I can identify
things<00:07:24.070> I<00:07:24.340> couldn't<00:07:24.610> identify<00:07:24.730> before<00:07:25.240> and

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.540 
things I couldn't identify before and

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.300 
things I couldn't identify before and
see<00:07:26.140> them<00:07:26.290> as<00:07:26.380> four<00:07:26.560> you'd<00:07:26.680> rather<00:07:26.860> than<00:07:27.100> just

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
see them as four you'd rather than just

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.690 
see them as four you'd rather than just
all<00:07:27.490> things<00:07:27.880> I<00:07:28.060> beg<00:07:28.330> you<00:07:28.450> to<00:07:28.510> look<00:07:28.630> at<00:07:28.840> so<00:07:29.170> yeah

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700 
all things I beg you to look at so yeah

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.360 
all things I beg you to look at so yeah
is<00:07:30.570> there<00:07:30.840> any<00:07:30.960> rule<00:07:31.230> of<00:07:31.380> thumb<00:07:31.620> about<00:07:32.070> how<00:07:32.310> to

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
is there any rule of thumb about how to

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.100 
is there any rule of thumb about how to
know<00:07:32.640> if<00:07:32.670> something<00:07:33.090> is<00:07:33.150> edible<00:07:33.450> or<00:07:33.660> not<00:07:33.840> I

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
know if something is edible or not I

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.350 
know if something is edible or not I
think<00:07:35.070> you<00:07:35.310> have<00:07:35.430> to<00:07:35.550> know<00:07:35.670> what<00:07:35.820> it<00:07:35.910> is<00:07:36.030> really

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
think you have to know what it is really

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.510 
think you have to know what it is really
there<00:07:37.200> isn't<00:07:37.320> any<00:07:37.560> distinguishing<00:07:38.040> feature

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 
there isn't any distinguishing feature

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.190 
there isn't any distinguishing feature
that<00:07:38.790> means<00:07:39.000> it<00:07:39.120> vegetables<00:07:39.570> and<00:07:39.720> ice<00:07:39.840> you

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.200 
that means it vegetables and ice you

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.810 
that means it vegetables and ice you
need<00:07:40.560> to<00:07:40.740> be<00:07:41.010> able<00:07:41.100> to<00:07:41.220> identify<00:07:41.370> it<00:07:41.730> and

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:41.820 
need to be able to identify it and

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.490 
need to be able to identify it and
especially<00:07:41.970> if<00:07:42.300> making<00:07:42.870> you<00:07:42.990> know<00:07:43.080> if<00:07:43.350> it

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 
especially if making you know if it

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.750 
especially if making you know if it
looks<00:07:43.530> like<00:07:43.740> something<00:07:43.830> poisonous<00:07:44.220> you<00:07:44.520> need
