write<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.950> 70<00:00:42.280> millimeter<00:00:42.400> wheel<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.060> I<00:00:43.420> am

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
write a 70 millimeter wheel and I am

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.840 
write a 70 millimeter wheel and I am
feeling<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.200> huge<00:00:44.350> difference<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:45.160> 73<00:00:45.700> with

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
feeling a huge difference the 73 with

feeling a huge difference the 73 with
the<00:00:45.970> core<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.420> lot<00:00:46.870> more<00:00:47.020> grip<00:00:47.230> really<00:00:47.890> really

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
the core a lot more grip really really

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.180 
the core a lot more grip really really
fast<00:00:48.930> overall<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.110> deciding<00:00:50.590> it's<00:00:50.710> it's<00:00:51.070> a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
fast overall and deciding it's it's a

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.710 
fast overall and deciding it's it's a
pretty<00:00:51.399> smooth<00:00:51.820> wheel<00:00:52.090> right<00:00:52.300> off<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.570> bat

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
pretty smooth wheel right off the bat

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.479 
pretty smooth wheel right off the bat
I'm<00:00:53.230> going<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.590> try<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.770> do<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:53.950> pre<00:00:54.130> drift<00:00:54.340> into

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
I'm going to try to do a pre drift into

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.180 
I'm going to try to do a pre drift into
this<00:00:54.610> quarter<00:00:54.880> now

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.740 

there's<00:01:00.190> some<00:01:00.399> jets<00:01:00.609> flying<00:01:00.879> around<00:01:01.210> overhead

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
there's some jets flying around overhead

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.959 
there's some jets flying around overhead
but<00:01:02.140> my<00:01:02.410> first<00:01:02.710> impressions<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.730> seismic

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
but my first impressions of the seismic

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.630 
but my first impressions of the seismic
speed<00:01:04.479> bands<00:01:04.720> after<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.619> couple<00:01:05.890> slides<00:01:06.250> is

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
speed bands after a couple slides is

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.609 
speed bands after a couple slides is
that<00:01:07.360> they're<00:01:07.600> really<00:01:07.750> good<00:01:08.080> for<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.350> race

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
that they're really good for a race

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.020 
that they're really good for a race
style<00:01:08.890> situation<00:01:09.580> where<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:09.759> need<00:01:09.909> to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
style situation where you need to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.120 
style situation where you need to
maintain<00:01:10.210> roll<00:01:10.720> speed<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.409> need<00:01:11.619> grip<00:01:11.950> and

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
maintain roll speed you need grip and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.740 
maintain roll speed you need grip and
you<00:01:12.400> want<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.729> wheel<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:13.119> when<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.390> hooks<00:01:13.630> up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
you want a wheel that when it hooks up

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.350 
you want a wheel that when it hooks up
after<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.229> slide<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.860> very<00:01:15.070> snappy<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.119> get

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
after a slide is very snappy and you get

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.389 
after a slide is very snappy and you get
right<00:01:16.630> back<00:01:16.840> into<00:01:17.080> traction<00:01:17.619> mode<00:01:17.799> we've

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
right back into traction mode we've

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.920 
right back into traction mode we've
noticed<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.820> these<00:01:19.030> wheels<00:01:19.299> are<00:01:19.479> leaving

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
noticed that these wheels are leaving

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.930 
noticed that these wheels are leaving
vain<00:01:20.229> lines<00:01:20.500> at<00:01:20.740> higher<00:01:20.920> speeds<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.549> what

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
vain lines at higher speeds and what

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.609 
vain lines at higher speeds and what
that<00:01:22.119> means<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.630> they're<00:01:22.960> really<00:01:23.259> suited

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
that means is that they're really suited

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.410 
that means is that they're really suited
towards<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.009> more<00:01:24.190> high<00:01:24.520> speed<00:01:24.940> style<00:01:25.270> of

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
towards a more high speed style of

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.180 
towards a more high speed style of
riding<00:01:25.750> some<00:01:26.440> of<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.590> things<00:01:26.740> I<00:01:26.860> liked<00:01:27.070> about

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
riding some of the things I liked about

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.880 
riding some of the things I liked about
this<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:27.880> how<00:01:28.240> pliable<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.080> urethane<00:01:29.380> is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
this is how pliable the urethane is

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.130 
this is how pliable the urethane is
after<00:01:30.520> some<00:01:30.729> slides<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.300> will<00:01:31.659> say<00:01:31.869> that<00:01:32.050> at

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
after some slides I will say that at

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.020 
after some slides I will say that at
first<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.770> wheels<00:01:33.130> gonna<00:01:33.340> be<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.550> lot<00:01:33.789> better

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
first this wheels gonna be a lot better

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.779 
first this wheels gonna be a lot better
for<00:01:34.330> just<00:01:34.630> downhill<00:01:35.200> drifting<00:01:36.130> going<00:01:36.550> fast

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
for just downhill drifting going fast

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.669 
for just downhill drifting going fast
but<00:01:37.330> as<00:01:37.509> it<00:01:37.690> breaks<00:01:37.840> in<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.289> got<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.409> really

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
but as it breaks in it's got a really

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.919 
but as it breaks in it's got a really
nice<00:01:38.860> feel<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.369> it<00:01:39.729> actually<00:01:39.970> could<00:01:40.539> be<00:01:40.569> used

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
nice feel and it actually could be used

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.719 
nice feel and it actually could be used
for<00:01:41.200> some<00:01:41.350> mild<00:01:41.649> stand<00:01:42.130> up<00:01:42.250> slides

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
for some mild stand up slides

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.760 
for some mild stand up slides
the<00:01:43.060> other<00:01:43.149> thing<00:01:43.420> has<00:01:43.690> quite<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.020> great<00:01:44.530> feel

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
the other thing has quite a great feel

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.180 
the other thing has quite a great feel
in<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.009> 76<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.140> we're<00:01:47.470> switching<00:01:47.770> up<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
in the 76 so we're switching up to the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.010 
in the 76 so we're switching up to the
80s<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.909> what's<00:01:49.119> nice<00:01:49.270> about<00:01:49.330> these<00:01:49.810> is

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
80s and what's nice about these is

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.200 
80s and what's nice about these is
they're<00:01:50.140> fresh<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.159> can<00:01:51.429> go<00:01:51.550> ruin<00:01:51.909> them<00:01:52.030> I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
they're fresh so I can go ruin them I

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.059 
they're fresh so I can go ruin them I
think<00:01:52.929> we<00:01:53.020> should<00:01:53.170> go<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.500> u-dub<00:01:53.830> the

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
think we should go to the u-dub the

you'll<00:02:01.840> really<00:02:02.080> appreciate<00:02:02.649> that<00:02:02.679> hard<00:02:03.250> edge

that<00:02:03.849> the<00:02:03.940> ABA<00:02:04.270> provides<00:02:04.750> you'll<00:02:05.259> notice<00:02:05.590> a

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
that the ABA provides you'll notice a

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.740 
that the ABA provides you'll notice a
significant<00:02:06.369> difference<00:02:06.789> in<00:02:06.970> both<00:02:07.360> speed<00:02:07.720> and

significant difference in both speed and

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.680 
significant difference in both speed and

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690

particular almost launched me into the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.750 
particular almost launched me into the
backseat<00:02:35.440> with<00:02:35.560> how<00:02:35.710> hard<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.220> hooked<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.580> when

backseat with how hard it hooked up when
it<00:02:36.910> did<00:02:37.090> grip<00:02:37.330> back<00:02:37.540> up<00:02:37.750> after<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.680> got<00:02:38.920> used<00:02:39.160> to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
it did grip back up after I got used to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.980 
it did grip back up after I got used to
that<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.580> was<00:02:39.790> noticing<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.330> they<00:02:40.570> were<00:02:40.600> very

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
that I was noticing that they were very

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.470 
that I was noticing that they were very
grippy<00:02:41.470> they<00:02:41.650> had<00:02:41.770> very<00:02:42.130> sharp<00:02:42.550> hard<00:02:42.940> edges

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
grippy they had very sharp hard edges

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.390 
grippy they had very sharp hard edges
and<00:02:43.630> when<00:02:44.050> they<00:02:44.170> did<00:02:44.350> hook<00:02:44.560> back<00:02:44.770> up<00:02:44.800> they

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
and when they did hook back up they

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.760 
and when they did hook back up they
launched<00:02:46.060> me<00:02:46.210> into<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.690> apex<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.380> out<00:02:47.470> again

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
launched me into the apex and out again
