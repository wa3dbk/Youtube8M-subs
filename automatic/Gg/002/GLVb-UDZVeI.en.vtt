 comfortable here must be the name of the guy 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.569
 who created the game and face to face look that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.369
 face sheet looks at this sheet if it gets 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.619
 looking and silent and vomiting because he 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.750

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.789
 finally we have the computer here 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.239
 galera that is where the majority occurs 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.860
 of the things of youtube life is not with 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.840
 You may notice the computer does not have 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.000

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.220

 Nice and here on the side we have the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.759
 normal stuff on youtube and look at the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.590
 people from the pool of banks and I think 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.780
 that the guy who did here promises should be 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.580

 to be able to carry out actions 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.299
 We still have zero subscribers in the

 in kakÃ¡ that we have to choose one 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.439
 also by law or by video in choosing the 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.510
 famous miniature drawing that stands on the 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.519
 video is a pretty fun task 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.650
 I also love to make half a gal that there is 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.260
 also none that shows him a butt 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.840
 we have 2 ac that goes to peep photo 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.280
 shunel and we have a 3 that is a figure 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.249
 really relevant 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.889
 well I'll put one that I liked 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:26.209
 picture was nice and looks only achieved 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.290
 now 2646 subscribers and now I got 6% 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.999
 infamous 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.889
 that is how you can see that the 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:33.530
 abundant and that really causes 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.180
 you win more subscribers so let's go 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.959
 now check the email that you checked the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.879
 email 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.040
 Look, the e-mail that we have here is 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.900
 half of a king and the whole channel and 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.939
 usually has a king who usually has 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.620
 someone who even does not like your 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:47.389
 video she wastes time to comment that 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.180
 she did not like that I can do what 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.639
 I give him an angry answer or 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.489
 Make a nice answer, I'll give you a 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.760
 legal response because violence generates 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.900
 violence if I give an answer is 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.790
 cursing guy he'll have another reason 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.249
 to scold me and I did not win any 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.480

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.340

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.079
 now I want to make a video street will do 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.150

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.310
 enrolled face r is relatively easy 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.870
 that you get written in this game, man. 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.989
 Have you ever thought if reality was the way? 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.310
 That's really cool, now we have it. 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.400
 that choosing one also denied that I 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.120
 I put the green cape kabum canvas 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.520
 always the yoki 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.229
 abuses and grows here in your life 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.330
 Now let's check the email again and see 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.310
 What is the medium that has schelotto? 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.199
 reipert oscar Rio accessing 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.330
 channel does not like ass not the guy does not 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.470
 likes these ass not like 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.750
 so I'll give you an aggressive answer 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.030
 for he looks only gave an answer 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.639
 aggressive for him and grew here crowded 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.800
 with 5,200 registered that in the bands 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.050
 more are going to make another video that 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.600
 now this time I make a video there 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.240
 copying another and youtube is a 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.919
 thing that occurs much even this 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.930
 game on the channel, so I 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.030
 I'm recording and access the channel of law that 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.280
 the channel of the hour a tip and 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.050
 truth to you no joke ever 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.600
 copy and another in October and there because 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.610
 You have to be original without doing something. 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.500
 single for youtube I know that I am 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.900
 saying this and me but my channel 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.970
 minecraft gameplay but I always 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.260
 I try to make the most different 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.330
 you have to do 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.100
 already karen said be aware of doing things 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.470
 that nobody ever did on youtube because 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.660
 what's cool can not be just another 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.280
 just like the others do not do more video 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.430
 I want to make funny videos. 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.090
 for funny videos are cool here and 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.310
 Let's just stay here just by squeezing a 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.919
 eyed is the question the sound will 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.560
 growing very rigorously written with 20 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.020
 30 card inscribed and look I only have 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.419
 telepathy is because I moved away from the screen 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.460
 computer and I trust generating more 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.800
 inscribed for me was just that mass that 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.990
 amazing thing guys and simulator 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.699

 one million subscribers doing this here 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.050
 So I guess now it 's time, I 'm not going. 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.910
 show my face in the crowd is a shame 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.720
 that you have no options to show your face 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.389
 I do not play 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.190
