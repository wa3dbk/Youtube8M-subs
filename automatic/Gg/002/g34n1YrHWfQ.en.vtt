volume<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> did<00:01:43.259> was<00:01:43.439> go<00:01:43.829> in

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
volume to it so what I did was go in

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.480 
volume to it so what I did was go in
with<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.930> deep<00:01:45.930> waver<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:47.009> give<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> some

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
with this deep waver to give it some

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.920 
with this deep waver to give it some
ways<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.000> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.240> give<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.659> bit

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
ways to kind of give it a little bit

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
ways to kind of give it a little bit
more<00:01:49.200> volume<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.950> make<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.670> more

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
more volume and make it a little more

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.230 
more volume and make it a little more
voluminous<00:01:51.119> um<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.380> didn't<00:01:52.829> put<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:54.210> of

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
voluminous um I didn't put a lot of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
voluminous um I didn't put a lot of
tight<00:01:54.750> ways<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.320> grabbed<00:01:55.500> big<00:01:55.740> sections

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
tight ways I just grabbed big sections

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
tight ways I just grabbed big sections
and<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:57.000> put<00:01:57.299> some<00:01:57.329> waves<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and you know put some waves in it to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.690 
and you know put some waves in it to
give<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.040> I'm<00:01:59.100> sure<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.520> did

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
give it this but I'm sure if I did

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.969 
give it this but I'm sure if I did
smaller<00:02:00.180> sections<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> maybe<00:02:01.680> even<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
smaller sections and maybe even a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.310 
smaller sections and maybe even a
smaller<00:02:02.280> barrel<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:03.240> would<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.810> even<00:02:04.079> fuller

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
smaller barrel it would get even fuller

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.020 
smaller barrel it would get even fuller
but<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> look<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.909> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
but this is the look that I like I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
but this is the look that I like I
didn't<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.290> lint<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
didn't want it to be for the lint that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.650 
didn't want it to be for the lint that
it<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:08.670> come<00:02:08.849> style<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.360> middle

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it is it then come style with the middle

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.190

space<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.209> let<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.390> dry

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
space that I like and I just let it dry

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.930 
space that I like and I just let it dry
once<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.560> dried<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.040> know<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.190> cut<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> little

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
once it dried you know I cut a little

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.570 
once it dried you know I cut a little
bit<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.690> bank<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:38.890> not<00:02:39.010> hanging

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
bit of the bank so that it's not hanging

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.789 
bit of the bank so that it's not hanging
over<00:02:39.730> my<00:02:39.849> eyes<00:02:40.030> hanging<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.660> my<00:02:40.900> eye<00:02:40.930> then<00:02:41.769> I

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
over my eyes hanging in my eye then I

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.160 
over my eyes hanging in my eye then I
grant<00:02:42.069> random<00:02:42.430> chunks<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.910> hair<00:02:43.209> in<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:44.049> know

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
grant random chunks of hair in you know

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.080 
grant random chunks of hair in you know
big<00:02:44.709> wave<00:02:44.890> did<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.280> did<00:02:45.519> exactly<00:02:45.790> what<00:02:45.970> I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
big wave did it did exactly what I

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.000 
big wave did it did exactly what I
wanted<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.690> do<00:02:46.870> you're<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> little<00:02:47.739> bit<00:02:47.830> more

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
wanted it to do you're a little bit more

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.530 
wanted it to do you're a little bit more
volume<00:02:48.190> because<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.970> was<00:02:49.120> looking<00:02:49.420> really

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
volume because it was looking really

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.110 
volume because it was looking really
reflect<00:02:50.140> by<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.470> bit<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.739> silky<00:02:51.130> texture<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.910> was

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
reflect by a bit a silky texture it was

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.000 
reflect by a bit a silky texture it was
already<00:02:52.450> fine<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.230> wanted<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.829> add<00:02:53.980> a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
already fine so I I wanted to add a

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.890 
already fine so I I wanted to add a
little<00:02:54.340> bit<00:02:54.459> more<00:02:54.610> attention<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.420> didn't

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
little bit more attention to it I didn't

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.449 
little bit more attention to it I didn't
spray<00:02:56.200> anything<00:02:56.500> any<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.160> I'm<00:02:57.310> definitely

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
spray anything any but I'm definitely

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.039 
spray anything any but I'm definitely
sure<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:58.060> if<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.329> spray<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:58.599> like<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> dry

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
sure that if you spray it like a dry

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.699 
sure that if you spray it like a dry
shampoo<00:02:59.230> or<00:02:59.829> if<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.970> put<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.900> hold<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.290> spray<00:03:02.530> on

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
shampoo or if you put a hold of spray on

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.520 
shampoo or if you put a hold of spray on
it<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:03.370> antes<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.360> it'll<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:05.049> even<00:03:05.200> fuller

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
it that antes it it'll get even fuller

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.050 
it that antes it it'll get even fuller
if<00:03:05.799> that's<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.160> look<00:03:06.190> you're<00:03:06.430> going<00:03:06.610> for<00:03:06.760> but

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
