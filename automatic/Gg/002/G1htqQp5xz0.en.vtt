00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 under the age of minors 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.220
 our children and our children 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.220
 teenagers 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.800
 frames but today he has played 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.430
 the psychologist to vitoria angels director 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.770
 executive of the institute and of julius and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.400
 explains how a parent can warn that 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.320
 your child suffers from addiction at a 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.970
 The child may have problems 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.100
 of affection 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.170
 between four depressives in box 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.080
 anxiety for the same need for 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.059
 want to have money to go to play 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.920
 family level is seeing a 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.100
 isolation of families and not 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.089
 shares and no longer goes out with parents 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.690
 prefers to go out and play 23 468 hours at 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.400
 once also this one discovered at the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.160
 personal the child no longer attends his 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.080
 personal needs like that cleaning 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.810
 his hygiene is not abandoned 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.000
 frame fit perfectly in the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.210
 profile described by the doctor angels 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.790
 but it was sadder to see how under the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.790
 the penumbra of the dawn would burn its 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.600
 pain through their frames teasing 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.370
 I was still a child and still 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.370
 I needed in the maternal support 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 Y 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.659
 90 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.520
 Oh, I bought a hamburger 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.740
 son the sigh and the tone of his voice 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.740
 reveals exhaustion 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.700
 and me 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.700
 Until when will I do without giving 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.600
 really 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.470
 4 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.640
 maybe the comparison that made frames 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.490
 it made sense to his mother and he were 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.720
 alone and together in a daily struggle that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.670
 it seemed to have no end and every day it 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.000
 she sank more and she did not get well in her 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.100
 efforts to rescue him service and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.100
 descended that in this battle I was 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.260
 alone his new diego couple with whom 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.130
 he had two children he was a good man but 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.440
 she thought that he loved frames that 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.170
 far from motivating I did not criticize it and that 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.230
 all the effort that he did not 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:06.520
 destroyed level they stepped on the house for me 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.520
 custom be quiet 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.170
 at that moment 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:23.450
 so it's true that frames do not 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.430
 has rule rules because I do not know 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.950
 can of possibilities for me has been 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.049
 rather they try to keep the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.299
 farce he will not look for that because he 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:36.639
 he said it's the house I do not know what was going on and 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.639
 I preferred to sleep anywhere 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.950
 not then that he stays at home and that he 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.170
 try to maintain when you have achieved 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.939
 all this is not love harvested in the 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.050
 bed and is putting let's say in the 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:59.960
 fourth and suddenly it arrives 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.960
 they go they go and you tell him 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.879
 If you want something, talk to him 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.010
 talk of the injured take care of 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.219
 frames with the provisions then to give it 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.219
 Your opinion 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.790
 although that does not think me not a 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.790
 way of wanting different means 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:40.020
 and then there the fights of 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.020
 Miles titles 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.040
 That 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:09.540
 if I talk to her 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.540
 doing something national 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.470
 5 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.309
 even though they still loved each other persists 

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:25.029
 a conflict capable of breaking down the 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:27.520
 family harmony there is in fact everything 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.949
 possible to accumulate your child even 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.309
 sometime in a new cast a center for 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.889
 addictions but he ran away a month 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:37.919
 Marco's mom was at the 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.919
 drift 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.199
 but I have not found the way to 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.199
 semifinals 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.000
 to face better 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.320
 people 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.219
 it has messed me up 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.260
 yl 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.260
 I started looking 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.840
 well why my program 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.979
 it caught my attention 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.979
 and half 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.800
 because he says it was nice 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.220
 really 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.530
 sarkozy
