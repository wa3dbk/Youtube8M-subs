00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 I greet all lovers of the universe 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.550
 five nights at freddy's my name is Anton 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.330
 and today I propose to talk about 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.950
 one interesting phrase from fnaf put 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.609
 as many likes as possible 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.460
 interested in new releases and media 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.449
 this phrase appears in the side corridor 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 on the wall 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.019
 and in the pirate bay there is a plate with 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.730
 a word a word many consider it 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.230
 Foxy wrote the word himself 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.399
 with a chance at 1 and 5 or 5 and 6 percent there 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.899
 the phrase appears 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.110
 these or darkness and all together it gives 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.739
 phrase which translates as forgive it 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.770
 I thought it was a foxy revelation 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.469
 but if you look closely the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.920
 word quarrel and the continuation of the phrase 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.949
 vary by fix maybe this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.199
 just a guard's hallucination 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.510
 it is likely that this guard himself is 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.689
 murderers of children who moved into 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.840
 animatronics and trying to get revenge on this 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.820
 theory explains strong aggression 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.210
 animatronic guard's vision which 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.310
 means his involvement in the killings 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.570
 another theory of inscription is also possible 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.590
 does not belong to foxy 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.799
 and Freddie who made the bite 87 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.200
 This is incidentally confirmed by the fact that 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.900
 Freddieâ€™s face shows faint prints 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.380
 the hands of the matter is that at the moment of the bite 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.960
 the victim instinctively tried to push 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.970
 animatronics and left traces on it 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.970
 touches about this phrase 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.850
 there is another theory that the whole fnaf 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.490
 this is a confrontation between two people 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.890
 purple man and puppet 1 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.829
 called the guard and can manage it 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 they say what and how to do it 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.270
 puppet controls animatronics 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.420
 rather their souls and their souls possible 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 killed children are also possible 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.070
 this phrase carries messages 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.970
 puppets to the purple man through 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.520
 animatronic and security guard that's me 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.890
 also explains the result of why he broke 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.530
 animatronics purple man them 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.620
 feared and thought he could get rid of 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.340
 fears breaking their interesting theory and 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.440
 is it true 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.870
 Of course, in practice, everything can be 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.930
 otherwise but theories are made to 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.280
 to think about something but was with you 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.870
 Anton I hope you this release 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.420
 I liked the same as I put 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.190
 fingers top add subscribers all
