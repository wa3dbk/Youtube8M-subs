background<00:01:36.740> things<00:01:37.010> so<00:01:37.880> I'll<00:01:38.030> just<00:01:39.160> struggle

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
background things so I'll just struggle

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.650 
background things so I'll just struggle
to<00:01:40.280> open<00:01:40.520> them<00:01:40.670> up<00:01:40.760> so<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:41.180> can<00:01:41.450> show<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:43.660> okay

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
to open them up so I can show you okay

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.560 
to open them up so I can show you okay
so<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:46.070> first<00:01:46.310> side<00:01:46.550> it's<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.150> like<00:01:47.330> all

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
so the first side it's just like all

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.440 
so the first side it's just like all
blue<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.200> then<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.440> second<00:01:48.770> side<00:01:48.979> has<00:01:49.760> some

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
blue and then the second side has some

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.960 
blue and then the second side has some
plants<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.930> it<00:01:50.960> but<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:52.010> didn't<00:01:52.610> really<00:01:52.700> think

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
plants on it but I didn't really think

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.330 
plants on it but I didn't really think
this<00:01:53.150> through<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.750> have<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.680> guess<00:01:54.830> have<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.130> tape

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
this through I have I guess have to tape

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.800 
this through I have I guess have to tape
it<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.270> tank<00:01:57.280> that's<00:01:58.280> one<00:01:58.790> side<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.600> then<00:01:59.690> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
it the tank that's one side and then the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.010 
it the tank that's one side and then the
other<00:01:59.929> side<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.130> plain<00:02:01.429> blue<00:02:01.750> but<00:02:02.750> I

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
other side is just plain blue but I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.120 
other side is just plain blue but I
didn't<00:02:03.320> really<00:02:03.470> think<00:02:03.500> about<00:02:03.800> how<00:02:03.950> it's

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
didn't really think about how it's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.410 
didn't really think about how it's
supposed<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.399> get<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.759> stay<00:02:04.970> on<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.330> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
supposed to get it to stay on to the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.900 
supposed to get it to stay on to the
tank<00:02:05.660> so<00:02:05.929> I<00:02:06.380> guess<00:02:06.649> I'll<00:02:06.800> just<00:02:06.860> tape<00:02:07.429> it<00:02:07.610> I

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
tank so I guess I'll just tape it I

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.200 
tank so I guess I'll just tape it I
don't<00:02:08.450> know<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:09.170> there<00:02:09.380> like<00:02:09.850> glue<00:02:10.850> or

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210
