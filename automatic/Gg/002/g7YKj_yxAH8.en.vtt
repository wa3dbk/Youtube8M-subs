00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
they can also using this map to register

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.279 
they can also using this map to register
their<00:00:47.190> sensor<00:00:47.579> location<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> people

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
their sensor location so that the people

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.049 
their sensor location so that the people
can<00:00:49.710> find<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:50.190> weather<00:00:50.399> station<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.320> map

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
can find your weather station on the map

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.910 
can find your weather station on the map
so<00:00:54.059> after<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> registration<00:00:57.500> here<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so after the registration here is a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.849 
so after the registration here is a
station<00:00:59.520> name<00:00:59.699> user<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.719> also<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
station name user can also to the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.070 
station name user can also to the
settings<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.730> rest<00:01:02.910> ability<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> maybe
