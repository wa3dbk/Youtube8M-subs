00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
it closer to the to the final contour

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.640 
it closer to the to the final contour
you<00:01:00.010> just<00:01:00.130> got<00:01:00.250> smaller<00:01:00.490> ripples<00:01:01.060> and<00:01:01.650> minor

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
dents that that's when we're going to

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.690 
dents that that's when we're going to
switch<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.560> hammer<00:01:05.770> on<00:01:06.040> dolly<00:01:06.310> but<00:01:06.549> let's

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
show you the hammer off dolly method

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.530 
show you the hammer off dolly method
first<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:09.700> going<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:09.880> show<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.030> hammer<00:01:10.330> off

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
first we're going to show you hammer off

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.660 
first we're going to show you hammer off
dolly<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.200> remember<00:01:12.039> you<00:01:12.219> always<00:01:12.429> want<00:01:12.609> to

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
dolly and remember you always want to

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.639 
dolly and remember you always want to
find<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:13.179> dolly<00:01:13.450> they<00:01:13.840> got<00:01:14.049> different<00:01:14.229> shapes

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
find a dolly they got different shapes

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.620 
find a dolly they got different shapes
it's<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.039> combination<00:01:15.340> dolly<00:01:15.789> it<00:01:16.359> kind<00:01:16.570> of

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
it's the combination dolly it kind of

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.300 
it's the combination dolly it kind of
fits<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.990> contour<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.859> shape<00:01:18.159> you're

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
fits the contour of the shape you're

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.340 
fits the contour of the shape you're
working<00:01:18.759> on<00:01:18.880> in<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.810> same<00:01:19.990> way<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:20.229> the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
working on in the same way that the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.739 
working on in the same way that the
hammer<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:21.340> if<00:01:21.640> this<00:01:21.820> was<00:01:21.969> actually<00:01:22.119> an<00:01:22.390> actual

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
hammer so if this was actually an actual

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.300 
hammer so if this was actually an actual
dent<00:01:23.020> we<00:01:23.289> could<00:01:23.439> reach<00:01:23.619> behind<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.249> that's

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
dent we could reach behind it and that's

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.889 
dent we could reach behind it and that's
one<00:01:24.549> thing<00:01:24.729> about<00:01:24.759> hammer<00:01:25.119> on<00:01:25.270> dolly<00:01:25.479> method

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
one thing about hammer on dolly method

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.630 
one thing about hammer on dolly method
you<00:01:26.319> have<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.649> be<00:01:26.799> able<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.009> have<00:01:27.189> access<00:01:27.340> to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
you have to be able to have access to

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.359 
you have to be able to have access to
both<00:01:27.729> sides<00:01:28.149> so<00:01:28.920> we're<00:01:29.920> not<00:01:29.979> going<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.189> start

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
both sides so we're not going to start

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.739 
both sides so we're not going to start
right<00:01:30.549> here<00:01:30.759> on<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:30.939> direct<00:01:31.270> damage<00:01:31.569> we're

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
right here on the direct damage we're

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.149 
right here on the direct damage we're
going<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:31.929> start<00:01:32.109> out<00:01:32.200> here<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.859> start

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
going to start out here and start

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.279 
going to start out here and start
straightening<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.729> out<00:01:33.789> first<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:34.600> remember

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
straightening that out first so remember

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.700 
straightening that out first so remember
it<00:01:35.380> starts<00:01:35.740> getting<00:01:36.009> low<00:01:36.159> in<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.460> area<00:01:36.880> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it starts getting low in this area and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.499 
it starts getting low in this area and
it's<00:01:38.710> kind<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:39.009> high<00:01:39.789> over<00:01:40.119> here<00:01:40.299> so<00:01:40.420> we're

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
it's kind of high over here so we're

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.609 
it's kind of high over here so we're
going<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.659> put<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:40.899> over<00:01:40.990> here<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.350> start<00:01:41.530> with

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
going to put it over here and start with

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:49.859 
going to put it over here and start with
this<00:01:41.740> first<00:01:42.069> we're<00:01:42.819> going<00:01:42.939> to<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.509> it<00:01:49.719> can't

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
this first we're going to and it can't

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.149 
this first we're going to and it can't
really<00:01:49.899> get<00:01:50.229> under<00:01:50.469> here<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:50.889> that's<00:01:51.039> going

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
really get under here and that's going

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.590 
really get under here and that's going
to<00:01:51.219> happen<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.549> cars<00:01:51.819> a<00:01:51.909> lot<00:01:52.119> too<00:01:52.329> there's<00:01:52.539> a

the contour the same thing I'm going to
push<00:02:06.270> up<00:02:06.480> more<00:02:06.750> towards<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.110> center<00:02:07.910> getting

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
push up more towards the center getting

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:21.290 
push up more towards the center getting
that<00:02:09.000> curve<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.509> back<00:02:19.970> now<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.240> to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that curve going back now I'm going to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.610 
that curve going back now I'm going to
now<00:02:21.600> I'm<00:02:21.690> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.900> push<00:02:22.050> straight<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
keep in mind whenever I'm doing using

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.990 
keep in mind whenever I'm doing using
the<00:02:50.950> hammer<00:02:51.160> off<00:02:51.400> dolly

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the hammer off dolly

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.990 
the hammer off dolly
I'm<00:02:52.060> never<00:02:52.540> hitting<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.959> dolly<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:54.640> always

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
I'm never hitting the dolly it's always

pushing<00:02:55.510> up<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.020> lows<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> dolly

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
pushing up on the lows with the dolly

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.949 
pushing up on the lows with the dolly
and<00:02:57.099> tapping<00:02:57.550> down<00:02:57.670> on<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:57.910> highs<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.750> whether

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
and tapping down on the highs so whether

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.140 
and tapping down on the highs so whether
it's<00:02:59.110> work<00:02:59.380> on<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> deal<00:02:59.830> you<00:03:00.640> can<00:03:00.790> get<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
it's work on a deal you can get the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.000 
it's work on a deal you can get the
backside<00:03:01.540> you'd<00:03:02.200> have<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.440> reach<00:03:02.590> up<00:03:02.620> under

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
backside you'd have to reach up under

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.240 
backside you'd have to reach up under
there<00:03:03.190> push<00:03:03.819> out<00:03:04.180> on<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.989> loaves<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.470> tap<00:03:06.040> in

there push out on the loaves and tap in
on<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.489> eyes<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.440> rip<00:03:09.269> pretty<00:03:10.269> well

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
on the eyes so that rip pretty well

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.770 
on the eyes so that rip pretty well
wraps<00:03:10.930> up<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.230> hammer<00:03:11.760> off<00:03:12.760> dolly<00:03:13.330> method
