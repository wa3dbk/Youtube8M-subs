00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hey and welcome today 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.330
 I'll give you a little insight into 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.120
 the wide world of the rocks first show 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.590
 I'll give you something he needs for it 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.480
 of course linoleum needs that looks like that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.150
 in that the plates which are available in the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.830
 size of 5 on world believes to a3 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.529
 maybe even bigger ones 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.400
 behind so net structure and in front the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.369
 reminds one or the other 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960
 maybe this is due to older floors 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.090
 because these floors used to be too 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.410
 made of linoleum 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.480
 the documents were produced, however 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.840
 was that mostly green dew21 nothing to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.450
 Thing 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.719
 because it was mentioned then 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.980
 do you need as a pointed tool here 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.420
 So my fiction is a semicircular blade 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.040
 with the later from the new 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.809
 be worked out 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 There are also different big ones for that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.420
 composition around quasi different lines 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 to produce stronger ones 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.750
 you need then to print view 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.510
 another small plate with her 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.309
 is to a small roll phase because 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.100
 evenly distribute them on the roll 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.420
 can and how evenly on the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.359
 publishers to get it no 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.979
 there are spots and who wants that is 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.600
 very helpful if that prints later 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.409
 such a big role 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.549
 but that's ten for us to print 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.960
 so let me do it myself 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.100
 already successfully done with the hands 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.420
 it works wonderfully around you too 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.340
 I have to demonstrate everything now 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.180
 something prepared and that small 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.290
 Pigs motive template on herseler 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.750
 I already have a little bit out 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.670
 taken and now is the following 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.290
 note that linoldruck procedure is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 a high pressure process that is the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.450
 color is applied to everything on the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.229
 end up 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.549
 accordingly we have to pull if 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.090
 we have our contours black 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.520
 would like 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.390
 everything that is not black will take out 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.189
 So almost everything around the contours 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.470
 and by that you just go with it 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.729
 along this tool 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.670
 You should definitely be there in the beginning 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.049
 be pretty careful when we do that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.460
 can not do that for very long 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.110
 It quickly happens that you are in it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.710
 the finger cuts and does that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.710
 hurt like hell 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.020
 we take now in the end everything from 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.930
 this plate out to the contours 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.770
 which we still want to have in the end 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.090
 I 'll do mine now 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:27.920
 smaller cut so that the video is not too 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:29.510
 long is gone as I said quite away 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.390
 the contours that will still have 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.880
 By the way, it would not have to be here either 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.770
 the contours or on the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.260
 reduce outlines you can do that quietly 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.530
 to make surface it is now in 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.870
 sensitive to demonstrations 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.940
 this technique all of them then 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.110
 About like this, I got you out of where you are 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.610
 still left a frame later 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.930
 he'll be black if he's there 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.340
 you have a little practice too 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.830
 multicolored or I'll show you 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.050
 maybe even as of my works 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.110
 I 'll say the shoe factory now 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.510
 so now you have yours 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.550
 pressure plate quasi finished in the end 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.810
 now comes to use 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.970
 so now you just open up 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.630
 a plate here in generous blob 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.890
 color I use this tempera resp 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.430
 gouache paint 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.959
 I would recommend to anyone 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.430
 maybe right line print 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.010
 to get color because the really of 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.800
 the consistency is more fluid 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.110
 easy to handle is distributed to her 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.560
 now with the role so that almost the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.410
 role 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.410
 beautifully evenly covered with question 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.820
 so that your pressure plate 1 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.610
 he goes over a few times already 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:53.170
 they really do everything about it 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:56.820
 beautiful ride but not wool 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.820
 too thick otherwise there are spots 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:30.830
 we are your paper and lay a week 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.479
 on it comes this big role of the club 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.659
 to use rent beautiful with 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:39.080
 taste down from even after 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.550
 ahead 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:47.599
 so that really all contours 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:51.879
 now comes the voice of the 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.879
 deduct truth once 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.349
 we have our little piggy one 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.000
 Here are some bright ones 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.009
 that's because I put this 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.470
 Do not immediately pore from the linoleum 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.580
 do not suck the paint immediately 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.750
 record then you just enter 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.400
 two printers serious waste if 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.849
 you print it before and let it matter 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.560
 what is and then there are about as 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:20.719
 from yes that was it already from mine 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.919
 small instructions as I said if you 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:24.080
 Have a little more practice with it 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.250
 Can you do that too ? 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.849
 I'll show you again 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.349
 short of 1 out of nine , it can work like that 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.440
 For example, more factory look 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.580
 this is a tri-color linoldruck i 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.080
 I hope I have a little incentive 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.520
 give yourself a bit creative now 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.060
 let off steam and I wish you a lot 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.060
 watch the fun
