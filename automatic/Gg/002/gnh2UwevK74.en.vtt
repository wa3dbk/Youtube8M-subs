00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
really important to use something with

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.330 
really important to use something with
that<00:04:05.379> tamper<00:04:05.859> or<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.099> plunger<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.780> Vitamix<00:04:08.340> is

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
that tamper or a plunger the Vitamix is

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.500 
that tamper or a plunger the Vitamix is
the<00:04:10.150> best<00:04:10.359> one<00:04:10.569> for<00:04:10.599> this<00:04:10.900> in<00:04:11.230> my<00:04:11.470> experience

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
the best one for this in my experience

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.479 
the best one for this in my experience
or<00:04:13.510> there's<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.959> new<00:04:14.019> Blendtec<00:04:14.709> model<00:04:15.129> that<00:04:15.340> has

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
or there's a new Blendtec model that has

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.310 
or there's a new Blendtec model that has
come<00:04:15.730> out<00:04:15.879> I<00:04:15.910> think<00:04:16.150> that's<00:04:16.660> good<00:04:16.959> for<00:04:16.989> like

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
come out I think that's good for like

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.800 
come out I think that's good for like
making<00:04:17.650> ice<00:04:17.769> creams<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.280> sorbets<00:04:18.609> so<00:04:19.539> you<00:04:19.630> can

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
making ice creams and sorbets so you can

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.770 
making ice creams and sorbets so you can
try<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.199> so<00:04:21.190> we're<00:04:21.430> just<00:04:21.459> gonna<00:04:21.639> shove<00:04:22.510> down

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
try that so we're just gonna shove down

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.450 
try that so we're just gonna shove down
with<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.260> tamper<00:04:23.800> push<00:04:24.070> everything<00:04:24.310> down

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
with the tamper push everything down

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.370 
with the tamper push everything down
into<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.910> blades<00:04:25.180> let<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.539> blend<00:04:25.720> up<00:04:25.960> at<00:04:26.110> first

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
into the blades let it blend up at first

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.170 
into the blades let it blend up at first
we'll<00:04:26.680> get<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> little<00:04:27.100> bit<00:04:27.220> like<00:04:27.370> powdery<00:04:28.000> like

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
we'll get a little bit like powdery like

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.129 
we'll get a little bit like powdery like
like<00:04:28.479> ice

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
like ice

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.830 
like ice

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
like an icy kind of thing or a snow cone

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.600 
like an icy kind of thing or a snow cone
type<00:04:32.289> thing<00:04:32.560> just<00:04:32.830> keep<00:04:33.070> blending<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.580> little

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
type thing just keep blending a little

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.070 
type thing just keep blending a little
bit<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.090> you'll<00:04:34.180> see<00:04:34.360> it'll<00:04:34.539> start<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.930> like

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
bit and you'll see it'll start to like

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.610 
bit and you'll see it'll start to like
smooth<00:04:35.470> out<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.039> get<00:04:36.250> more<00:04:36.580> like<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.849> sorbet

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
smooth out and get more like a sorbet

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.440 
smooth out and get more like a sorbet
like<00:04:38.620> more<00:04:38.830> creamy<00:04:39.220> looking<00:04:39.669> so<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.270> keep

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
like more creamy looking so just keep

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.670 
like more creamy looking so just keep
doing<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:40.960> make<00:04:41.080> sure<00:04:41.110> you're<00:04:41.380> not<00:04:41.500> over

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
doing that and make sure you're not over

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.950 
doing that and make sure you're not over
blending<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.550> can<00:04:42.789> always<00:04:42.910> just<00:04:43.060> if<00:04:43.840> you

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
blending so you can always just if you

blending so you can always just if you
think<00:04:44.200> it<00:04:44.349> might<00:04:44.650> be<00:04:44.860> right<00:04:45.039> or<00:04:45.280> maybe<00:04:45.430> getting

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
think it might be right or maybe getting

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.610 
think it might be right or maybe getting
to<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.000> place<00:04:46.210> just<00:04:46.690> take<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.050> stop<00:04:47.440> it

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
to that place just take that stop it

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.320 
to that place just take that stop it
take<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:47.979> top<00:04:48.160> off<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.400> taste<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.970> look<00:04:49.180> at<00:04:49.300> it

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.850 
take the top off and taste it look at it
and<00:04:49.690> you'll<00:04:49.900> know<00:04:50.050> by<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.289> texture<00:04:52.800> okay<00:04:53.800> so

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
and you'll know by the texture okay so

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.920 
and you'll know by the texture okay so
this<00:04:54.340> is<00:04:54.700> what<00:04:54.849> we<00:04:54.970> want<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.240> texture<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.810> be

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
this is what we want the texture to be

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.350 
this is what we want the texture to be
like<00:04:56.169> it's<00:04:56.830> like<00:04:57.160> kind<00:04:57.460> of<00:04:57.580> creamy<00:04:57.880> looking

if you blend too far and it starts

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.550 
if you blend too far and it starts
getting<00:05:10.060> mush<00:05:10.330> then<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:10.840> can<00:05:10.960> just<00:05:11.169> stick<00:05:11.440> it

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
getting mush then you can just stick it

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.620 
getting mush then you can just stick it
in<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.740> freezer<00:05:11.979> for<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:13.000> little<00:05:13.030> while<00:05:13.330> and

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
doing this for keeping it from melting

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.029 
doing this for keeping it from melting
you<00:05:30.250> can<00:05:30.460> put<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.819> bowl<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:32.259> freezer<00:05:32.500> or

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
you can put the bowl in the freezer or

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.369 
you can put the bowl in the freezer or
hand<00:05:33.310> if<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:33.699> want<00:05:33.940> and<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.870> bowl<00:05:35.050> will<00:05:35.259> be

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.140 
hand if you want and the bowl will be
cold<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:35.830> when<00:05:35.949> you<00:05:36.069> scoop<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:36.430> in<00:05:36.580> there<00:05:36.789> it'll

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
cold so when you scoop it in there it'll

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.589 
cold so when you scoop it in there it'll
stay<00:05:37.629> cold<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:39.430> can<00:05:39.550> also<00:05:39.759> scoop<00:05:40.389> it<00:05:40.509> in

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.129 
there and then if you're not going to
eat<00:05:42.099> it<00:05:42.220> right<00:05:42.400> then<00:05:42.699> like<00:05:42.909> maybe<00:05:43.139> five

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
eat it right then like maybe five

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.600 
eat it right then like maybe five
minutes<00:05:44.440> from<00:05:44.530> now<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:44.800> can<00:05:45.069> scoop<00:05:45.400> it<00:05:45.460> in

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
minutes from now you can scoop it in

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.309 
minutes from now you can scoop it in
here<00:05:45.940> into<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:46.389> bowl<00:05:46.569> and<00:05:46.900> then<00:05:47.020> put<00:05:47.199> the

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
here into the bowl and then put the

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.100 
here into the bowl and then put the
whole<00:05:47.470> bowl<00:05:48.180> into<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.300> freezer<00:05:49.539> for<00:05:49.900> five

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
whole bowl into the freezer for five

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.719 
whole bowl into the freezer for five
minutes<00:05:50.379> to<00:05:50.560> kind<00:05:50.710> of<00:05:50.800> keep<00:05:50.979> it<00:05:51.159> cool<00:05:51.400> until

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
minutes to kind of keep it cool until

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.180 
minutes to kind of keep it cool until
you<00:05:52.000> eat<00:05:52.210> it<00:05:52.330> so<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:52.569> doesn't<00:05:52.840> melt<00:05:53.139> and<00:05:53.590> you

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
you eat it so it doesn't melt and you

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.409 
you eat it so it doesn't melt and you
could<00:05:54.370> probably<00:05:54.580> chop<00:05:55.000> up<00:05:55.150> some<00:05:55.180> fresh

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
could probably chop up some fresh

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.210 
could probably chop up some fresh
watermelon<00:05:55.990> and<00:05:56.319> put<00:05:56.470> it<00:05:56.590> in<00:05:56.710> there<00:05:56.889> I<00:05:57.159> don't

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
watermelon and put it in there I don't

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.069 
watermelon and put it in there I don't
know<00:05:57.370> you<00:05:57.580> can<00:05:57.729> get<00:05:57.880> creative<00:05:58.060> and<00:05:59.069> enjoy
