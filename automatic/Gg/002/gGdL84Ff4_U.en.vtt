if you look on the back of your TV you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.290 
if you look on the back of your TV you
don't<00:02:44.690> see<00:02:45.080> those<00:02:45.320> connections

you're<00:02:47.300> still<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.960> luck<00:02:48.200> because<00:02:48.470> we<00:02:49.070> have<00:02:49.220> a

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
you're still in luck because we have a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.560 
you're still in luck because we have a
couple<00:02:49.490> models<00:02:49.850> for<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:50.390> you're

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
couple models for you but you're

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.640 
couple models for you but you're
probably<00:02:50.690> gonna<00:02:50.930> end<00:02:50.990> up<00:02:51.140> spending<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.560> little

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
probably gonna end up spending a little

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.010 
probably gonna end up spending a little
more<00:02:51.830> money<00:02:52.240> what<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.360> probably<00:02:53.630> have<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:53.959> the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
more money what you probably have in the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.680 
more money what you probably have in the
back<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.380> TV<00:02:54.709> is<00:02:54.860> an<00:02:54.980> optical<00:02:55.610> or<00:02:55.880> coaxial

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
back of the TV is an optical or coaxial

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.530 
back of the TV is an optical or coaxial
digital<00:02:56.959> connection<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:58.130> those<00:02:58.850> look<00:02:59.360> like

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
digital connection and those look like

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.410 
digital connection and those look like
this

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.300 

so<00:03:04.140> if<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.350> look<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> back<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.830> your<00:03:05.010> TV

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
so if you look on the back of your TV

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.920 
so if you look on the back of your TV
and<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.580> don't<00:03:05.760> have<00:03:05.940> those<00:03:06.210> little<00:03:06.270> red<00:03:06.810> and

see<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> little<00:03:10.680> square<00:03:11.100> connector<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.060> kind

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
see a little square connector that kind

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.510 
see a little square connector that kind
of<00:03:12.270> has<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.630> black<00:03:13.110> door<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.830> that's<00:03:14.310> an
