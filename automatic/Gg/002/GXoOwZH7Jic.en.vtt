00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 here we are inside 208 are 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.929
 always in the company of carlo he makes us from 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.920
 cicerone inside the city car of 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 moment 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.660
 hello hello carlo then here we are 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.810
 I am fascinated by the interior of 208 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.099
 I studied and saw on the internet that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.750
 this design was made by one 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.099
 designer don that surely made a 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.690
 work because when entering which I enter 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 immediately had a feeling of being 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.879
 finally inside a city car a car 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.070
 actually new features 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.260
 I immediately jump to the eye I see immediately 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.320
 that the dashboard is very particular 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.590
 what you say yes for sure one thing 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 characteristic of the 208 own the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.699
 dashboard primarily to all that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.140
 is the quadrant of the various rev counter 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.850
 speedometer that has a position a little 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.299
 different than the norm 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.610
 because it is no longer seen through 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.130
 steering wheel races but can be seen above 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.869
 flight then a position that distracts 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.860
 the less the look from the guide is much more 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.280
 obviously easier perceptive here 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.380
 are all steering wheel controls 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 they command a radio rather than the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.260
 bluetooth then the functions of the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 phone you know this big screen that is 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.360
 another feature of the 208 that is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.580
 a touchscreen that is always present 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.399
 in the car from the construction 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.050
 intermediate onwards 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.800
 we say that everyone asks me is the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.320
 navigator 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.360
 no no it is not the navigator is a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.640
 touchscreen that serves to control the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.000
 radio bluetooth and computer 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.680
 board 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.110
 so all the functions 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.789
 linked to these 3 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.130
 this does not exclude that if you want you can 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.170
 have as an option also to live like 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.030
 optional by ordering it from the beginning in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.860
 everyone in all the arrangements is possible 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.649
 have also the navigator as an option 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.929
 certainly certain and I'm looking at it then 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.480
 practically in the center or the reference 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.480
 on-board computer if I 'm not wrong 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.580
 or no cruise control, however, there is also 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.030
 the limiter is the speed limiter 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.730
 speed the city what are they but here 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.400
 I see that there is the possibility of 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.650
 be able to activate navigator and excuse me 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.870
 the coach is regular with the of 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.170
 speed in d has capacity within reach 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.209
 but no 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.750
 apologize for a moment about the speech 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.910
 of the steering wheel smaller than the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.560
 usual 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.680
 absolutely yes new feature 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.750
 even of 208 is precisely this compared to 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.090
 all that the competition a 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.060
 steering wheel of a much smaller diameter 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.200
 therefore much more manageable, manageable 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.870
 much more beautiful to drive because 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.720
 it seems maybe to drive a car from 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.280
 run a kart thing almost or later 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.739
 as for the others 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.170
 functionality I see here is the possibility 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.519
 to orient the flow as always 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.700
 Air lurks see here 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.799
 possibility to activate also the 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.720
 air conditioner air conditioners that 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.890
 in this case the manual this 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.360
 set up here is the set up 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.100
 intermediate called active 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.130
 but the manual climate control and let's say 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.650
 the most widespread version 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.420
 wanting there is also the superior version 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.760
 the upper equipment that has a 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.220
 automatic climate control and 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.620
 interior finishes obviously more accurate 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.580
 the more I took care of it I wanted to do a moment 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.010
 a panoramic migrate second back to 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.150
 see however that they are five seats 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.730
 however, for this is a car 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.180
 registered for five passengers are 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.030
 grate for 5 seats and space a 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.440
 arrangement is certainly abundant 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.120
 for those that are the dimensions 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.200
 inserting the machine 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.380
 last thing or how many versions of 208 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.050
 there are some of them 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.519
 four outfits there is the preparation 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:21.609
 base that the first set up that 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.790
 we say without air conditioning and without 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.950
 radio for those looking for the price 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.540
 above all there is the car then there is 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.160
 the intermediate equipment that is that 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.970
 more sold than the one we are on 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.729
 seated 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.200
 I continue that we are watching there is a 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.110
 third set up called 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.020
 business that is sold let's just say ed 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.310
 exclusively to those who use the machine 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.800
 such as 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.600
 and a half from work and then there is a fourth 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.430
 preparation that the then is 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.980
 definitely the one with the most finishes 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.950
 cared for than automatic climate control 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.890
 and the most refined finished a priori 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.780
 you hear a very last thing turning off 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.260
 the car that says if we take a look at the 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:09.310
 luggage rack so let's see that 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:11.400
 which is the capacity the spies tell us 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.400
 that we are going down with the key 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 remained 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:23.499
 active here is this is the 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.499
 this is the trunk 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.620
 also the trunk 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.460
 very roomy for those that are 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.460
 car size 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.949
 therefore also with regard to the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.810
 possibility to say so insert 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.699
 transform the car to methane or gpl this 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.370
 poignant both with the study that is the 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.400
 torre dal e for the LPG cylinder 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.669
 therefore when the transformation mounts to 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.669
 gpl there was no space in the trunk and in 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.629
 in case the cylinders were mounted instead 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.389
 of methane 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:06:00.330
 the trunk is halved if there is half 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.500
 a normal thing can be knocked down 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.960
 seats 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.470
 I see two thirds and a third can be 16 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.039
 two-thirds regulatory a third has a lot 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:14.550
 they simply break down I can see 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.009
 here how how it works if you make me do you 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.419
 to see 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:23.909
 we see a little Libyan the key of 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:29.360
 I calculate here if you show me while 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.360
 moments so I see it from here I see how it is 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.210
 is 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:39.230
 and therefore one is killed in practice 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:45.740
 city ​​car that can load a lot 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:49.810
 very very good material 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.430
 carlo I thank you I hope I have given 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.200
 to have given as much information as possible 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.210
 to all those interested in 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.490
 this to this car 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.620
 for now it's all from the dealership 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.780
 car 90 of Ancona I salute you and to 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.780
 next hello thanks hello hello hello
