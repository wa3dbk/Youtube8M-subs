 she is only 5 years old but lives in a bed and breathes with the help of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.700
 marÃ­a fernanda has an atrophy in the spine since the birth of 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.290
 hope of him and the mother are the embryonic stem cells is the 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.170
 unique possibility of cure 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.849
 this order of net worth 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.929
 Brazil already has research with adult stem cells taken from 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.119
 anyone 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.119
 the institute of the heart has already achieved good results with cells withdrawn 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.039
 of the hip site for heart disease treatment 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.980
 the problem here these cells 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 suffer all the aggressions that the individual of 50 60 70 years ended up 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 exposing factors such as diabetics from smoking high blood pressure can affect the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.120
 This is one of the reasons why 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 hostage to use at least in stem cell research 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.930
 the biosafety law that is being questioned in the supreme 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.240
 federal court 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.920
 allows the use of human embryos stored for more than three years from the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.950
 With parental permission 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.170
 after this summons happens 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 the embryos that are not used are therefore from the check in and before 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.000
 nitrogen to a negative 196 degrees and can stay here for years 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.030
 is the couple who owns the embryos 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.460
 and decided that it will be done with them but never 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.119
 can be discarded 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.620
 the federal council of forbidden medicine 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.900
 the stem cell research in Brazil 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.759
 embryonic happens in brazil 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.240
 country with material coming from outside the country the ministry of health finances 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.299
 three surveys with this type of cell hope that one day the treatment can be 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.930
 used in the single health care system these expensive invasive procedures 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.330
 traumatic injuries that the patient in a certain way requiring hospitalization that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.820
 require a lot of things read with bites can be replaced by the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.340
 optimization precisely by the placement of stem cells 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.850
 - injured players 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.000
 I understood then was this and shows that for the single health system is this 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.490
 can represent a monthly saving
