00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.790
 please many people

 warning that some users are not 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.840
 able to do the installation due to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.399
 a code error 80 18 8:30 to eff 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.469
 Microsoft said it is investigating 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.300
 the cause of this error and that the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.030
 suspicion is low 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.290
 appliance storage available 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.479
 therefore if you face this kind of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.640
 problem has to make more room your 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.380

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.310
 comments down here 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.360
 I would like to comment on the announcement of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.189
 microsoft 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.470
 I'm going to ask a question and it may come up 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.960
 geddel port sector boss windows 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.610
 microsoft phone said yes 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.070
 if you install selection by thousand with 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.530
 password may escalate it, but when 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 it is available for the device 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.720
 well now let's go to the news of the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.720
 system 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.929
 there and folders 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.689
 the first and undoubtedly the greatest novelty 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.700
 have all available are the folders 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.030
 dynamics or how they are more 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.829
 known there and folders with them can 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.170
 organize in a much more practical way 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.969
 and efficiently bring their natalie start 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.799
 to create a background line 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.780
 just drag the taille on top 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.159
 and the folder will be created 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.799
 you can add how many applications 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.239
 want each folder and can also name it 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.459
 any way you want 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.959
 few realize is that it is 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.790
 possible to even put a lot with 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.400
 the folder name to make it even 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.500
 more personalized for it passes 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:27.549

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:35.940
 text echo in folder name 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:49.200
 See how much more attractive and 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.200
 that way customizable light times 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.489
 Another novelty is the app store 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.650
 gained support for life style 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.690
 now constantly displays name 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.760
 Recommended user applications 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.620
 you can turn the function on or off 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.590
 any time and in the settings of the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.510
 same xbox store that will also give 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.760
 support vital to display the cover 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.650
 some that are being produced in this 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.569
 function will arrive at the next 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.840
 application that is promised to the 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:22.240
 next Friday 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.790
 applications 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.070
 the very interesting new resource to 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.870
 application steps and resources as well 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.450
 similar to the child's space 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.100
 Only with less limitations would I 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.170
 bring more detail about two features 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.330
 very soon here on the channel on the board 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.370
 verses plus an important tip and I 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.500
 I want to give it to you is to go out 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.750
 this way you must press the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.430
 locking the device and when the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.500
 option to switch off the appliance 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.240
 think it looks right and so 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.750
 then you will return to normal mode 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.820
 internet sharing user 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.260
 more good news in the system 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.410
 now you can share your 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.480
 3g or 4g internet through bluetooth 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.430
 you can share with up to seven 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.540
 devices so you get two 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.340
 benefits 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.230
 the first is that it is not necessary anymore 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.480
 enter the network name and password for the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.550
 devices and the second is that the name of 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.090
 energy as the bluetooth consuming 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:24.250
 less energy than if we covers 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.990
 smartbox enabled this feature is not yet 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.390
 totally motivated at the moment in the version 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.330
 preview of the system but you can already see 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.250
 in the settings menu an option called 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.750
 accessories applications 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.730
 here where you will probably go 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.210
 set up your smart flip covers 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.320
 compatible smartphones 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.970
 remembering that the rumors indicate that the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.250
 microsoft will launch its first website 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.680
 shot this year for those who do not know 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.880
 the marketwatch the smart watch 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.980
 where can you walk with your 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.960
 smartphone perform a simple task 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.550
 how to reject a call the motto 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.260
 notification right there 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.970
 rest assured that if this rumor 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.700
 confirm I worked everything first hand 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:05.470
 here on the channel to delete messages in the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.750
 secret here only that it is now possible 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.350
 delete multiple sms messages from one 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.130
 turn 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.440
 to open a message that touches 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.690
 option to select messages by selecting 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:23.790
 message if you want to lie down and click the 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:26.050
 delete custom snooze button 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.750
 this is probably the novelty that most 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.010
 went unnoticed by all but how 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.780
 I always seek to bring information 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.640
 exclusive to the channel 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.320
 I realized that now this can customize 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.009
 to convince the duration of the nap 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.259
 in app 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.389
 the dollar man so you can increase 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.919
 that five minutes to 10 or even 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.999
 even an hour of good and good 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.999
 used the nap 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.550
