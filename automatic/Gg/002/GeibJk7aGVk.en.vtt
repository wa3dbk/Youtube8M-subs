this<00:00:03.149> technique<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.720> trusting<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.350> trusting

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
this technique is trusting and trusting

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.670 
this technique is trusting and trusting
is<00:00:04.920> where<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.190> take<00:00:05.370> some<00:00:05.580> butcher's<00:00:05.970> twine<00:00:06.000> or

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
is where we take some butcher's twine or

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.650 
is where we take some butcher's twine or
kitchen<00:00:07.680> twine<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.670> use<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> tie<00:00:09.360> meat

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
kitchen twine and we use it to tie meat

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.770 
kitchen twine and we use it to tie meat
together<00:00:10.110> such<00:00:10.530> as<00:00:10.710> beef<00:00:11.130> tenderloin<00:00:11.820> pork

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
together such as beef tenderloin pork

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.129 
together such as beef tenderloin pork
loin<00:00:13.080> where<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.700> large<00:00:15.059> end<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.870> you

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
loin where you have a large end and you

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
loin where you have a large end and you
have<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> very<00:00:16.590> thin<00:00:16.949> end<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.850> want<00:00:18.029> to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
have a very thin end and you want to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.849 
have a very thin end and you want to
actually<00:00:18.240> fold<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.750> thin<00:00:18.960> end<00:00:19.170> over<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.770> we

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
actually fold the thin end over so we

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.769 
actually fold the thin end over so we
have<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> nice<00:00:20.250> uniform<00:00:20.760> piece<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.420> meat<00:00:21.600> so

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
have a nice uniform piece of meat so

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.410 
have a nice uniform piece of meat so
that<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.230> cooks<00:00:22.470> all<00:00:22.680> at<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> same<00:00:23.340> time<00:00:26.420> I'm

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that it cooks all at the same time I'm

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.790 
that it cooks all at the same time I'm

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.630 
the back here and just pull very gently
and<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.720> does<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and what this does is you can see if I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
and what this does is you can see if I
just<00:01:38.880> let<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.450> slack<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:40.290> chickens<00:01:40.650> flat

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
just let this go slack my chickens flat

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.999 
just let this go slack my chickens flat
when<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> pull<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.060> gently<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.110> becomes<00:01:43.799> nice

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
when I pull this gently it becomes nice

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
when I pull this gently it becomes nice
and<00:01:44.040> plump<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.939> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> comes<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.810> together

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and plump and kind of comes all together

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.700 
and plump and kind of comes all together
and<00:01:46.610> what<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.820> does<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:49.079> actually

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and what this does is it is actually

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.399 
and what this does is it is actually
creating<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.369> nice<00:01:50.880> uniform<00:01:51.420> shape<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
creating a nice uniform shape so that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.960 
creating a nice uniform shape so that
when<00:01:52.560> things<00:01:52.770> cook<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.610> cook<00:01:53.820> at

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
when things cook they actually cook at

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.740 
when things cook they actually cook at
the<00:01:54.270> same<00:01:54.509> time<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.670> gently<00:01:56.670> pull<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.360> then

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the same time so gently pull and then

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.450 
the same time so gently pull and then
I'm<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> wrap<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.009> string<00:01:59.280> around<00:02:01.460> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
I'm going to wrap the string around the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580 
I'm going to wrap the string around the
end<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> drumstick<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.630> around<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
end of the drumstick here around the
