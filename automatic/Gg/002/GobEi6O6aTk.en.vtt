in<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.199> video<00:00:01.439> we're<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.860> explain<00:00:02.310> how

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
in this video we're going to explain how

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.210 
in this video we're going to explain how
to<00:00:02.730> use<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.570> an<00:00:03.810> aux<00:00:04.290> channel<00:00:04.680> on<00:00:04.980> your

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
to use the an aux channel on your

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.950 
to use the an aux channel on your
transfer<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.730> control<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.390> gain<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
transfer to control the gain in the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.890 
transfer to control the gain in the
model<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:08.490> tend<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.760> recommend<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.690> use

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
model we tend to recommend you just use

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.419 
model we tend to recommend you just use
the<00:00:10.080> internal<00:00:10.440> gain<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:11.010> other<00:00:11.130> words<00:00:11.280> where

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
the internal gain in other words where

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.310 
the internal gain in other words where
no<00:00:11.610> aux<00:00:11.820> channel<00:00:12.090> controls<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.750> game<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.170> can

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
no aux channel controls the game you can

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.470 
no aux channel controls the game you can
do<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.620> from<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> very<00:00:14.639> beginning<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.240> lot<00:00:15.360> of

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
do that from the very beginning a lot of

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.640 
do that from the very beginning a lot of
advanced<00:00:15.719> pilots<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.470> fine<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
advanced pilots I think it's fine to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.560 
advanced pilots I think it's fine to
even<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.699> want<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.150> use<00:00:18.359> an

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
even do that but if you want to use an

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.599 
even do that but if you want to use an
aux<00:00:18.750> channel<00:00:19.020> control<00:00:19.500> your<00:00:19.650> gain<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
aux channel control your gain this is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.420 
aux channel control your gain this is
how<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> would<00:00:21.090> do<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:22.010> first<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.100> enter<00:00:23.250> your

how you would do it first to enter your

how you would do it first to enter your
basic<00:00:23.760> menus<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.230> neutrals<00:00:25.710> limits

you're<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> gain<00:00:29.910> settings<00:00:30.420> I've<00:00:30.599> already<00:00:30.720> got

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
you're to gain settings I've already got

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.450 
you're to gain settings I've already got
it<00:00:31.050> set<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.260> an<00:00:31.439> all<00:00:31.910> exchan<00:00:33.890> it's<00:00:34.890> an<00:00:34.980> internal

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it set on an all exchan it's an internal

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.540 
it set on an all exchan it's an internal
channel<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.260> set<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.890> unit<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.370> from

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
channel so it's set in the unit not from

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.920 
channel so it's set in the unit not from
your<00:00:38.640> transmitter<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> want<00:00:39.690> an<00:00:39.750> aux

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
your transmitter if you want an aux

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
your transmitter if you want an aux
channel<00:00:40.140> control<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.610> flick<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
channel control it you just flick the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
channel control it you just flick the
switch<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.629> case<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.989> August<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
switch in this case it's August to I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.760 
switch in this case it's August to I
could<00:00:43.980> choose<00:00:44.250> gear<00:00:44.899> to<00:00:45.899> control<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
could choose gear to control it but in

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.190 
could choose gear to control it but in
this<00:00:46.829> case<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.219> use<00:00:47.430> aux<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.660> I've

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
this case I'm use aux to so I've

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.069 
this case I'm use aux to so I've
selected<00:00:49.469> ox2<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:51.000> what's<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
selected ox2 is my what's going to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.380 
selected ox2 is my what's going to
change<00:00:52.110> my<00:00:52.350> gain<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> transmitter<00:00:53.390> I'll

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
change my gain from the transmitter I'll

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.240 
change my gain from the transmitter I'll
go<00:00:54.510> out<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.780> those<00:00:54.870> menus<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
go out of those menus then I go to the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.830 
go out of those menus then I go to the
advanced<00:00:56.699> menu<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.270> I'll<00:00:57.360> hold<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> button

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
advanced menu so I'll hold the button

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.959 
advanced menu so I'll hold the button
till<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> lights<00:00:58.230> flash<00:00:58.550> that's<00:00:59.550> advanced

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
till the lights flash that's advanced

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.939 
till the lights flash that's advanced
menu<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:00.780> actual<00:01:00.960> gain<00:01:01.500> I've<00:01:01.800> got

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
menu and that's my actual gain I've got

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.479 
menu and that's my actual gain I've got
it<00:01:02.070> set<00:01:02.660> internally<00:01:03.680> this<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.979> set<00:01:05.280> at

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it set internally this one is set at

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.390 
it set internally this one is set at
eighty<00:01:05.790> percent<00:01:06.030> off<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.250> which<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
eighty percent off to and which is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
eighty percent off to and which is
basically<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> same<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> default<00:01:09.360> game<00:01:09.810> no

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
basically the same as a default game no

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.210 
basically the same as a default game no
i<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.320> raise<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:13.220> keep

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
i can raise that game it's going up keep

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800 
i can raise that game it's going up keep
changing<00:01:14.610> until<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> goes<00:01:15.000> high<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.659> can

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
changing until it goes high or i can

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.370 
changing until it goes high or i can
lower<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:17.210> keep<00:01:18.210> changing<00:01:18.600> until<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.960> goes<00:01:19.080> low

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
lower it keep changing until it goes low

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
lower it keep changing until it goes low
and<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:20.939> down<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.150> almost
