00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
right what's the what's the most

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.590 
right what's the what's the most
rewarding<00:02:32.140> part<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.190> all<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:34.180> most<00:02:34.360> fun

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
rewarding part of it all the most fun

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.840

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
part and the most rewarding part I mean

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.780 
part and the most rewarding part I mean
I<00:02:37.150> think<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:38.019> most<00:02:38.200> rewarding<00:02:38.350> part<00:02:38.800> probably

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
I think the most rewarding part probably

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.750 
I think the most rewarding part probably
is<00:02:39.910> being<00:02:40.480> able<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.780> get<00:02:41.019> involved<00:02:41.260> with

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
is being able to get involved with

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.880 
is being able to get involved with
people's<00:02:42.760> lives<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.600> are<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.410> part<00:02:44.739> of

know about their family about good

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.210 
know about their family about good
things<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.350> happen<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.769> them<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.069> bad

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
things that happen to them and bad

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.400 
things that happen to them and bad
things<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.550> happen<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:55.209> think<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.870> just

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
things that happen that I think I just

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.840 
things that happen that I think I just
do<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.680> private<00:02:56.890> practice<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.640> kind<00:02:57.819> of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
do a private practice it just kind of

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.670 
do a private practice it just kind of
happened<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.870> know<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.019> interviewed<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.500> bunch

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680

happened you know I interviewed a bunch
of<00:02:59.800> places<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.400> think<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.269> private<00:03:01.720> practice

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
of places I think in a private practice

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.850 
of places I think in a private practice
setting<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:03.190> might<00:03:03.310> work<00:03:03.580> harder<00:03:04.000> or<00:03:04.269> call

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
setting you might work harder or call

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.550 
setting you might work harder or call
but<00:03:05.860> more<00:03:06.250> rewarding<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.900> actually<00:03:08.410> get

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
but more rewarding that you actually get

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.039 
but more rewarding that you actually get
to<00:03:08.680> decide<00:03:08.890> what<00:03:09.069> your<00:03:09.190> hours<00:03:09.519> are<00:03:09.700> or<00:03:10.120> when

it's time to hire a doctor you get to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.039 
it's time to hire a doctor you get to
kind<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.549> hit<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.820> pick<00:03:13.030> or<00:03:13.570> if<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.720> work<00:03:13.900> at<00:03:14.019> a

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
kind of hit the pick or if you work at a

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.050 
kind of hit the pick or if you work at a
big<00:03:14.200> hospital<00:03:14.620> system<00:03:14.980> they<00:03:15.489> tell<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:15.850> when

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
partner is going to be so you definitely

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.860 
partner is going to be so you definitely
lose<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.340> lot<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.820> say<00:03:25.060> as<00:03:25.120> far<00:03:25.360> as<00:03:25.510> how<00:03:25.660> things

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
lose a lot of say as far as how things

lose a lot of say as far as how things
are<00:03:26.049> going<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.260> go<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.650> think<00:03:27.280> it's<00:03:27.400> more

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
are going to go I think it's more

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.039 
are going to go I think it's more
rewarding<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:28.120> be<00:03:28.150> in<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.450> situation<00:03:28.660> where<00:03:28.930> you

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
rewarding to be in a situation where you

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.750 
rewarding to be in a situation where you
have<00:03:29.140> more<00:03:29.440> control<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:30.519> know<00:03:30.610> if<00:03:30.670> you're

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
have more control you know if you're

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.160 
have more control you know if you're
working<00:03:30.910> with<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.209> group<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.450> could<00:03:31.750> fire<00:03:31.989> you

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
working with a group that could fire you

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.140 
working with a group that could fire you
they<00:03:32.380> could<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:33.400> know<00:03:33.430> what's<00:03:33.970> going<00:03:34.120> to

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
they could you know what's going to

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150 
they could you know what's going to
happen<00:03:34.480> but<00:03:35.200> there's<00:03:35.470> less<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.859> you<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.040> to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
happen but there's less that you have to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.069 
happen but there's less that you have to
worry<00:03:36.340> about<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.730> some<00:03:36.970> ways<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.720> might<00:03:37.900> not
