00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Best regards, dear students, my 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.720
 name is jorge palaces I'm a teacher 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.370
 binding 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.680
 in this continent I will teach 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.040
 as in flying 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.010
 by number of witnesses 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.980
 you see each block 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.550
 each block of paper 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.160
 it goes 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.940
 a book will suffice 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.940
 in this case there are several 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.350
 from the form 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.429
 from the way one on top of another that 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.429
 it is put in order 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.480
 that this right leaves 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 and it has to be a rule 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.730
 and with my hands support me 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.600
 let's have the 2nd 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.320
 and also here that you can on the wall to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.000
 that this right 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.079
 and we will not continue not to form a frame 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.370
 here but this right 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.370
 and well flat 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.350
 teach a way 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.420
 before I get to be in this 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.620
 position has to be fine 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.750
 paired well stopped this way of 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.180
 100 passes 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.130
 to this stack of paper that is going to be a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.130
 a rumba the approximate numbers 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.299
 to 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.460
 of couple 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.460
 like two leaves 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.719
 one on top of the other enzymes 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.719
 white 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 why 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.610
 i 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.680
 Y 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.840
 so as not to dirty the second sheet of 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.800
 work that serves as a respect sheet 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.800
 the same happens under 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.290
 I already gave it 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.360
 so you can differentiate and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.380
 I can take it out I have to put a 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.100
 separator 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.830
 contains separator because the color 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.080
 it will allow me at the moment of 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.010
 finish decorating and drying this myself 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.450
 I can take out a little block 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.140
 ah 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.140
 5 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.469
 and the front to the wall 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.170
 sticking with the rule the levels both 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.020
 sides 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.530
 to tax law 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.530
 we are also 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.000
 it's more I do not need the guillotine anymore 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.800
 to refer 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.800
 because all the works also couples 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.230
 in base 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.010
 right fee 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.850
 with one more separator 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.840
 the same procedure speak another 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.879
 in this position everything has to be 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.500
 well even leaves the leaves well in couple 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.910
 have associated with this video day to 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.780
 stop crying just one by one 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.780
 as an aroma 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.840
 one 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.840
 same 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.150
 the red 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.310
 ah 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.460
 and from below 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.639
 ah 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.639
 ah 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.870
 to 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.629
 it pushes so it's convenient that it be in my 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.629
 base 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.969
 in the same center 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.009
 look at my base 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:03.749
 this is so 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.749
 all are also stuck 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.100
 Thank you 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.039
 at par in percent 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.940
 Y 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.940
 and so we are 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.670
 We continue with the explanation of 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.320
 cast by quantities of risks 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.930
 and even some row 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.460
 with your separators now we're going to 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.180
 find 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.180
 8 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.840
 the car not now as well as painting a 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.840
 couple like that 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.740
 pressed by the left hand 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.780
 and he arrived 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.940
 from bottom to top 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.210
 in such a way 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.640
 now 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.290
 like me 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.290
 for negotiation 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.460
 there 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.800
 a paper over here 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.800
 in a weight 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.280
 does it move
