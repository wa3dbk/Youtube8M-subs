00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
kind of spread all over the place but

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
weakness because you leave a gap it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
weakness because you leave a gap it
immediately<00:01:19.920> starts<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.460> cause<00:01:20.610> chaos<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
immediately starts to cause chaos and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.460 
immediately starts to cause chaos and
you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.750> what's<00:01:21.930> happened<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you can see what's happened like in the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.600 
you can see what's happened like in the
middle<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> map<00:01:22.950> though<00:01:23.100> we've<00:01:23.220> lost<00:01:23.400> our

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
middle of the map though we've lost our

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.219 
middle of the map though we've lost our
two<00:01:23.790> three<00:01:24.000> guys<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.659> probably<00:01:24.780> only<00:01:24.990> one

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
two three guys it's probably only one

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.660 
two three guys it's probably only one
guy<00:01:25.409> over<00:01:25.439> there<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.070> we're<00:01:26.189> still<00:01:26.400> really

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
guy over there now so we're still really

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.300 
guy over there now so we're still really
really<00:01:26.970> weak<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.290> we've<00:01:28.860> got<00:01:29.040> such

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
really weak and you know we've got such

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.819 
really weak and you know we've got such
focus<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.170> next<00:01:31.439> important

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
focus here so but the next important

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.380 
focus here so but the next important
thing<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.070> coming<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.270> know

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
thing is coming up where we you know

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
thing is coming up where we you know
lose<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.369> assess

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
lose this one and then we have to assess

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
lose this one and then we have to assess
what's<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> happen<00:01:36.689> next<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> can

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
what's going to happen next now you can

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
what's going to happen next now you can
see<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.979> they're<00:01:38.159> fully<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:38.820> over<00:01:39.119> our<00:01:39.240> base

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
see that they're fully all over our base

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
see that they're fully all over our base
now<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.840> we're<00:01:39.930> gonna<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.320> work<00:01:40.350> really

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
now and we're gonna have to work really

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.889 
now and we're gonna have to work really
hard<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.310> clear<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:42.030> now<00:01:42.570> look<00:01:42.750> at<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
hard to clear this out now look at the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.690 
hard to clear this out now look at the
map<00:01:43.049> right<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:43.439> okay<00:01:43.710> everyone's<00:01:44.460> moving

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
map right now okay everyone's moving

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
map right now okay everyone's moving
back<00:01:45.000> forward<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:45.479> again<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.930> still<00:01:46.110> very

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
back forward but again it's still very

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.080 
back forward but again it's still very
very<00:01:46.680> weak<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.250> hand<00:01:47.460> side<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
very weak on the right hand side of an a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.179 
very weak on the right hand side of an a
and<00:01:48.329> again<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.229> comes<00:01:49.350> back<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.740> another<00:01:49.920> thing

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
and again it comes back to another thing

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.560 
and again it comes back to another thing
that<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.340> regularly<00:01:50.520> say<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.329> don't

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
that I regularly say it which is don't

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.600 
that I regularly say it which is don't
stay<00:01:51.899> behind<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.470> M<00:01:52.530> come<00:01:52.799> you've<00:01:53.130> got<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
stay behind the M come you've got to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850 
stay behind the M come you've got to
push<00:01:53.790> forward<00:01:54.090> okay<00:01:54.509> we've<00:01:54.930> lost<00:01:55.229> we've<00:01:55.829> lost

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
push forward okay we've lost we've lost

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.709 
push forward okay we've lost we've lost
the<00:01:56.250> advantage<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.180> had<00:01:57.450> in

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the advantage that we had in

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.630 
the advantage that we had in
bottlenecking<00:01:58.380> these<00:01:58.649> guys<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.130> stopping

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
bottlenecking these guys and stopping

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.940 
bottlenecking these guys and stopping
them<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.600> can't<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.170> stay<00:02:01.409> back<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
them so you can't just stay back and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.499 
them so you can't just stay back and
kill<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.939> hope<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.299> you're<00:02:03.420> going

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
kill you know and hope that you're going

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.120 
kill you know and hope that you're going
to<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.719> killed<00:02:03.869> you've<00:02:04.140> got<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.649> kind<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.890> move

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
to get killed you've got to kind of move

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.190 
to get killed you've got to kind of move
forward<00:02:05.670> you've<00:02:05.939> got<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.270> fill<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.750> gap<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
forward you've got to fill that gap you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.960 
forward you've got to fill that gap you
got<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> clear<00:02:07.619> them<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.039> move<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.640> okay

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
got to clear them out and move up okay

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.400 
got to clear them out and move up okay
so<00:02:09.330> that's<00:02:09.539> what<00:02:09.720> we're<00:02:09.840> trying<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.259> now

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
so that's what we're trying to do now

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.990 
so that's what we're trying to do now
and<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.709> important<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.370> keep<00:02:11.400> looking<00:02:11.610> at

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and it's important to keep looking at

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.280 
and it's important to keep looking at
the<00:02:12.090> map<00:02:12.239> keep<00:02:12.540> looking<00:02:12.810> where<00:02:12.959> people<00:02:13.200> are

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the map keep looking where people are

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.890 
the map keep looking where people are
going

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
going

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.119 
going
should<00:02:14.079> be<00:02:14.170> able<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.409> look<00:02:14.560> at<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.739> map<00:02:14.860> so

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
should be able to look at the map so

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.100 
should be able to look at the map so
look<00:02:15.310> right<00:02:15.489> now<00:02:15.610> like<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.909> see<00:02:16.090> everyone<00:02:16.959> is

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
look right now like you see everyone is

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.289 
look right now like you see everyone is
all<00:02:17.319> around<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.920> here<00:02:18.280> now<00:02:18.670> obviously<00:02:18.879> it's

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
all around a here now obviously it's

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.179 
all around a here now obviously it's
important<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.200> we<00:02:20.319> do<00:02:20.500> have<00:02:20.680> people<00:02:20.920> around

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
important that we do have people around

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.130 
important that we do have people around
a<00:02:21.549> because<00:02:21.879> we<00:02:22.000> need<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.239> clear<00:02:22.480> out<00:02:22.689> but<00:02:23.019> at

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
a because we need to clear out but at

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.539 
a because we need to clear out but at
the<00:02:23.230> same<00:02:23.439> time<00:02:23.650> people<00:02:23.980> should<00:02:24.129> be<00:02:24.159> ready<00:02:24.459> to

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
the same time people should be ready to

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.190 
the same time people should be ready to
move<00:02:24.849> forward<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.659> should<00:02:25.840> be<00:02:25.870> ready<00:02:26.110> to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
move forward they should be ready to

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.170 
move forward they should be ready to
kind<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:27.010> know<00:02:27.040> push<00:02:27.370> back<00:02:27.640> up<00:02:27.849> so<00:02:28.030> that

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
kind of you know push back up so that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.149 
kind of you know push back up so that
when<00:02:28.299> we<00:02:28.420> do<00:02:28.629> clear<00:02:28.989> those<00:02:29.140> guys<00:02:29.379> out<00:02:29.620> we<00:02:29.980> can

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
when we do clear those guys out we can

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.800 
when we do clear those guys out we can
put<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.609> pressure<00:02:30.819> back<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.359> we<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.450> stop

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
put the pressure back and we can stop

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.569 
put the pressure back and we can stop
them<00:02:31.959> from<00:02:32.079> pushing<00:02:32.530> back<00:02:32.859> into<00:02:33.280> us<00:02:33.430> okay<00:02:35.579> so

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
them from pushing back into us okay so

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.860 
them from pushing back into us okay so
right<00:02:36.730> now<00:02:36.760> we're<00:02:37.030> still<00:02:37.180> working<00:02:37.359> turning

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
right now we're still working turning

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.270 
right now we're still working turning
this<00:02:37.930> base<00:02:38.200> okay<00:02:38.650> we've<00:02:38.769> got<00:02:38.890> people<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.159> the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
this base okay we've got people on the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.830 
this base okay we've got people on the
left<00:02:39.459> hand<00:02:39.670> side<00:02:39.790> here<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.420> we're<00:02:40.540> trying<00:02:40.750> to
