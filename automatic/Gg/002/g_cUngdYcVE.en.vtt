really awesome set also pretty cheap I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
really awesome set also pretty cheap I
mean<00:01:41.880> two<00:01:42.030> dollars<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.570> pack<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.049> wonder<00:01:43.649> how

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
mean two dollars for a pack I wonder how

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.020 
mean two dollars for a pack I wonder how
many<00:01:43.829> you're<00:01:44.040> getting<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.340> box<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:44.970> if

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
many you're getting in a box you know if

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
many you're getting in a box you know if
they're<00:01:45.180> gonna<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.509> boxes<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> stuff<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
they're gonna have boxes and stuff to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
they're gonna have boxes and stuff to
I'm<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:46.979> guess<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.939> boxes

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
I'm my guess would be that the boxes

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.210 
I'm my guess would be that the boxes
would<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> same<00:01:48.810> price<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.740> probably<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
would be the same price but probably you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.560 
would be the same price but probably you
know<00:01:50.340> double<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.670> packs<00:01:50.939> or<00:01:51.180> something<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
know double the packs or something you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.080 
know double the packs or something you
knows<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.799> yeah<00:01:52.950> though<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.340> looks<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.939> this

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
knows so yeah though it looks like this

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
knows so yeah though it looks like this
set<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.840> amazing<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.920> those<00:01:56.100> are
