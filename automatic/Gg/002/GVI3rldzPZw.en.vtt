00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.130
 Ming University 27 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.780
 700 grams of 7% saline mixed with 2% saline and 9% saline 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.079
 I want to make 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:20.460
 Mix several grams of 2% saline and 9% saline respectively 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 Should i 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.689
 It is a problem 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.919
 It is a problem of saline solution, but it is a problem of saline solution 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.559
 I hope it will be easy to write 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.710
 Let's write an automatic beaker 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 I think it should be easy to add it like this 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.500
 The 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 .2% saline solution- 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 9% saline solution 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.030
 Up to money 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.220
 Change in 7% chocolate 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.530
 It is an honor 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.890
 I wore it a couple of times 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.440
 This is 1700 grams 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 text 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.610
 Lacquered in x bats with eco saline problem 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 I'm seeking for a term of 21 equations, but this time I use x and y 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 I will go to 8 in simultaneous equations 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.700
 What is asked is a 2% saline solution and a 9% saline solution 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.689
 How many grams of each should I mix? 2% 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.050
 Saline X Brand 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.360
 9% saline solution weak brand model 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.180
 Let's add a high handed heart Make a difference xbla 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.560
 Always% saline 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.050
 X brand 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.750
 Do not yegram 9% saline solution 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.880
 Then you can already get basic knowledge here 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.110
 x grams mix the grams 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.600
 One speaks extasy because it will be 700 grams 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.860
 This is one and I feel like 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.810
 next 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.129
 In the problem of saline solution 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.969
 Make a cool equation of the injured plateau being carried well 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.909
 Please give me 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.999
 The amount of included salt was summarized 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.799
 The amount of salt contained in 2% saline ex grams is 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.949
 x grams- 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.809
 2% 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.209
 It means that it is Japanese yen 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.989
 Treasure 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.989
 100% for x grams 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.729
 It's a city 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:40.990
 Two hundredths 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.479
 If this is applied 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.479
 It is included and the amount of food comes out 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.549
 In addition, 9% saline weak gram contained non-food 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:57.069
 This is 100 minutes going to yingda as well 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.519
 And the tasting included in 7% 46th grade 700 grams 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.819
 This is 100 minutes running 700 grams as well 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.819
 You should do so 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.850
 Then 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.109
 With the amount of salt that is very much here 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.439
 What paid the ¥ 400 million cost included here 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.999
 Equal to the amount of salt contained here 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.319
 I read that this means that there is another fund 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.079
 is not it 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.059
 Persons who bear 100-9 for x 20 to 100 * have widespread corruption. 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.169
 700 billion billion-Nara became a manpower 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:41.819
 If you organize 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.410
 Rex to the sound of 100 minutes 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.079
 Scary to compete for pluslu 100 minutes 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.409
 Go 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.500
 I will also try this time 700 * 1 100 minutes 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.529
 And another part 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:02.169
 In the case of x + u made earlier 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.429
 Now we have simultaneous equations 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:11.369
 I will say high, but the lacquerware of this one is Ryohei 200 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.699
 I took 100 minutes to take 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.340
 The United States does not increase 100 times by 100 times 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.709
 Take ecb 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.169
 Then you can make a rush + inflow 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.849
 Japan Radio 900 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.409
 Let's adjust the coefficient of x if the person is good opportunity 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.819
 Polish the busy call battle with nicksplice 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.879
 Point now 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.289
 Disappears 2x to 2ex 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.940
 70% denying 20% ​​to 90% 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.250
 Recall four thousand nine hundred four thousand three thousand five hundred 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.050
 In Nara 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.050
 The second part you can do 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:01.889
 Let's substitute 105 cups of pre-efficacy into this formula 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.150
 I'm calculating welfare medical engineering now 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.479
 I compared 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.129
 200 holdings here are 2% years of acquisition 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:18.439
 9% salt water fluctuation 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.860
 Ku 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.949
 I just came 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.469
 In the problem of saline solution this way over and easily organized 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:28.919
 Please 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.370
 The point is 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.719
 Fukuma is 400 million yen 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.749
 Calculate this 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:37.240
 It is that 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.870
 is this good
