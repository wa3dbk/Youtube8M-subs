00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello that such a moment to say hello I am me 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.750
 crossed and this video I'm recording 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.139
 because a few days ago he recorded a video in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.410
 where he explained a little bit what happens in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.929
 your eye on your body when you decide to leave 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.090
 to eat to lose weight 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.609
 then that video was very fast lasted 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.250
 approximately 2 minutes and the various 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.180
 people told me they wanted more 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.220
 information on that topic they wanted to know 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.590
 exactly what happens in our body 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.210
 when a person stops eating because 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.610
 wants to lose weight then having 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.430
 these comments in mind I decided 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.280
 record this video to explain more to 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.010
 detail and in more depth what happens 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.660
 in your body what happens inside 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.000
 you when you decide to go hungry 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.440
 to lose weight so I invite you before 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.750
 which is for my final sample this video and 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.129
 discover what is happening inside 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.579
 us when we decided not to eat 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.159
 hungry to lose weight a big mistake 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.140
 your body is a perfect machine and is 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.540
 designed to survive in any 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.700
 circumstance of all beings 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.880
 living human beings are those of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.619
 greater ability to adapt this 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.509
 capacity that we possess is possible 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.180
 thanks to our brain and system 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.920
 nervous depending on the environment they change 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.220
 its operation to adapt to 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 circumstances 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.360
 with this idea in mind every time you 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.250
 brain perceives from the outside some 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.230
 change he will take the necessary measures 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.270
 to guarantee its survival 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.850
 the body fat that bothers you so much 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.940
 it's simply energy that your brain 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.760
 use to survive 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.470
 in antiquity if the circumstances 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.050
 outsiders were precarious and there was little 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.300
 food the brain was entering a phase 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.340
 of saving accumulating the largest amount 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.860
 of fat possible for each food that 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.080
 I received 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.720
 let's see now what happens when a 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.680
 overweight person today 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.840
 decide to stop eating to lose weight 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.060
 in the first moment you get up 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.399
 in the morning your body has been more 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.470
 or less 8 hours depending on the time 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.780
 that is born without receiving any food 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.360
 if you make the decision not to eat breakfast and 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.400
 go hungry because you do not have time or 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.090
 for any other reason you are taking 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.370
 to the limit your body 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.950
 your brain needs glucose which is 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.260
 energy to work properly and 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.379
 will make your only mission is to get 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.180
 food in this case its main 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.420
 objective is to find a means by which 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.900
 get quick energy to function 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.510
 normally 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.400
 the problem is that the means of obtaining 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.140
 that quick energy that needs its 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.739
 brain is eating food with a 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.299
 high sugar or starch content is 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.760
 for this reason they will cause you 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.410
 foods with high sugar levels and 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.840
 unhealthy 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.650
 and all these foods are the most 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.880
 harmful to your body for example 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:11.010
 sweet flours pasta fat etcetera 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.900
 let's imagine that mid- morning you're 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.020
 bad-tempered and stressed and looking 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.110
 desperately eat something this bad 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.930
 humor and stress is a sign that your 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.100
 brain is desperate because it needs 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.470
 fuel energy of course fair 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.040
 at the time you ate something you have already 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.980
 passed more than 14 hours without food if 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.350
 repeat this cycle constantly your 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.380
 brain is convinced that there is a shortage 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.380
 of food and go into a saving mode 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.200
 after having eaten food with a 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.860
 high sugar content you experience 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.830
 an instant satisfaction you feel 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.670
 well your brain at the moment is 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.310
 happy 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.370
 you and your brain are happy for the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.590
 moment however within you is 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.660
 happening things not very good 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.959
 The first thing is that your body entered 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.599
 a way of saving and your metabolism is 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.600
 slow down to save as much 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.079
 possible energy and the second at most 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.150
 dangerous let's see why 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.820
 when a large body enters your body 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.750
 amount of sugar or starch 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.930
 the glucose in your blood rises like a 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.930
 rocket 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.740
 this excess of glucose in the blood makes 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.289
 that your body secretes large amounts 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.960
 of insulin to decrease the excess of 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.120
 glucose but the liver which is the 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.850
 responsible for leveling the levels of 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.060
 glucose of your blood can not contact 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:53.040
 and the excess glucose is stored in 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.680
 your legs and belly like fat 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.920
 and this is not all since your body is 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.500
 in a saving phase and when you come back to 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.860
 eat he will give the order to store the 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.500
 as much fat as possible 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.229
 you realize everything that happens in your 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.390
 organism if you decide to go hungry for 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.090
 lose weight 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.860
 everything that I just described 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:22.070
 previously it becomes a circle 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.340
 vicious and every time he goes up and goes up in weight 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.230
 the solution to this simple problem 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.390
 you have to eat more often 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.610
 Normally, every meal is recommended 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.460
 every four hours in the same way is 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.260
 important that you eat less quantity and 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.250
 that the food you eat is 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:42.230
 healthy and if they can be 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.820
