other taper on a personal level I do
recommend<00:02:01.740> using<00:02:02.010> teflon<00:02:02.700> tape<00:02:02.730> indices<00:02:03.630> in

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
recommend using teflon tape indices in

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.940 
recommend using teflon tape indices in
regular

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.290 

plumbers<00:02:07.670> teflon<00:02:08.179> tape<00:02:08.209> because

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.600 

I'll<00:02:11.360> recommend<00:02:11.720> using<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.290> because<00:02:12.890> cutting

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
I'll recommend using it because cutting

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.280 
I'll recommend using it because cutting
it<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> pain<00:02:14.510> and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
it is a pain and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.809 
it is a pain and
if<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.439> pull<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:16.950> two<00:02:17.129> months<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
if you pull the two months the

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.580 
if you pull the two months the
thicknesses<00:02:18.420> will<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.349> different<00:02:21.590> double

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
thicknesses will be different double

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:34.780 
thicknesses will be different double
check<00:02:22.799> these

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.270 

they're<00:02:35.420> very<00:02:35.930> roughly<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.500> same

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.160 

guess<00:02:40.819> we're<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.150> have<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.510> give<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.110> a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
guess we're going to have to give it a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.120 
guess we're going to have to give it a
try<00:02:42.440> here<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.980> leave

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
try here just leave

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:53.800 
try here just leave
I'm<00:02:44.520> just<00:02:44.670> using<00:02:44.940> regular<00:02:45.560> KY<00:02:46.560> jelly

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.020 

the<00:02:54.290> only<00:02:54.500> one<00:02:54.620> they<00:02:54.739> had<00:02:54.890> left<00:02:55.130> us<00:02:55.670> this

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
the only one they had left us this

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:05.110 
the only one they had left us this

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.300 

again<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.260> time<00:03:06.530> I'm<00:03:06.709> probably<00:03:07.010> going<00:03:07.220> to

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
again this time I'm probably going to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.280 
again this time I'm probably going to
keep<00:03:07.489> going<00:03:07.700> since<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.180> already<00:03:08.420> have<00:03:08.780> one<00:03:09.080> ear

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.680 

I<00:03:21.610> cannot<00:03:22.120> recommend

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.580
