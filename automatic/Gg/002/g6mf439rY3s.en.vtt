00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.270 
and smaller the full well capacity
decreases<00:01:32.420> with<00:01:33.050> it<00:01:33.230> so<00:01:33.530> if<00:01:33.650> we<00:01:33.830> are<00:01:33.920> talking

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280

1.5<00:07:52.100> micron<00:07:52.900> pixel<00:07:53.900> so<00:07:54.590> here<00:07:55.190> we<00:07:55.370> have<00:07:55.400> a<00:07:55.910> pixel
