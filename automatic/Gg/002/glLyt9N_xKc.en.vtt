00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
an informative video just a quick

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.990 
an informative video just a quick
unboxing<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:22.160> get<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.940> box<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:25.250> was<00:03:25.400> well

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
unboxing I get the box it was well

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.460 
unboxing I get the box it was well
packaged<00:03:26.390> even<00:03:26.630> that<00:03:26.720> was<00:03:26.810> already<00:03:26.959> open<00:03:27.230> even

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
packaged even that was already open even

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.259 
packaged even that was already open even
though<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:27.799> didn't<00:03:28.130> actually<00:03:28.280> open<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.209> I'm
