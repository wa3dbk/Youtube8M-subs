 camera with a small matrix 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.400
 angle of view of the lens decreases such 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.870
 the way getting turns into

 mid-level portraits beautiful boke 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.760
 because of the simplicity and optical layout and 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.060
 shallow depth of field fifty dollars 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.130
 have a very beautiful beauty 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.290

 experimenting yourself and trying
