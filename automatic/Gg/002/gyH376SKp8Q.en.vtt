00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello everyone it's pavel again today 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.000
 I will show one very, very interesting trick 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.580
 by which you can also win 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 money from a friend and so get down and what 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.480
 make this trick a stronger trick there by 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.150
 fight off coin box 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 lighter and two matches start take one 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.590
 match and insert in advance done in 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.590
 hole box 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 put a coin like this 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.689
 and put the second match like this 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.660
 and ask a friend to pull out a coin 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.210
 so in matches did not fall make 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.769
 and we â€™ll show them that 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.519
 do you need to take a lighter and just 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.519
 set fire to these matches 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 wait until no more burn out 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.860
 blow out they burn the heads of matches 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.340
 stick together 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.340
 she will hold on to this he is already blowing out 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.110
 so we can safely get our 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.110
 coin construction matches also stands 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.969
 even if you tilt 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.230
 the same can be done with the bill I 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.230
 right now do about accelerated shooting 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:02:00.810
 Now we ignite forward 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.810
 to her burn out 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.770
 Again, I say you can wait until the end 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.770
 so you have our banknote studying 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.270
 also still allow too 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.810
 when they 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.020
 the row of the match itself rises than show 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.020
 this 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.260
 here she was burning 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.460
 Kan burns down the lower part of the pro itself 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.180
 rises you can wait it burned 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.740
 without fear, therefore, for our bill of all 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.720
