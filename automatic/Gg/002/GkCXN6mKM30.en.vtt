take some fluid out when you collapse
the<00:06:24.080> pistons<00:06:24.500> or<00:06:25.460> you<00:06:25.580> can<00:06:26.050> open<00:06:27.050> up<00:06:27.140> the

you're collapsing it make sure fluids
flowing<00:06:36.770> out<00:06:37.040> and<00:06:37.280> then<00:06:37.460> tighten<00:06:37.820> that<00:06:38.000> so<00:06:38.330> you

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
flowing out and then tighten that so you

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.070 
flowing out and then tighten that so you

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
always believe the brakes at the end to

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.460 
always believe the brakes at the end to
have<00:06:44.270> someone<00:06:44.660> pump<00:06:44.870> the<00:06:44.990> brakes

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
have someone pump the brakes

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
and then when they're holding the brake

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.920 
and then when they're holding the brake
pedal<00:06:50.699> down<00:06:50.819> open<00:06:51.210> that<00:06:51.330> up<00:06:51.449> a<00:06:51.509> little<00:06:51.659> bit<00:06:51.809> let

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
some fluid come out close it back up and

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.279 
some fluid come out close it back up and
you<00:06:55.860> probably<00:06:56.099> good<00:06:56.400> to<00:06:56.430> go

hundred foot-pounds I think it was
specifically<00:07:20.630> 98<00:07:21.200> but<00:07:21.590> hunter<00:07:22.250> is<00:07:22.310> pretty

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
specifically 98 but hunter is pretty

specifically 98 but hunter is pretty
close<00:07:22.760> so<00:07:24.940> here's<00:07:25.940> the<00:07:26.060> master<00:07:26.390> cylinder<00:07:26.600> it's

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 
close so here's the master cylinder it's

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.690 
close so here's the master cylinder it's
got<00:07:27.170> a<00:07:27.200> minimum<00:07:27.620> and<00:07:27.770> a<00:07:27.830> maximum<00:07:27.860> just<00:07:28.520> make

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
got a minimum and a maximum just make

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.990 
got a minimum and a maximum just make
sure<00:07:28.910> it's<00:07:29.090> above<00:07:29.900> the<00:07:30.110> minimum<00:07:30.500> and<00:07:31.000> below

sure it's above the minimum and below
the<00:07:32.180> maximum<00:07:32.300> but<00:07:32.870> I<00:07:32.900> just<00:07:33.110> try<00:07:33.230> and<00:07:33.290> fill<00:07:33.500> it

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
the maximum but I just try and fill it

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.220 
the maximum but I just try and fill it
up<00:07:33.680> though<00:07:34.810> this<00:07:35.810> is<00:07:36.020> over<00:07:36.320> fault<00:07:36.590> right<00:07:37.280> now

up though this is over fault right now

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.740 
up though this is over fault right now
it<00:07:39.230> takes<00:07:39.260> them<00:07:39.620> out
