getting Nicks and scratches on it and
that<00:00:58.050> definitely<00:00:58.829> helps<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.910> bottle

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
that definitely helps to have a bottle
come<00:01:00.600> from<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.140> course<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:02.039> like

another<00:01:08.340> big<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.180> love<00:01:09.510> bottle

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
another big thing that I love bottle

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
another big thing that I love bottle
covers<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.680> more<00:01:11.520> than<00:01:11.760> not<00:01:12.000> they're

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
covers for is more than not they're

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
covers for is more than not they're
going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.540> grip<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.530> base<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.040> them

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
going to have grip on the base of them

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.100 
going to have grip on the base of them
so<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:14.700> you've<00:01:14.820> got<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.030> tank<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.659> against

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
so when you've got that tank up against

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
so when you've got that tank up against
your<00:01:16.229> shoulder<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> stick<00:01:17.460> on

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
your shoulder it's going to stick on

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890 
your shoulder it's going to stick on
there<00:01:17.759> much<00:01:17.909> better<00:01:18.060> keep<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.479> from<00:01:18.630> sliding

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
there much better keep it from sliding

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.740 
there much better keep it from sliding
around<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.650> protection<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.640> grip<00:01:21.119> both<00:01:21.509> going

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
around so protection and grip both going

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
around so protection and grip both going
to<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.930> huge<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.159> bottle<00:01:23.460> covers

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to be huge for the for the bottle covers

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
to be huge for the for the bottle covers
and<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.479> thing<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.720> really<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.170> about<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and one thing I really like about on the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
and one thing I really like about on the
exalted<00:01:26.520> clips<00:01:27.000> ones<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.140> entire

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
exalted clips ones is that the entire

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.429 
exalted clips ones is that the entire
system<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.640> rubber<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.540> first<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.020> guy<00:01:31.259> like
