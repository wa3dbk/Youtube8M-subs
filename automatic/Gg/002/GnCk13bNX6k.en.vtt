00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.850
 off at kemel, it's off to the desert in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.590
 a short half hour can 28 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.009
 players here the race of their lives 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.009
 do 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:30.800
 that certain games are not that good 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:40.579
 then we jump on this camel 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:43.489
 with a little champion I came 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:48.670
 find it ok I get a coin 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.670
 a fata morgana exactly and a packet 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.369
 I think it will do it 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.629
 in kemel from it comes through you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.989
 Bet as much money as possible 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 secure and how that works shows now 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.090
 when it's your turn, you have four 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.250
 various possibilities 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.390
 the first one is to take a dice 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.890
 you now wake up a leaflet and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.590
 blues then the cube pyramid 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.130
 that means a short shake on it 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.509
 withdraw 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 then you just move the camel that 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.369
 color matches the displayed number 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
 So every green 2 falls down the yellow fireplace 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.509
 sit on top of it we just take 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.140
 with important is that the yellow cameras 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.850
 front is even though it sits on top 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.100
 the second possibility is on the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.569
 betting wager that's called too 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.130
 bet which camille is in front if 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.569
 all channels are pulled once 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.310
 For example, I could say that now 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.270
 believe yellow wins have been wrong then 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.369
 I take the appropriate tile 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.899
 left to me if I'm right 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.840
 if i get money for my tip 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.159
 I do not have to lose money 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.869
 the third possibility is on the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.259
 Overall winner the loser 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.060
 become 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.709
 every player has these five 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.719
 value cards in the colors of the camels 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.219
 So, if that's what I think , that's it 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.039
 entire game wins then I put 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.000
 this card and say it is yellow 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.439
 the whole camel 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.149
 but I could say that as well 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.480
 Orange does not follow suit this time 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.280
 Orange makes it camille, so do you 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.720
 continue until a camel the entire round 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.910
 has made it and the finish line again 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.100
 crosses then there are points for that 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.930
 german and all camel and then 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.550
 money is counted the most money has 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.650
 winning 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.170
 Camel is off the camel game around 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.880
 Cube awaken and desert ships funny 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.170
 playing material short playing time high 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.900
 Player numbers make it the perfect 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.710
 party and family games so camel off 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.710
 and start playing directly
