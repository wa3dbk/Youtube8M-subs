there<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> are<00:01:25.740> now<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.729> create<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.119> route

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
there we are now we can create a route

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.899 
there we are now we can create a route
from<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> route<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.310> these<00:01:29.579> are<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:29.790> your

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.709 
it's got the speed the times we can all
change<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:20.459> we<00:02:21.459> highlight<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.030> again<00:02:22.150> and

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.719 
change that we highlight it again and

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.849 
change that we highlight it again and
activate<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.659> there's<00:02:25.659> our<00:02:25.780> rolling<00:02:26.439> road<00:02:26.650> on

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
activate and there's our rolling road on

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.160 
activate and there's our rolling road on
the<00:02:26.950> right<00:02:27.069> hand<00:02:27.340> side<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> screen<00:02:28.170> so

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
the right hand side of the screen so

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.800 
the right hand side of the screen so
that's<00:02:29.319> how<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.620> do<00:02:29.859> a<00:02:29.889> route<00:02:30.189> to<00:02:30.629> delete<00:02:31.629> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that's how you do a route to delete the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.259 
that's how you do a route to delete the
route<00:02:32.280> highlight<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.459> route<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.590> delete<00:02:36.269> now

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
route highlight the route and delete now

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.479 
route highlight the route and delete now
the<00:02:37.329> routes<00:02:37.629> gone<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.650> route<00:02:38.859> goes<00:02:39.159> on<00:02:39.340> all

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
the routes gone that route goes on all

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.759 
the routes gone that route goes on all
the<00:02:39.669> charts<00:02:40.260> get<00:02:41.260> rid<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.439> the<00:02:41.530> dashboard

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
the charts get rid of the dashboard

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.459 
the charts get rid of the dashboard
there's<00:02:42.639> a<00:02:42.700> dashboard<00:02:42.939> icon<00:02:43.359> there's<00:02:44.349> all

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.469 
there's a dashboard icon there's all

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.920 
there's a dashboard icon there's all

is the settings try not to mess that one
up<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.200> rest<00:02:50.439> you'll<00:02:50.680> find<00:02:50.980> on<00:02:51.189> printer<00:02:51.909> so

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
up the rest you'll find on printer so

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:53.849 
up the rest you'll find on printer so
we're<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.169> a<00:02:53.199> look<00:02:53.409> at<00:02:53.500> somewhere

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
we're going to have a look at somewhere

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.520 
we're going to have a look at somewhere
else<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.189> the<00:02:54.219> world<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:55.389> right-hand<00:02:55.989> char<00:02:56.319> is

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
else in the world the right-hand char is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.250 
else in the world the right-hand char is
a<00:02:56.590> base<00:02:56.949> chart<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.699> world<00:02:57.909> there<00:02:58.870> we<00:02:59.049> go

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
a base chart of the world there we go

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.759 
a base chart of the world there we go
the<00:03:00.159> reason<00:03:00.609> this<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.790> one<00:03:01.180> big<00:03:01.689> chart<00:03:02.169> so<00:03:02.739> we

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
the reason this is one big chart so we

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.509 
the reason this is one big chart so we
can<00:03:03.159> spin<00:03:03.669> the<00:03:04.180> software<00:03:04.689> on<00:03:04.870> zooming<00:03:05.260> out<00:03:05.519> all

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
can spin the software on zooming out all

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.970 
can spin the software on zooming out all
around<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.180> world<00:03:07.419> and<00:03:07.840> then<00:03:08.469> zoom<00:03:08.709> back<00:03:08.739> in

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
around the world and then zoom back in

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.309 
around the world and then zoom back in
where<00:03:09.459> we're<00:03:09.609> interested<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.329> if<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.629> see<00:03:10.870> so

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
where we're interested in if you see so

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.439 
where we're interested in if you see so
we<00:03:11.439> get<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:11.859> scale<00:03:12.310> now<00:03:13.180> we<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.689> drag<00:03:14.139> our

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:15.449 
we get it to a scale now we can drag our

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.749 
we get it to a scale now we can drag our
total<00:03:16.449> screen<00:03:16.780> with<00:03:17.709> just<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:18.040> left-click<00:03:18.549> and

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:18.759 
total screen with just a left-click and

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.809 
total screen with just a left-click and
have<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.329> look<00:03:19.659> at<00:03:20.229> some<00:03:20.560> island<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.609> the<00:03:21.729> Indian

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
have a look at some island in the Indian

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.729 
have a look at some island in the Indian
Ocean<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.590> we<00:03:23.769> lift<00:03:24.280> click<00:03:24.849> it<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:26.049> centers<00:03:26.620> on

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
Ocean so we lift click it it centers on

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.390 
Ocean so we lift click it it centers on
the<00:03:26.769> screen<00:03:27.159> and<00:03:27.970> we<00:03:28.180> zoom<00:03:28.419> in<00:03:29.009> now<00:03:30.009> we<00:03:30.069> want<00:03:30.310> to

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
the screen and we zoom in now we want to

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.679 
the screen and we zoom in now we want to
come<00:03:30.579> off<00:03:30.729> the<00:03:30.970> world<00:03:31.209> charts<00:03:31.780> these<00:03:32.439> are<00:03:32.769> now

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
come off the world charts these are now

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.149 
come off the world charts these are now
that's<00:03:34.689> the<00:03:34.870> base<00:03:35.049> well<00:03:35.379> chart<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.859> we're<00:03:36.040> on

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
that's the base well chart that we're on

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.159 
that's the base well chart that we're on
we're<00:03:36.430> going<00:03:36.729> to<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.180> individual<00:03:37.930> world

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
we're going to the individual world

we're going to the individual world
charts<00:03:38.680> there<00:03:39.189> we<00:03:39.340> go<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.989> islands
