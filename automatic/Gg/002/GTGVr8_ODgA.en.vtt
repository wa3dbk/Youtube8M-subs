the<00:01:19.210> word<00:01:19.420> would<00:01:19.810> go<00:01:19.960> beyond<00:01:20.290> culture

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
the word would go beyond culture

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.140 
the word would go beyond culture
ethnicity<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:23.020> just<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.549> know<00:01:24.700> music<00:01:25.000> just

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.170 

still<00:01:34.040> without<00:01:34.190> planning<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.880> become<00:01:35.000> a

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
classical musician and and at that point

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.310 
classical musician and and at that point
obviously<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:46.940> got<00:01:47.210> into<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:48.140> so-called

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
obviously I got into the so-called

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.440 
obviously I got into the so-called
classical<00:01:48.770> repertoire<00:01:49.550> I<00:01:49.910> mean<00:01:50.150> but<00:01:50.330> if<00:01:50.420> you

want to be accurate classical music is

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.330 
want to be accurate classical music is
really<00:01:52.759> between<00:01:53.320> no<00:01:54.320> hiding<00:01:54.740> mode<00:01:54.920> certain<00:01:55.250> in

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
really between no hiding mode certain in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.469 
really between no hiding mode certain in
the<00:01:55.400> young<00:01:55.550> Beethoven<00:01:56.090> nothing<00:01:56.360> before

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
very logical path for me to take because

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.100 
very logical path for me to take because
