have<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.680> battle<00:00:38.430> her<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.090> when<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> have

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
have to battle her so much when I have

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.979 
have to battle her so much when I have
to<00:00:39.899> brush<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> mornings<00:00:41.989> because

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
to brush it out in the mornings because

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.020 
to brush it out in the mornings because
it<00:00:43.260> gets<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.530> tangled<00:00:43.890> back<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.789> she

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it gets really tangled back here and she

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.760 
it gets really tangled back here and she
is<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> fan<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.690> sitting<00:00:46.170> still<00:00:46.559> long

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
is not a fan of sitting still long

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.049 
is not a fan of sitting still long
enough<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.190> me<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> brush<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> tangles<00:00:47.730> out

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
enough for me to brush the tangles out

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.779 
enough for me to brush the tangles out
so<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.890> figured<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.100> okay<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.579> went<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so I figured it was okay if we went a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.810 
so I figured it was okay if we went a
little<00:00:50.910> shorter<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> hair<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:53.100> grows<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
little shorter on the hair it grows you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.010 
little shorter on the hair it grows you
know<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.590> she's<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.829> too<00:00:55.980> happy<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.640> she

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
know and she's not too happy with it she

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.299
