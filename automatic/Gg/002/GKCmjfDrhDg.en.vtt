lot<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.500> mascara<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> root<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.360> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
lot of mascara just in the root so it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.330

try with a curling iron
Carolyn<00:02:06.229> ioan<00:02:06.409> I'm<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:07.040> using<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.430> basic<00:02:07.670> iron

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
Carolyn ioan I'm just using a basic iron

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.870 
Carolyn ioan I'm just using a basic iron
just<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.750> put<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> bend<00:02:09.740> in<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.950> end<00:02:10.190> whenever<00:02:10.789> I

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
just to put a bend in the end whenever I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.030 
just to put a bend in the end whenever I
do<00:02:11.000> an<00:02:11.209> updo<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.630> like<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> curl<00:02:12.350> on<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.560> ends

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
do an updo I like a curl on the ends

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.400 
do an updo I like a curl on the ends
because<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.370> helps<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.180> pieces<00:02:14.750> lock<00:02:14.989> in<00:02:15.230> on

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
because it helps be pieces lock in on

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.470 
because it helps be pieces lock in on
themselves<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.700> if<00:02:17.000> you're<00:02:17.120> going<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.300> put

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
themselves so if you're going to put

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.820 
themselves so if you're going to put
your<00:02:17.600> hair<00:02:17.780> up<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:18.140> good<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.470> go<00:02:18.590> through

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
your hair up it's good to go through
