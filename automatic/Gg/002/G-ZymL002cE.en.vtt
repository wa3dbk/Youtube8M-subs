have<00:03:16.860> no<00:03:17.070> trouble<00:03:17.130> spotting<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:18.800> all<00:03:19.800> right

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
have no trouble spotting that all right

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.480 
have no trouble spotting that all right
after<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.850> going<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.540> be<00:03:22.100> once<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.250> pass

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
after that is going to be once you pass

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.410 
after that is going to be once you pass
here<00:03:24.000> all<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.870> stuff<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.830> pass<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.670> medical

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
here all that stuff you pass a medical

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.120 
here all that stuff you pass a medical
thing<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.660> med<00:03:30.660> vendor<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.230> there's<00:03:31.890> one

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
thing like a med vendor and there's one

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.740 
thing like a med vendor and there's one
over<00:03:32.280> here<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.270> reason<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:33.570> already

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
over here and the reason it's already

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.150 
over here and the reason it's already
open<00:03:33.990> because<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.320> when<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.620> initially<00:03:34.830> made

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
open because I when I initially made

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.040 
open because I when I initially made
this<00:03:35.310> clip<00:03:35.610> video<00:03:36.060> screwed<00:03:36.540> up<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.720> little<00:03:36.900> bit

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
this clip video screwed up a little bit

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.680 
this clip video screwed up a little bit
I<00:03:37.580> didn't<00:03:38.580> bother<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.940> showing<00:03:39.210> you<00:03:39.300> on<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.450> map

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
I didn't bother you showing you on a map

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.230 
I didn't bother you showing you on a map
because<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.860> medical<00:03:41.460> station<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.060> there

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
because the medical station is on there

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.520 
because the medical station is on there
and<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:42.390> already<00:03:42.480> shows<00:03:42.750> up<00:03:42.900> on<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.080> map<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.440> it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
and I already shows up on the map so it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.350 
and I already shows up on the map so it
should<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.800> really<00:03:44.010> easy<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.400> find<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:45.120> one's

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
should be really easy to find this one's

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.790 
should be really easy to find this one's
kind<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.660> tricky<00:03:45.720> when<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.200> go<00:03:46.320> through<00:03:46.560> here

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
kind of tricky when you go through here

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.380 
kind of tricky when you go through here
you'll<00:03:47.130> see<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.580> have<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.760> go<00:03:47.850> under<00:03:48.090> kind<00:03:48.300> of

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
you'll see you have to go under kind of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.060 
you'll see you have to go under kind of
a<00:03:48.480> bridge<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.960> there's<00:03:49.440> guys<00:03:49.560> up<00:03:49.770> here<00:03:49.800> so

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
a bridge and there's guys up here so

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.890 
a bridge and there's guys up here so

they'll be shooting you and you can't
get<00:03:51.990> up<00:03:52.050> there<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.380> way<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:52.740> if<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:52.860> jump

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
get up there that way but if you jump

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.000 
get up there that way but if you jump
down<00:03:53.490> there<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.270> a<00:03:54.300> box<00:03:54.990> right<00:03:55.260> here<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.650> this

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
down there is a box right here and this

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.070 
down there is a box right here and this
one<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.580> didn't<00:03:57.300> find<00:03:57.480> in<00:03:57.690> my<00:03:57.810> first

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
one I didn't find in my first

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.570 
one I didn't find in my first
playthrough<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.950> could<00:03:59.160> be<00:03:59.280> kind<00:03:59.520> of

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
playthrough so it could be kind of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.580 
playthrough so it could be kind of
tricky<00:03:59.850> but<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.690> should<00:04:00.840> be<00:04:00.930> no<00:04:01.080> problem<00:04:01.500> now

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
tricky but it should be no problem now
