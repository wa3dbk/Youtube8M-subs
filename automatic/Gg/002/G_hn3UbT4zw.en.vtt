arabesque<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.410> also<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
arabesque but we also have to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430 
arabesque but we also have to
counterbalance<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:33.030> by<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> way<00:00:33.960> perspire

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.370 
counterbalance that by the way perspire
might<00:00:34.680> recover<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:36.050> with<00:00:37.050> the

might recover from that with the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.500 
might recover from that with the

arabesques that Dimity is demonstrating
what<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.200> seeing<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> fine<00:00:40.950> level<00:00:41.190> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
what you're seeing is a fine level of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.220 
what you're seeing is a fine level of
precision<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.450> order<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.870> precision

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
precision and in order to have precision

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.200 
precision and in order to have precision
you<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.010> optimal<00:00:44.489> control<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.059> your

ankle and your foot Dimity has this

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.500 
ankle and your foot Dimity has this
beautiful<00:00:48.510> very<00:00:48.719> expressive<00:00:49.320> foot<00:00:50.510> while

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
beautiful very expressive foot while

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.840 
beautiful very expressive foot while
she's<00:00:51.719> had<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.199> history<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.800> uncle<00:00:53.190> Spain<00:00:53.460> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
she's had a history of uncle Spain so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
she's had a history of uncle Spain so
there's<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> lot<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> mobility<00:00:54.960> there<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.379> so

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
there's a lot of mobility there and so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
there's a lot of mobility there and so
she<00:00:55.949> has<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> learn<00:00:56.610> where<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> center<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> her

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
she has to learn where the center of her

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.849 
she has to learn where the center of her

eventually<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> come<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.370> have

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
eventually we have to come down we have

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.090 
eventually we have to come down we have
to<00:01:17.670> move<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> next<00:01:18.360> step<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> game

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
to move on to the next step the game

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.780 
to move on to the next step the game
just<00:01:20.910> pick<00:01:21.120> it<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.500> allows<00:01:22.500> them<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.490> fun

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
just pick it up allows them to have fun

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.790 
just pick it up allows them to have fun
with<00:01:24.120> this<00:01:24.300> and<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.050> explore<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.620> in<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
with this and to explore it in a

with this and to explore it in a
different<00:01:25.980> way<00:01:31.730> in<00:01:32.730> dance<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.330> lot<00:01:33.510> of<00:01:33.570> injuries

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
different way in dance a lot of injuries

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.150 
different way in dance a lot of injuries
come<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> lower<00:01:34.530> leg<00:01:34.770> region

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
come in the lower leg region

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.550 
come in the lower leg region
predominantly<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.290> number<00:01:37.530> of

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
predominantly because of the number of

steps that dancers do to get injuries
you<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.910> be<00:01:42.000> strong<00:01:42.300> so<00:01:42.690> we<00:01:42.840> do

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you have to be strong so we do

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.290 
you have to be strong so we do
concentrate<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:44.010> strengthening<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.700> targeted
