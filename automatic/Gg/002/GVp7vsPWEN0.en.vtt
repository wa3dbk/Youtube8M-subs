00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.960 
curling wand but this one-inch curling
iron<00:02:36.450> will<00:02:36.840> work<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:37.920> as<00:02:38.129> well<00:02:38.160> may<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:38.940> to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
iron will work just as well may like to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.000 
iron will work just as well may like to
kind<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> smooth<00:02:39.810> out<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.650> roots<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.980> little

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
kind of smooth out the roots a little

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.280 
kind of smooth out the roots a little
bit<00:02:41.340> I'll<00:02:41.610> smooth<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.120> out<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> top<00:02:42.959> and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
bit I'll smooth it out on the top and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.040 
bit I'll smooth it out on the top and
underneath

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
underneath

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.050 
underneath
and<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.460> of<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.610> ways<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:46.970> I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
and so this is one of the ways that I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.120 
and so this is one of the ways that I
like<00:02:47.210> to<00:02:47.360> do<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.740> starting<00:02:48.740> with<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:48.890> small

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
like to do it starting with a small

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.160 
like to do it starting with a small
section<00:02:49.370> I'll<00:02:50.060> twist<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> little<00:02:50.690> bit<00:02:50.960> at

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
section I'll twist it a little bit at

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.400 
section I'll twist it a little bit at
the<00:02:51.230> root<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.950> open<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.700> curling<00:02:53.030> iron<00:02:53.210> and<00:02:53.570> did

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
the root I open the curling iron and did

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.470 
the root I open the curling iron and did
I<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:54.710> wrap<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.070> around<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.790> barrel<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.270> just

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
I just wrap it around the barrel I just

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.300 
I just wrap it around the barrel I just
keep<00:02:56.660> twisting<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.470> wrapping<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.100> around

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
keep twisting it and wrapping it around

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:08.860 
keep twisting it and wrapping it around
the<00:02:58.850> barrel<00:02:59.150> all<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.480> way<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.900> end<00:03:00.080> then<00:03:07.870> I

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the barrel all the way to the end then I

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.980 
the barrel all the way to the end then I
unravel<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.620> from<00:03:09.920> around<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.610> barrel<00:03:11.060> hit<00:03:11.870> it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
unravel it from around the barrel hit it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.270 
unravel it from around the barrel hit it
with<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:12.140> little<00:03:12.170> bit<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.470> hairspray<00:03:12.710> I'm<00:03:13.100> using

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
with a little bit of hairspray I'm using

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.730 
with a little bit of hairspray I'm using
to<00:03:13.490> lauriol<00:03:14.000> it's<00:03:14.600> not<00:03:14.720> it's<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.020> flexible<00:03:15.560> hold

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
to lauriol it's not it's a flexible hold

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.540 
to lauriol it's not it's a flexible hold
hairspray

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.350 

I'm<00:03:20.550> going<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.760> take<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.000> bobby<00:03:21.269> pin<00:03:26.180> that's<00:03:27.180> how

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
I'm going to take a bobby pin that's how

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.330 
I'm going to take a bobby pin that's how
it<00:03:27.510> looks<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.620> here's<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.920> second<00:03:29.310> way

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
it looks and here's the second way

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.370 
it looks and here's the second way
again<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.460> twisted<00:03:32.910> at<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.180> roots<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.810> this

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
again I twisted at the roots and this

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.860 
again I twisted at the roots and this
time<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:34.860> don't<00:03:35.100> open<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:36.180> curling<00:03:36.569> iron<00:03:36.630> I

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
time I don't open the curling iron I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.760 
time I don't open the curling iron I
just<00:03:37.080> wrapped<00:03:37.319> it<00:03:37.530> all<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:38.280> way<00:03:38.370> around

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.690 

just<00:03:41.160> keep<00:03:41.340> twisting<00:03:41.850> as<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.000> go

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
just keep twisting as I go

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.820 
just keep twisting as I go
and<00:03:43.870> twisting<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:44.959> around<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.319> barrel<00:03:45.620> is

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
and twisting it around the barrel is

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.199 
and twisting it around the barrel is
what<00:03:46.160> also<00:03:46.310> helped<00:03:46.670> me<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:46.910> keep<00:03:47.060> this

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
what also helped me to keep this

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.270 
what also helped me to keep this
hairstyle<00:03:47.569> because<00:03:48.110> before<00:03:48.709> when<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.099> would

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
hairstyle because before when I would

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.490 
hairstyle because before when I would
just<00:03:49.430> do<00:03:49.519> like<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.700> flat<00:03:50.030> curl<00:03:50.330> that<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.260> what

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
just do like a flat curl that is what

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.920 
just do like a flat curl that is what
would<00:03:51.650> make<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.890> style<00:03:52.190> fall<00:03:52.670> faster<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.569> this

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
would make the style fall faster so this

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.910 
would make the style fall faster so this
has<00:03:54.080> really<00:03:54.590> helped<00:03:54.950> me<00:03:55.480> now<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.870> my<00:03:56.989> crown<00:03:57.440> I

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
has really helped me now for my crown I

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.220 
has really helped me now for my crown I
will<00:03:58.430> turn<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:58.970> barrel<00:03:59.120> sideways<00:03:59.810> and

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
will turn the barrel sideways and

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.339 
will turn the barrel sideways and
continue<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:00.980> do<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.540> twist<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.810> wrap

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
continue to do the twist and wrap

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.370 
continue to do the twist and wrap
curling<00:04:04.190> method<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:04.730> i<00:04:05.000> leave<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:05.930> clamp

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
curling method and I i leave the clamp

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.059 
curling method and I i leave the clamp
up<00:04:07.060> first<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:09.200> once<00:04:09.380> i<00:04:09.470> finally<00:04:09.709> wrapped

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
up first and then once i finally wrapped

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.410 
up first and then once i finally wrapped
it<00:04:10.220> all<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.400> way<00:04:10.489> around<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.880> barrel<00:04:11.239> I'll

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
it all the way around the barrel I'll

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.589 
it all the way around the barrel I'll
close<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.810> now<00:04:12.769> turn<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:13.730> in<00:04:14.060> words<00:04:14.330> a<00:04:14.480> little

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
close it now turn it in words a little

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.120 
close it now turn it in words a little
bit<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.230> can<00:04:15.260> get<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.470> little<00:04:15.590> bit<00:04:15.739> closer<00:04:15.980> to

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
bit so I can get a little bit closer to

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.490 
bit so I can get a little bit closer to
my<00:04:16.400> room<00:04:16.639> then<00:04:17.000> turn<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.690> barrel<00:04:17.900> upside<00:04:18.829> down

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
my room then turn the barrel upside down

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.860 
my room then turn the barrel upside down
I<00:04:19.620> let<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.190> curl<00:04:20.459> down<00:04:20.640> I<00:04:20.700> don't<00:04:21.329> let<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.600> curl

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
I let the curl down I don't let the curl

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.780 
I let the curl down I don't let the curl
fall<00:04:22.260> also<00:04:22.650> hold<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:22.980> my<00:04:23.100> hand<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.610> see

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
fall also hold in my hand as you see

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.150 
fall also hold in my hand as you see
here<00:04:24.030> how<00:04:24.270> sprayed<00:04:24.720> again<00:04:24.900> instead<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:25.860> paying

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
here how sprayed again instead of paying

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
