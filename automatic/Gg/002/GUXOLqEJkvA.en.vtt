00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.529
 pork of these pork or pork 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.320
 yes 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.030
 good 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.020
 Y 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.400
 and with friends as they are here you do not see and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.910
 mills and well we are excited to 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.560
 Janka as well basically what 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.240
 we do is that it adds what sanz 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.250
 ayÃ¡n cut what this kitten would be 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.380
 Well, well, we can ride to him 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.480
 if we give right click and bread and good 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.660
 it will automatically start flying and 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.640
 is going to put his music so that 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.040
 symbol with its going to be 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 he's practically going to start singing 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.640
 so to speak 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.240
 either way 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.190
 and well you can fly if it appears 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.260
 then that space is for you to 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.240
 elevate and with low shifts 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.070
 in this way show and good to compose 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.020
 when it advances then leave what is this 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.720
 rainbow type 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.280
 and well now he is very father is for 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.320
 have fun this way is to pass it 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.690
 well a while and well then in general 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.310
 it's pretty funny once yes 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.700
 not for the music could it be another 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.490
 thing 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.560
 and well if you do not listen to it, it's because 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.399
 better eliminate it so it does not come out 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.890
 here in the video but good 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.689
 practically everything that this one does 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.509
 Sendai uncut as you can see next from 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.030
 a rather weird way as it rotates the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.700
 cat just he moves alone here 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.700
 showed right and then it moves a little 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.429
 weird but you can control it well 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.590
 normal way as well as face downs all 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:02:00.130
 let's go and see if he does not have a disk 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.539
 know I do not have anything the cat and good 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.909
 well here is the cat another thing is that 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.909
 if you put paper on it then practice 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.959
 the data is eaten the paper for the cat 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.150
 that as he told you then if we have 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.610
 paper in your hand can follow us as 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.709
 if it were a bone for a wolf of this 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.269
 way wow and good if you put it here in the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.340
 soil practically the cat is going to 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.370
 stay with the cake is going to stay in 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.700
 that place and well let's put another 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.290
 cat let's see this other cat and good 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.180
 to compose then the other cat equal 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.459
 bada and then and stay in the cake 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.430
 automatically from here they do not move and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.629
 good if we take it then practically 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.629
 they will follow us in this way 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.769
 and we're going to leave it here so we 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.879
 continue to capture what these are 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.340
 there is no uncut then practically 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.260
 we need what are four cakes and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.510
 a fish and in this way you create what 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.610
 what is the nahyan cat and good this way 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.319
 will give us what is the spotlight cat and 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.970
 good to create what is a disk of 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.799
 nahyan card music simply 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.440
 we started what are obsidian four 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.640
 and a cake and that was not what this is 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.500
 disk 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.880
 as if we put it because it will emit us 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.880
 what this song of nahyan cat 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.010
 it is not removed 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.540
 copyright and then not basically what 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.850
 does this mode is so that peace is a 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.709

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.920

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.650
 small but it is for you to have fun 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.330

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.650
 Well, you know if you liked it 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.720
 more before the video I leave the 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 installation to be installed on the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.050
 that can climb cat 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.640
 new as well continue with 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.260
 the installation of the aya cut button but 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.510
 before that they should download what 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.520
 are these two files that simulated ader and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.050
 the model is already cut and is in the link of 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.580
 I leave these two files in the 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.230
 description to download it goes 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.520
 and it was when afterwards he must complete 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.860
 downloading these two files 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.260
 we open our minecraft it turns out that 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.150
 now we activate the strong and good this 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.710
 what the strongman does makes our 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.330
 minecraft remove all the mods that are 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.799
 they are installed on it since 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
 we installed some way that is not 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.799
 compatible with the modes we have 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.810
 installed in our minecraft we are 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.910
 will create and to avoid that we activate 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.500
 the suday forum to do an installation 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.600
 clean in this way here only 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.330
 Formosa that have download 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.830
 and I think we are ready our 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.660
 minecraft if we can continue with 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.980
 installation of monay uncut for it 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.900
 we put to the folder of our 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.360
 minecraft if it's not right and well let's 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.400
 start at the beginning we write run from 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.410
 this form we give accept will open us 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.200
 the window to execute who will execute 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.640
 tell us percent app data percent 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.410
 we accept and opened this 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.850
 window here in this window find 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.030
 the folder of our minecraft that 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.680
 it would be this point minecraft we open it 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.310
 we also open the bin folder and then 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.930
 good in the folder too 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.240
 we will find a file called 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.760
 micro point and arc is this we open it with 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.200
 the rare windows cheever minimizes this 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.090
 window and we have that one that comes from 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.620
 April that the micro point and here we 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.420
 we found a folder called me 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.820
 times that is completely capitalized 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.650
 how to put it is this goal and pnv the 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.300
 they select in this way and eliminate it 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.950
 If you do not delete it, the screen will appear 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.050
 black or they will grow the minecraft 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.790
 so, well, try to eliminate 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.080
 this bar folder and we continue with 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.000
 installation in the files that 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.760
