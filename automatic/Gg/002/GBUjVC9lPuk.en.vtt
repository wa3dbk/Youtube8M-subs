he<00:06:29.460> takes<00:06:29.670> a<00:06:29.790> lot<00:06:29.880> of<00:06:29.940> practice<00:06:30.450> you<00:06:30.660> need<00:06:30.930> to

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
an easier way to transform it than mine

which<00:06:46.770> probably<00:06:47.430> you<00:06:47.730> guys<00:06:48.180> probably<00:06:48.450> have
