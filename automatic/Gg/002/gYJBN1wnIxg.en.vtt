00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.539
 save organized salve talking and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.760
 I dialogued with another video and this time 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.399

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.800

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.450
 games with the Portuguese case here 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.680
 videos games with the call did not think 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.239
 in your accounts 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.840
 I'm going to do what I'm doing here. 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.090
 You guys good here in the video and in this 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.390
 video a game that called me a lot 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.140
 attention 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.750
 It's a racing game. 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.199
 The game is a game of the fourth generation of 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 next generation of consoles was in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.610
 development or four years four 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:17.430
 years think how much game should be good that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:22.189
 game promises to bring something 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:30.060
 different for the racing games it goes 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:33.540
 bring all the whole new map 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.549
 york in the united states 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.960
 map of the united states for 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.090
 Bread game running behind and not clues 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.479
 huge fields to occur 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.259
 except that the only bad this game for what 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.720
 I can see that it will only be possible. 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.340
 made in single player yes it will only be able 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.090
 be played in the single player does not have a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.409
 game multiplayer mode so good but that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.869
 will not have a new player 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.420
 but it's going to be good anyway this game 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.649
 he has a very cool dynamic 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.349
 I think it's really cool, he was a comb. 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.470
 cuoq to the six issues of where you go 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.930
 can occur for example that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.070
 can only run on the street he will not have 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.170
 land fields road fields between 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.880
 other things different fields for 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.620
 You can run with the car that I 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.810
 I think it's very cool, it's going to be a game. 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.940
 so I asked what I realized 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.570
 no in this game play background state to 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.730
 you 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.260
 It's going to be a game with the open field that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.890
 game is being developed by the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.730
 ubisoft and is a company that talks a lot 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.700
 has a lot of experience and is trying to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.740
 bring new games to the chosen mode 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:54.030
 for a new way of running games and 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:59.670
 this game will promise the best game of 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:04.230
 race that has already been done is what 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.900
 promising him to remember very well the 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.180
 his graphic is looks even if looking 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.390
 so his graph is really stand out. 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.110

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:26.550
 ps4 and this is a game that will be worth a lot
