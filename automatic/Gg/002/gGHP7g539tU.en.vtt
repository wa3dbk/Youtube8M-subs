00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.269
 from my home this segment is presented 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.269
 by berg hansen warnes state 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.080
 hello I'm marlin frank designer and 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.360
 Latin hunting lifestyle expert 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.150
 and today with verizon they get fat celestial 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.279
 let's show you how to create a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.330
 elegant living room concept 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.790
 open 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.529
 Open concept design or plant 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.140
 open has been a trend in the 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.120
 last 25 years but the lack of 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.580
 privacy is not adapted to the style of 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.340
 everyone's life has to make sure 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.379
 that this will work with your family and 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.739
 make sure to study the plans of the 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.900
 home before collapsing walls achieve 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.300
 a homogeneous aspect when everything is 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.610
 put in one place can be 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.500
 complicated always take into account the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.330
 furniture size your family in 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.160
 growth and how long do you think that 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.750
 are going to happen between taking in that 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.600
 space 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.640
 now I make a list of the spaces 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.740
 smaller functional ones that 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.900
 they need inside the biggest room and 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.150
 Assign an estimated dimension for each 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.340
 area once you have determined the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.740
 appropriate size for each space is 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.240
 You can plan the design when 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.130
 place the furniture think about the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.650
 orientation of the relationship pieces 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.869
 with the others and the separation between 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.120
 these to strengthen the hospitalization 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.280
 social from one area to the other 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.050
 in this space as you can see the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.240
 elimination of the wall that separated the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.240
 kitchen in the living room brought several 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.790
 benefits now the kitchen has a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.710
 spectacular view of the room and second 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.630
 the lines of vision in the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.280
 opposite direction offering the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.500
 opportunity to communicate with whom 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.560
 is cooking while other stands in 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.540
 the breakfast area 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.490
 your texture color selection does not have 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.560
 to be exactly the same but if you 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.619
 tones of the same room color 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.820
 room the combination of this room 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.520
 to be with the kitchen works 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.850
 perfectly fine by the integration 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.100
 of the blue in the two areas 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.459
 You can also create a combination of 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.289
 kitchen multifunctional room but before 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.420
 your first day of shopping later imagine 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.489
 how will the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.680
 space full of kids running 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.360
 around her husband and you chatting in 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.640
 the kitchen with glasses of the hand the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.890
 granny chopping onions next to 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.900
 sink and friends relaxed in a 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.120
 comfortable sofa through the room 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.100
 you will create a space where three 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.530
 family relationships and good 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.010
