00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.749
 still interesting such a thing I want to tell 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:03.820
 prom 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.620
 android market 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.490
 percent 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.859
 not long ago he 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.449
 began to use 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.439
 android phones 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.079
 but in particular it is one of the first 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.720
 phones which are not very liked 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.490
 score is mediocre 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.689
 liked the operating room 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.099
 system was 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.589
 earlier 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.769
 at her marriage 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.769
 Windows Mobile but after that 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.659
 favor with these two phones 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.029
 but the android version 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.530
 1 5 even by itself will settle 5 do not we need 2 1 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.700
 So I realized that this is the most ideal 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 operating system from not yet for me 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.710
 Yang hour I will show what fraction myself 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.990
 for this we have to connect 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.280
 we will connect to the internet contract 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.050
 I mean home bai aig 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.620
 Rinat that we connect cool 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.140
 for this we have to find 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.720
 setting here you need them 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.850
 tell what 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.620
 ng automatically euro will not connect network 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.170
 must and be turned on manually 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.660
 Here we turn on Wi-Fi 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750
 switching on 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.750
 getting 5 thousand and that's actually 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.310
 my address 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 so my husband joined 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.310
 i will see 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.310
 gets into the market 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.900
 attention was taken by the cast of a city and 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.360
 repeat repeat it itself is not 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.860
 so such a mistake was connected 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 happened 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 turn on 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.470
 connected 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 go out launching the market 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.810
 accordingly and always 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.119
 not without problems so here 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.920
 had several times 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.570
 accounting but on the other hand this liquid 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.520
 phone 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.489
 so in ideal situations, not all 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.599
 it happens well 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.340
 well, so here you are 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.810

 download 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.839
 paid version of the program either 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.059
 free versions of the program at 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.039
 At least yesterday I was sitting and almost all 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.429
 the evening sat uploaded the program us bye 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:27.759
 it is fast and convenient 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.649
 what's the question what 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.179
 here look there is a search 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.239
 you can kill any program yourself 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.079
 for example me 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.469
 jumped up in the morning 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.279
 no problems downloaded everything was restored 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.380
 or applications that already 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.119

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.579
 all health applications are available 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.139
 tools and a whole bunch but 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.220
 for example, we will often use 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.679
 multimedia 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.809
 here's the date you can 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.349
 a ride of rage 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.689
 percent 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.919
 what can be taken of this with interest 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.059
 download as you can see that very 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.049
 bigger the farther the go 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:02.689
 great 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:03.959
 becomes 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.049
 tobacco, that is, there are whole programs 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:06.849
 a bunch 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.779
 Well, for example, let's see how 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.340
 this free programs like 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.509
 m to 1 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.939
 Here we are on May below look at it 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.539
 program comments 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.679
 her versions 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.569
 actually there are various 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.429

 successfully installed we all set 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.849
 I don't know what the program may be 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.849
 easier than such settings 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.439
 launching the menu and another MFP epson programs Diana 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.439
 dung is here she is playing 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.419
 all started the program 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.059
 picture 1 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.920
 so they say 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.830
 program and not so easy I do not know what 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.569
 if there is 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.569
 Look, what a beauty

 whether the menu or something else 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.210
 new 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.210
 eg 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.949
 report tons 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.930
 all the time in different colors draw us 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.930
 need one such trick 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.039
 with me 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.370
 how he draws cool 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.819
 mccain salda 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.729
 simple simple drawing and grandchildren 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.259
 we'll see 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.090
 eg 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.419
 line thickness 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.419
 on the podium 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.559
 and this is all represented 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:05.639
 we will not 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.249
 and hours on separate programs 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.249
 just go out 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.889
 m again run brand now 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.419
 in mind 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.809
 some can 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.939
 also install any other programs 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.639
 as you can see as a big part 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:22.569
 of them 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.349
 is free 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.169
 and programs to carry on the peak just a cloud 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.389
 proper 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.069
 somewhere here were incredible about 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.809
 downloaded 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:35.809
 subject guides smoke-free visas for cake and so 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:36.260
 Further 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.330
 I do not know what could be better than here 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.639
 such a system 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.860
 so programs by program 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.930
 I can say that he is practically all that 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.520
 want that and install 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.789
 let's show the jacket how it works in 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.360
 boarding a dispute about her nbu which is fascinated 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.349
 internet explorer yahoo 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.349
 what is it if there is a pyramid 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.990
 actually here 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.380
 go vote frequently visited sites 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.380
 visiting our favorite site inform.ru 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.809
 so quickly 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:16.009
 beautiful 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.919
 we upload here by the way unlike 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.189
 the built-in browser opera opera is very 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.199
 quickly does everything 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.379
 proper interest to many 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:27.639
 scrolling and as I told you earlier about 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.580
 the processor 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.509
 smart handles absolutely any 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.860
 information 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.090
 increase how to treat drags very 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.189
 quickly 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.259
 well i have an iphone 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.259
 all perfectly 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.210
 well, just great 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.020
 the pictures have not uploaded my husband yet 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.020
 use the page 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.849
 don't even know what to say to you just a class 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:06.279
 other programs 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:08.139
 Yes, and I theoretically can 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.109
 show well I think it will be separate 

00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:12.839
 section 

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:13.609
 by program
