out of it and you know they check it out

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.930 
out of it and you know they check it out
and<00:00:47.120> be<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.960> guess<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.219> letter<00:00:50.610> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and be my guess from what that letter is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
and be my guess from what that letter is
from<00:00:51.239> their<00:00:51.420> reaction<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.440> many<00:00:52.559> other

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
from their reaction and so many other

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
from their reaction and so many other
people's<00:00:53.129> guess<00:00:53.340> which<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.570> little

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
people's guess which is kind of a little

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.470 
people's guess which is kind of a little
bit<00:00:54.809> obvious<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.879> stuff

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
bit obvious is that from all the stuff

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
bit obvious is that from all the stuff
that<00:00:57.510> happened<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.379> buggy<00:00:58.620> surrounding<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that's the only explanation what else

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.350 
that's the only explanation what else
could<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.710> letter<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.250> sets<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.939> guess
