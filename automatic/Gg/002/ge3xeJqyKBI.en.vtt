00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.550
 hello we worked on the salmon fillet at the frozen decorations of 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.549
 at tesla nova in philippe about 800 grams 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.189
 saw a new year's Eve but rather no criticism 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.340
 cream so the idea is to put to marinate how serious the ceni is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.259
 much simpler 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.210
 you will take your entire net 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.140
 defrost you are going to put on coarse salt cover it with coarse salt 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.800
 count about one hour for 800 grams 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 then wanting to stay either we used it as early 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.080
 first trenches and we prepare yes the Germans we can keep it in 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.890
 a grape seed oil a year an oil from the other 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.060
 dotted with several different terms of the year and flat parsley from the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.130
 chives and leave you in a refrigerator only five days without 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.210
 no soucy so we directly sartis salt I live in the trenches 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 finely like a smoked salmon 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 very very thin slices 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.510
 so we're not on a concretely raw salmon lightly cooked by 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 coarse salt 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 we had a nice little time 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.080
 ap 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.060
 that's like these 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.460
 then 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 a little bit of fleur de sel 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.110
 a standing tower the fair 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.030
 some slightly broken pink berries between your fingers like that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 intrepid Lille 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.660
 It's hotter 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.390
 danette 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 according to trevor ncube is also chopped chives 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.329
 to accompany him I will not put the posts and sooner 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.159
 small pools live from italy 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.969
 and there you make a very simple recipe easy to use and still 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:22.989
 lightened 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.580
 on this I wish you a nice appetite
