00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
in our approach and it's always

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.529

ways of looking at things that makes you

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
ways of looking at things that makes you
a<00:00:29.130> better<00:00:29.400> coach<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.449> makes<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> able<00:00:30.869> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
reach out to other people a big piece of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.880 
reach out to other people a big piece of
what<00:00:33.450> we're<00:00:33.600> getting<00:00:33.719> across<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> coaches

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
what we're getting across to the coaches

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.100 
what we're getting across to the coaches
is<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.030> adults<00:00:36.450> they're<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> ones

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
is that as the adults they're the ones

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
is that as the adults they're the ones
we<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> adjust<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> children<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> so

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
we have to adjust to the children and so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
we have to adjust to the children and so
a<00:00:39.780> piece<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.530> talked<00:00:40.739> about<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
a piece of what we talked about in the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.090 
a piece of what we talked about in the
course<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.570> psychological<00:00:43.559> stage<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
course is the psychological stage the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.880 
course is the psychological stage the
social<00:00:44.610> stage<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.719> children<00:00:46.320> grow<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
social stage at which children grow and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.459 
social stage at which children grow and
so<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.820> young<00:00:48.030> ages<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> year<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> years

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
so these very young ages a year to years

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
so these very young ages a year to years
makes<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.860> huge<00:00:50.190> difference<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
makes a huge difference and so that's a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.209 
makes a huge difference and so that's a
big<00:00:51.870> piece<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.559> across<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
big piece of what we get across to the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.220 
big piece of what we get across to the
coaches<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.820> course<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.020> what

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
changes are going to occur and what's

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.389

really fun group we use six is you eight
to<00:01:04.199> ten<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.619> twelve<00:01:04.979> they're<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.400> such<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610

to ten to twelve they're just such a
fun-loving<00:01:06.270> group<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.080> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
energetic and so I think now when you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.370 
energetic and so I think now when you
take<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.570> energy<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.140> channel

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
take all that energy in you can channel

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200 
take all that energy in you can channel
in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.770> direction<00:01:10.950> nothing<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:11.970> this

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
in the right direction nothing like this

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.490 
in the right direction nothing like this
course<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.900> gonna<00:01:13.049> give<00:01:13.260> me<00:01:13.380> the

course is really gonna give me the
information<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.159> need<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> most

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
of a more player centered environment

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.910

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
guided discovery less direct direction

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.940 
guided discovery less direct direction
from<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> coaches<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> players<00:01:28.560> can

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
from the coaches so that the players can

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.890 
from the coaches so that the players can
think<00:01:29.250> more<00:01:29.310> from<00:01:29.640> themselves<00:01:29.850> make<00:01:30.509> more<00:01:30.810> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
think more from themselves make more of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.170 
think more from themselves make more of
their<00:01:31.020> own<00:01:31.140> decisions<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> huge

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
their own decisions that has a huge

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.569 
their own decisions that has a huge
impact<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.869> time<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.979> way<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> kids

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
impact in time and the way that the kids

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
impact in time and the way that the kids
play<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> game<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.840> national<00:01:37.170> youth<00:01:37.290> license

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
play the game the national youth license

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.060 
play the game the national youth license
is<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.549> very<00:01:38.729> important<00:01:39.420> course<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
is I think a very important course and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.380 
is I think a very important course and
we<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.369> give<00:01:41.490> our<00:01:41.610> younger<00:01:41.909> players<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
we have to give our younger players of

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.810 
we have to give our younger players of
base<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.369> we'll<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.579> better

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
base and I think we'll have better

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
base and I think we'll have better
players<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.329> 15<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.780> 16<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> better

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
players at 15 and 16 if we do a better

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
players at 15 and 16 if we do a better
job<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:47.070> they<00:01:47.159> wonder<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.149> research

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
job when they wonder what the research

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
job when they wonder what the research
is<00:01:48.630> showing<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> u12<00:01:49.619> level<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.460> get

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
is showing is that the u12 level you get

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.789 
is showing is that the u12 level you get
more<00:01:50.790> dropouts<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.930> athletics<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.560> soccer

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
more dropouts from athletics and soccer

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.770 
more dropouts from athletics and soccer
in<00:01:52.979> particular<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> think<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
in particular and so I think with this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.359 
in particular and so I think with this
course<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.890> bring<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> kids

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
course if we can you know bring the kids

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
course if we can you know bring the kids
up<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:56.880> training<00:01:57.299> environment<00:01:57.840> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
up in the right training environment and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
up in the right training environment and
as<00:01:58.380> coaches<00:01:58.860> training<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.310> way<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.790> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
as coaches training the way that you

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.880 
as coaches training the way that you
know<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> research<00:02:01.170> has<00:02:01.350> shown<00:02:01.530> us<00:02:01.560> that's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
know the research has shown us that's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
know the research has shown us that's
most<00:02:02.310> positive<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.420> retain<00:02:03.689> some<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
most positive and we can retain some of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.719 
most positive and we can retain some of
those<00:02:04.049> kids<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.369> win-win

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
those kids and it can just be a win-win

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.609 
those kids and it can just be a win-win
for<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:06.329> soccer<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> United<00:02:07.409> States

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
for for soccer and for the United States

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.850 
for for soccer and for the United States
