00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.939 

this<00:00:45.629> lick<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.230> uses<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> couple<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
this lick actually uses a couple of

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.880 
this lick actually uses a couple of
different<00:00:47.250> inversions<00:00:47.519> as<00:00:48.059> well<00:00:48.839> as<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.440> couple

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
different inversions as well as a couple

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
different inversions as well as a couple
of<00:00:50.010> single<00:00:50.489> notes<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.879> once<00:00:51.059> again<00:00:51.180> we're

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
of single notes so once again we're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
of single notes so once again we're
bouncing<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.199> forth<00:00:52.409> between<00:00:52.559> chords

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
bouncing back and forth between chords

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.520

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's gotta really watch your timing on

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.750 
it's gotta really watch your timing on
that<00:02:58.110> make<00:02:58.680> sure<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.890> don't<00:02:58.980> rush<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.460> last

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
that make sure you don't rush that last

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.310 
that make sure you don't rush that last
lick<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.570> tough<00:03:00.810> because<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.140> got<00:03:01.260> to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
get right back up to that chord so you

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.850 
get right back up to that chord so you
really<00:03:03.690> got<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.870> get<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.200> smooth<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.740> get<00:03:04.830> a
