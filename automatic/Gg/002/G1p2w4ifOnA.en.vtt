playstation one this is actually a

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.210 
playstation one this is actually a
really<00:00:06.720> really<00:00:06.870> early<00:00:07.200> playstation<00:00:08.069> game<00:00:08.189> i

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
really really early playstation game i

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.470 
really really early playstation game i
think<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.550> came<00:00:08.670> up<00:00:08.820> within<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.120> first<00:00:09.150> year

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
think it came up within the first year

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.200 
think it came up within the first year
of<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.320> playstation<00:00:10.889> launching<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.370> japan<00:00:11.700> so

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
of the playstation launching in japan so

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.810 
of the playstation launching in japan so
it's<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.570> very<00:00:13.200> simplistic<00:00:14.190> even<00:00:14.730> my

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
it's a very simplistic even my

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.519 
it's a very simplistic even my
playstation<00:00:15.269> standards<00:00:15.839> compared<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.320> how

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
playstation standards compared to how

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.470 
playstation standards compared to how
much<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.070> visuals<00:00:17.820> sort<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.119> picked<00:00:18.270> up<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
much the visuals sort of picked up a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.029 
much the visuals sort of picked up a
pace<00:00:18.660> over<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> course<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> console<00:00:19.949> of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
pace over the course of the console of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.160 
pace over the course of the console of
lifetime<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.180> looking<00:00:21.840> at<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.109> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
lifetime so you can looking at it you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.320 
lifetime so you can looking at it you
can<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.740> doesn't<00:00:23.039> quite<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
can see that it doesn't quite have the I

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.480 
can see that it doesn't quite have the I
guess<00:00:24.660> panache<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.109> sparkle<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.160> some<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
guess panache and sparkle of some of the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.890 
guess panache and sparkle of some of the
later<00:00:26.670> games<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.119> show<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.779> it's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
later games to show up on it but it's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.080 
later games to show up on it but it's
still<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:28.710> time<00:00:28.949> was<00:00:29.130> very<00:00:29.460> good<00:00:29.670> looking<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
still first time was very good looking a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.759 
still first time was very good looking a
lot<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.330> people<00:00:30.539> are<00:00:30.630> kind<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.900> still<00:00:31.500> being

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
lot of people are kind of still being

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.700 
lot of people are kind of still being
moved<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> awed<00:00:32.730> by<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.090> 3d<00:00:33.660> graphics<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
moved and awed by the 3d graphics as a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.709 
moved and awed by the 3d graphics as a
sort<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.010> shifted<00:00:35.309> out<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> sprite<00:00:35.880> era<00:00:36.480> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
sort of shifted out of the sprite era of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.139 
sort of shifted out of the sprite era of
the<00:00:36.750> 16-bit<00:00:37.290> era<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.820> definitely

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the 16-bit era so it was definitely

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.360 
the 16-bit era so it was definitely
turning<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:40.020> heads<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> time<00:00:40.739> because

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
turning some heads at the time because

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.310 
turning some heads at the time because
of<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.300> trying<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> implement<00:00:43.140> some

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
of it actually trying to implement some

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.990 
of it actually trying to implement some
of<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.620> stuff<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.129> even<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
of this stuff and even like the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
of this stuff and even like the
cutscenes<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.539> kassir<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.140> quite<00:00:46.379> nice<00:00:46.620> for

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
cutscenes are kassir like quite nice for

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
cutscenes are kassir like quite nice for
their<00:00:47.010> time<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.210> about<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.600> best

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
their time what I like about it best

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.630 
their time what I like about it best
though<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.890> shoot-'em-up<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
though is that it's a shoot-'em-up that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.180 
though is that it's a shoot-'em-up that
keeps<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.270> changing<00:00:51.539> its<00:00:51.930> perspective<00:00:52.559> it's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
keeps on changing its perspective it's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.010 
keeps on changing its perspective it's
just<00:00:53.309> something<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.699> notice<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> sort<00:00:54.989> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
just something like notice is sort of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
just something like notice is sort of
becoming<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.469> thing<00:00:55.710> back<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> because<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
becoming a thing back and because the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.819 
becoming a thing back and because the
mid-90s<00:00:57.510> he<00:00:57.629> sort<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> saw<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.530> them

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
mid-90s he sort of saw it with them

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
mid-90s he sort of saw it with them
salamander<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.090> had<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> serious

vertical and horizontal and throwing in

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.200 
vertical and horizontal and throwing in
a<00:01:10.860> few<00:01:11.040> other<00:01:11.189> things<00:01:11.280> while<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> was<00:01:11.880> added

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
a few other things while it was added

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.280 
a few other things while it was added
but<00:01:12.630> Phil<00:01:12.840> azama

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

but Phil azama
really<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.580> shifts<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.060> around

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
really really just shifts it around

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.700 
really really just shifts it around
constantly<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> whole

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
constantly you have like the whole

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.740 
constantly you have like the whole
vertical<00:01:17.220> horizontal<00:01:17.400> thing<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
vertical horizontal thing then the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.109 
vertical horizontal thing then the
camera<00:01:19.080> shifts<00:01:19.500> behind<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.189> ship<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.970> your

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
camera shifts behind the ship so your

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.429 
camera shifts behind the ship so your
surya<00:01:21.330> shooting<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.780> front<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> while<00:01:22.350> the

camera falls behind oil-cooled vice

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.050 
camera falls behind oil-cooled vice
versa<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.320> well<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> camera<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.700> front

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.160 
versa as well have the camera in front
of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.180> ship<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.540> app<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.930> rear

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
of the ship in the app like a rear

off Elega quasi ground motor it looks

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550

like<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.000> ship<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.750> spreading<00:01:43.049> little<00:01:43.350> feet

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
felt a bit like a viewpoint on the Neo

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.980 
felt a bit like a viewpoint on the Neo
Geo<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.890> way<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.600> kind<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.810> neat

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
Geo that way and it's just kind of neat

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
Geo that way and it's just kind of neat
to<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.799> constantly<00:01:53.399> shifting

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
to have this like constantly shifting

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.109 
to have this like constantly shifting
like<00:01:54.450> perspective<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> shoot-'em-ups

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
like perspective and the shoot-'em-ups

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.490 
like perspective and the shoot-'em-ups
because<00:01:57.450> usually<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.079> very<00:01:58.350> very

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
because usually it's just very very

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
because usually it's just very very
rigid<00:01:59.040> will<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.820> whole<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.240> will<00:02:00.360> be

horizontal oh the whole thing will be
vertical<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> that's<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.299> got<00:02:03.509> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
vertical and that's about all you got so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.149 
vertical and that's about all you got so
it's<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.079> nice<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.860> sort

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
more that powers up as you use it so you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.730 
more that powers up as you use it so you
can<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.120> sort<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.360> hold<00:02:32.570> down<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.050> attack

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
can just sort of hold down the attack

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.200 
can just sort of hold down the attack
button<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.220> then<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.580> search<00:02:34.670> building<00:02:35.090> up

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
button and then just search building up

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.460 
button and then just search building up
its<00:02:35.360> charge<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.900> then<00:02:35.990> when<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.170> release<00:02:36.440> it

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
its charge and then when you release it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.920 
its charge and then when you release it
then<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.920> fires<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.850> then<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.420> make<00:02:38.750> these

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
then it fires and then to make these

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.150 
then it fires and then to make these
things<00:02:39.170> stronger<00:02:39.590> that's<00:02:39.740> how<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:39.950> get<00:02:40.070> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
things stronger that's how you get the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.040 
things stronger that's how you get the
power-ups<00:02:40.580> one<00:02:40.820> here<00:02:41.030> killing<00:02:41.540> enemies<00:02:41.870> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
power-ups one here killing enemies and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.450 
power-ups one here killing enemies and
stuff<00:02:42.170> sometimes<00:02:42.650> they'll<00:02:42.890> just<00:02:42.920> show<00:02:43.190> up<00:02:43.310> on

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
stuff sometimes they'll just show up on

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.550 
stuff sometimes they'll just show up on
the<00:02:43.550> map<00:02:43.760> or<00:02:43.940> someone<00:02:44.270> will<00:02:44.390> drop<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.020> then

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
the map or someone will drop it and then

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.290 
the map or someone will drop it and then
it'll<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:46.040> like<00:02:46.220> level<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.700> these<00:02:46.910> different

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
it'll just like level up these different

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.520 
it'll just like level up these different
weapons<00:02:47.600> whatever<00:02:47.780> want<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.290> an<00:02:48.410> app

bit<00:04:09.800> at<00:04:09.980> yeah<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.400> it's<00:04:11.030> I'd<00:04:11.270> say<00:04:11.450> it's<00:04:11.570> play

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
bit at yeah and it's I'd say it's play

but a medium sized hitbox your ships

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.550 
but a medium sized hitbox your ships
gonna<00:04:13.790> have<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.300> it's<00:04:14.840> not<00:04:15.050> quite<00:04:15.290> like<00:04:15.380> the

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.990 
gonna have so it's not quite like the
modern<00:04:16.040> games<00:04:16.220> today<00:04:16.430> where<00:04:16.670> you<00:04:16.760> have<00:04:16.850> that

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
modern games today where you have that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.760 
modern games today where you have that
little<00:04:17.060> dot<00:04:17.540> where<00:04:17.570> as<00:04:18.049> long<00:04:18.200> as<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.500> doesn't

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
little dot where as long as that doesn't

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.590 
little dot where as long as that doesn't
get<00:04:18.890> hit<00:04:19.070> you're<00:04:19.370> fine<00:04:19.880> it's<00:04:20.120> still<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.390> bit

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
get hit you're fine it's still a bit

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.729 
get hit you're fine it's still a bit
bigger<00:04:20.780> than<00:04:20.989> that<00:04:21.109> but<00:04:21.260> not<00:04:21.380> quite<00:04:21.620> as

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
bigger than that but not quite as

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.440 
bigger than that but not quite as
gigantic<00:04:22.280> as<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.580> stuff<00:04:22.790> in<00:04:22.940> the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
gigantic as the stuff in the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.970 
gigantic as the stuff in the
eight<00:04:23.720> in<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.870> 16-bit<00:04:24.260> era<00:04:24.470> or<00:04:24.650> sometimes

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
eight in the 16-bit era or sometimes

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.350 
eight in the 16-bit era or sometimes
even<00:04:25.040> your<00:04:25.280> entire<00:04:25.370> ship<00:04:25.790> with<00:04:25.910> one<00:04:26.060> giant

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
even your entire ship with one giant

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.170 
even your entire ship with one giant
hitbox<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.530> it's<00:04:27.830> biggest<00:04:28.610> similar<00:04:29.000> in<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
hitbox so it's biggest similar in the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.180 
hitbox so it's biggest similar in the
middle<00:04:29.450> difficulty<00:04:29.990> wise<00:04:30.140> but<00:04:30.380> did<00:04:30.590> find<00:04:30.620> it

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
middle difficulty wise but did find it

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.190 
middle difficulty wise but did find it
pushed<00:04:31.430> me<00:04:31.580> fairly<00:04:31.850> hard<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.420> have<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:33.050> be<00:04:33.170> a

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
pushed me fairly hard to have to be a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.480 
pushed me fairly hard to have to be a
bit<00:04:33.380> more<00:04:33.530> careful<00:04:33.950> with<00:04:34.040> what<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.280> was<00:04:34.460> doing

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
bit more careful with what I was doing

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.700 
bit more careful with what I was doing
but<00:04:35.300> it's<00:04:35.570> just<00:04:35.840> like<00:04:35.960> most<00:04:36.110> other<00:04:36.260> shooters

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
but it's just like most other shooters

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.310 
but it's just like most other shooters
it's<00:04:36.950> a<00:04:37.100> lot<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.370> its<00:04:37.610> memorization<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:38.810> once<00:04:39.260> I

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
it's a lot of its memorization so once I

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.660 
it's a lot of its memorization so once I
get<00:04:39.470> used<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.710> whatever<00:04:39.890> attack<00:04:40.310> pattern

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
get used to whatever attack pattern

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.710 
get used to whatever attack pattern
until<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:40.880> have<00:04:41.060> thrown<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.540> where<00:04:41.630> the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
until you have thrown a and where the

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.420 
until you have thrown a and where the
enemies<00:04:42.080> are<00:04:42.230> gonna<00:04:42.290> be<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.800> Stewart<00:04:43.040> slowly

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
enemies are gonna be and Stewart slowly

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.980 
enemies are gonna be and Stewart slowly
getting<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.120> little<00:04:44.210> bit<00:04:44.420> further<00:04:44.720> each<00:04:44.960> time

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
getting a little bit further each time

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.870 
getting a little bit further each time
you<00:04:45.290> played<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.620> game<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:46.040> mean<00:04:46.490> looking<00:04:46.850> back

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
you played the game I mean looking back

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.280 
you played the game I mean looking back
at<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.240> game<00:04:47.390> now<00:04:47.600> graphically<00:04:48.080> it's

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
at the game now graphically it's

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.630 
at the game now graphically it's
definitely<00:04:48.590> not<00:04:48.680> gonna<00:04:48.800> Wow<00:04:49.040> and<00:04:49.310> he<00:04:49.370> wanted

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
definitely not gonna Wow and he wanted

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.700 
definitely not gonna Wow and he wanted
more<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.120> historical<00:04:50.840> sort<00:04:51.140> of<00:04:51.230> thing<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.470> see

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
more of a historical sort of thing I see

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.290 
more of a historical sort of thing I see
is<00:04:51.770> more<00:04:51.920> with<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.190> value<00:04:52.520> is<00:04:52.700> here<00:04:52.910> sort<00:04:53.210> of

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
is more with the value is here sort of

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.940 
is more with the value is here sort of
looking<00:04:53.900> back<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.260> seeing<00:04:54.500> what<00:04:54.680> some<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.860> the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
looking back and seeing what some of the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.220 
looking back and seeing what some of the
very<00:04:55.130> early<00:04:55.600> polygonal<00:04:56.600> graphics<00:04:56.720> were

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
very early polygonal graphics were

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.290 
very early polygonal graphics were
actually<00:04:57.500> like<00:04:57.650> on<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.830> home<00:04:58.040> system<00:04:58.520> it's<00:04:59.000> very

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
actually like on a home system it's very

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.150 
actually like on a home system it's very
simplistic<00:04:59.690> by<00:05:00.320> today's<00:05:00.680> standards

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
simplistic by today's standards

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.310 
simplistic by today's standards
obviously<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:02.000> sometimes<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:03.110> do<00:05:03.200> almost

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
obviously and sometimes to do almost

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.230 
obviously and sometimes to do almost
seems<00:05:03.590> like<00:05:03.650> blocky<00:05:04.190> pixelated<00:05:04.970> stuff

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
seems like blocky pixelated stuff

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.090 
seems like blocky pixelated stuff
especially<00:05:05.510> on<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.080> when<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.530> camera<00:05:06.890> shifts

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
especially on the when the camera shifts

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.830 
especially on the when the camera shifts
like<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.550> either<00:05:07.730> in<00:05:07.910> front<00:05:08.090> or<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.420> back<00:05:08.450> of

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
like to either in front or in back of

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.810 
like to either in front or in back of
your<00:05:09.080> home<00:05:09.710> ship<00:05:10.010> they're<00:05:10.250> just<00:05:10.580> there<00:05:10.730> to

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
your home ship they're just there to

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.610 
your home ship they're just there to
look<00:05:10.940> really<00:05:11.180> blocky<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.780> blotchy<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.260> stuff

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
look really blocky and blotchy and stuff

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.770 
look really blocky and blotchy and stuff
so<00:05:13.220> it's<00:05:13.460> not<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:13.880> most<00:05:14.030> pretty<00:05:14.270> game<00:05:14.540> in<00:05:14.690> the

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
so it's not the most pretty game in the

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.660 
so it's not the most pretty game in the
world<00:05:14.930> but<00:05:15.080> it's<00:05:15.470> okay<00:05:15.890> I<00:05:15.920> guess<00:05:16.280> it's<00:05:16.490> not

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
world but it's okay I guess it's not

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.000 
world but it's okay I guess it's not
gonna<00:05:16.850> like<00:05:17.600> be<00:05:17.780> ruined<00:05:18.200> up<00:05:18.350> by<00:05:18.470> any<00:05:18.650> stretch

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
gonna like be ruined up by any stretch

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.590 
gonna like be ruined up by any stretch
in<00:05:19.280> terms<00:05:19.490> like<00:05:19.580> could<00:05:19.700> be<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.910> ugly<00:05:20.210> for<00:05:20.450> the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
in terms like could be the ugly for the

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.060 
in terms like could be the ugly for the
each<00:05:20.750> PlayStation<00:05:21.320> 1<00:05:21.470> games<00:05:21.710> and<00:05:21.890> there<00:05:21.980> are

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
each PlayStation 1 games and there are

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.470 
each PlayStation 1 games and there are
plenty<00:05:22.310> of<00:05:22.520> those<00:05:22.640> as<00:05:22.820> well<00:05:23.000> but<00:05:23.120> I<00:05:23.180> wouldn't

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
plenty of those as well but I wouldn't

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.810 
plenty of those as well but I wouldn't
put<00:05:23.540> foolish<00:05:23.990> OMA<00:05:24.230> in<00:05:24.380> with<00:05:24.560> that<00:05:24.740> group

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
put foolish OMA in with that group

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
put foolish OMA in with that group
necessarily<00:05:25.820> that's<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.450> nice<00:05:26.600> thing<00:05:26.810> about

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
necessarily that's the nice thing about

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.300 
necessarily that's the nice thing about
