in the game but what's cool about it is
you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.700> actually<00:01:35.820> digivolve<00:01:36.570> into<00:01:36.810> their

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
you can actually digivolve into their

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.219 
you can actually digivolve into their
digital<00:01:37.409> forms<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.970> basically<00:01:39.659> us<00:01:39.810> another<00:01:40.049> on

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
digital forms so basically us another on

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.660 
digital forms so basically us another on
top<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.590> there's<00:01:40.799> something<00:01:40.920> 12<00:01:41.310> form<00:01:41.549> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
top of that there's something 12 form so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
top of that there's something 12 form so
you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.880> actually<00:01:42.060> transform<00:01:42.899> into

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you can actually transform into

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
you can actually transform into
and<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.010> top<00:01:44.190> of<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.370> there's<00:01:44.760> also<00:01:44.910> super

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and on top of that there's also super

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.930 
and on top of that there's also super
forms<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.410> there's<00:01:46.650> three<00:01:46.800> different<00:01:46.940> levels

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
forms so there's three different levels

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.940 
forms so there's three different levels
of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> Digimon<00:01:48.750> evolution<00:01:49.650> that<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.830> can

of the Digimon evolution that you can

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.320 
of the Digimon evolution that you can
actually<00:01:50.070> achieve<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> game<00:01:50.880> looks<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
actually achieve in the game looks so

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.150 
actually achieve in the game looks so
different<00:01:51.750> stuff<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.350> fans<00:01:52.650> would<00:01:52.890> remember

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160
