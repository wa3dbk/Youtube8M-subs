00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
springboard which is just the desktop

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.370 
springboard which is just the desktop
and<00:01:04.799> you'll<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.780> Cydia

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

much<00:01:14.040> easier<00:01:14.580> than<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.420> downloading<00:01:16.260> of<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
much easier than the downloading of a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.180 
much easier than the downloading of a
program<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.940> your<00:01:18.030> computer<00:01:18.480> and<00:01:19.190> connecting

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
program to your computer and connecting

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
the iPhone over USB and creating a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.370 
the iPhone over USB and creating a
custom<00:01:24.060> install<00:01:24.360> package<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.050> all<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
custom install package and all of that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.380 
custom install package and all of that
is<00:01:25.800> just<00:01:25.890> done<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.400> over-the-air<00:01:26.820> really

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
is just done right over-the-air really

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.620 
is just done right over-the-air really
simple<00:01:28.700> we'll<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.820> give<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.060> another<00:01:30.300> minute

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
simple we'll just give it another minute

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
simple we'll just give it another minute
here<00:01:31.430> maybe<00:01:32.430> I'll<00:01:32.640> skip<00:01:32.820> past<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:34.610> maybe<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
here maybe I'll skip past it maybe not I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
here maybe I'll skip past it maybe not I
figured<00:01:36.150> you'd<00:01:36.300> want<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:36.480> see<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:37.500> amount<00:01:37.710> of

figured you'd want to see the amount of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.310 
figured you'd want to see the amount of
time<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.130> took<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.980> just<00:01:40.980> keep<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> going

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
time it took so just keep it going

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.480 
time it took so just keep it going
there<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.500> progress<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.010> happening<00:01:44.370> right
