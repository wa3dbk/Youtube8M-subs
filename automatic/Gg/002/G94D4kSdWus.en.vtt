00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.550
 hello friends past video clip 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:14.370
 I showed you how 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:17.580
 equip vibrotail or twister 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.180
 here is such a jig head you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.789
 remember yes 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:30.990
 we pierce the headers and print the middle 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:35.090
 the torso is such a snap but it 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.190
 the jig-head is already full 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.890
 prepared for use on the hook 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.590
 weld the lead fused and already to 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:52.559
 is not shorter then need to think today I 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.710
 I want to show you how to collect all this 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.930
 separately for this we need 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.399
 hook with a long shank 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.399
 here is such 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.140
 carbine 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.880
 latch and here's a winder ring 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:21.880
 and carabiner latch winding ring can 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 to be a different size and this one 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.350
 a little weight that's a weight with ears called 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.039
 Cheburashka because here these ears 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.289
 stick out of the weights fused weights 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.849
 these cheburashka have a different size I 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:43.720
 took small 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:46.899
 C grade attached to these ears 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 winding rings see I already started for 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.640
 time savings 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.299
 proceed to the assembly we take the vibrotail and 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.299
 branchy 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:03.409
 take the hook 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:08.470
 also from the head 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:11.470
 we pierce this fish 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.470
 we derive 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.530
 And cream pen from fish on 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:33.430
 we take carabiner snap attach 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:38.280
 Here is the snap hook attach to 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.280
 for in one ring on cheburashka so 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.400
 have attached 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.460
 Here is such a construction see 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.330
 one winding ring 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:55.690
 here is a cheburashka 2 clockwork ring and 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.260
 carabiner with latch now open 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.260
 latch 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:15.190
 and pass the hook ear 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:15.190
 fasten the snap fastener 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.560
 It turned out like this 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.950
 carabiner does not get confused 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:32.750
 to brake the fish quietly rotates on 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:37.880
 this carabiner this main gear 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.690
 we have prepared now take since 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.590
 pike 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.550
 very sharp teeth leash special 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.840
 can be metalized can not on 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.790
 one end of the leash carbine on the other 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:01.120
 latch open the latch 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.120
 we dress a winding ring on the latch 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.750
 so here 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.700
 all gear is ready 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.410
 here you can or another latch with 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:22.150
 carabiner or just skip fishing line and 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:24.630
 tie a clinch or simple 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.810
 eight as you please 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.050
 main fishing line and tackle ready for 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.050
 application 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:39.600
 I want to tell you friends that some 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.590
 dogma certain rules in making 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:47.150
 and mounting predator gear 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.250
 there is no need to experiment 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.229
 Here is this weights Cheburashka can 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.750
 to put 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:59.669
 directly after to after hook to 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:08.000
 Cheburashka already attach this one 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:12.810
 latch system carabiner and leash 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.580
 but when I did more to me like this 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.490
 Cheburashka like weight can be generally 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.710
 attach to the other end of the leash 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.860
 here 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.860
 what does it mean 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:42.340
 attach the hook leash she this 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:46.770
 end of cheburashka so it gives us a field 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:51.789
 for maneuver that is twister 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:54.779
 when posting a certain spent there 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.439
 twisted the coil a couple of times 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:01.439
 the weight falls 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:04.330
 twist he goes after him then again 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:08.699
 support coil twister pops up 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:12.360
 release the tweeter coil 5 float down 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:15.729
 so so my friends 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:21.419
 experiment and you will always be with 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:29.159
 prey the same can be done with 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:30.900
 lure attach system karabinchik 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:37.409
 snap lock 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:40.779
