a few episodes ago we looked at one of
the<00:00:22.750> main<00:00:22.960> reasons<00:00:23.380> why<00:00:23.590> God<00:00:23.859> is<00:00:24.070> not<00:00:24.220> a

we believe that if something is true

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.159 
we believe that if something is true
that<00:00:30.489> we<00:00:30.640> should<00:00:30.789> proclaim<00:00:31.119> it<00:00:31.390> even<00:00:31.779> if<00:00:32.020> it

person from his father even Trinitarians

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.840 
person from his father even Trinitarians
would<00:00:43.930> have<00:00:44.199> to<00:00:44.350> admit<00:00:44.589> this<00:00:44.800> since<00:00:45.400> from

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
would have to admit this since from

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.790 
would have to admit this since from
their<00:00:46.030> perspective<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.930> unity<00:00:47.350> between<00:00:47.500> the

their perspective the unity between the
father<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.190> Jesus<00:00:48.699> is<00:00:48.850> not<00:00:49.089> that<00:00:49.239> they<00:00:49.360> have

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
father and Jesus is not that they have

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.630 
father and Jesus is not that they have
the<00:00:49.629> same<00:00:49.809> person<00:00:50.290> but<00:00:50.739> that<00:00:50.769> they<00:00:51.070> share<00:00:51.430> the
