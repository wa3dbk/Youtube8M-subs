of the cards so you might want to do

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.330 
of the cards so you might want to do
this<00:01:36.409> in<00:01:36.620> in<00:01:37.550> separate<00:01:38.800> chunks<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:39.860> I'm<00:01:40.159> just

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
this in in separate chunks so I'm just

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
punching them and then using another

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.360 
punching them and then using another
card<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.750> be<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.260> guide<00:01:45.470> as<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.800> where<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.190> put

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
card to be the guide as to where to put

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.070 
card to be the guide as to where to put
the<00:01:46.460> hole<00:01:46.490> punches<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.180> next<00:01:47.450> card<00:01:47.659> so

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
the hole punches on the next card so

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.969 
the hole punches on the next card so
this<00:01:48.229> shows<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.440> little<00:01:48.710> bit<00:01:48.950> more

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
this shows a little bit more
