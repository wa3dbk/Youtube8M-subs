00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.760
 you step that I used in the recording 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.500
 of your new dvd 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.170
 I'm using the 6 pack here 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.559
 meridian that was an award-winning 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.929
 year of 2009 during the fair more 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.529
 which happens in franc in germany to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:28.380
 configuration of this kit is following 8 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:36.540
 6 8 by 7 10 by 8 12 by 9 13 by 10 14 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:39.960
 by 11 14 by 14 16 by 16 18 by 16 and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.010
 18-by- 16 bank, but without the skin of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.559
 answer two bass drums of 22 by 18 to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.550
 main box is a black panther of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 14 by 8 and the effects box a sling 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.350
 the dishes that I am 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.450
 using are all of the brand fish I 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.670
 I often mix multiple lines to 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.420
 to achieve a more diverse sound 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.950
 so I'm using the lines here 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.630
 signature hood 2002 signature reflector 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.649
 hello works 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.189
 besides these two timbals one of 14 and one 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.299
 balance is 15 and the two boys are 18 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.109
 with a dome of 24 that were made 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.020
 customized by type of music that I 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.170
 I play another detail of my kit are 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.840
 also those two splashs that the use is 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.209
 a signature species of 8 with the splash 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.429
 of the street of 10 then gives this sonority 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:41.099
 dried the drumsticks that use the 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.289
 promark autographed model achilles 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:46.319
 priester the stones I 'm using 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.319
 are all the evans brand and the model 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.719
 used in this recording was aec and 2 c 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.959
 two have these inner rings that 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.200
 control the harmonics well and according to 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.329
 Tone measurement increases the rings 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.759
 are also a little thicker in order to 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.889
 to hold the drum resonance further 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.189
 the skin I 'm using in the box 

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:10.439
 main is the hd drae generator that is 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:13.780
 that skin that has the little holes around it 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:16.540
 and these little holes wait for the air 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.750
 has a more controlled tuning without 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.840
 a lot of resonance in the effect box I 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.780
 I'm using evans launch that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.150
 it's the onyx and the boobs I'm 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.160
 using the skin and 4 which is one of the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.920
 heavier and thicker pieces 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.370
 they have the pedal I'm using is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.400
 the w9 thousand and microphones are all the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.520
 audi technique and it is worth noting that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.530
 the microphone of the bass drums is the 2,500 that is 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.830
 microphone with a double 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.120
 a condenser capsule and a dynamic 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.459
 the trios I 'm using are from 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.630
 staff of one and the module is also a 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.790
 module of the staff of a sdx monitoring 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.860
 that I'm using and the power click is 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.780
 a small four-channel coffee table that I 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.760
 I can hear perfectly on recordings 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.739
 and shows workshops 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.380
 the equipment they use during my 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.480
 the workshop are all of the cyclotron both 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.160
 the speakers as the peripherals 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.930
 and also the tables 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.019
 the equipment you use for the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.280
 recordings of demo demos and workshops 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.870
 are from sun 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.750
 the hacker I am using a 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.720
 fast to what was done in gibraltar 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.400
 order for this battery and a radio 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.410
 which makes assembly much easier 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.810
 exactly for the precision that this 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.790
 equipment offers the total also uses the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.930
 my igt shoes on the turbo comes out with a kick 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.290
 which was made by the Brazilian company 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.090
 called urban boards the finish of my 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.150
 another kit was made by a company 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.700
 called aero ricci who specializes in 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.950
 in finishes of batteries and for 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.320
 finish to save all this 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.560
 equipment and uses the brand's 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.560
 gillette
