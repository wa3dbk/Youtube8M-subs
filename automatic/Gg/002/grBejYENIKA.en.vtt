00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.400
 The multiplayer mode of Driver San Fransisco offers something for everyone 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.240
 if you make the streets unsafe with friends as a team 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.480
 or Cinema will show your retrospect of being rescued over the finish line 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.230
 the motives of fashion is interesting and fun 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.039
 Lawn and jostling are not mouse but are highly recommended it is 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.060
 quite easy to get into the action and then stay 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.480
 with higher ranks hardly any new skills 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.830
 Weapons and cars are back 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.110
 but the decisive force is Chatter 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 for the balance she is a young and dry 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.589
 and your opponents can handle it at any time 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.589
 be the start everywhere in the ground 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.280
 even if you look at your car yourself 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.280
 It is never too late and to come forward again 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.720
 Red Shift can be self-shaking 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.100
 Pay in the last second 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.800
 like in single player mode you can by fast ships 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.160
 Change cars and come back to the front but there are also motives of 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.570
 Top chefs 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.590
 can exchange 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.590
 each author a few finals 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.920
 not just a defensive driving style 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.420
 but also a real weapon 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.220
 With the imposing you can write a shock to other cars and so into the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.100
 Bring slinging 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.460
 the way to level 40 is far but we give a little on the tennis tour 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.820
 more on 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.310
 In online gaming, the more cars are available to choose faster stronger ones 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.830
 What I've just best suits is there's plenty of online modes with each other 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.990
 and against each other 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.780
 Leading banks stay through the streets while he's on the move 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.760
 Team boss race you can grab new cars with chip 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.350
 or you will not be quite old-fashioned classic races in the chat 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.010
 allowed 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.410
 There are also numerous local ones 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.730
 There are 8 different split screen modified 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.400
 Drive against each other or partially shared area in the mode of lightning 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.890
 Bread or AMD any opponents who come too close or know together against 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.709
 the clock around 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.129
 to retrieve the commerzbank shares 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.789
 another or against each other 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.789
 in each mode there is to look ahead while the other players are looking 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.599
 maybe or jump off claims 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.149
 can you imagine 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:23.259
 secure an example 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.259
 For example, from the beginning ships or retro 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.069
 in the grid 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.269
 and then the race goes, or catch or drive conquer 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.540
 in over a dozen multiplayer modes there are always new "cooking professionals" 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.540
 Challenges are the steering wheel right 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.249

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.959
 and difficult to master because there are roads 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.989
 great addiction factor 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.499
