there<00:00:06.390> are<00:00:06.540> many<00:00:06.960> different<00:00:07.350> kinds<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.649> robots

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
there are many different kinds of robots

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.459 
there are many different kinds of robots
in<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> DARPA<00:00:08.580> Robotics<00:00:08.790> Challenge<00:00:09.349> seven<00:00:10.349> of

them are of the Atlas type Alice
unplugged<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.980> upgrade<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.549> Atlas<00:00:14.880> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
unplugged is the upgrade to Atlas to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.760 
unplugged is the upgrade to Atlas to
allow<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.509> run<00:00:15.690> entirely<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.260> batteries

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
allow it to run entirely on batteries

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
allow it to run entirely on batteries
and<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.850> use<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> wireless

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
and to have it use a wireless

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.120 
and to have it use a wireless
communication<00:00:18.750> path<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> not

require a safety tether to hold itself
up<00:00:22.380> basically<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.970> cut<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> cord<00:00:24.539> we

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
up basically we have to cut the cord we

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.109 
up basically we have to cut the cord we
have<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.380> no<00:00:25.560> longer<00:00:25.800> rely<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.519> safety<00:00:26.849> line

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
have to no longer rely on a safety line

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.029 
have to no longer rely on a safety line
on<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> top<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.380> see<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.560> there's<00:00:28.859> one

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
on the top you can see that there's one

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.650 
on the top you can see that there's one
there<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.550> now<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.330> you're<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
there right now and you're going to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.479 
there right now and you're going to
continue<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.109> use<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:31.560> during<00:00:31.769> your<00:00:31.890> testing

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
continue to use them during your testing

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.209 
continue to use them during your testing
but<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> course<00:00:33.630> when<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.800> contest

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
but of course when we have the contest

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.799 
but of course when we have the contest
itself<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.940> you're<00:00:36.090> getting<00:00:36.239> ready<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
itself and you're getting ready for the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.900 
itself and you're getting ready for the
contest<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.530> safety<00:00:37.980> line<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.430> not<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
contest that safety line is not going to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.959 
contest that safety line is not going to
be<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.210> anymore<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.230> new<00:00:40.379> Atlas<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.010> 75%

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
be there anymore the new Atlas is 75%

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
be there anymore the new Atlas is 75%
new<00:00:42.480> only<00:00:42.809> 25%<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> parts<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.280> in

much quieter than it was before it also
is<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:55.980> bit<00:00:56.190> stronger<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.090> can

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
is a little bit stronger so that it can

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
is a little bit stronger so that it can
better<00:00:57.390> get<00:00:57.600> off<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> ground<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.289> case<00:00:58.320> it

better get off the ground in case it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
better get off the ground in case it
falls<00:00:58.879> we<00:00:59.879> try<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> make<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> number<00:01:00.750> of

falls we try to make a number of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.410 
falls we try to make a number of
innovations<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> new<00:01:01.770> robot<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:03.000> primary

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
innovations to the new robot the primary

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
innovations to the new robot the primary
one<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.680> new<00:01:04.769> battery<00:01:05.100> pack<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.640> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
one is the the new battery pack so in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.550 
one is the the new battery pack so in
the<00:01:06.000> back<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> robot<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:06.900> you'll<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the back of the robot here you'll see a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460 
the back of the robot here you'll see a
large<00:01:08.430> box<00:01:08.729> which<00:01:09.090> represents<00:01:09.200> all<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
robot is a brand new pump this is a very

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
robot is a brand new pump this is a very
quiet<00:01:25.380> pump<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> we're<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.610> excited

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
quiet pump and we're really excited

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.310 
quiet pump and we're really excited
about<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.360> pump<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> makes<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
about this pump because it makes the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.840 
about this pump because it makes the
robot<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.680> lot<00:01:28.890> quieter<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.490> teams<00:01:29.670> can

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
robot a lot quieter the teams can

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.390 
robot a lot quieter the teams can
actually<00:01:30.270> operate<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.470> robot<00:01:31.829> without<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
actually operate this robot without the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.179 
actually operate this robot without the
the<00:01:32.909> need<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.540> any<00:01:33.689> hearing<00:01:33.960> protection<00:01:34.350> it's

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the need for any hearing protection it's

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.999 
the need for any hearing protection it's
a<00:01:35.310> variable<00:01:35.810> pressure<00:01:36.810> pump<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> will

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
a variable pressure pump so that will

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.609 
a variable pressure pump so that will
allow<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> team's<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:39.000> change<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.229> decide

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
allow the team's to change and decide

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.580 
allow the team's to change and decide
what<00:01:40.890> pressure<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.579> use<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> robot

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
what pressure they will use on the robot

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.749 
what pressure they will use on the robot
during<00:01:43.590> any<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> tasks<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
during any of the tasks of the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.609 
during any of the tasks of the
competition<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.960> will<00:01:46.140> allow<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.500> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
competition and that will allow them to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
competition and that will allow them to
actually<00:01:46.740> save<00:01:47.189> battery<00:01:47.460> power<00:01:47.670> by<00:01:48.270> using

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
actually save battery power by using

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.749 
actually save battery power by using
less<00:01:48.780> pressure<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> robot<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.579> we

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
less pressure on the robot up here we

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.609 
less pressure on the robot up here we
will<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.360> set<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.810> computers<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
will have a set of computers and the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
will have a set of computers and the
teams<00:01:52.829> will<00:01:53.009> use<00:01:53.159> those<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.579> process<00:01:54.030> images

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
teams will use those to process images

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.959 
teams will use those to process images
out<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> sensor<00:01:55.680> head<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.610> command

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
out of the sensor head and then command

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.690 
out of the sensor head and then command
the<00:01:57.119> robot<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.750> its<00:01:57.930> tasks<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.829> arms<00:01:59.430> have

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the robot to do its tasks the arms have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.969 
the robot to do its tasks the arms have
been<00:02:00.200> repositioned<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.619> robot

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
been repositioned on this robot

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.560 
been repositioned on this robot
basically<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> shoulders<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.420> been

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
basically the shoulders have been

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
basically the shoulders have been
flipped<00:02:03.840> over<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.920> cut

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
flipped over you see they are now cut

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.830 
flipped over you see they are now cut
the<00:02:05.399> arms<00:02:05.640> come<00:02:05.820> out<00:02:05.850> from<00:02:06.210> much<00:02:06.329> lower<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the arms come out from much lower in the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.770 
the arms come out from much lower in the
robot<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.740> allows<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.369> users<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.179> have

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
robot and this allows the users to have

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.080 
robot and this allows the users to have
more<00:02:10.050> work<00:02:10.259> space<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.860> front<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> robot<00:02:11.879> so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
more work space in front of the robot so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.920 
more work space in front of the robot so
they<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.540> what

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
they can see what

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.660 
they can see what
hands<00:02:13.079> are<00:02:13.230> doing<00:02:13.319> these<00:02:13.920> are<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.250> older

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
hands are doing these are the older

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.280 
hands are doing these are the older
forearms<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.540> will<00:02:15.689> have<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> new<00:02:16.049> set<00:02:16.260> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
forearms but we will have a new set of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.979 
forearms but we will have a new set of
electric<00:02:16.739> forearms<00:02:17.189> which<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.299> wrist

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
electric forearms which have a wrist

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.539 
electric forearms which have a wrist
degree<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.409> freedom<00:02:19.739> which<00:02:19.980> will<00:02:20.129> allow<00:02:20.310> them

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
degree of freedom which will allow them

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.250 
degree of freedom which will allow them
to<00:02:20.579> turn<00:02:20.849> doorknobs<00:02:21.420> without<00:02:21.810> having<00:02:22.140> to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
to turn doorknobs without having to

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.589 
to turn doorknobs without having to
torque<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> whole<00:02:22.799> arm<00:02:23.569> three-quarters<00:02:24.569> of

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
torque the whole arm three-quarters of

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.509 
torque the whole arm three-quarters of
this<00:02:24.840> robot<00:02:25.049> has<00:02:25.379> changed<00:02:25.799> basically<00:02:26.280> from

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
this robot has changed basically from

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.580 
this robot has changed basically from
the<00:02:26.670> knees<00:02:26.849> all<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.299> way<00:02:27.659> up<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.349> teams

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the knees all the way up so the teams

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.020 
the knees all the way up so the teams
are<00:02:28.680> gonna<00:02:28.799> have<00:02:29.040> quite<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> job<00:02:29.609> over<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.000> next

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
are gonna have quite a job over the next

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.520 
are gonna have quite a job over the next
three<00:02:30.329> months<00:02:30.389> to<00:02:30.689> get<00:02:30.810> reacquainted<00:02:31.139> with

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
three months to get reacquainted with

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.339 
three months to get reacquainted with
new<00:02:31.950> Atlas<00:02:32.400> unplugged<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.689> finals<00:02:34.109> are<00:02:34.200> gonna

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
new Atlas unplugged the finals are gonna

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.140 
new Atlas unplugged the finals are gonna
be<00:02:34.500> very<00:02:34.799> hard<00:02:35.159> they're<00:02:35.639> gonna<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.939> much

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
be very hard they're gonna be much

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.300 
be very hard they're gonna be much
harder<00:02:36.750> than<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> trials<00:02:37.349> were<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.769> know<00:02:37.859> none

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
harder than the trials were I know none

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.030 
harder than the trials were I know none
of<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.519> like<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.760> idea<00:02:39.409> but<00:02:40.409> it's<00:02:40.680> what<00:02:40.920> we

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
of you like that idea but it's what we

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.069 
of you like that idea but it's what we
have<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.609> in<00:02:41.909> order<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:42.569> bring

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
have to do in order to really bring

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.449 
have to do in order to really bring
these<00:02:43.260> systems<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.859> right<00:02:44.040> level<00:02:44.250> of

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
these systems to the right level of

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.580 
these systems to the right level of
development<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:45.450> want<00:02:45.629> these<00:02:45.870> tests<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.470> be

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
development we want these tests to be

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.259 
development we want these tests to be
much<00:02:46.769> more<00:02:46.980> authentic<00:02:47.099> much<00:02:47.730> more<00:02:47.879> like<00:02:48.060> real

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
much more authentic much more like real

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.670 
much more authentic much more like real
disasters<00:02:48.870> we're<00:02:49.230> gonna<00:02:49.319> make<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
disasters we're gonna make the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.649 
disasters we're gonna make the
communication<00:02:50.310> much<00:02:50.579> more<00:02:50.849> realistic<00:02:51.209> much

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
communication much more realistic much

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.629 
communication much more realistic much
more<00:02:51.870> austere<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.349> difficult<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.220> long

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
more austere and difficult with long

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.759 
more austere and difficult with long
blackouts<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.419> up<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.689> a<00:02:54.720> minute<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.439> robots

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
blackouts of up to a minute the robots

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.080 
blackouts of up to a minute the robots
are<00:02:55.829> going<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.159> to<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:56.669> of<00:02:56.700> these

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
are going to have to do all of these

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.209 
are going to have to do all of these
tasks<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.599> sequence<00:02:58.049> without<00:02:58.349> any<00:02:58.620> human<00:02:58.889> help

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
tasks in sequence without any human help

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.129 
tasks in sequence without any human help
there<00:02:59.609> won't<00:02:59.849> be<00:02:59.909> any<00:03:00.269> possibility<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.959> a

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
there won't be any possibility for a

there won't be any possibility for a
person<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.530> intervene<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.030> robots

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
person to intervene and so the robots

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.819 
person to intervene and so the robots
will<00:03:03.480> have<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.750> perform<00:03:04.049> much<00:03:04.379> much<00:03:04.590> better

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
will have to perform much much better

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.679 
will have to perform much much better
than<00:03:05.040> before<00:03:05.159> they'll<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.879> less<00:03:06.090> time<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.540> do

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
than before they'll have less time to do

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.509 
than before they'll have less time to do
it<00:03:06.840> only<00:03:07.139> an<00:03:07.260> hour<00:03:07.469> for<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:07.950> entire<00:03:08.280> mission

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
it only an hour for the entire mission

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:17.940 
it only an hour for the entire mission
and<00:03:09.379> may<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.530> best<00:03:10.680> robot<00:03:11.040> win
