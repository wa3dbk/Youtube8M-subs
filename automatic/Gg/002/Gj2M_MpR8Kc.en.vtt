00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
do each overture its they done a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.170 
phenomenal job with it it's amazing so
but<00:02:40.530> overall<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.190> would<00:02:41.280> probably<00:02:41.970> give<00:02:42.090> this

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
but overall I would probably give this

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.360 
but overall I would probably give this
about<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.390> 7<00:02:42.480> out<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.870> time<00:02:43.140> mainly<00:02:43.830> because<00:02:44.010> it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
about a 7 out of time mainly because it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.400 
about a 7 out of time mainly because it
is<00:02:44.459> nothing<00:02:44.790> new<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.540> same<00:02:45.720> time<00:02:45.959> it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
is nothing new but at the same time it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.920 
is nothing new but at the same time it
just<00:02:46.620> brings<00:02:46.799> some<00:02:46.920> new<00:02:47.040> aspects<00:02:47.519> into<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.030> so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
just brings some new aspects into it so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.050 
just brings some new aspects into it so
it<00:02:49.380> does<00:02:49.590> help<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.980> out<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.100> little<00:02:50.459> bit<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:50.970> it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
it does help it out a little bit but it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.280 
it does help it out a little bit but it
is<00:02:51.209> still<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.630> feels<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.930> standalone

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
is still just feels like a standalone

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.210 
is still just feels like a standalone
game<00:02:52.590> by<00:02:52.739> itself

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
game by itself

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.910 
game by itself
