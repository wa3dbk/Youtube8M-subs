everything around it and in total i

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.660 
everything around it and in total i
wasn't<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:03.899> happy<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.769> way<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:05.159> managed

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.120 
wasn't really happy the way they managed
to<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.409> did<00:01:07.740> balance

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
to or but it's the way they did balance

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130

it<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.460> battlefield<00:01:08.880> 4<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> three-hit

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it in battlefield 4 because a three-hit

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
it in battlefield 4 because a three-hit

and wanted headshot them at all ranges

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.999 
and wanted headshot them at all ranges
plus<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.610> 10<00:01:41.939> instead<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.479> five<00:01:43.009> rounds

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
plus you get 10 instead of five rounds

in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.159> magazine<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.729> again<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.390> something

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
in the magazine which again is something

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.810 
in the magazine which again is something
I<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.700> way

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I really do like and I think the way

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.280 
I really do like and I think the way
they<00:01:47.939> did<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.780> better<00:01:49.020> for

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
they did now is not better for

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.039 
they did now is not better for
aggressive<00:01:49.590> recon<00:01:49.890> players<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.939> case<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:52.020> are

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
aggressive recon players in case you are

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.569 
aggressive recon players in case you are
already<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.619> little<00:01:52.860> bit<00:01:52.979> skilled<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
already a little bit skilled and that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.859 
already a little bit skilled and that
was<00:01:53.670> before<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.970> had<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> feeling<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.570> they

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
was before I had the feeling that they

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
was before I had the feeling that they
kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> wanted<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.950> make<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.430> bit

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
kind of wanted to make it a little bit

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
kind of wanted to make it a little bit

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.970 
them and what I think about them and
also<00:02:37.150> how<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.540> think<00:02:38.049> they<00:02:38.200> should<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.620> balanced

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
also how I think they should be balanced

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.670 
also how I think they should be balanced
or<00:02:39.190> how<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:40.150> rule<00:02:40.329> should<00:02:40.569> nerf<00:02:40.900> them<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.379> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
or how this rule should nerf them in the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.860 
or how this rule should nerf them in the
final<00:02:42.489> release<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.910> hardline<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:43.540> again

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
final release of hardline but again

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.690 
final release of hardline but again
that's<00:02:44.079> something<00:02:44.170> for<00:02:44.349> next<00:02:44.590> video<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.579> also

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
that's something for next video and also

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.250 
that's something for next video and also
something<00:02:45.970> else<00:02:46.180> would<00:02:46.420> be<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.840> golden

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
something else would be the golden

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.229 
something else would be the golden
sniper<00:02:47.650> video<00:02:48.040> which<00:02:48.310> actually<00:02:48.609> Frank<00:02:49.120> you
