door that is used to make pies and so

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.359 
door that is used to make pies and so

flour on top of all the ingredients mix
the<00:02:21.090> flour<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.830> here<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> tip<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.239> don't

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
the flour so here is the tip you don't

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.449 
the flour so here is the tip you don't
want<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.930> over<00:02:25.230> mix<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.650> dough<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.280> if

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
want to over mix this dough because if

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.550 
want to over mix this dough because if
you<00:02:26.610> over<00:02:27.060> mix<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.510> when<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.930> bakes<00:02:28.170> it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
you over mix it when it bakes it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.070 
you over mix it when it bakes it
retracts<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.489> become<00:02:29.819> smaller<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.780> just

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
retracts and become smaller so you just

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.990 
retracts and become smaller so you just
want<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.470> ingredients<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.220> form<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.580> ball<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
want the ingredients to form a ball and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.330 
want the ingredients to form a ball and
that's<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.440> make<00:02:34.620> sure<00:02:34.860> all<00:02:35.099> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that's it so just make sure all the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.170 
that's it so just make sure all the
ingredients<00:02:35.580> are<00:02:36.209> integrated<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:38.060> form<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
ingredients are integrated and form a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.250 
ingredients are integrated and form a
ball<00:02:40.010> but<00:02:41.010> don't<00:02:41.250> need<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.549> too<00:02:41.760> much<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.299> here

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
like this okay and I'm going to press it

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.159 
like this okay and I'm going to press it
with<00:05:10.520> my<00:05:10.730> fingers<00:05:11.150> a<00:05:11.180> little<00:05:11.480> bit<00:05:11.660> and<00:05:14.169> because

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
with my fingers a little bit and because

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.670 
with my fingers a little bit and because
the<00:05:15.290> edges<00:05:15.740> are<00:05:16.240> already<00:05:17.240> sharp<00:05:17.600> it's<00:05:18.380> very

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
the edges are already sharp it's very

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.310 
the edges are already sharp it's very
easy<00:05:18.890> if<00:05:19.220> I<00:05:19.340> work<00:05:19.520> my<00:05:19.550> pain<00:05:20.000> around<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:21.080> will

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
easy if I work my pain around it it will

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.070 
easy if I work my pain around it it will
just<00:05:21.560> cut<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:23.030> do<00:05:23.390> I<00:05:23.450> need<00:05:25.690> so<00:05:26.690> I'll<00:05:26.930> just

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
just cut the do I need so I'll just

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.830 
just cut the do I need so I'll just
place<00:05:27.440> it<00:05:27.470> like<00:05:27.710> this<00:05:27.770> however<00:05:28.610> because<00:05:29.390> this

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
place it like this however because this

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.530 
place it like this however because this
dough<00:05:30.080> shrinks<00:05:30.740> when<00:05:30.890> it<00:05:30.950> um

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
dough shrinks when it um

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.870 
dough shrinks when it um
bakes<00:05:33.020> I'm<00:05:33.410> going<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:33.950> add<00:05:34.130> a<00:05:34.370> little<00:05:34.550> bit<00:05:34.760> of

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
bakes I'm going to add a little bit of

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.909 
bakes I'm going to add a little bit of
dough<00:05:35.120> around<00:05:35.330> here<00:05:35.780> because<00:05:36.140> we<00:05:36.470> need<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:36.740> put

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
dough around here because we need to put

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.640 
dough around here because we need to put
it<00:05:37.040> over<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:38.240> edge<00:05:38.419> a<00:05:38.450> little<00:05:38.990> bit<00:05:39.140> so<00:05:39.440> I'm

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
it over the edge a little bit so I'm

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:48.989 
it over the edge a little bit so I'm
just<00:05:39.830> going<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.160> patch<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.960> like<00:05:41.960> this

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:48.999 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:53.919 

and<00:05:49.999> here<00:05:50.629> my<00:05:50.869> mold<00:05:51.110> is<00:05:51.259> ready<00:05:52.569> after<00:05:53.569> I<00:05:53.629> shaved

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:53.929 
and here my mold is ready after I shaved

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:57.129 
and here my mold is ready after I shaved
my<00:05:54.050> dough<00:05:54.259> I'm<00:05:54.740> going<00:05:55.490> to<00:05:55.819> pierce<00:05:56.629> it<00:05:56.869> with<00:05:57.110> a

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
my dough I'm going to pierce it with a

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.189 
my dough I'm going to pierce it with a
fork<00:05:57.529> and<00:05:58.149> we<00:05:59.149> do<00:05:59.300> this<00:05:59.509> because<00:05:59.719> when<00:06:00.080> you

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
fork and we do this because when you

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.169 
fork and we do this because when you
base<00:06:00.409> we<00:06:00.619> don't<00:06:00.830> want<00:06:01.009> it<00:06:01.129> to<00:06:01.249> inflate<00:06:01.699> right

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:02.179 
base we don't want it to inflate right

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.459 
base we don't want it to inflate right
so<00:06:02.959> you<00:06:03.619> just<00:06:03.649> purse<00:06:04.580> it<00:06:04.849> everywhere<00:06:05.689> even<00:06:05.959> the

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 
so you just purse it everywhere even the

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:10.629 
so you just purse it everywhere even the
edges<00:06:07.569> like<00:06:08.569> this<00:06:08.869> if<00:06:09.110> you're<00:06:09.709> making<00:06:09.889> a<00:06:10.129> big

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
edges like this if you're making a big

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.559 
edges like this if you're making a big
pie<00:06:10.879> crust

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
pie crust

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.230 
pie crust
you<00:06:12.080> should<00:06:12.409> pierce<00:06:12.800> it<00:06:13.069> but<00:06:13.399> also<00:06:13.639> you<00:06:13.879> should

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
you should pierce it but also you should

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.769 
you should pierce it but also you should
put<00:06:15.229> it<00:06:15.439> in<00:06:15.529> the<00:06:15.860> middle<00:06:16.039> partially<00:06:16.939> paper<00:06:17.209> and

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
put it in the middle partially paper and

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.799 
put it in the middle partially paper and
on<00:06:18.110> top<00:06:18.379> of<00:06:18.409> it<00:06:18.770> games<00:06:19.249> before<00:06:19.939> baking<00:06:20.360> it's

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:20.809 
on top of it games before baking it's

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.199 
on top of it games before baking it's
because<00:06:21.409> this<00:06:21.529> way<00:06:21.740> we<00:06:21.769> add<00:06:22.129> weight<00:06:22.490> on<00:06:22.819> the

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.209 
because this way we add weight on the

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:25.239 
because this way we add weight on the
center<00:06:23.569> of<00:06:23.779> the<00:06:23.899> pie<00:06:24.110> before<00:06:24.769> we<00:06:24.860> bake<00:06:25.039> it

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:25.249 
center of the pie before we bake it

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:28.029 
center of the pie before we bake it
because<00:06:25.939> these<00:06:26.179> are<00:06:26.389> small<00:06:26.809> I<00:06:27.169> don't<00:06:27.199> have<00:06:27.860> to

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
because these are small I don't have to

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:29.859 
because these are small I don't have to
do<00:06:28.189> this<00:06:28.339> I<00:06:28.519> only<00:06:28.759> need<00:06:28.999> to<00:06:29.149> pierce<00:06:29.449> the<00:06:29.659> pie

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:29.869 
do this I only need to pierce the pie

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:32.579 
do this I only need to pierce the pie
okay

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:32.589 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.600 

place<00:06:33.589> the<00:06:33.769> dough<00:06:33.919> in<00:06:33.949> the<00:06:34.069> fridge<00:06:34.159> for<00:06:34.369> 30

place the dough in the fridge for 30

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.809 
place the dough in the fridge for 30
minutes<00:06:35.179> before<00:06:35.809> baking<00:06:35.959> it

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:36.819 
minutes before baking it

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.429 
minutes before baking it
