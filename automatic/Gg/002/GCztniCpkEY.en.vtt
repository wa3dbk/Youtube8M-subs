you guys how to do a prusik knot to put
your<00:00:28.830> tarp<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.480> it's<00:00:30.480> probably<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:32.420> most

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
your tarp up it's probably the most

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.069 
your tarp up it's probably the most
badass<00:00:34.489> not<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.360> next<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.750> maybe<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
badass not out there next to maybe the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
badass not out there next to maybe the
news<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.520> know<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> news

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
news because that one you know the news

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.160 
news because that one you know the news
does<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.500> alright<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:42.629> could<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.840> string

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
does so alright so they could be string

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.549 
does so alright so they could be string
I<00:00:43.430> already<00:00:44.430> got<00:00:44.610> my<00:00:44.670> ridgeline<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.559> just

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
I already got my ridgeline up just

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
I already got my ridgeline up just
strung<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.920> between<00:00:47.129> two<00:00:47.340> trees<00:00:47.520> tighten<00:00:48.390> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
strung that between two trees tighten it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.639 
strung that between two trees tighten it
off<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:50.329> ideally<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.660> want<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.930> piece<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.520 

cord<00:00:55.730> that's<00:00:56.730> smaller<00:00:57.210> than<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:58.170> Ridgeline

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
cord that's smaller than your Ridgeline

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.799 
cord that's smaller than your Ridgeline
it'll<00:00:59.280> bite<00:00:59.489> better<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> take<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.800> cord<00:01:02.809> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it'll bite better so take your cord and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.289 
it'll bite better so take your cord and
make<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> called<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.100> prusik<00:01:05.339> loop<00:01:05.790> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
make what is called a prusik loop to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.750 
make what is called a prusik loop to
start<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.950> believe<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.490> also<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
start with or I believe it's also a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.310 
start with or I believe it's also a
necklace<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.780> all<00:01:12.780> you're<00:01:12.990> doing<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
necklace not so all you're doing is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
necklace not so all you're doing is
basically<00:01:13.439> tying<00:01:13.979> two<00:01:14.400> little<00:01:14.670> knots<00:01:17.420> first

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
basically tying two little knots first

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929 
basically tying two little knots first
one<00:01:18.570> goes<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.610> made<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
one goes like that so you just made a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.260 
one goes like that so you just made a
loop<00:01:21.380> with<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.530> regular<00:01:22.890> overhand<00:01:23.189> knot<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
loop with your regular overhand knot and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.840 
loop with your regular overhand knot and
take<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> other<00:01:25.409> pieces<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.430> rest<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
take the other pieces or the rest of the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
take the other pieces or the rest of the
cord<00:01:28.579> run<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> through

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.870 

alright<00:01:42.240> here's<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.360> other<00:01:43.480> not<00:01:44.880> tighten

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
alright here's the other not tighten

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.320 
alright here's the other not tighten
them<00:01:46.000> off<00:01:47.760> now<00:01:48.990> these<00:01:49.990> two<00:01:50.290> knots<00:01:51.180> when<00:01:52.180> you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
them off now these two knots when you

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.600 
them off now these two knots when you
pull<00:01:52.570> on<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.840> tags<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:54.010> can<00:01:54.040> move<00:01:54.310> them<00:01:54.490> in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
pull on the tags you can move them in

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.890 
pull on the tags you can move them in
towards<00:01:54.910> each<00:01:55.000> other<00:01:55.210> make<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.260> loop<00:01:56.410> bigger

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.110 

you<00:02:01.900> grab<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.230> right<00:02:02.380> side<00:02:02.590> or<00:02:02.860> make<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.000> loop

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
you grab the right side or make the loop

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.650 
you grab the right side or make the loop
smaller<00:02:07.770> okay<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.149> going<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.450> leave<00:02:10.630> it

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
smaller okay I'm just going to leave it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.590 
smaller okay I'm just going to leave it
big<00:02:10.960> right<00:02:10.990> now<00:02:14.700> all<00:02:15.700> nice<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.150> tight<00:02:16.300> on<00:02:16.450> each

that cool for a second all right you got
your<00:02:44.520> preso<00:02:44.730> gloop<00:02:45.290> I'm<00:02:46.290> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> take<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.710> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
your preso gloop I'm going to take it to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.010 
your preso gloop I'm going to take it to
your<00:02:46.920> ridge<00:02:47.070> line<00:02:47.690> you're<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> go

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
your ridge line you're going to go

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.690 
your ridge line you're going to go
around<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.440> ridge<00:02:49.590> line<00:02:49.830> three<00:02:50.190> times<00:02:50.220> with

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
around the ridge line three times with

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.630 
around the ridge line three times with
it<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.000> keep<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.210> knot<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.810> middle<00:02:52.640> so

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it and keep the knot in the middle so

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:06.680 
it and keep the knot in the middle so
you<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.820> one<00:02:59.000> two<00:03:02.330> three<00:03:04.790> pull<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.970> down<00:03:06.210> keep

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
you go one two three pull it down keep

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.280 
you go one two three pull it down keep
the<00:03:06.840> knot<00:03:06.990> in<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.200> middle<00:03:08.780> pull<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.900> down<00:03:10.080> like

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
the knot in the middle pull it down like

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.400 
the knot in the middle pull it down like
this<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.450> should<00:03:12.870> have<00:03:12.900> something<00:03:13.260> that

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
this so you should have something that

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.400 
this so you should have something that
looks<00:03:13.530> exactly<00:03:14.100> like<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:15.020> if<00:03:16.020> you've<00:03:16.260> done

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
looks exactly like that if you've done

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.990 
looks exactly like that if you've done
it<00:03:16.470> right<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.100> got<00:03:17.220> one<00:03:17.430> two<00:03:17.580> three<00:03:17.850> humps

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
it right so you got one two three humps

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.510 
it right so you got one two three humps
