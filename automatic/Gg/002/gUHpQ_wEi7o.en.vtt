00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.140
 let's do 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.290
 pirate cake pops you see we have had 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.420
 white chocolate we have repeated and now 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.820
 we are going to take a few drops of black 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.300
 so that they are a bit color like 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.300
 dark 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.470
 well then we will be with a color 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.240
 like tan a flesh color pulling 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.750
 Moreno now let's do our 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.710
 balls as always 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.260
 we take mass we make the ball and the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.260
 let's put in a tray that 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.270
 We will put the refrigerator now see 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.130
 we are making different balls 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.410
 we make by hand and we leave it to put 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.080
 to the refrigerator before putting them in 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.260
 refrigerator I like to make them the 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.960
 little hole that we will fill with 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.199
 chocolate because I do it now because the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.590
 mass is squishy and if not now I 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.990
 allows mold well and if not then I 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.149
 would break good now we have 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.149
 taken in the fridge you see and we are 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.970
 sticking the chocolate stick in the 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.700
 little hole we had made before we go 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.860
 putting all the sticks 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.219
 when this is hardened then 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.219
 we will give the first chocolate capital 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.400
 Well now what we are doing 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 once it has hardened 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.710
 chocolate that we have put on the stick 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.409
 is we take two by two the cake pops 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.060
 we are giving it another shape every time 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.490
 What do we do? 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.899
 chocolate we have chocolate when 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.240
 We will join the ones it has 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.560
 that being almost cold the hotter 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.500
 is more difficult and more or less is 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.030
 for then if we want more 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.130
 or paquito has to be chocolate 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.770
 colder so that it works worse but 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.140
 well we see you put together the cake 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.399
 pops two by two we take care of 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.679
 that in the part of the stick is 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.009
 totally covered the chocolate because 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.539
 if not then there fat falls and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.790
 We now see a small 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.590
 taps so that the remainder of the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.440
 chocolate fall at once 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.420
 spinning and we are bringing as towards me 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.690
 so that it falls on the bottom 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.989
 all these are going to be pirates and 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.640
 let's cover half of them with a hat 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.019
 then there 's a bit like like this the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.920
 back because then it will go 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.959
 covered 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.000
 once covered what we do is 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.040
 prick our cork on a cork 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.590
 well now we need red then 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.190
 we take dye for red chocolate 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.510
 beige and we cast on top of this in order to 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.510
 beads was a dark color 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.500
 and we mix we want to get a vote 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.500
 very rich 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.850
 now we are putting our 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.520
 different cake pops in chocolate 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.530
 red we only have half that is going to be 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.510
 the pirate cap we have half 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.310
 and let it dry and we are having all 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.720
 we have just what is half the 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.260
 back side 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.300
 Well let's finish off our pirates 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.120
 You see, we take a pirate, we're going to put him 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.770
 first as a corner here in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.320
 the hat as if they were the peaks of 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.120
 handkerchief then to paste we're going to 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.890
 do it with fondant to paste what 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.750
 we do is put some chocolate 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.360
 chocolate liquid and fondant paste 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.730
 better with a little good chocolate 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.890
 so we make some red fondant and 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.890
 as if they were the peaks of the handkerchief 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.930
 and now we finish let's make the eye 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.670
 also with fondant but in this case 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.590
 black the eye of the patch see if we see 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.660
 that chocolate bounces 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.120
 so what we have to do is 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.110
 stick it with chocolate 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.110
 seems to have endured 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.590
 and now we are going to do 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.010
 a bit with black fondant also the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.770
 beard and well this one does not want then 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.200
 we take a little chocolate and we put 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.200
 a tad 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.060
 let's make a beard 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.310
 of beige black fondant 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.310
 as well as finished in tip and a mustache 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.539
 we have already put the mustache 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.580
 beard and the patch and the only thing that we 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:47.349
 is to finish the other eye with a little 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.659
 edible marker we are going to do 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.780
 here the patch tape and polka dots 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.610
 blacks in the hat 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.070
 well, they have not stayed in our 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:02.790
 pirates each one is different from the other 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.790
 because they are all manual but very cool
