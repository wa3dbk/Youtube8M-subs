00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.520 

as<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:40.050> can<00:04:40.170> see<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:41.640> want<00:04:41.940> your<00:04:42.840> dough<00:04:43.110> to

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
as you can see you want your dough to

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.260 
as you can see you want your dough to
still<00:04:43.770> have<00:04:44.010> those<00:04:44.190> marks<00:04:44.730> around<00:04:45.030> because

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
still have those marks around because

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.780 
still have those marks around because
this<00:04:45.510> helps<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.500> your<00:04:46.800> dough<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.400> actually

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
this helps in your dough to actually

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.910 
this helps in your dough to actually
rise<00:04:48.420> if<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.140> actually<00:04:49.260> twist<00:04:49.680> it<00:04:49.860> around

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
rise if you actually twist it around

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.830 
rise if you actually twist it around
you're<00:04:50.460> gonna<00:04:50.580> cover<00:04:50.880> all<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:51.420> up<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:51.690> your

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
you're gonna cover all that up and your

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.440 
you're gonna cover all that up and your
door<00:04:51.990> is<00:04:52.080> actually<00:04:52.200> not<00:04:52.470> gonna<00:04:52.590> rise<00:04:52.800> properly

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
door is actually not gonna rise properly

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.270 
door is actually not gonna rise properly
so<00:04:54.450> a<00:04:54.780> place<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.170> fix<00:04:55.290> onto<00:04:55.590> my<00:04:55.680> baking<00:04:55.860> tray

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
so a place to fix onto my baking tray

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.250 
so a place to fix onto my baking tray
and<00:04:56.610> I've<00:04:57.210> kept<00:04:57.480> them<00:04:57.570> spaced<00:04:57.930> because

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
and I've kept them spaced because

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.360 
and I've kept them spaced because
they're<00:04:58.380> going<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.680> rise<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:59.130> they're<00:04:59.280> going

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
they're going to rise and they're going

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.710 
they're going to rise and they're going
to<00:04:59.550> grow<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.030> when<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:00.240> happens<00:05:00.600> I<00:05:00.690> don't

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
to grow and when that happens I don't

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.810 
to grow and when that happens I don't
want<00:05:01.050> everything<00:05:01.920> forming<00:05:02.250> into<00:05:02.340> one<00:05:02.550> massive

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
want everything forming into one massive

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.160 
want everything forming into one massive
scone

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
scone

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.040 
scone
i<00:05:04.230> brushed<00:05:04.920> in<00:05:05.130> with<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.310> bit<00:05:05.460> of<00:05:05.540> full<00:05:06.540> cream

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
i brushed in with a bit of full cream

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.350 
i brushed in with a bit of full cream
milk<00:05:07.260> because<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.710> wanted<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.100> bit<00:05:08.250> of<00:05:08.340> color<00:05:09.270> on

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
milk because I wanted a bit of color on

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.690 
milk because I wanted a bit of color on
the<00:05:09.510> top<00:05:09.690> of<00:05:09.840> my<00:05:09.930> scones<00:05:10.260> pop<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.370> into<00:05:11.550> your

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
the top of my scones pop it into your

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.170 
the top of my scones pop it into your
oven<00:05:12.540> for<00:05:13.110> 10<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.590> 12<00:05:13.800> minutes<00:05:13.890> mine's<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.970> fan

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
oven for 10 to 12 minutes mine's a fan

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.710 
oven for 10 to 12 minutes mine's a fan
for<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:15.810> that's<00:05:15.930> 200<00:05:16.770> degree<00:05:17.040> centigrade<00:05:17.720> and

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
for so that's 200 degree centigrade and

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.920 
for so that's 200 degree centigrade and
if<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.710> have<00:05:19.890> a<00:05:19.920> normal<00:05:20.340> one<00:05:20.580> just<00:05:21.420> put<00:05:21.750> it<00:05:21.840> in

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
if you have a normal one just put it in

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.590 
if you have a normal one just put it in
from<00:05:22.290> 220<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.550> around<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.120> same<00:05:24.360> time

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
from 220 and around the same time

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.290 
from 220 and around the same time
probably<00:05:24.990> 10<00:05:25.290> minutes<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:26.430> most<00:05:26.970> phones<00:05:27.180> are

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
probably 10 minutes so most phones are

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.230 
probably 10 minutes so most phones are
out<00:05:27.450> now<00:05:27.480> I<00:05:28.190> kept<00:05:29.190> in<00:05:29.310> for<00:05:29.490> 10<00:05:29.640> minutes<00:05:29.940> first

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
out now I kept in for 10 minutes first

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.120 
out now I kept in for 10 minutes first
and<00:05:30.720> then<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.200> realized<00:05:31.590> probably<00:05:31.860> need

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
and then I realized probably need

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.860 
and then I realized probably need
another<00:05:32.250> minute<00:05:32.580> or<00:05:32.910> two<00:05:33.270> so<00:05:33.300> I<00:05:33.480> left<00:05:33.660> him<00:05:33.810> for

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
another minute or two so I left him for

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.040 
another minute or two so I left him for
like<00:05:34.170> 11<00:05:34.560> minutes<00:05:34.730> so<00:05:35.730> a<00:05:36.000> perfect<00:05:36.420> score<00:05:36.660> a

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
like 11 minutes so a perfect score a

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.670 
like 11 minutes so a perfect score a
perfect<00:05:37.740> con<00:05:38.220> should<00:05:38.760> have<00:05:39.030> that<00:05:39.690> line<00:05:40.380> all

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
perfect con should have that line all

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.060 
perfect con should have that line all
around<00:05:40.950> it<00:05:41.630> where<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.720> can<00:05:42.840> actually<00:05:43.070> split

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
around it where you can actually split

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.690 
around it where you can actually split
it<00:05:44.250> open<00:05:44.810> put<00:05:45.810> your<00:05:46.020> cream<00:05:46.500> put<00:05:47.250> your<00:05:47.430> jam

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
it open put your cream put your jam

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.900 
it open put your cream put your jam
