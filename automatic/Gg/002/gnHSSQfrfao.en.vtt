think you get it but you always should

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.749 
think you get it but you always should
should<00:01:31.350> start<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.890> general<00:01:32.340> section

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
should start with the general section

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.060 
should start with the general section
where<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> put<00:01:33.479> some<00:01:33.750> organizational<00:01:34.740> stuff

where you put some organizational stuff

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.730 
where you put some organizational stuff

around your studies in first for example

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.140

like the class schedule you have and

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.200

can use the pen and add some things here
or<00:02:12.630> delete<00:02:13.590> them<00:02:13.770> it's<00:02:14.069> very<00:02:14.370> cool<00:02:14.850> when<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
or delete them it's very cool when you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.840 
or delete them it's very cool when you
use<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.350> tablet<00:02:16.709> PC<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.520> it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
use it on a tablet PC because it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.750 
use it on a tablet PC because it
depletes<00:02:18.090> fun<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.680> do<00:02:19.830> some<00:02:20.069> error<00:02:20.280> it's

depletes fun if you do some error it's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640 
depletes fun if you do some error it's
just<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.270> click<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.630> your<00:02:21.930> error<00:02:22.140> as<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> way

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
just one click and your error as a way

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.430 
just one click and your error as a way
and<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:24.150> should<00:02:24.300> do<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> or<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.020> could<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.350> it

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
and you should do it or you could do it

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.290 
and you should do it or you could do it
like<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.650> instead<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.489> printing<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.090> for

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
like that instead of printing it for

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.440 
like that instead of printing it for
example<00:02:27.780> because<00:02:28.110> printer<00:02:28.890> paper<00:02:29.040> really

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
example because printer paper really

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.320 
example because printer paper really
sucks<00:02:30.450> quite<00:02:31.319> frankly<00:02:32.030> another<00:02:33.030> cool<00:02:33.300> thing

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
sucks quite frankly another cool thing

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.180 
sucks quite frankly another cool thing
most<00:02:33.930> people<00:02:34.230> don't<00:02:34.350> know<00:02:34.590> when<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.890> do<00:02:35.040> this

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
most people don't know when you do this

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.900 
most people don't know when you do this
like<00:02:35.430> I'm<00:02:35.670> doing<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:37.430> one<00:02:38.430> note<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.850> the

handwriting is searchable so for example

when<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.280> look<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.670> strategy<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:49.850> paper

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
when I look for strategy on this paper

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.500 
when I look for strategy on this paper
what<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.569> can<00:02:51.720> see<00:02:51.959> here<00:02:51.989> 16<00:02:52.890> search<00:02:53.790> results

what we can see here 16 search results

what we can see here 16 search results
and<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:55.290> also<00:02:55.620> moves<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.459> another

and this also moves and it's another

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.759 
and this also moves and it's another
cool<00:02:57.300> feature<00:02:57.540> about<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.230> most<00:02:58.440> people

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
cool feature about one of most people

cool feature about one of most people
don't<00:02:58.980> know<00:02:59.130> when<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.819> print<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.239> presentation

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
don't know when you print a presentation

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.250 
don't know when you print a presentation
to<00:03:01.019> OneNote<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.610> text<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.569> this<00:03:03.810> presentation

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
to OneNote the text in this presentation

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 
to OneNote the text in this presentation
or<00:03:04.650> even<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.130> pictures<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.970> searchable

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
or even in pictures is searchable

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.050 
or even in pictures is searchable
because<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:07.319> is<00:03:07.440> an<00:03:07.530> OCR<00:03:07.920> integrated<00:03:08.760> into

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
because there is an OCR integrated into

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.330 
because there is an OCR integrated into
OneNote<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.170> can<00:03:10.350> browse<00:03:10.650> through<00:03:10.920> it

OneNote and you can browse through it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.680 
OneNote and you can browse through it
and<00:03:13.070> show<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> different<00:03:14.610> strategies<00:03:15.209> it

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
and show the different strategies it

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.569 
and show the different strategies it
found<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.650> really<00:03:16.950> cool<00:03:17.390> then

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
found and this is really cool then

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.539 
found and this is really cool then
another<00:03:20.579> tip<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.360> me<00:03:21.570> is<00:03:22.070> organized<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.459> a

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
another tip for me is organized on a

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.300 
another tip for me is organized on a
chronical<00:03:24.269> base<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.560> means<00:03:25.829> this<00:03:26.100> was

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
chronical base so this means this was

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.759 
chronical base so this means this was
lecture<00:03:26.820> number<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.690> when<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.200> go<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.590> little

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
lecture number one when I go a little

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.860 
lecture number one when I go a little
bit<00:03:28.950> down<00:03:29.310> here<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.850> my<00:03:30.000> mouse<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.480> find

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
bit down here with my mouse I find

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.940 
bit down here with my mouse I find
lecture<00:03:31.320> lecture<00:03:31.739> number<00:03:31.950> 2<00:03:32.459> 3<00:03:33.329> etc<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:34.290> then

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
lecture lecture number 2 3 etc and then

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.800 
lecture lecture number 2 3 etc and then
again<00:03:35.250> another<00:03:35.790> feature<00:03:36.120> most<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.660> people

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
again another feature most of the people

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.930 
again another feature most of the people
still<00:03:37.170> know<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.799> in<00:03:38.040> OneNote<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.700> can

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
still know is that in OneNote you can

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.479 
still know is that in OneNote you can
organize<00:03:39.480> your<00:03:39.540> pages<00:03:40.019> again<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.310> make<00:03:41.459> it

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
organize your pages again to make it

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.310

active<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.239> have<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.420> better<00:03:42.600> overview<00:03:43.019> for

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
active to have a better overview for

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.590 
active to have a better overview for
example<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.010> can<00:03:44.340> expand<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.000> collapse<00:03:45.150> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
example so I can expand and collapse the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.860 
example so I can expand and collapse the
view<00:03:45.810> here<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:47.250> Mbah<00:03:48.030> worth<00:03:48.450> basically

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
view here so the Mbah worth basically

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.640 
view here so the Mbah worth basically
three<00:03:49.470> weeks<00:03:49.680> three<00:03:50.220> weeks<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.780> strategy

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
three weeks three weeks in strategy

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.370 
three weeks three weeks in strategy
which<00:03:53.040> means<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.420> block<00:03:54.750> number<00:03:54.780> one

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
which means this one is block number one

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.699 
which means this one is block number one
overview<00:03:56.310> block<00:03:57.150> number<00:03:57.510> two<00:03:57.750> overview<00:03:58.410> and

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
tip for this short video is when you

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.960 
tip for this short video is when you
work<00:04:30.139> or<00:04:30.500> when<00:04:30.830> you<00:04:30.889> have<00:04:31.009> a<00:04:31.070> group<00:04:31.340> work<00:04:31.639> you

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
work or when you have a group work you

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.480 
work or when you have a group work you
probably<00:04:32.270> should<00:04:32.780> generate<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.530> notebook<00:04:34.460> just

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
probably should generate a notebook just

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.150 
probably should generate a notebook just
for<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.090> group<00:04:35.300> work<00:04:35.600> like<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.169> did<00:04:36.380> here<00:04:36.680> in

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
for that group work like I did here in

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.629 
for that group work like I did here in
this<00:04:37.400> case<00:04:37.759> for<00:04:37.789> example<00:04:38.560> where<00:04:39.560> I<00:04:39.590> put<00:04:39.949> all

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
this case for example where I put all

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.540 
this case for example where I put all
stuff<00:04:41.270> we<00:04:41.570> worked<00:04:41.840> together<00:04:42.199> on<00:04:42.650> as<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:42.949> team<00:04:43.310> in

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
stuff we worked together on as a team in

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.670 
stuff we worked together on as a team in
one<00:04:44.090> notebook<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.080> cool<00:04:45.320> thing<00:04:45.350> about

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
one notebook and the cool thing about

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.379 
one notebook and the cool thing about
this<00:04:46.039> is<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:46.610> can<00:04:46.789> share<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.090> notebook

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
this is that you can share a notebook

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.270 
this is that you can share a notebook
with<00:04:47.750> other<00:04:47.930> people<00:04:48.380> work<00:04:48.590> with<00:04:48.949> you<00:04:49.100> together

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
with other people work with you together

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.170 
with other people work with you together
so<00:04:49.789> this<00:04:50.000> means<00:04:50.240> nobody<00:04:51.050> can<00:04:51.520> say<00:04:52.520> oh<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:52.789> didn't

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
so this means nobody can say oh I didn't

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.360 
so this means nobody can say oh I didn't
cut<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.449> material<00:04:53.600> because<00:04:54.350> it's<00:04:54.680> all<00:04:54.889> saved

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
cut the material because it's all saved

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.219 
cut the material because it's all saved
in<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.639> cloud<00:04:55.789> I<00:04:56.210> use<00:04:56.419> onedrive<00:04:56.810> for<00:04:57.110> it

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
in the cloud I use onedrive for it

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.890 
in the cloud I use onedrive for it
because<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.800> really<00:04:58.160> works<00:04:58.669> best<00:04:59.270> with

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
because it really works best with

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.870 
because it really works best with
OneNote<00:05:00.229> together<00:05:00.860> because<00:05:01.400> it's<00:05:01.639> from<00:05:01.850> the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
OneNote together because it's from the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.680 
OneNote together because it's from the
same<00:05:02.090> manufacturer<00:05:02.539> I<00:05:02.840> think<00:05:03.199> haha<00:05:04.180> ok<00:05:05.180> yeah

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
same manufacturer I think haha ok yeah

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.860 
same manufacturer I think haha ok yeah
