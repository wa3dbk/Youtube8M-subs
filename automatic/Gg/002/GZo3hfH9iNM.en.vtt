00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Good day friends max with you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.540
 and today we will talk to you about splash and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.880
 splash we have naturally sven 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.059
 how does passivochka go and have magnus like 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.170
 actively and also we can purchase 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.410
 splash buying radius at the battle fury 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.810
 great cool much more than battle 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.170
 fury but so for example if i hit it 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.119
 a strong son will touch both this and that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.570
 if there is only battle fury battle 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.420
 fury touches only very neighbors it 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.890
 first second main question 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.750
 today is what is the maximum 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.129
 coefficient with porsche we can get 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.399
 and so playing the cliff is written what gives 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 us 65 percent splash 65 percent i 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.079
 checked all the same there 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.719
 plus what's the plus splash in dota goes 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.930
 without any protection resistor at all 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.699
 there is written how much it will hit 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.949
 percent of one hundred and twenty let's say and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.949
 somewhere 90 90 will hit and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.510
 from the battle fury, too, there is something there 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.030
 net damage on the nearby target 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.659
 to this svena protection will be 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.820
 take into account 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 because you hit a unit 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.070
 whose you beat on it goes incomplete 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.710
 before damage you all crisis through protection 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.829
 and the neighboring targets are going full damage 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 Kalasha so now in our inventory 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.420
 lies one battle fury and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.439
 great cliff must be this hundred 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 percent damage that is a hundred feet 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.060
 my God that the bottom of mathematics 142 damage 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.950
 must be done 142 damage she 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.950
 rushing really this young 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.750
 the person next to it will apply less 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:57.210
 and approximately from the splash will cause more 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.969
 one whole 2 tenths now now 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.210
 now now take and 6 battle 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.210
 fury 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.849
 6 battle fury we take 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:16.060
 in fact it turns out 6 to 35 210 and 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:20.680
 plus another 6 5 2 as many as 75 they were evicted 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:27.430
 god 2 as much as 75 damage us pretty 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:31.750
 big eat one hit did go in 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.980
 summary look sven here this one we 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.340
 killed this one here 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.959
 received a total of 2 74 damage due to resist 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.180
 protect the next pig I teach a look cool from 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.010
 six battle fury damage in general everywhere 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.870
 passed from everything and and he passed 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.569
 pure ie 35 percent with batlfuri 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.280
 65 percent with fungi and total 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.049
 the coefficient really turns out we 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.220
 inflicted 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:03:01.660
 the next price we get 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.609
 1282 damage our damage 467 share 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.790
 it turns out 2 point 75 really 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:10.630
 absolutely dota 2 does not lie as much as 75 possible 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.760
 I am good to fill it is convenient now 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:19.599
 another we have done 274 damage to crush 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.590
 and splash damage rate 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.919
 and the damage target is 466 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.120
 have 1282 divided by 275 it turns out 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:33.340
 us all 75 it turns out 466 practically in 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.359
 5 times we do more damage next 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.099
 don't take aim 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:41.880
 which volume is nice it is convenient 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:49.500
 okay, let 's put Magnus on top 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:51.760
 write refresh at magnus power power 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.079
 show 50 percent extra 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:00.239
 completely and that is the coefficient should be 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:04:04.510
 recipe 25 now we will check it so eat 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:08.799
 go again a report caused svenu 300 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:13.750
 damage this time to nearby sven 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:16.530
 1644 damage improved 1644 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.670
 divide by 505 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.850
 509 already damage it will be 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.830
 factor of 3. 25 i.e. again dota 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.020
 not lying and that is if you are at the maximum 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.820
 splash this recipe 25 more than this 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.410
 impossible to get it will be pure 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.410
 fly to fly over the enemy 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.680
 such things we dota and approximately 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:44.030
 green damage rate 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:50.580
 Target main 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:54.620
 impact factor on my god i carry 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.600
 now i am i can say it 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.770
 Splash Damage Ratio 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.070
 and damage by so it turns out about 6 5 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:10.080
 8 that is almost six times 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:13.340
 exceeds the damage on the roof exceeds 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.740
 lesson 6 1 damage than the one you 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.530
 strike striking off a single target 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.060
 my gosh that me with diction excuse my 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:28.200
 dear friends I will swim a little bit 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.520
 Do patters as yet been 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.430
 useful information so let us down 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:38.419
 small amounts of splash news with us 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:41.789
 always clean this is the first second damage 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.680
 there will always be almost more 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.169
 the next goal rather than the one you 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.180
 beat and maximum coefficient which 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:53.310
 can get in dota it's 325 but in 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.620
 Generally it is a blow to the support and all 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.350
 Kerry neighboring also die here such 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.390
 dota us do for now subscribe 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.380
 put the husks bye 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.380
 with you was max or
