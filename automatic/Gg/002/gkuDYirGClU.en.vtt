traffic let's look at some of the
functionality<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.530> interesting<00:01:38.009> here

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
functionality it's very interesting here

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
functionality it's very interesting here
if<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.460> want<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> enter<00:01:38.790> an<00:01:39.000> address<00:01:39.119> things<00:01:39.720> are

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
if I want to enter an address things are

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719 
if I want to enter an address things are
pretty<00:01:40.259> routine<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.369> use<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.670> little

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
pretty routine I can use this little

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
pretty routine I can use this little
wheel<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.869> click<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.380> turn<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
wheel and I can click and turn and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
wheel and I can click and turn and
that's<00:01:44.579> all<00:01:44.909> pretty<00:01:45.149> obvious<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.899> let's<00:01:45.960> say

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that's all pretty obvious but let's say

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.120 
that's all pretty obvious but let's say
I<00:01:46.229> don't<00:01:46.320> want<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> type<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I don't want to type it in with the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.770 
I don't want to type it in with the
click<00:01:47.310> wheel<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.670> want<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> write<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.630> can

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
click wheel I want to write it in I can

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.710 
click wheel I want to write it in I can
do<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> right<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.430> pad<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.240> it'll

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
do that right here on this pad and it'll

proprietary outtie cable I bet it's not

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.940 
proprietary outtie cable I bet it's not
cheap<00:02:35.939> to<00:02:35.969> replace<00:02:36.329> but<00:02:37.049> for<00:02:37.260> example<00:02:37.709> if<00:02:37.859> I

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
cheap to replace but for example if I

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.459 
cheap to replace but for example if I
try<00:02:38.189> and<00:02:38.250> plug<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.609> into<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.879> iPhone<00:02:39.359> 4<00:02:39.719> with

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
something called the Audi parking system

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.440 
something called the Audi parking system
which<00:03:10.829> isn't<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.519> parking<00:03:11.969> system<00:03:12.299> it's

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
which isn't really a parking system it's

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.869 
which isn't really a parking system it's
a<00:03:12.480> rear-view<00:03:12.810> camera<00:03:13.069> which<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.219> nice<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:14.760> it

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
a rear-view camera which is nice but it

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.699 
a rear-view camera which is nice but it
doesn't<00:03:14.909> park<00:03:15.419> the<00:03:15.569> car<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> think<00:03:16.169> in<00:03:16.409> this<00:03:16.500> day

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
doesn't park the car I think in this day

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.199 
doesn't park the car I think in this day
and<00:03:16.859> age<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.010> better<00:03:17.430> park<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> car<00:03:18.150> if

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
and age you better park the car if

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.729 
and age you better park the car if
you're<00:03:18.299> gonna<00:03:18.389> call<00:03:18.659> it<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.840> parking<00:03:19.290> system

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
you're gonna call it a parking system

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.020 
you're gonna call it a parking system
because<00:03:20.040> you're<00:03:20.340> gonna<00:03:20.459> look<00:03:20.669> silly

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
because you're gonna look silly

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.270 
because you're gonna look silly
otherwise<00:03:21.449> what<00:03:22.049> we<00:03:22.169> have<00:03:22.379> though<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.859> nice

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
otherwise what we have though is a nice
