00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
only cost minerals so this is perfect in

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.760 
only cost minerals so this is perfect in
this<00:05:17.180> situation<00:05:17.390> I<00:05:17.600> really<00:05:17.840> as<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.500> cheese

this is good cheese because yeah he's
really<00:05:23.419> maximizing<00:05:24.200> it<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:24.410> he's<00:05:24.620> it's<00:05:24.950> at

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
really maximizing it and he's it's at

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.530 
really maximizing it and he's it's at
this<00:05:25.550> point<00:05:25.700> it's<00:05:25.850> not<00:05:25.880> even<00:05:26.000> we<00:05:26.300> actually

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
this point it's not even we actually

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.909 
this point it's not even we actually
have<00:05:26.660> spine<00:05:26.960> crawlers<00:05:27.260> going<00:05:27.470> down<00:05:27.590> at<00:05:27.800> the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
have spine crawlers going down at the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.200 
have spine crawlers going down at the
zerg<00:05:28.100> space<00:05:28.370> I<00:05:28.610> can<00:05:28.850> see<00:05:28.940> on<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.090> production

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
zerg space I can see on the production

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.480 
zerg space I can see on the production
overlay<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:29.900> that's<00:05:30.110> good<00:05:30.710> too<00:05:31.130> might<00:05:31.310> be<00:05:31.460> a

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
overlay and that's good too might be a

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.219 
overlay and that's good too might be a

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.070 
on his part at this point he's pushing
the<00:05:40.130> creep<00:05:40.340> tom<00:05:40.550> was<00:05:40.729> put<00:05:41.360> creamer<00:05:41.930> that's

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
the creep tom was put creamer that's

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.020 
the creep tom was put creamer that's
great<00:05:42.350> because<00:05:42.530> he<00:05:43.370> can't<00:05:43.580> build<00:05:43.760> bunkers

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
great because he can't build bunkers

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.540 
great because he can't build bunkers
closer<00:05:44.270> he's<00:05:44.960> right<00:05:45.140> now<00:05:45.260> he's<00:05:45.740> sorry<00:05:46.250> I'm<00:05:46.370> I'm

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
talking so much I know it's what I'm

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.480 
talking so much I know it's what I'm
excited<00:05:48.500> he's<00:05:48.620> picky<00:05:48.860> he's<00:05:48.979> piggybacking

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
excited he's picky he's piggybacking

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.980 
excited he's picky he's piggybacking
those<00:05:49.760> bunkers<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.150> he<00:05:50.360> can't<00:05:50.600> piggyback

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
those bunkers and he can't piggyback

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.540 
those bunkers and he can't piggyback
them<00:05:51.169> onto<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:51.620> creep<00:05:51.890> so<00:05:52.070> that's<00:05:52.220> a<00:05:52.310> great

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
them onto the creep so that's a great

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.670 
them onto the creep so that's a great
idea<00:05:52.700> cuz<00:05:53.479> if<00:05:53.690> you're<00:05:53.930> getting<00:05:54.200> proxied<00:05:54.590> with

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
idea cuz if you're getting proxied with

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.110 
idea cuz if you're getting proxied with
something<00:05:54.919> like<00:05:55.100> cannons<00:05:55.580> like<00:05:55.850> we<00:05:55.970> talked

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
something like cannons like we talked

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.580 
something like cannons like we talked
about<00:05:56.210> in<00:05:56.360> last<00:05:56.600> game<00:05:56.780> or<00:05:56.900> bunkers<00:05:57.380> in<00:05:57.410> this

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
about in last game or bunkers in this

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.890 
about in last game or bunkers in this
case<00:05:57.800> put<00:05:58.550> a<00:05:58.580> creep<00:05:58.760> tumor<00:05:59.030> down<00:05:59.150> he<00:05:59.419> can't<00:05:59.660> get

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
case put a creep tumor down he can't get

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.780 
case put a creep tumor down he can't get
closer<00:06:00.110> yeah<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:00.740> he<00:06:00.860> again<00:06:01.340> you<00:06:01.669> know

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
closer yeah and he again you know

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.520 
closer yeah and he again you know
there's<00:06:01.970> no<00:06:02.120> either<00:06:02.330> you<00:06:02.479> cannot<00:06:02.990> econ<00:06:03.320> out<00:06:03.440> of

there's no either you cannot econ out of

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.440 
there's no either you cannot econ out of
this<00:06:03.620> you<00:06:03.770> need<00:06:03.890> to<00:06:03.950> go<00:06:04.100> all<00:06:04.310> in<00:06:04.700> in<00:06:05.240> defense

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
this you need to go all in in defense

finished<00:06:07.729> and<00:06:07.850> we<00:06:07.910> have<00:06:08.030> this<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:09.020> spine

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
finished and we have this the spine

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.400 
finished and we have this the spine
crawlers<00:06:10.160> as<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.400> front<00:06:10.760> yeah<00:06:11.630> i<00:06:11.660> like<00:06:12.020> i<00:06:12.050> like

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
bunker down right there and the thing

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.030 
bunker down right there and the thing
for<00:06:17.870> tearing<00:06:18.140> his<00:06:18.229> galleons<00:06:18.470> just<00:06:18.740> in<00:06:18.860> time

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
for tearing his galleons just in time

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.440 
for tearing his galleons just in time
before<00:06:19.160> the<00:06:19.400> creep<00:06:19.550> takes<00:06:19.760> over<00:06:19.940> at<00:06:20.030> spur<00:06:20.270> fect

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
before the creep takes over at spur fect

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.940 
before the creep takes over at spur fect
time<00:06:20.570> this<00:06:20.720> is<00:06:20.810> a<00:06:20.840> great<00:06:21.200> cheese<00:06:21.440> player<00:06:21.680> and

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
time this is a great cheese player and
