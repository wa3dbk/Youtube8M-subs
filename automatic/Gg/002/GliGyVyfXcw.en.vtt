I<00:00:02.120> I<00:00:03.120> think<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.899> think<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:04.290> important<00:00:04.650> to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
I I think I think it's important to

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.889 
I I think I think it's important to
understand<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:06.060> adjustment<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.779> is

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
understand that the adjustment that is

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.020 
understand that the adjustment that is
happening<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.440> not<00:00:07.470> just<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.040> central<00:00:08.760> banks

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
happening is not just that central banks

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.150 
happening is not just that central banks
fill<00:00:09.240> there<00:00:09.750> was<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> funding<00:00:10.380> gap<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.800> amount

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
fill there was a funding gap the amount

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.100 
fill there was a funding gap the amount
of<00:00:11.340> money<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.090> lent<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.840> amount

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
of money that can be lent and the amount

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.690 
of money that can be lent and the amount
of<00:00:13.259> money<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.559> needed<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.309> borrowed

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
of money that needed to be borrowed

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.170 
of money that needed to be borrowed
there<00:00:15.360> was<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> gap<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:17.160> central<00:00:17.850> banks

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
there was a gap and the central banks

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.179 
there was a gap and the central banks
needed<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.930> come<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.380> help<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.650> fill<00:00:19.890> that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
needed to come in and help to fill that

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.910 
needed to come in and help to fill that
gap<00:00:20.520> what's<00:00:21.390> happened<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> adjustment<00:00:22.740> is

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
gap what's happened in the adjustment is

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.130 
gap what's happened in the adjustment is
that<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> amount<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.180> money<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.930> being

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that the amount of money that is being

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.800 
that the amount of money that is being
lent<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.830> borrowed<00:00:26.250> has<00:00:26.490> fallen<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.119> lot<00:00:27.330> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
lent and borrowed has fallen a lot and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.529 
lent and borrowed has fallen a lot and
with<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.650> depressions<00:00:29.640> essentially<00:00:30.359> have

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
with that depressions essentially have

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
with that depressions essentially have
occurred<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.230> other<00:00:31.439> words<00:00:31.619> depressed

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
occurred in other words depressed

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.880 
occurred in other words depressed
economic<00:00:32.790> conditions<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.320> important<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
economic conditions so it's important to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.660 
economic conditions so it's important to
realize<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.700> when<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.360> back<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.899> normalcy

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
realize that when we go back to normalcy

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
realize that when we go back to normalcy
yet<00:00:38.670> normalcy<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> past<00:00:40.260> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
yet normalcy is not like the past in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.889 
yet normalcy is not like the past in
other<00:00:41.100> words<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.719> those

other words that you can that those

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.690 
other words that you can that those
countries<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.379> spend<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.579> they

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
countries can spend the way that they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.130 
countries can spend the way that they
have<00:00:44.910> spent<00:00:45.180> before<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:47.190> past<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.270> live

other words the fundamental law is when

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900 
other words the fundamental law is when
we<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.530> can't<00:00:58.829> raise<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.340> faster

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
we go that we can't raise that faster

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.049 
we go that we can't raise that faster
than<00:01:00.059> income<00:01:00.420> from<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.789> can't

than income from now on and if we can't

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119 
than income from now on and if we can't
raise<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.300> fast<00:01:03.840> than<00:01:04.140> income<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
raise that fast than income we have to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.039 
raise that fast than income we have to
have<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> low<00:01:05.580> debt<00:01:05.850> growth<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.869> issue

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
have a low debt growth and the issue

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.800 
have a low debt growth and the issue
will<00:01:07.409> come<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.860> productivity<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> shift

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
will come to productivity so the shift

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.350 
will come to productivity so the shift
of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> discussion<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.159> change<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
of the discussion is going to change the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.539 
of the discussion is going to change the
shift<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> discussion<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
shift of the discussion is now going to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
shift of the discussion is now going to
change<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.700> economics<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
change in the economics of how do you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.890 
change in the economics of how do you
become<00:01:19.259> competitive<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.240> competition

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
become competitive and so competition

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.260 
become competitive and so competition
will<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.680> discussion<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.460> that's<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
will be the discussion and that's a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.240 
will be the discussion and that's a
whole<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.600> won't<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.220> are

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
whole I won't go on there but there are

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.289 
whole I won't go on there but there are
clear<00:01:26.729> benchmarks<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.720> discussion<00:01:28.259> about

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
clear benchmarks for discussion about

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.770 
clear benchmarks for discussion about
productivity<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:31.020> product<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.430> out

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
productivity and product you have an out

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
productivity and product you have an out
ultimately<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.259> only<00:01:34.560> spend<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
ultimately you can only spend what you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.940 
ultimately you can only spend what you
produce<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.680> at<00:01:37.829> those

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
produce and so when we look at those

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850 
produce and so when we look at those
countries<00:01:38.280> they're<00:01:39.210> very<00:01:39.689> expensive<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
countries they're very expensive if you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.499 
countries they're very expensive if you
use<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.310> measures<00:01:43.820> literally<00:01:44.820> what<00:01:45.119> does<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
use them measures literally what does it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
use them measures literally what does it
cost<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.110> an<00:01:46.259> educated<00:01:46.829> person<00:01:47.189> what

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
cost to have an educated person what

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.899 
cost to have an educated person what
does<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> cost<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.540> educated<00:01:49.020> person<00:01:49.530> in

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
does it cost of an educated person in

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
does it cost of an educated person in
France<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.240> United<00:01:51.390> States<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.229> China<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
France the United States and China and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.700 
France the United States and China and
other<00:01:53.130> look<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:53.820> those<00:01:54.000> comparisons<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
other look at those comparisons and the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.490 
other look at those comparisons and the
cost<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.369> an<00:01:56.790> educated<00:01:57.270> person<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.049> these

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
cost of an educated person in these

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.880 
cost of an educated person in these
countries<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.990> go<00:02:00.990> through<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.229> numbers<00:02:01.710> is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
countries is go through the numbers is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
countries is go through the numbers is
multiples<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.060> cost<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.570> an<00:02:03.659> educated

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
there be self-sustaining productivity is

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.900 
there be self-sustaining productivity is
going<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.710> be<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> question<00:02:32.100> there<00:02:32.520> are<00:02:32.550> clear

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
going to be the question there are clear

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.420 
going to be the question there are clear
benchmarks<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.780> productivity<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.770> won't<00:02:35.280> go<00:02:35.400> on

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
benchmarks of productivity I won't go on

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.470 
benchmarks of productivity I won't go on
but<00:02:36.390> we<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> list<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.590> those<00:02:37.710> things<00:02:37.950> that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
but we have a list of those things that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.160 
but we have a list of those things that
correlate<00:02:39.480> with<00:02:40.190> 90<00:02:41.190> percent<00:02:41.580> correlation

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
correlate with 90 percent correlation

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.690 
correlate with 90 percent correlation
with<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.410> outcome<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.100> growth<00:02:44.280> rate<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
with the outcome of the growth rate the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.190 
with the outcome of the growth rate the
next<00:02:44.850> 10<00:02:45.150> years<00:02:45.180> they're<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> health

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
next 10 years they're like a health

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.070 
next 10 years they're like a health
index<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.640> look<00:02:47.940> at<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.270> health<00:02:48.600> index

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
index if you look at that health index

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.950 
index if you look at that health index
you<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.290> go<00:02:49.620> down<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.220> compare<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
you can go down that and compare it and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.840 
you can go down that and compare it and
those<00:02:51.960> are<00:02:52.200> going<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.380> be<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.100> drivers

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
those are going to be the drivers

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.000 
those are going to be the drivers
productivity<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.140> debt<00:02:55.350> cycle<00:02:55.890> will

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
productivity because the debt cycle will

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.120 
productivity because the debt cycle will
no<00:02:56.130> longer<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.760> main<00:02:56.910> driver
