certain elements that the developers

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.470 
certain elements that the developers
just<00:02:13.110> didn't<00:02:13.349> think<00:02:13.379> about<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.159> on<00:02:14.970> my<00:02:15.299> first

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
just didn't think about and on my first

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240 
just didn't think about and on my first
player<00:02:15.750> i<00:02:15.930> was<00:02:16.019> wearing<00:02:16.290> dark<00:02:16.590> armor<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.190> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
player i was wearing dark armor and I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.220 
player i was wearing dark armor and I
had<00:02:17.370> both<00:02:17.490> dark<00:02:17.850> weapons<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.810> when<00:02:18.959> he<00:02:19.020> took

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
had both dark weapons so when he took

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.620

the dark weapon off me it was killing me

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.360 
the dark weapon off me it was killing me
because<00:02:22.110> I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
because I

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.430 
because I
have<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.790> full<00:02:22.970> dark<00:02:23.269> set<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.140> didn't

have the full dark set on and I didn't

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.809 
have the full dark set on and I didn't
realize<00:02:24.799> because<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.310> know<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.459> was<00:02:25.610> still

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
realize because you know I was still

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.210 
realize because you know I was still
really<00:02:26.030> new<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.540> game<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.099> like<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.190> I

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
really new to the game and like I I

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.890 
really new to the game and like I I
noticed<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.849> was<00:02:28.879> losing<00:02:29.180> life<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.840> I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
noticed that I was losing life and I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.690 
noticed that I was losing life and I
didn't<00:02:30.230> know<00:02:30.319> why<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.650> couldn't<00:02:31.040> figure<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.489> out

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
didn't know why I couldn't figure it out

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.660 
didn't know why I couldn't figure it out
and<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.480> ended<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:32.870> dying<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.519> all

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
and I ended up dying and it was all

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.670 
and I ended up dying and it was all
because<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.659> game<00:02:35.840> had<00:02:35.989> took<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.290> weapon<00:02:36.590> off

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
because the game had took the weapon off

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.710 
because the game had took the weapon off
me<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:36.980> I'd<00:02:37.099> gone<00:02:37.310> into<00:02:37.640> being<00:02:37.879> you<00:02:38.599> know

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
me and I'd gone into being you know

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.360 
me and I'd gone into being you know
cursed<00:02:39.019> again<00:02:39.379> rather<00:02:39.680> than<00:02:39.829> having<00:02:40.129> that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
cursed again rather than having that

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.880 
cursed again rather than having that

think<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> thought<00:02:45.470> through<00:02:45.680> well<00:02:45.920> enough

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
think the thought through well enough

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.920 
think the thought through well enough
because<00:02:48.519> you<00:02:49.519> know<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.879> caused<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.450> death<00:02:50.659> and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
question on that part it's just why does

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.180 
question on that part it's just why does
it<00:02:56.150> have<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:56.569> neutral<00:02:57.049> state<00:02:57.379> for<00:02:57.890> certain

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
gambler and a really good example is you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.319 
gambler and a really good example is you
can<00:03:03.109> draw<00:03:03.799> your<00:03:04.010> weapon<00:03:04.430> go<00:03:04.730> towards<00:03:05.209> a

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
tripwire that will trigger an event that

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.309 
tripwire that will trigger an event that
leads<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.879> a<00:03:07.909> fight<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.510> then<00:03:08.930> when<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.109> fight

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
leads to a fight and then when the fight

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.190 
leads to a fight and then when the fight
begins<00:03:09.680> you'll<00:03:09.890> have<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> sheathed<00:03:10.370> weapon<00:03:10.819> and

disappointing<00:03:25.730> because<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:27.470> weakest<00:03:27.950> part

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160

of the witcher 2 is the combat by far
everything<00:03:31.220> else<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.609> really<00:03:32.120> stellar<00:03:32.569> but

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.349 
everything else is really stellar but
the<00:03:33.349> combat<00:03:33.709> just<00:03:33.950> isn't<00:03:34.459> at<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.760> same<00:03:35.060> level

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
the combat just isn't at the same level

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.170 
the combat just isn't at the same level
and<00:03:35.750> i<00:03:36.169> really<00:03:36.650> wish<00:03:36.829> it<00:03:36.859> was<00:03:37.190> then<00:03:37.970> i<00:03:38.060> was
