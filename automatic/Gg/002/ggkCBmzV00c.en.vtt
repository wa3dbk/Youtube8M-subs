the officials know about that because

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.180 
the officials know about that because
you<00:00:15.299> know<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.509> fact<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:16.470> can't<00:00:16.830> touch<00:00:17.130> a

the<00:00:18.840> touch<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.949> official<00:00:20.430> thought<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.760> might

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the touch the official thought it might

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.640 
the touch the official thought it might
have<00:00:21.090> been<00:00:21.210> more<00:00:21.420> than<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.320> threw

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
have been more than that and it threw

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730 
have been more than that and it threw
off<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:23.789> Duncan<00:00:24.449> shot<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.019> terms<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.529> him

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
off the Duncan shot in terms of him

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.279 
off the Duncan shot in terms of him
making<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.640> official<00:00:27.060> believe<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
making the official believe that that

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.500 
making the official believe that that
particular<00:00:28.439> touch<00:00:29.160> through<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> balance<00:00:30.359> off

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
particular touch through the balance off

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.569 
particular touch through the balance off
of<00:00:30.689> his<00:00:30.840> shot<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
of his shot and I think it was really a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.970 
of his shot and I think it was really a
fool<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> referee<00:00:33.660> play<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.770> have

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
fool the referee play and when you have

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.350 
fool the referee play and when you have
plays<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.550> no<00:00:35.850> matter<00:00:36.000> where<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.270> are

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
plays like that no matter where they are

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.400 
plays like that no matter where they are
on<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> floor<00:00:36.750> they<00:00:36.960> could<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.170> under<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
on the floor they could be under the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.020 
on the floor they could be under the
hoop<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.160> midcourt<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.910> be

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
hoop that can be at midcourt they can be

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.810 
hoop that can be at midcourt they can be
while<00:00:39.210> you're<00:00:39.239> shooting<00:00:40.070> players<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.579> be

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
while you're shooting players can be

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.610 
while you're shooting players can be
very<00:00:42.059> clever<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:42.989> particular<00:00:43.140> case

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
very clever and in this particular case

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.029 
very clever and in this particular case
Tim<00:00:44.219> Duncan<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:45.180> Lord<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.930> call<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
Tim Duncan really Lord this call and I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.650 
Tim Duncan really Lord this call and I
think<00:00:47.100> that's<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:48.329> an<00:00:48.480> error

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
think that's where we got an error

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.630 
think that's where we got an error
there's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> piece<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.379> there<00:00:49.559> he<00:00:50.219> shoots<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
there's a piece right there he shoots it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.790 
there's a piece right there he shoots it
immediately<00:00:51.030> upon<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> contact<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
immediately upon the contact and it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.229 
immediately upon the contact and it
looks<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.160> more<00:00:53.489> than<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> i'm

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
looks like it's more than that and i'm

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.569 
looks like it's more than that and i'm
not<00:00:54.420> saying<00:00:54.480> exactly<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.680> contact<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
not saying exactly that that contact is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.939 
not saying exactly that that contact is
is<00:00:56.760> not<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.289> bit<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:58.710> you're<00:00:58.829> on

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
is not a little bit more if you're on

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
is not a little bit more if you're on
the<00:00:59.070> floor<00:00:59.340> i<00:00:59.550> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> recognize<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
officials do have the best look at times

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.479 
officials do have the best look at times
on<00:01:03.239> recognizing<00:01:04.140> contact<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.430> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
on recognizing contact but in this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.130

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.940 
three-point shot in this particular case
I<00:03:01.910> think<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.480> contact<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.140> had<00:03:03.590> occurred

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.220 
I think the contact is had occurred
actually<00:03:04.550> before<00:03:04.730> Finley<00:03:05.570> created<00:03:06.110> a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
actually before Finley created a

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.710 
actually before Finley created a
continuation<00:03:07.190> for<00:03:07.489> shooting<00:03:07.820> motion<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.570> we

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
continuation for shooting motion so we

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.240 
continuation for shooting motion so we
probably<00:03:08.989> would<00:03:09.200> have<00:03:09.260> gone<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.739> line<00:03:09.950> for

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
probably would have gone to the line for

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.430 
probably would have gone to the line for
just<00:03:11.060> if<00:03:11.299> they're<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.660> penalty<00:03:11.810> just<00:03:12.290> for

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
just if they're in the penalty just for

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.020 
just if they're in the penalty just for
two<00:03:12.620> maybe<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.250> second<00:03:13.610> shot<00:03:13.790> would<00:03:13.940> have

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
two maybe the second shot would have

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.940 
two maybe the second shot would have
been<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.180> cute<00:03:14.420> one<00:03:14.570> crashing<00:03:15.350> rebound<00:03:15.769> is
