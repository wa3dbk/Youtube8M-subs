00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 we have recently shown tanks on the garden 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.920
 again reported invasion all the time 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.259
 they say that these Russians are constantly 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.920
 Ukraine sends tanks and so on and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.410
 we are sending west military advisers 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.250
 we send military 505 on for fcew under 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.500
 in the name of academy who is doing there 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.920
 sniper rifles gsg-9 lite 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.900
 versions 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 what is this if the Russian sends 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.529
 tanks then we send this 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.630
 and which of us first started this question 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.010
 ask we will not we want to draw 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.649
 your attention on some photos 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.809
 who recently showed on cdf this 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.570
 the collapse of the event chronicles Kiev reports to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 50 Russian tanks and cdf immediately adopted 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.140
 this news and it turned out later that this 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.149
 There were no tanks that were in Ukraine 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.489
 although it was Russian tanks it is true 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.590
 these were Russian tanks since 2009 with 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.750
 Georgia and all this was stolen from the Korean 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 television another news that I 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.949
 read about which reported rider and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.590
 printed spiegel online 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.510
 namely about maneuvers over the atlantic 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.979
 which passenger aircraft had 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.869
 get away from the collision with the Russian 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.820
 military aircraft just unexpected 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.710
 Russian military aircraft appears in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 the sky and the passenger plane have to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.240
 it is interesting to get away from the collision 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.979
 Russian military aircraft was not correct 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.390
 course or at a passenger plane or 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.220
 both flew right course 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.070
 or may even have been apart on 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.600
 a distance of 40 kilometers 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.939
 against otherwise whether it was Russian 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 whether there was a military plane 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.869
 this international air 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.040
 space yes it was there and therefore 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.290
 was not necessarily at all about it 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.079
 report by Russian military aircraft 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.579
 you can be there but that's what me 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.530
 a little surprised at the same time 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.720
 Americans their military aircraft 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.079
 relocated to Germany to Europe and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.509
 no one reported about it and if it reports 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.159
 then not how about the threat shorter if 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.840
 us military aircraft to us 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.649
 relocated is a security measure 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.600
 and not at all a provocation if the American 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.579
 military on the border with Russia in Estonia 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.360
 conduct a parade then this is in this situation 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.520
 not a provocation, but if the Russians 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.320
 sent the plane which is international 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.509
 airspace is flying all this 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.289
 provocation and we have to move away from 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.030
 collisions 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.040
 I don't even know how to react 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.719
 it's just funny people think up 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.489
 anything better if you already want 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.590
 incite then do it a little smarter 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.870
 do it like the Hess Land Television 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.239
 who published in the news 1 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.950
 comment let's hear exactly that 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.170
 the place where the reporter says that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.299
 Ukraine has already visited Russian and 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.799
 then they died of hunger at thirty 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.260
 second thirty third year millions 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:39.209
 people and this is really a direct verbal answer 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.030
 Putin's talking about how cunning he is 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.639
 acts accusing the government and of 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.120
 that it is a portal to the east of the country 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.470
 food disaster 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.950
 says that this form of destruction 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.870
 people given the history of Ukraine under 80 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.989
 years ago Stalin's Russia 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.599
 soviet union millions of ukrainians 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.269
 systematically killed by the famine for this 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.250
 way who says oh Putin is looking for new 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.230
 arguments to continue the war 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.200
 what does the reporter say in this 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.909
 comments years 32 and 33 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.729
 in those years in Ukraine starved to death 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.799
 6 million Ukrainians 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:18.870
 they died of starvation because they had 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.780
 taken away food and grain 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.269
 that grain was taken from them 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.669
 Stalin took him and that's what this 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.829
 comments did not mention it at all 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:32.010
 that Stalin exported this grain 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.470
 abroad and mostly in the us about it 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.079
 then reported the american media there 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.269
 even one movie about this history of advice 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.579
 when i first watched this movie i 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.940
 I thought it was frames from svensson but it 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.859
 there were cadres of 32 33 years and this is a bit 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.419
 mean to compare Ukraine in times 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.459
 Stalin and Ukraine which 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.949
 presumably Putin wants at x so 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.790
 also sometimes we began to compare 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:58.979
 Putin or sometimes Putin with Hitler 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.970
 shorter than Putin, the worst he or Stalin 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:04.979
 either hitler is a very insidious reception i 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.180
 I think that if you already mention that 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.400
 happened in Ukraine 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.870
 that millions of people died of starvation then 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.629
 need to and mention about what became 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.340
 sold out but west in other words we 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.549
 involved in this massacre 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.529
 because the United States then bought this grain but 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.989
 since I started talking about grain there is one 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.460
 interesting news therefore 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.770
 about the connection with the receipt of Ukraine 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.419
 loans from imf so to speak 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.940
 certain indulgences have been made 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.889
 associated with gamow products and therefore 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.229
 firms like monsanto stupidly 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.870
 or bsf now trying large parts 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.380
 Ukraine for yourself open call it 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.419
 here so innocuous until today 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.520
 moment gamma about Ukraine banned 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.259
 just as in Russia, but if 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.419
 near the boundaries dispel it 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.400
 then we can assume that most 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.900
 of these genetically modified foods 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.060
 will spread to the side 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.060
 Moscow and through more towards Europe and 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.550
 this will achieve what in Europe at all 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.319
 don't want it right in the middle of europe it all 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.810
 but it seems to be distributed 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.310
 stupid coincidence that i wanted to show 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.289
 how one-sided our media us 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.210
 inform and want to direct us on 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.830
 wrong way but thank god we don't 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.090
 stupid enough to succumb to it 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.090
 and do our own media
