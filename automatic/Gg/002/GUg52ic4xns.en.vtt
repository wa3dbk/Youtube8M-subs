her engagement ring that she has now and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it's kind of hard to do so because of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.770 
it's kind of hard to do so because of
the<00:00:31.230> setting<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.820> that<00:00:32.820> she<00:00:33.000> kind<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the setting that that she kind of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.180 
the setting that that she kind of
described<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.260> me<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.500> she<00:00:34.649> wanted<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190

described to me that she wanted in the
ring<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.489> made<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.380> you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
ring that I made for so you know it's a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380 
ring that I made for so you know it's a
little<00:00:37.770> bit<00:00:38.010> lower<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.000> harder<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
little bit lower and so it's harder to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
little bit lower and so it's harder to
get<00:00:39.540> another<00:00:39.930> ring<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> fit<00:00:40.559> underneath<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
get another ring to fit underneath it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.639 
get another ring to fit underneath it
without<00:00:41.280> rubbing<00:00:41.550> diamond<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> diamond<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
without rubbing diamond a diamond so

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.850
