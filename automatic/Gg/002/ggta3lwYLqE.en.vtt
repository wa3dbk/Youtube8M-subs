00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
would be like hitting on the 11th fret

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.220 
would be like hitting on the 11th fret
of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.360> g<00:02:21.600> string<00:02:21.630> right<00:02:23.780> then<00:02:24.780> I'm<00:02:24.900> gonna<00:02:24.989> hit

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
middle finger see my middle finger keeps

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.140 
middle finger see my middle finger keeps
going<00:02:37.600> up<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.840> hitting<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.140> g-string<00:02:39.150> just

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
going up and hitting that g-string just

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:52.890 
going up and hitting that g-string just
like<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.720> got<00:02:44.190> promotion<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.810> you

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
want to practice that over and over

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.030 
want to practice that over and over
again<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.110> get<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.350> up<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.740> speed

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
again so you can get that up to speed

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.610 
again so you can get that up to speed

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
right incidentally this is very

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.770 
right incidentally this is very
difficult<00:02:59.860> for<00:03:00.190> me<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.340> do<00:03:00.550> because<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.940> play

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
difficult for me to do because I play

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.290 
difficult for me to do because I play
with<00:03:01.900> three<00:03:02.140> fingers<00:03:02.730> playing<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:03.970> with<00:03:04.150> two

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
with three fingers playing this with two

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.910 
with three fingers playing this with two
fingers<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.840> used<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.290> play<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.530> with<00:03:05.710> three

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
fingers I used to play this with three

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.360 
fingers I used to play this with three
fingers<00:03:06.100> all<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.430> time<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.070> lot<00:03:09.340> easier

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
fingers all the time is a lot easier

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.700 
fingers all the time is a lot easier
because<00:03:09.820> I<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.180> with<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.630> finger<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.560> then

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
because I just with this finger and then

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.380 
because I just with this finger and then
your<00:03:11.920> first<00:03:12.400> finger<00:03:12.550> in<00:03:12.820> your<00:03:12.940> third<00:03:13.150> finger

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
your first finger in your third finger

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.460 
your first finger in your third finger
are<00:03:14.380> there<00:03:14.590> already<00:03:16.020> it's<00:03:17.020> almost<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.440> just

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
are there already it's almost like just

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.160 
are there already it's almost like just
very<00:03:17.860> natural<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.240> know<00:03:19.330> most<00:03:19.720> people<00:03:19.840> play

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
very natural but I know most people play

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.480 
very natural but I know most people play
with<00:03:20.350> two<00:03:20.470> fingers<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:21.040> want<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.280> teach<00:03:21.400> it

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
with two fingers and I want to teach it

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.770 
with two fingers and I want to teach it
like<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:21.910> believe<00:03:22.150> Steve<00:03:22.450> Harris

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
like that and I believe Steve Harris

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.630 
like that and I believe Steve Harris
uses<00:03:23.110> two<00:03:23.290> fingers<00:03:23.680> if<00:03:23.830> I'm<00:03:23.950> not<00:03:24.040> mistaken<00:03:24.460> he

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
uses two fingers if I'm not mistaken he

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.800 
uses two fingers if I'm not mistaken he
looks<00:03:24.850> like<00:03:24.970> he's<00:03:25.150> playing<00:03:25.360> with<00:03:25.450> three<00:03:25.660> but<00:03:25.780> I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
looks like he's playing with three but I

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.400 
looks like he's playing with three but I
believe<00:03:26.170> he<00:03:26.290> uses<00:03:26.590> two<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:29.140> there's<00:03:29.260> good

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
believe he uses two and there's good

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.570 
believe he uses two and there's good
clarity<00:03:29.890> when<00:03:30.040> you're<00:03:30.160> using<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> two

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
clarity when you're using the two

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
gonna hit that three times and go to the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.800

like the 11th fret you're only gonna hit

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:13.699 
like the 11th fret you're only gonna hit
that<00:04:05.489> string<00:04:06.299> once<00:04:06.659> instead<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.140> twice<00:04:12.709> then

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
that string once instead of twice then

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.080 
that string once instead of twice then
you<00:04:13.829> move<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.189> twelfth<00:04:14.639> fret<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.970> then
