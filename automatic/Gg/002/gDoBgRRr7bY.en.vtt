guys over the yugioh 5ds manga volume 9

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.720 
guys over the yugioh 5ds manga volume 9
and<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.470> finally<00:00:16.770> know<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.890> promo<00:00:17.279> card<00:00:17.550> for

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and we finally know the promo card for

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.640 
and we finally know the promo card for
it<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.090> gonna<00:00:18.270> be<00:00:18.390> released<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.930> japan<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
it it's gonna be released in japan on a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.750 
it it's gonna be released in japan on a
June<00:00:20.130> 4th<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.550> 2015<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.350> think<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.340> means

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
June 4th of 2015 so I think that means

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.859 
June 4th of 2015 so I think that means
like<00:00:24.000> we'll<00:00:24.180> probably<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.720> about<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
like we'll probably get it in about a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.480 
like we'll probably get it in about a
year<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.740> think<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.189> usually<00:00:26.460> I

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
year or so I think that's usually I

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.800 
year or so I think that's usually I
think<00:00:26.670> we're<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> year<00:00:27.119> behind<00:00:27.300> most<00:00:27.660> time

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
think we're like a year behind most time

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.529 
think we're like a year behind most time
on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> longest<00:00:28.289> anyway<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> Stardust

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
on the longest anyway we have a Stardust

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.200 
on the longest anyway we have a Stardust
Chronicle<00:00:31.080> spark<00:00:31.380> dragon<00:00:31.949> basically<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> think

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
Chronicle spark dragon basically I think

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
Chronicle spark dragon basically I think
this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.360> supposed<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.500> equivalent<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this is supposed to be the equivalent of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.709 
this is supposed to be the equivalent of
shooting<00:00:35.489> star<00:00:35.700> from<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> anime<00:00:36.360> since<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
shooting star from the anime since the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
shooting star from the anime since the
manga<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.079> course<00:00:37.260> has<00:00:37.440> different<00:00:37.860> versions

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
manga of course has different versions

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.680 
manga of course has different versions
of<00:00:38.309> Stardust's<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> other<00:00:39.300> side<00:00:39.570> are

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of Stardust's and all the other side are

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.690 
of Stardust's and all the other side are
dragons<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.649> believe<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.309> speed<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
dragons so I believe this will speed the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.010 
dragons so I believe this will speed the
equivalent<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> shooting<00:00:42.390> star<00:00:42.570> dragon

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
equivalent to shooting star dragon

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.410 
equivalent to shooting star dragon
anyway<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> light<00:00:44.550> dragon<00:00:44.910> synchro

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
yeah it is a little bit different of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.240 
yeah it is a little bit different of
course<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:16.110> shooting<00:01:16.650> story<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.100> kind<00:01:17.220> of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
course then shooting story it's kind of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
was its name stuff like that but uh you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.149 
was its name stuff like that but uh you
know<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.049> bit<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.770> similar

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
know they were a little bit more similar

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.320 
know they were a little bit more similar
it<00:01:26.340> seems<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.700> one's<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.119> bit

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it seems like this one's a little bit

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.460 
it seems like this one's a little bit
different<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> course<00:01:27.869> from<00:01:28.049> shooting<00:01:28.409> star

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
different of course from shooting star

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
different of course from shooting star
which<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.579> seeing<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:29.939> bit

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
which is good I like seeing a little bit

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.179 
which is good I like seeing a little bit
more<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.720> different<00:01:31.020> card<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> anyway

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
more of a different card in it anyway

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
more of a different card in it anyway
it's<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.549> card<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.299> course<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.869> protect

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it's a card that of course can protect

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.810 
it's a card that of course can protect
itself<00:01:34.619> which<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.920> good<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.369> know<00:01:35.460> they're<00:01:35.729> in

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
itself which is good you know they're in

either<00:01:36.000> player's<00:01:36.329> turn<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.140> banish

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
either player's turn you can just banish

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.569 
either player's turn you can just banish
one<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.770> synchro<00:01:38.070> monsters<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
one your synchro monsters to the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.179 
one your synchro monsters to the
graveyard<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> unaffected<00:01:40.590> by

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
graveyard and then it is unaffected by

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
graveyard and then it is unaffected by
other<00:01:41.729> card<00:01:42.000> effects<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.540> that's<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:43.079> good

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
other card effects so that's really good

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.530 
other card effects so that's really good
and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.310> course<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:45.060> makes<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> we're

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and then of course that makes it we're

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.270 
and then of course that makes it we're
more<00:01:45.960> likely<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.470> best<00:01:46.500> way<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.040> rid<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
more likely the best way to get rid of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.830 
more likely the best way to get rid of
this<00:01:47.430> card<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.180> actually<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.659> have
