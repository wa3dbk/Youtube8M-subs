00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
there but you just cannot see it so if I

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.999

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.949 
from five minutes to like two hours so
get<00:03:29.250> ready<00:03:29.520> for<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.510> final<00:03:30.810> output

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
get ready for that but the final output

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.770 
get ready for that but the final output
is<00:03:31.320> worth<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.550> like<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.120> do<00:03:33.270> this<00:03:33.480> effect

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
is worth it so I like to do this effect

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.210 
is worth it so I like to do this effect
now<00:03:34.170> I'm<00:03:34.260> going<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.470> rotate<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.830> even<00:03:35.040> bit

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
now I'm going to rotate the even bit

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.860 
now I'm going to rotate the even bit
more<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.610> as<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:35.880> see<00:03:36.060> one<00:03:36.270> when<00:03:36.660> I'm

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
more and as you can see one when I'm

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.630 
more and as you can see one when I'm
using<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.350> same<00:03:37.530> brush<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:38.130> doesn't<00:03:38.520> look

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
using the same brush it doesn't look

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.580 
using the same brush it doesn't look
repetitive<00:03:39.209> because<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.660> brush<00:03:39.900> set<00:03:40.350> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
repetitive because the brush set is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.010 
repetitive because the brush set is
really<00:03:41.340> cool<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:42.240> I'm<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.660> going<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.870> rotate

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
really cool so I'm just going to rotate

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.530 
really cool so I'm just going to rotate
it<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.740> and<00:03:44.130> put<00:03:44.490> this<00:03:44.790> one<00:03:45.090> slightly

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
it like that and put this one slightly

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.490 
it like that and put this one slightly
here<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.550> side<00:03:47.820> okay<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.870> does<00:03:49.290> look

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
here on this side okay that does look

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.430 
here on this side okay that does look
repeated<00:03:49.980> here<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.790> might<00:03:51.330> make<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.959> bit

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
repeated here so I might make a bit

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.730 
repeated here so I might make a bit
small<00:03:52.920> change<00:03:53.640> here<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.540> there<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.140> rotate

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
small change here and there and rotate

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.040 
small change here and there and rotate
it<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.190> then<00:03:56.490> put<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:56.910> one<00:03:57.150> here<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:57.900> now

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
it and then put this one here so now

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.400 
it and then put this one here so now
that<00:03:58.110> looks<00:03:58.530> fine<00:03:58.770> so<00:03:59.100> as<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.600> see<00:04:01.020> that

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
that looks fine so as you can see that

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.740 
that looks fine so as you can see that
there<00:04:01.709> are<00:04:01.740> other<00:04:02.190> really<00:04:02.730> cool<00:04:03.060> process<00:04:03.360> too

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
there are other really cool process too

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.350 
there are other really cool process too
so<00:04:04.110> all<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.560> have<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.830> do<00:04:05.010> now<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.250> just<00:04:05.550> keep

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
so all you have to do now is just keep

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.540 
so all you have to do now is just keep
repeating<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.950> other<00:04:08.130> part<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.490> that

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
repeating it and the other part is that

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.850 
repeating it and the other part is that
you<00:04:09.450> can<00:04:09.480> use<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.990> brush<00:04:10.200> really<00:04:10.440> different

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
you can use the brush really different

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.340 
you can use the brush really different
way<00:04:10.950> like<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.370> one<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.850> like<00:04:12.510> now<00:04:12.780> looks<00:04:13.140> like

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
way like this one is like now looks like

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.580 
way like this one is like now looks like
this<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:14.370> if<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:14.790> just<00:04:15.030> rotate<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.930> let<00:04:16.470> me

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
this but if you just rotate it let me

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.770 
this but if you just rotate it let me
first<00:04:16.820> increase<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.880> spacing<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.630> can

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
first increase the spacing so you can

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.659 
first increase the spacing so you can
see<00:04:18.930> properly<00:04:19.140> now<00:04:19.890> I'm<00:04:19.950> going<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.160> rotate<00:04:20.340> it

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
see properly now I'm going to rotate it

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.710 
see properly now I'm going to rotate it
three<00:04:21.359> 180<00:04:22.049> or<00:04:22.470> whatever<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.250> then<00:04:23.910> I'm<00:04:24.510> going

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
three 180 or whatever and then I'm going

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.780 
three 180 or whatever and then I'm going
to<00:04:24.780> make<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.050> big

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
to make it big

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.450 
to make it big
really<00:04:26.150> huge<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.980> then<00:04:27.980> I'm<00:04:28.100> just<00:04:28.130> going<00:04:28.430> to

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
really huge and then I'm just going to

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.370 
really huge and then I'm just going to
use<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.760> bottom<00:04:28.970> part<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.600> reveal<00:04:29.870> some<00:04:30.050> area

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
use the bottom part to reveal some area

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.070 
use the bottom part to reveal some area
so<00:04:30.950> when<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.130> click<00:04:31.430> here<00:04:31.790> like<00:04:32.150> that<00:04:32.390> so<00:04:32.900> it

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
so when I click here like that so it

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.500 
so when I click here like that so it
reveals<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.250> hand<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:35.030> doesn't<00:04:35.450> even

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
reveals the hand and it doesn't even

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.930 
reveals the hand and it doesn't even
look<00:04:35.690> like<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.500> same<00:04:36.800> brush<00:04:37.070> so<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:37.730> way<00:04:37.880> you

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
look like the same brush so this way you

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.210 
look like the same brush so this way you
can<00:04:38.150> also<00:04:38.300> use<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.050> same<00:04:39.260> brush<00:04:39.560> differently

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
can also use the same brush differently

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.770 
can also use the same brush differently
again<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.670> again<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.270> will<00:04:41.420> be<00:04:41.570> still

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
again and again and it will be still

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.400 
again and again and it will be still
worth<00:04:41.990> it

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
worth it

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.850 
worth it
so<00:04:43.100> right<00:04:43.730> now<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.120> looks<00:04:44.360> okay<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:45.350> now<00:04:45.740> I'm

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
so right now it looks okay and now I'm

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.130 
so right now it looks okay and now I'm
going<00:04:46.010> to<00:04:46.100> fast<00:04:46.340> forward<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:47.090> use<00:04:47.720> different

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
going to fast forward and use different

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.260 
going to fast forward and use different
brushes<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:48.830> can<00:04:49.040> see<00:04:49.280> how<00:04:49.640> you<00:04:50.060> can

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
brushes so you can see how you can

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.920 
brushes so you can see how you can
create<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.750> final<00:04:51.080> output

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:15.379 

you

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.730 

so<00:05:16.389> as<00:05:16.479> you<00:05:16.569> guys<00:05:16.690> can<00:05:16.870> see<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:17.110> have<00:05:17.560> created

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
so as you guys can see I have created

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.070 
so as you guys can see I have created
the<00:05:18.160> basic<00:05:18.550> smoke<00:05:18.789> output<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.569> that<00:05:19.870> looks

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
the basic smoke output and that looks

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.779 
the basic smoke output and that looks
kind<00:05:20.319> of<00:05:20.410> okay<00:05:20.770> not<00:05:20.949> very<00:05:21.160> good<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:21.550> that's

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
kind of okay not very good and that's

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.490 
kind of okay not very good and that's
the<00:05:21.970> down<00:05:22.180> point<00:05:22.479> of<00:05:22.599> this<00:05:22.750> effect<00:05:23.110> like<00:05:23.289> once

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
the down point of this effect like once

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.170 
the down point of this effect like once
you<00:05:23.650> create<00:05:23.949> something<00:05:24.280> with<00:05:24.699> this<00:05:24.849> effect

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
you create something with this effect

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.089 
you create something with this effect
you<00:05:25.360> cannot<00:05:25.690> repeat<00:05:26.080> it<00:05:26.229> unless<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.860> use<00:05:27.069> the

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
you cannot repeat it unless you use the

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.839 
you cannot repeat it unless you use the
selection<00:05:27.729> so<00:05:28.509> yep<00:05:29.009> and<00:05:30.009> that's<00:05:30.220> also<00:05:30.490> kind<00:05:30.759> of

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
selection so yep and that's also kind of

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.430 
selection so yep and that's also kind of
advantage<00:05:31.270> because<00:05:31.599> every<00:05:31.930> time<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.229> create

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
advantage because every time you create

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.100 
advantage because every time you create
something<00:05:32.860> it's<00:05:32.979> going<00:05:33.160> to<00:05:33.280> be<00:05:33.370> new<00:05:33.789> so<00:05:34.750> now

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
something it's going to be new so now

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.900 
something it's going to be new so now
it's<00:05:35.319> the<00:05:35.590> time<00:05:35.889> for<00:05:35.949> color<00:05:36.460> correction<00:05:36.880> so

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
it's the time for color correction so

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.850 
it's the time for color correction so
create<00:05:37.360> new<00:05:37.509> adjustment<00:05:37.990> layer<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.440> select

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
create new adjustment layer and select

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.370 
create new adjustment layer and select
curves<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.460> I'm<00:05:39.849> going<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.060> make<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.780> shape

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
curves and I'm going to make a shape

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.800 
curves and I'm going to make a shape
that<00:05:41.590> looks<00:05:41.620> like<00:05:41.979> s<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.729> then<00:05:43.240> I'm<00:05:43.569> going<00:05:43.780> to

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
that looks like s and then I'm going to

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.779 
that looks like s and then I'm going to
boost<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.289> contrast<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:45.069> this<00:05:45.370> shape

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
boost the contrast so this shape

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.260 
boost the contrast so this shape
basically<00:05:46.180> boosts<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:47.229> contrast<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:48.270> that

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
basically boosts the contrast and that

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.629 
basically boosts the contrast and that
looks<00:05:49.539> fine<00:05:49.780> so<00:05:49.840> let's<00:05:50.409> make<00:05:50.949> it<00:05:50.979> even<00:05:51.400> bit

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
looks fine so let's make it even bit

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.760 
looks fine so let's make it even bit
more<00:05:51.909> darker<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.479> that<00:05:52.599> looks<00:05:52.780> fine<00:05:52.960> now<00:05:53.199> go

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
more darker and that looks fine now go

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.300 
more darker and that looks fine now go
to<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.919> blues<00:05:54.220> and<00:05:54.580> blues<00:05:55.210> and<00:05:56.110> create<00:05:57.039> this

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
to a blues and blues and create this

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.029 
to a blues and blues and create this
that<00:05:57.699> old<00:05:58.000> cliche<00:05:58.659> vintage<00:05:59.050> look<00:05:59.289> at<00:05:59.530> bit<00:06:00.009> of

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
that old cliche vintage look at bit of

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.089 
that old cliche vintage look at bit of
blues<00:06:00.520> and<00:06:01.000> then<00:06:01.509> add<00:06:01.840> bit<00:06:02.139> of<00:06:02.289> yellows<00:06:02.740> and

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
blues and then add bit of yellows and

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.550 
blues and then add bit of yellows and
suddenly<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:04.120> image<00:06:04.330> starts<00:06:04.990> looking<00:06:05.319> really

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
suddenly the image starts looking really

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.689 
suddenly the image starts looking really
beautiful<00:06:05.919> I<00:06:06.009> don't<00:06:06.069> know<00:06:06.250> what<00:06:06.430> is<00:06:06.580> about

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
beautiful I don't know what is about

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.420 
beautiful I don't know what is about
this<00:06:07.000> colors<00:06:07.300> but<00:06:07.539> it<00:06:07.720> looks<00:06:08.110> damn<00:06:08.380> good<00:06:08.430> and

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
this colors but it looks damn good and

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.770 
this colors but it looks damn good and
now<00:06:09.759> create<00:06:10.030> a<00:06:10.060> new<00:06:10.180> layer<00:06:10.419> and<00:06:10.539> select

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
now create a new layer and select

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.770 
now create a new layer and select
vibrance<00:06:11.740> and<00:06:12.039> this<00:06:12.729> time<00:06:13.000> adventure

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
vibrance and this time adventure

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.740 
vibrance and this time adventure
vibrance<00:06:14.169> maybe<00:06:14.380> 30<00:06:14.740> 40<00:06:15.009> and<00:06:15.310> if<00:06:16.150> you<00:06:16.449> think

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
vibrance maybe 30 40 and if you think

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.749 
vibrance maybe 30 40 and if you think
that<00:06:16.840> it<00:06:17.110> doesn't<00:06:17.470> work<00:06:17.710> very<00:06:18.009> much<00:06:18.130> then

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
that it doesn't work very much then

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.730 
that it doesn't work very much then
don't<00:06:19.120> use<00:06:19.330> it<00:06:19.509> it<00:06:19.690> is<00:06:19.719> not<00:06:20.020> very<00:06:20.289> important

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
don't use it it is not very important

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.950 
don't use it it is not very important
step<00:06:20.979> I<00:06:21.159> would<00:06:21.250> say<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:21.909> for<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.449> final<00:06:22.780> step

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
step I would say and for the final step

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.300 
step I would say and for the final step
as<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.199> can<00:06:23.349> see<00:06:23.469> the<00:06:23.590> image<00:06:23.800> has<00:06:23.919> become<00:06:24.130> a

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
as you can see the image has become a

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.159 
as you can see the image has become a
bit<00:06:24.580> darker<00:06:25.030> because<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.389> colors<00:06:25.750> and<00:06:25.960> all

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
bit darker because of colors and all

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.649 
bit darker because of colors and all
stuff<00:06:26.500> so<00:06:27.159> create<00:06:27.669> new<00:06:27.849> curves<00:06:28.120> layer<00:06:28.389> and

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:28.659 
stuff so create new curves layer and

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:30.480 
stuff so create new curves layer and
boost<00:06:29.080> the<00:06:29.320> highlights<00:06:29.710> just<00:06:29.830> like<00:06:30.250> that

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
boost the highlights just like that

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.969 
boost the highlights just like that
simply<00:06:30.909> and<00:06:31.240> it<00:06:31.990> will<00:06:32.169> also<00:06:32.320> make<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:32.740> smoke

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
simply and it will also make the smoke

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.089 
simply and it will also make the smoke
look<00:06:33.250> even<00:06:33.729> more<00:06:33.909> better<00:06:34.210> so<00:06:34.960> that<00:06:35.620> looks<00:06:35.830> fine

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
look even more better so that looks fine

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.390 
look even more better so that looks fine
and<00:06:36.750> we<00:06:37.750> are<00:06:37.840> done<00:06:38.080> so<00:06:38.590> the<00:06:38.710> final<00:06:38.949> output<00:06:39.099> is

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
and we are done so the final output is

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.040 
and we are done so the final output is
ready<00:06:39.610> and<00:06:39.880> if<00:06:39.969> you<00:06:40.090> have<00:06:40.180> any<00:06:40.360> questions<00:06:40.840> feel
