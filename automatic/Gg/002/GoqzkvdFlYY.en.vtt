 Definitely tuned and a lot of fun 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.960
 This tutorial mobbing is not as

 every other mega blog on as well 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.400
 need a decent primer here 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.490
 a kreimer for that we used the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.659
 netratings prima defended by mccain 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.270
 with the hands of my complete one 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.240
 weight next, it continues with 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.090
 the minerals commission and the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.649
 essentials krupp that's a great one 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.960
 great combination which makes the skin right 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.250
 radiate works and that 's what it's about 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.000
 scoring the skin super well groomed 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.459
 silky super top look skin edits 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.920
 I do not wear the whole with my 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.470
 youtube stay on and this where my 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.050
 god the giants 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.130
 as good as you can see just breathe 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.280
 I always find it when I have this 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.800
 essentials user the skin of the hammer 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.720
 or not it is very easy and 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 You see , the skin is very radiant 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.900
 young out 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.090
 still a bit perfect 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.160
 We have to cover it today, too 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.370
 we used the crawler controller from 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.920
 nec the super super great the smart and 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.960
 actually really productive for that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.630
 silky look that's still great 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.060
 opacity and both stick with 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.980
 versatile kite and cologne on the tough side 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.320
 we still need work for 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.500
 our somewhat critical function something 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.770
 what shall percent to 100 the ort labus 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.320
 with the queen color batch hearing aid her 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.150
 I go in the top left of the picture and in 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.740
 put a primer for ours 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.200
 Highlight heard right 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.380
 Highlight definitely stands when stripping 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.790
 a first top priority 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.310
 and our highlight gets one too 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.780
 extra primer places that now 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.060
 put everyone where we marry the same 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.430
 Just want to go through the cream 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.980
 consistency the powdery highlighter 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.900
 to deliver lightweight really nice base 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.070
 what the powder product is better 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.380
 can hold on 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.110
 the queen color base is great for me 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.090
 beautiful easy becomes very very velvety and 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.590
 by uci blender I work the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.739
 Perfect for the skin 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.860
 recommend the green kala b in general 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.900
 I always apply that before the powder 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.550
 as soon as you have a creamy product 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.320
 but still about a brother and I go 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.750
 personally not so nice but that 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.160
 is left to each one now the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.450
 skin is already radiant or 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.090
 not the think ye 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.400
 Now I go with the mini performance in the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.470
 Finish in color softing gentle over 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.320
 the queen coverband over it again 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.450
 that will be the silky and the blue yet 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.130
 times intensify its already see the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.140
 skin starts to radiate properly 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.440
 place I do that now one all 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.299
 put on the face where we shine and 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.730
 want balmy these are the cheekbones 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.790
 that is the lower jawbone the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.880
 a nose of the inner corner of the eye 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.169
 bit under the eyebrow 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.840
 simply everywhere 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.200
 I mean I am a friend of blue 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.380
 but straubing stuck high on one 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.060
 completely new 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.090
 next to it were the eye make types 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.580
 pixilated eyebrows made everything 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.250
 as exciting as glory but now 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.650
 completely has niki tutorial is on 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.680
 I demanded mega unlocks halfway through 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.970
 long only spoken by melanie luminoso 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.590
 and I was a bit shocked like that 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.570
 strong the vipnet fourth which is why I am with 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.770
 youtube countries where stop by the dvd 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.110
 students there was over it again 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.210
 gone and now I have it 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.770
 actually still in the hall imagine 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.180
 want 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.919
 mary human from the ball yes i wanted 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.870
 actually thought of it in one 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.210
 Show wood why he still packed 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.800
 But I felt I had 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.840
 need a bit lighter 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.820
 highlighter and me personally 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.810
 Merkel criticism at the moment 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.590
 a little too much 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.860
 well that's why Mary Louise with the and 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.479
 in the slightly smaller brush the 224 goes 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.289
 Now again about all the highlights 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:26.650
 put over it and, so to speak, against 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.440
 Targeted enters this block again 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.750
 to place on top of it we have 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.380
 large area the queen color base as 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.780
 highlight base then mostly in the finish in 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.289
 soft gentle already a bit 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.280
 triptiser but already large 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:48.130
 and then mary gives away luminosa as cherry 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.220
 and ok now something easy on the lips 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.979

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.490
 and perfect for this mega flop 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.199
 at the end there is still a little fix place 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.409
 super super important with it all 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.070
 radiate properly and you markets blue 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.070
 becomes 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.410

 I prefer to go to the other one 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.370
 But page also say quite as 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.980
 I do not think it's revolutionary 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.930
 However, I have his beautiful variety 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.080
