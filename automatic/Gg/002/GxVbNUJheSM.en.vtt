00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.160 

when<00:00:02.879> we<00:00:02.970> set<00:00:03.149> out<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.270> design<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.659> map<00:00:03.899> the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
when we set out to design a map the

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.210 
when we set out to design a map the
first<00:00:04.380> thing<00:00:04.529> we<00:00:04.620> start<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:04.890> this<00:00:04.980> kind<00:00:05.190> of

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
first thing we start with this kind of

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.740 
first thing we start with this kind of
like<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.370> high<00:00:05.549> concept<00:00:06.029> for<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.270> level<00:00:06.450> we

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
like a high concept for the level we

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.330 
like a high concept for the level we
have<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.020> ability<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.620> create<00:00:07.890> something

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
have the ability to create something

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.190 
have the ability to create something
that<00:00:08.460> was<00:00:08.639> more<00:00:08.820> uniquely<00:00:09.210> American<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:09.990> we

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
that was more uniquely American so we

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.770 
that was more uniquely American so we
did<00:00:10.559> cities<00:00:10.860> like<00:00:11.070> Los<00:00:11.250> Angeles<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.030> Miami

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
did cities like Los Angeles and Miami

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.749 
did cities like Los Angeles and Miami
that<00:00:13.230> offers<00:00:13.740> us<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> completely<00:00:14.580> different

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
that offers us a completely different

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.430 
that offers us a completely different
feeling<00:00:15.120> than<00:00:15.480> what<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.719> would<00:00:15.809> get<00:00:15.990> from

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
feeling than what you would get from

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.019 
feeling than what you would get from
typical<00:00:17.039> battlefield<00:00:17.550> map

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
typical battlefield map

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.580 
typical battlefield map
so<00:00:18.240> once<00:00:18.390> we've<00:00:18.510> had<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.810> high<00:00:18.990> concept<00:00:19.410> we

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
so once we've had that high concept we

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.170 
so once we've had that high concept we
really<00:00:19.800> start<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.189> research<00:00:20.520> finding<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
really start with a research finding a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.580 
really start with a research finding a
bunch<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.390> different<00:00:21.660> images<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:22.020> some<00:00:22.380> cases

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
bunch of different images in some cases

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.080 
bunch of different images in some cases
we<00:00:22.920> actually<00:00:23.220> go<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.580> look<00:00:23.880> at<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
we actually go out and look at the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.179 
we actually go out and look at the
locations<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.810> take<00:00:24.930> photos<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.740> start<00:00:26.070> on

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
locations and take photos so I start on

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.279 
locations and take photos so I start on
2d<00:00:26.550> graph<00:00:26.939> paper<00:00:27.180> kind<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.779> some<00:00:27.930> top-down

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
2d graph paper kind of do some top-down

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.200 
2d graph paper kind of do some top-down
stuff<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.859> then<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.130> turn<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.519> into<00:00:29.760> an

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
stuff and then we turn that into an

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.759 
stuff and then we turn that into an
actual<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.599> more<00:00:30.840> polished<00:00:31.260> map<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
actual like more polished map and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.830 
actual like more polished map and
incorporate<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> into<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.610> pitch<00:00:32.880> deck<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.660> once

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
incorporate it into a pitch deck so once

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
incorporate it into a pitch deck so once
we<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> pitch<00:00:34.590> established<00:00:35.219> that's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
we have the pitch established that's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.290 
we have the pitch established that's
when<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.670> start<00:00:35.850> thinking<00:00:36.000> about<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
when we start thinking about the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.760 
when we start thinking about the
LEvolution<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.989> wanted<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> include<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> big

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
LEvolution we wanted to include the big

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
LEvolution we wanted to include the big
spectacle<00:00:38.190> stuff<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.610> fans<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.969> come<00:00:39.149> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
spectacle stuff that fans have come to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.790 
spectacle stuff that fans have come to
expect<00:00:39.450> from<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.809> Battlefield<00:00:40.200> series<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
expect from the Battlefield series so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 
expect from the Battlefield series so
for<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.399> downtown<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.090> large<00:00:42.420> tower

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
for like in downtown the large tower

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.479 
for like in downtown the large tower
crane<00:00:43.079> comes<00:00:43.500> crashing<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> ground<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
crane comes crashing to the ground and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.799 
crane comes crashing to the ground and
as<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.700> does<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.059> tearing<00:00:45.360> holes<00:00:45.510> through

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
as it does it's tearing holes through

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.209 
as it does it's tearing holes through
both<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.170> skyscrapers<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
both in skyscrapers and then it

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.529 
both in skyscrapers and then it
basically<00:00:47.280> creates<00:00:47.640> interconnected<00:00:48.329> routes

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
basically creates interconnected routes

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.840 
basically creates interconnected routes
between<00:00:48.750> them<00:00:49.079> there's<00:00:49.860> four<00:00:50.489> hydraulic

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
between them there's four hydraulic

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.340 
between them there's four hydraulic
tensioners<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:51.660> things<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:52.020> basically

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
tensioners these things are basically

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
tensioners these things are basically
holding<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> crane<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> place<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.090> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
holding the crane in place and if you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.459 
holding the crane in place and if you
destroy<00:00:54.480> three<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.870> them<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> crane<00:00:55.289> comes

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
destroy three of them the crane comes

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
destroy three of them the crane comes
down

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660 

so<00:01:01.200> if<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.950> this<00:01:02.160> stuff<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.580> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
so if I look at this stuff in the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
so if I look at this stuff in the
scripting<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> see<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:04.020> tensioners<00:01:04.590> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
scripting and see these tensioners and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
scripting and see these tensioners and
this<00:01:05.100> basically<00:01:05.520> will<00:01:05.760> trigger<00:01:06.060> all<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this basically will trigger all the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.390 
this basically will trigger all the
events<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.930> happen<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.980> of<00:01:08.160> one

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
events that happen and this is of one

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.980 
events that happen and this is of one
tiny<00:01:08.730> piece<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.300> scripting<00:01:09.690> that<00:01:09.720> goes

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
tiny piece of the scripting that goes

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
tiny piece of the scripting that goes
into<00:01:10.200> creating<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.680> event<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.400> only<00:01:11.640> does

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
into creating this event not only does

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.730 
into creating this event not only does
it<00:01:11.820> take<00:01:12.120> my<00:01:12.300> time<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.870> designing<00:01:13.440> this<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it take my time like designing this and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.410 
it take my time like designing this and
figure<00:01:13.980> out<00:01:14.040> exactly<00:01:14.250> how<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:14.940> this<00:01:15.090> stuff<00:01:15.300> is

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
figure out exactly how all this stuff is

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.880 
figure out exactly how all this stuff is
going<00:01:15.510> to<00:01:15.570> work<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.320> ultimately<00:01:16.500> that's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
going to work and then ultimately that's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
going to work and then ultimately that's
the<00:01:16.980> animators<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.730> technical<00:01:18.150> artists

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the animators and the technical artists

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.180 
the animators and the technical artists
and<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> VFX<00:01:19.140> guys<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> sound<00:01:19.800> guys<00:01:19.980> to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
and the VFX guys and the sound guys to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:32.350 
and the VFX guys and the sound guys to
really<00:01:20.430> bring<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.790> event<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.240> life

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.540 

I'm<00:01:33.360> super-excited<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.500> watch<00:01:35.160> people

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
I'm super-excited to watch people

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.820 
I'm super-excited to watch people
explore<00:01:36.150> our<00:01:36.360> levels<00:01:36.720> find<00:01:37.230> all<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> really

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
explore our levels find all the really

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.530 
explore our levels find all the really
really<00:01:38.070> cool<00:01:38.250> details<00:01:38.730> we've<00:01:39.030> put<00:01:39.210> into<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
really cool details we've put into it
