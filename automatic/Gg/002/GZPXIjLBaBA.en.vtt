00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.060
 Hello to you honter and in this video 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.549
 show you how to make an automatic 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.769
 firms rubber in minekravt and this you 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.570
 will need the following mods this forestry 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.059
 buildcraft and industrial craft 2 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.379
 experiment either instead 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.080
 simple industrial craft 2 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.789
 if all these mods you have then for 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.490
 start you need to build a mother and 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.260
 firms like this it looks like if you don't 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.570
 know how multi firms are built 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.599
 watch my previous video i already have 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.160
 told them how to build it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.469
 the size of the mother and the company can be any 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.600
 it all depends on how much you 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.360
 you need rubber if you need a little something 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.360
 A small company will fit if rubber 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.280
 need a lot of things better build big i 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.059
 I will show on the example of a small 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.480
 multi firm then take blocks of land and 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.010
 manually set them in the work area 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.690
 multi firms here as shown 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.940
 then take a soldering iron lessons 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.280
 it can be done with the help of a carpenter 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.570
 right click here 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.690
 pick a hand farm take 4 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.340
 rubberized electronic lamps 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.950
 lay them out and you need to 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.840
 more complicated circuit board 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.240
 lamps can be made in a lamp factory 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.880
 PCB can also be made with 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.100
 using a carpenter after you 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.130
 got paid it needs to be put 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.130
 multi firms 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.250
 then you need to feed the water and catch 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.730
 mineral fertilizer 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.730
 Now take peavey seedlings and start 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.490
 you can exhibit them as each other 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.570
 Close but I recommend you 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.300
 to expose like that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.390
 from all four sides was free 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.390
 a place 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.870
 it will be easier to see how much 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.120
 latex drips on the tree and even collect 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.250
 will be much easier if manually 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.590
 although grown you do not need 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.910
 collect nothing enough once 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.650
 plant these trees here then either 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.270
 wait until they grow up 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:14.440
 either automatically accelerate their growth 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:18.280
 put all the rest in here 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.350
 space so we make it lighter to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.770
 can be used to accelerate growth 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.630
 flour 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.060
 take the flour in hand and press 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:32.260
 pads here we see in the tree 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.800
 grown now we remove foliage and look 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.870
 how many latex drips on this tree 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:45.040
 You can not remove the tops and we see 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.730
 see that latex drips on the tree 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.120
 none at all or it has already been assembled 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.410
 Now turn off the multi firm and remove 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.410
 all the rubber that's here 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.390
 if so here 's another tree grew 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.269
 we remove it and put in his place yet 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.390
 once there where vii look there 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.390
 here 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.090
 so here we see again we are not 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:39.230
 lucky and not here latex is now 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:41.780
 Turn on the farm and wait for this latex 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.380
 will be assembled it will be assembled and placed 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.380
 here in these cells 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.660
 but the tree itself will not be cut down 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.240
 that's all 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.090
 latex multi firm he gathered 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.520
 moved here and if you set 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.480
 suite bottom connect to it 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.280
 pipe and put and bottom extractor then 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.070
 fun so sbu trial automatically 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.350
 then get two sticks to the tractor 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.900
 electricity and its extractor will be 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.820
 you can recycle at rubber here 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.760
 put an improvement ejector to 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.209
 automatically rubber or feed went by 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.860
 pipes or moved to the chest here 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.710
 in this simple way you can 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.720
 get a lot of rubber rain 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.420
 wait for the rest to grow 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.620
 hevea trees either using bone 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.000
 flour accelerate their growth and his brothers trunk 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.040
 Like it all put subscribe
