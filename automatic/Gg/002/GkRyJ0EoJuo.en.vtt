00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:13.360
 and like the king here but something of 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.400
 satisfaction because but nevertheless I 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.500
 I would like it because today is also my 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.210
 message in the child to all those who 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.010
 you are in these if you are behind 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.900
 means that the video has been uploaded 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.670
 edited and all good because I think 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.900
 quite weird because the mess I have 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.760
 to tell has had to remove the 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.800
 screen that I have here to place it 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.119
 here good this is if we do not have 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.559
 so that I can see to see if it 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.170
 is focusing on wind but if I have to 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.550
 move a dresser and put it here with a 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.159
 pile of books to make a tripod 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.839
 minister poetic mind what happens in 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.309
 reality in your flawed game zone 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.010
 Well, I do it because it's pretty 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.690
 Pimp is not focusing because I do not 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.640
 had united that in focus but principle 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.829
 there should be seen a few 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.350
 little lights focused then if the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.269
 you have seen is 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 and if it does not mean that we focus 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.449
 but good the fact is that the counted 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.690
 everything here superbonito surfaces here 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.899
 with my little lights and with micro and holes 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.460
 that with bringing a message is that I am not 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.860
 I do not like the emails, and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.659
 also stayed in hats but the case 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.880
 is that today I wanted to thank you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.380
 Christmas you do not know you the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.420
 facts and he knows everyone is 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.100
 moment of sharing to celebrate what 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.539
 we have lived during the year and be in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.149
 family or with friends with people 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.200
 what we want and in my case I'm going to celebrate 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.700
 life but right now boys 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.800
 You Darwin also want me 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 I think right now the most beautiful thing 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.560
 I can do and with that I could do it 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.060
 this video make a video where two 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.039
 looks thank you for having been during 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.619
 this year has been a year of many 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.240
 changes a lot of work I would say but that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.039
 I liked having passed homes that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.479
 a year where many times I took this 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.009
 like a job even though I'm 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.840
 studying and I could not give you some things 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.429
 hours that I really liked to see and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.319
 that there are people behind who value it in the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.940
 day by day and I'm not going for the micro no 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.179
 because I do not do every special and I do not 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.179
 like 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.259
 but in the end at Christmas and it's time to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.030
 then one year then practical 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.350
 implements thank you very much for being there 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.640
 I think you have an experience 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.619
 Christmas all the points I hope that 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.750
 are he sharing Christmas with whom 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.820
 was that alone that's the most important thing 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.560
 beyond if it is declared that we continue 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.910
 so much is better but the truth is that what 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.950
 more beautiful is to share with ease 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.330

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.709
