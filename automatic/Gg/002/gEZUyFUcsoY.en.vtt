because<00:00:00.539> we're<00:00:00.750> using<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.790> exchange<00:00:02.790> server

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
because we're using the exchange server

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.050 
because we're using the exchange server
with<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.600> built-in<00:00:04.200> after<00:00:05.040> sync<00:00:05.250> protocol<00:00:05.670> it's

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
with a built-in after sync protocol it's

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.460 
with a built-in after sync protocol it's
built<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> technology<00:00:06.960> they<00:00:07.230> know<00:00:07.319> how<00:00:07.410> to

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
built on the technology they know how to

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.430 
built on the technology they know how to
use<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.099> they<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.670> in-house<00:00:09.389> that's<00:00:09.990> that's

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
use and they have in-house that's that's

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.230 
use and they have in-house that's that's
right<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.920> there's<00:00:11.099> less<00:00:11.460> servers<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.000> manage

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
right and there's less servers to manage

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360 
right and there's less servers to manage
in<00:00:12.450> between<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.530> actually<00:00:13.679> pretty

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
in between that so it's actually pretty

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.900 
in between that so it's actually pretty
easier<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.059> use<00:00:15.770> secondly<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.640> some

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
easier to use secondly we have some

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.120 
easier to use secondly we have some
tools<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.600> were<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.560> give<00:00:19.770> IT

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
tools that were going to give IT

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.420 
tools that were going to give IT
managers<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.119> allow<00:00:21.420> them<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:22.430> configure

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
managers that allow them to configure

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.670 
managers that allow them to configure
all<00:00:24.000> those<00:00:24.269> devices<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:25.050> they<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.289> configure

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
all those devices and they can configure

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.050 
all those devices and they can configure
for<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> number<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.310> ways<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.640> tools<00:00:26.849> allow

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
for a number of ways the tools allow

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269 
for a number of ways the tools allow
them<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.960> email<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:28.949> through<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
them to do it the email or through a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.279 
them to do it the email or through a
secure<00:00:29.580> website<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.510> they<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.750> make<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.050> very

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
secure website so they can make it very

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
secure website so they can make it very
simple<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.920> automate<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> process<00:00:32.460> of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
simple to automate the process of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.380 
simple to automate the process of
setting<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.270> all<00:00:33.390> those<00:00:33.510> those<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:35.270> where<00:00:36.270> we

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
setting up all those those is where we

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.420 
setting up all those those is where we
create<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:37.320> nice<00:00:37.530> mechanism<00:00:37.920> work

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
create this really nice mechanism work

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790 
create this really nice mechanism work
on<00:00:38.610> profiles<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.350> create<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
on profiles and you can create it you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.780 
on profiles and you can create it you
know<00:00:40.860> see<00:00:40.980> your<00:00:41.100> highest<00:00:41.370> department<00:00:41.489> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
know see your highest department can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.280 
know see your highest department can
create<00:00:42.059> profiles<00:00:42.510> individually

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
create profiles individually

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.319 
create profiles individually
automatically<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> server<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
automatically on the server as the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750 
automatically on the server as the
employee<00:00:45.719> logs<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> dynamically

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
employee logs in and it can dynamically

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
employee logs in and it can dynamically
create<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.239> their<00:00:48.360> exchange<00:00:48.780> setup<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.559> can

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
create for their exchange setup it can

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
create for their exchange setup it can
create<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> VPN<00:00:50.460> settings<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.180> create

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
create the VPN settings it can create

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.270 
create the VPN settings it can create
security<00:00:52.050> requirements<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.829> pin<00:00:53.039> code

the<00:01:19.049> configuration<00:01:19.799> dirt<00:01:20.220> simple<00:01:20.790> there's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the configuration dirt simple there's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.399 
the configuration dirt simple there's
also<00:01:21.270> tools<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.930> plug<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.229> into<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
also tools they can plug it into a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.660 
also tools they can plug it into a
computer<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
computer if they want they can do it on

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.950 
computer if they want they can do it on
the<00:01:23.759> web<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.330> send<00:01:24.479> an<00:01:24.540> email<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the web they can send an email to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840 
the web they can send an email to
someone<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.500> all<00:01:25.680> these<00:01:25.830> mechanisms<00:01:26.040> but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
someone but all these mechanisms but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
someone but all these mechanisms but
that<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> heart<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.200> single

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that at the heart of it it's a single

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140 
that at the heart of it it's a single
package<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.100> single<00:01:29.490> profile<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.000> does

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
package a single profile which does

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.210 
package a single profile which does
everything<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.170> top<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
everything for you on top of that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.850 
everything for you on top of that
because<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> SDK<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.740> IT

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
because of the SDK we think that IT

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.170 
because of the SDK we think that IT
departments<00:01:35.549> are<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> absolutely<00:01:36.000> love

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
departments are going to absolutely love

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.370 
departments are going to absolutely love
this<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> lot<00:01:37.350> of

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
this because there's a lot of
