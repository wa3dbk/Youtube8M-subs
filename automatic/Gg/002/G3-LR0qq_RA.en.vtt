 after you've washed and 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.600
 disinfected your dams let's cut 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.290
 the upper lower part of this for 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.290

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 Y 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.199
 and so we are going to do with all our 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.199
 dams 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.440
 since you have cut all your tips 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.020
 let's remove the part of the center with 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.020
 Help from a spoon or arrow 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.210

 Be careful that the knife does not touch 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.890
 the edges because if they can not break 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.920
 also try to choose strawberries more 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.920
 big so you can cut them better 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.869
 that you can follow the instructions that 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.509
 they sell behind the little bag of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.969

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.060
 and will continue to dissolve 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.540
 since your gelatin is cold we are going to 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.010
 add tequila or waka 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.010
