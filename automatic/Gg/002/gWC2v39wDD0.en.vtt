00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.090
 this year 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.570
 that shows how much of that research shows that savers must 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.150
 work from a basic location whether it also has the composition of rome and there 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.880
 hit this new have taken the two parts will noise this is one 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.419
 total 300 grams 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:24.439
 that should be enough to help the population this was the relapse altogether 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.439
 I have completed a number of jobs in Zandvoort 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.470
 I do I do to get a little light-hearted the filling 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.480
 and so shall the children 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 the message can start 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.550
 and so we are not going to do that 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.570
 I grab a piping bag for that 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.800
 with a spray nozzle in it 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.650
 a syringe 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.060
 But first tourists start spraying in often so you have to stop the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.600
 the opening set but this is also blocked as a supplement 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 gets it 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.260
 using the disaster season 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
 the change 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.539
 we could have done his baking paper if I did the competition 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.470
 that takes a lot of fat at full speed 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.470
 do not take a good look at the unions 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 other than that the two pieces finish 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.750
 and baking paper are there 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.480
 we have no problems there 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
 This case can take a little balls outside 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.530
 you can also 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.200
 train traffic 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.000
 why make 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 and they actually in every for that sake 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.380
 you can find the spray you want balls or longer 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.079
 you can also create jobs that might be even easier 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.709
 what a pack you save bag 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.649
 put a long line 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.649
 and then put them in the fridge or freezer of children 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.699
 friezes goes faster 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.669
 in those cities you cut them into pieces 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.919
 and that is actually the easiest I am going to put them less in the cooling tom 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.919
 has scouted to live 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.989
 then brand go i can prepare now 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.289
 she can be by old goalkeeper skater who is equally light big good 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.669
 dekker cao polar light which we will soon be mixing 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.489
 or the coconut 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.409
 with this, cooking is a penalty 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.069
 we can also just burn it lightly in overexposed toasting, it just has 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.749
 slightly more taste 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.709
 I'm going to show the CAO 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.449
 then children need help and a sieve 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.719
 that I would use a head chance 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.519
 sit the cold that creates right on your tongue and then he sits the taste buds 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.649
 say close 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.919
 a taste nice much more of the cocoa 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.119
 besides that, a kidnapped is not so nice 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:16.089
 with that comes a third part, so two hundred can of bekaro powder 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:17.699
 on board powdered sugar 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.129
 that together 7 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.129
 then it's safe for someone 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.019
 to the 7 then I also have these clubs that are all here that are there 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.719
 then off 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.010
 then getting the back matches is easier to roll through the cocoa and 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:54.419
 But if the two steel face believes that a bit on the paper 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.419
 You can also see that the powdered sugar gets a lighter color 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.329
 and it is now also a bit sweeter 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.779
 then it goes into a container 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.849
 years 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.769
 have cash declare and melted 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.389
 the chocolate cut back not necessarily to be at the right temperature 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.860
 he may not sit why are we or bicycles too cold that is not worked 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.850
 because it is also a soft mind 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.870
 the on the cocoa farmers in our interest and then you see no more could be on later 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.889
 the news 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:36.969
 m 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:37.919
 he is not allowed alone 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.919
 the cry is therefore not 45 degrees which quickly fill 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.599
 but then watch life or fillings 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.599
 let some wilders go for research 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.210
 good count just sprayed a few showers 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.930
 the two are closing cows in the freezer 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.930
 and now I'm going to cut them through the chocolate 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.889
 for that I need a dora people or a poll that a fork 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.740
 texts are fairly robust 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.849
 grab this quickly 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.849
 in the chocolate to hear 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.219
 mitch plates from 7 as hand iron 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.219
 then you can if desired I also like for example 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.710
 emergency power 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.029
 Geneva fork 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.419
 recalled by the cooking class 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.419
 whatever is possible 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.789
 so carpooling is actually just the same again 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:40.460
 the 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.699
 chocolate and base 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.120
 the deduction and a drink 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.120
 martek a carbine 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.400
 and then form again 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.069
 that result 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:58.069
 7 the renÃ© is hard 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.000
 7 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.089
 the 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:08.089
 also the 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:10.349
 the
