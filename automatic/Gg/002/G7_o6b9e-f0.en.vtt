00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.420
 60 years old most men feel 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.550
 yourself strong and young but after 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.100
 this milestone in many does not decrease 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.770
 performance immunity level 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.860
 muscle mass increases fragility 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.950
 bones often develops depression and 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.539
 all this because after 60 masculine 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.749
 the body level decreases 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.960
 testosterone how inevitable is this 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:40.569
 process and is it possible from him to him 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.739
 affect this we talk today with 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:45.609
 Dr. Julia 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.550
 Rubinstein Senior Urologist Hospital Mayor 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:52.449
 Julia good morning and I would like 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.389
 talk about that man probably 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.059
 as women grow old they decrease 

00:00:55.389 --> 00:01:01.019
 sex hormone levels but we are women 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.330
 accept if necessary 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.210
 sex hormones, but men need to 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.170
 give such hormones and whether they take 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.570
 I want them to you very well 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.090
 notice that all the symptoms are not enough 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.820
 you are not enough testosterone target you 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.430
 said and 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.660
 yes of course this decrease in muscle mass 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.480
 decrease 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:30.640
 decrease bone density is depression 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:34.180
 this decrease in sexual desire and she 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.750
 men are only casual 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.020
 women age women younger he 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.720
 not 60 years forty years 40 years already 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.570
 begins to decrease testosterone which 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.750
 leads to all the symptoms that you 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.730
 said here the statistics says every 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.230
 year since 40 years 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.659
 one percent to 60 when a man loses 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.480
 5 percent testosterone ie this 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.990
 as if not a catastrophic figure but she 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.180
 gives here such serious consequences and 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.080
 so if this drug is for men and 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.270
 whether they take it need not take 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 of course you need to check when you 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.820
 come to the doctor you need if you have 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.220
 These symptoms need to be checked. 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.450
 testosterone testosterone is 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.330
 defined upper and lower bound 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.250
 testosterone when we say that he 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.110
 normal in the blood if testosterone is not 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.520
 enough there is medicine to replace 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.400
 passengers knead replacement 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:41.640
 therapy is ointment and there are injections now 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.800
 have a new testosterone injection which 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.060
 enjoys once every three months and he 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.100
 gives constantly 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.709
 constant blood testosterone level 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.870
 and men just comes alive in front of the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.190
 there is it as good as it is positive 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.290
 that we have such an opportunity 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.720
 help a man of course that's when 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.930
 a woman takes the sex hormone very 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.959
 it is often said that he may negatively 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.970
 affect her health and cause let's say 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.459
 cancer in particular 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.940
 breast tumors but testosterone which 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.670
 takes a man and can he say 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.750
 same effect on him serve 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.780
 cause prostate cancer then 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.940
 sister can not but cause 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.050
 early detection of prostate cancer 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.450
 glands 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.480
 yes he can like him because when 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.250
 starts men taking testosterone 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.870
 testosterone is a hormone that affects 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.910
 prostate development and level 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.860
 prostatic specific antigen and this antigen 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.200
 which which rises at 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.480
 if there is no cancer 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.489
 testosterone it is very small and if 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.980
 we give this man testosterone 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.890
 prostatic antigen rises 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.690
 immediately and that is a month after give 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.280
 from testosterone and we see that 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.420
 increase prostatic specificity antigen 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.209
 This is an indication that we have not already given 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.890
 he is the house we would not have noticed the man all 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.620
 it would be equal to breaking the disease 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.250
 waved it well we didn't notice it 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.320
 just this is one side 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.390
 as they say about you the other side if 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.940
 Any methods that can help 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.000
 man sus support himself 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.340
 testosterone 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.350
 if something is some habits in men 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.740
 which on the contrary also affects 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.830
 lower testosterone levels yes of course 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.910
 too yes of course obesity we all know 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.520
 obesity by type when obesity goes on 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.920
 in the abdomen it reduces the amount 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.720
 testosterone diabetes mellitus to 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.720
 cardiovascular disease reduces 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.760
 level of testosterone is unknown what is here 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.040
 primary what is secondary most likely 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.370
 salt game on vascular diseases they 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.290
 primary metabolic disorders are 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.140
 lowers their obesity to obesity 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.940
 hereby testosterone is all connected 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.500
 and metabolism inside the body it is associated 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.320
 should a man go in for sports and 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.270
 give up smoking and alcohol for

 order to keep your masculine 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.669

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.750
 yes of course of course how much 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:27.729
 may certainly worth it and so that both 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.750
 how can a man get to a doctor? 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.810
