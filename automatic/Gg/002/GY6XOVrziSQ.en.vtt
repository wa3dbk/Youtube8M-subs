00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
probably all the time because the other

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.420 
probably all the time because the other
boots<00:00:58.050> they're<00:00:59.050> not<00:00:59.649> really<00:00:59.829> any<00:01:00.040> reason<00:01:00.100> to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430

anything<00:01:04.000> beneficial<00:01:04.420> might<00:01:05.229> as<00:01:05.379> well<00:01:05.530> just

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
anything beneficial might as well just

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.920 
anything beneficial might as well just
wear<00:01:05.860> these<00:01:06.070> all<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.520> time<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.940> when<00:01:07.690> you<00:01:07.780> do

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
wear these all the time and when you do

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.870 
wear these all the time and when you do
prison<00:01:08.259> of<00:01:08.350> elders<00:01:08.500> then<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.490> got<00:01:09.640> these

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
prison of elders then you got these

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.639 
prison of elders then you got these
going<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.360> know<00:01:10.960> there's<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.289> bunch<00:01:11.530> of

different versions of these boots and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.969 
different versions of these boots and
it's<00:01:13.869> going<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.050> take<00:01:14.229> some<00:01:14.259> time<00:01:14.649> to<00:01:14.800> collect

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
it's going to take some time to collect

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.100 
it's going to take some time to collect
them<00:01:15.280> all<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.550> it'll<00:01:16.210> be<00:01:16.300> good<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.630> carry

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
them all and it'll be good to carry

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.050 
them all and it'll be good to carry
these<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.619> know<00:01:17.770> what<00:01:17.979> rounds<00:01:18.399> are<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.850> prison

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
these and know what rounds are in prison

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.520 
these and know what rounds are in prison
of<00:01:19.240> elders<00:01:19.360> so<00:01:19.569> you<00:01:19.660> can<00:01:19.780> swap<00:01:20.110> your<00:01:20.259> gear

me know what you guys think they look
pretty<00:01:25.149> cool<00:01:25.660> as<00:01:25.810> well<00:01:25.840> they're<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.619> little<00:01:26.830> bit

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
pretty cool as well they're a little bit

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.919 
pretty cool as well they're a little bit
weird<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.580> took<00:01:27.729> me<00:01:27.910> a<00:01:27.940> while<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.209> find<00:01:28.569> a<00:01:28.780> um

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
weird it took me a while to find a um

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.719 
weird it took me a while to find a um
shader<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.830> they<00:01:29.950> didn't<00:01:30.250> look<00:01:30.369> really

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
shader that they didn't look really

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.480 
shader that they didn't look really
goofy<00:01:31.119> on<00:01:31.209> they<00:01:32.200> do<00:01:32.560> kind<00:01:32.979> of<00:01:33.069> look<00:01:33.220> weird

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
goofy on they do kind of look weird

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.550 
goofy on they do kind of look weird
they're<00:01:33.970> definitely<00:01:34.179> unique<00:01:34.660> they<00:01:35.380> got

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
they're definitely unique they got

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.529 
they're definitely unique they got
little<00:01:35.590> warts<00:01:36.160> on<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.550> knee<00:01:36.849> I<00:01:37.060> don't

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
little warts on this knee I don't

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.490 
little warts on this knee I don't
understand<00:01:38.080> them<00:01:38.289> but<00:01:38.979> um<00:01:40.110> yeah<00:01:41.110> they

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
understand them but um yeah they

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.980 
understand them but um yeah they
definitely<00:01:41.979> look<00:01:42.610> kind<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.970> weird<00:01:43.030> we<00:01:43.840> were

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
definitely look kind of weird we were

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.680 
definitely look kind of weird we were
using<00:01:44.200> this<00:01:44.530> shader<00:01:44.860> their<00:01:45.550> ruse<00:01:45.789> passage<00:01:46.420> and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
using this shader their ruse passage and

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.469 
using this shader their ruse passage and
I<00:01:47.289> didn't<00:01:47.590> like<00:01:47.740> all<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.099> white<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.550> them<00:01:48.789> so<00:01:49.179> i

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
I didn't like all the white on them so i

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.859 
I didn't like all the white on them so i
changed<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:50.170> up<00:01:51.209> let's<00:01:52.209> show<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.420> couple<00:01:52.660> of

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
changed it up let's show a couple of

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.180 
changed it up let's show a couple of
other<00:01:53.020> shaders<00:01:53.500> here<00:01:56.009> they're<00:01:57.009> definitely

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
other shaders here they're definitely

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.969 
other shaders here they're definitely
strange<00:01:58.000> looking<00:01:58.479> I<00:01:58.709> don't<00:01:59.709> know<00:01:59.800> what<00:01:59.950> I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
strange looking I don't know what I

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.749 
strange looking I don't know what I
think<00:02:00.340> about<00:02:00.459> them<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:02.429> really<00:02:03.429> like<00:02:03.580> the

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
think about them I really like the

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.589 
think about them I really like the
midday<00:02:04.030> midday<00:02:04.780> looked<00:02:05.170> pretty<00:02:05.470> good<00:02:05.649> a<00:02:06.599> lime

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
midday midday looked pretty good a lime

midday midday looked pretty good a lime
green<00:02:07.630> accents<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.709> places<00:02:10.319> pretty<00:02:11.319> sweet

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
green accents and places pretty sweet
