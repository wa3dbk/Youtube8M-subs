concentration<00:00:47.550> right<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.760> stop<00:00:48.090> an<00:00:48.210> earthquake

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
concentration right I stop an earthquake

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.319 
concentration right I stop an earthquake
for<00:00:48.780> Garchomp<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.980> reckon<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> bug<00:00:53.910> buzz<00:00:54.120> for

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
for Garchomp and I reckon a bug buzz for

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.299 
for Garchomp and I reckon a bug buzz for
us<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.870> frost<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> pain

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:06.380

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.529 

that<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.140> excellent<00:01:13.499> teamwork<00:01:14.539> that

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
that was excellent teamwork that

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.029 
that was excellent teamwork that
probably<00:01:15.810> could<00:01:15.899> have<00:01:15.960> been<00:01:16.109> done<00:01:16.289> bit<00:01:16.499> a<00:01:16.679> bit

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
probably could have been done bit a bit

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:23.240 
probably could have been done bit a bit
better<00:01:18.649> hey<00:01:19.649> idiot<00:01:21.829> aerial<00:01:22.829> ace<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.159> have

frost<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:34.500> feels<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.069> weird<00:01:35.399> doing<00:01:35.729> this

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
frost it feels really weird doing this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.800 
frost it feels really weird doing this
because<00:01:36.890> they're<00:01:37.890> both<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.520> Pokemon<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.569> it's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
because they're both my Pokemon so it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.490 
because they're both my Pokemon so it's
like<00:01:40.079> fighting<00:01:40.380> myself<00:01:40.729> it's<00:01:41.729> slightly<00:01:42.000> odd

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.289 

right<00:01:49.500> has<00:01:49.890> already<00:01:50.159> taken<00:01:50.670> another

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
right has already taken another

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.609 
right has already taken another
earthquake<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.090> signal<00:01:54.569> beam<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.140> leafeon

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
earthquake and a signal beam for leafeon

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.749 
earthquake and a signal beam for leafeon
try<00:01:58.619> confuse<00:01:59.009> it<00:02:00.829> hopefully<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.009> didn't<00:02:02.700> need

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
try confuse it hopefully I didn't need

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.569 
try confuse it hopefully I didn't need
to<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> killed<00:02:03.179> it<00:02:06.920> well<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.399> well

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
to a killed it well this is going well

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:14.599 
to a killed it well this is going well
its<00:02:08.789> knit<00:02:11.000> one<00:02:12.000> big<00:02:12.269> worry<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:14.400> dark

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
its knit one big worry is that the dark

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.080 
its knit one big worry is that the dark
or<00:02:14.790> sends<00:02:15.060> out<00:02:15.150> Giratina<00:02:16.579> the<00:02:17.579> a/c<00:02:17.760> I'm<00:02:17.970> not

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
or sends out Giratina the a/c I'm not

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.009 
or sends out Giratina the a/c I'm not
worried<00:02:18.269> I'm<00:02:18.420> still<00:02:18.599> but<00:02:18.720> all<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.930> our

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
worried I'm still but all of our

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:26.390 
worried I'm still but all of our
contacts<00:02:19.500> are<00:02:19.620> knocked<00:02:19.739> out

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.920 

this<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.550> probably<00:02:27.790> why<00:02:28.000> Wi-Fi<00:02:28.420> battles<00:02:28.810> are

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
this is probably why Wi-Fi battles are

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.000 
this is probably why Wi-Fi battles are
better<00:02:30.540> because<00:02:31.540> if<00:02:32.290> you're<00:02:32.440> battling<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:32.890> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
better because if you're battling is the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.350 
better because if you're battling is the
real<00:02:33.160> person<00:02:33.550> they<00:02:33.640> have<00:02:33.730> some<00:02:33.910> idea<00:02:34.270> of

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
real person they have some idea of

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.800 
real person they have some idea of
strategy<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.080> stuff<00:02:35.410> like<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:36.360> right<00:02:37.360> we'll

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
strategy and stuff like that right we'll

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.230 
strategy and stuff like that right we'll
go<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.050> outrage<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:40.170> ancient<00:02:41.170> power<00:02:42.240> just

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
go with outrage and ancient power just

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.460 
go with outrage and ancient power just

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
sucked but then that was probably the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.760 
sucked but then that was probably the
best<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.320> do<00:02:53.410> right<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:55.690> let's<00:02:56.350> see<00:02:56.500> some
