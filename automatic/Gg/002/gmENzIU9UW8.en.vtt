00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
fire and there's not much difference in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.160 
fire and there's not much difference in
between<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.160> two<00:00:28.310> just<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.730> size<00:00:29.170> the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
between the two just the size the

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.589 
between the two just the size the
trappers<00:00:30.740> fire<00:00:31.310> is<00:00:31.670> used<00:00:32.000> differently<00:00:32.449> from

trappers fire is used differently from
the<00:00:32.809> long<00:00:32.989> fire<00:00:33.350> as<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:34.160> long<00:00:34.370> fires<00:00:34.670> use<00:00:35.000> for

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
the long fire as the long fires use for

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.130 
the long fire as the long fires use for
an<00:00:35.390> overnight<00:00:35.980> stay<00:00:36.980> or<00:00:37.280> a<00:00:37.340> longer<00:00:37.940> stay<00:00:38.300> the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
an overnight stay or a longer stay the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.560 
an overnight stay or a longer stay the
trapper<00:00:39.830> of<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.010> hunters<00:00:40.309> fire<00:00:40.550> is<00:00:40.850> made<00:00:41.390> up

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
on a much smaller scale because it's

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.670 
on a much smaller scale because it's
kind<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.570> like<00:00:44.690> we're<00:00:44.870> doing<00:00:45.080> today<00:00:45.230> we're<00:00:45.590> on

okay<00:01:13.150> guys<00:01:13.330> there's<00:01:13.720> nothing<00:01:14.050> to<00:01:14.470> this<00:01:14.620> hunter

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
okay guys there's nothing to this hunter

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.670 
okay guys there's nothing to this hunter
or<00:01:15.130> trappers<00:01:15.580> fire<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:16.480> has<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.810> same<00:01:17.050> basics

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
or trappers fire it has the same basics

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.670 
or trappers fire it has the same basics
as<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:17.860> long<00:01:18.130> fire<00:01:19.200> however<00:01:20.200> it's<00:01:20.380> just<00:01:20.440> on<00:01:20.650> a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
as a long fire however it's just on a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.910 
as a long fire however it's just on a
smaller<00:01:21.070> scale<00:01:21.490> now<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:23.080> see<00:01:23.260> how<00:01:23.380> small<00:01:23.710> this

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
smaller scale now you see how small this

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.660 
smaller scale now you see how small this
fire<00:01:24.220> is<00:01:24.430> that's<00:01:24.850> all<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.270> fire<00:01:25.479> you'll<00:01:25.720> need

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
fire is that's all the fire you'll need

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.850 
fire is that's all the fire you'll need
your<00:01:27.670> longer<00:01:28.180> pieces<00:01:28.420> or<00:01:29.140> your<00:01:29.320> side<00:01:29.560> running

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
your longer pieces or your side running

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.480 
your longer pieces or your side running
pieces<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:31.390> about<00:01:31.660> 16<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.410> 18<00:01:32.770> inches<00:01:33.100> in

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
pieces are about 16 to 18 inches in

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.760 
pieces are about 16 to 18 inches in
length<00:01:33.550> and<00:01:36.390> ballpark<00:01:37.390> I<00:01:37.630> like<00:01:38.020> about<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.350> three

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
length and ballpark I like about a three

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.820 
length and ballpark I like about a three
finger<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.369> diameter<00:01:40.030> now<00:01:41.020> what<00:01:41.290> I'll<00:01:41.410> do<00:01:41.619> is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
finger in diameter now what I'll do is

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.620 
finger in diameter now what I'll do is
once<00:01:42.369> I<00:01:42.490> get<00:01:42.550> a<00:01:42.670> fire<00:01:43.090> going

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
once I get a fire going

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
once I get a fire going
I'll<00:01:43.690> get<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.050> going<00:01:44.290> pretty<00:01:44.440> good<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.540> then

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
I'll get it going pretty good and then

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.540 
I'll get it going pretty good and then
I'll<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.840> try<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.899> feel<00:01:50.140> for<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.470> wind<00:01:50.680> just

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
I'll just try to feel for the wind just

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.490 
I'll just try to feel for the wind just
like<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.880> long<00:01:52.060> fire<00:01:52.330> you<00:01:52.540> want<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.290> air

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
like the long fire you want the the air

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.300 
like the long fire you want the the air
to<00:01:54.190> enter<00:01:54.399> one<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.149> two<00:01:55.330> ends<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:56.310> then

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
to enter one of the two ends and then

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.660 
to enter one of the two ends and then
I'll<00:01:58.240> uh<00:01:58.300> I'll<00:01:59.130> set<00:02:00.130> them<00:02:00.220> pretty<00:02:00.460> close

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
I'll uh I'll set them pretty close

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.490 
I'll uh I'll set them pretty close
together<00:02:00.880> now<00:02:01.750> if<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.899> get<00:02:02.020> them<00:02:02.110> too<00:02:02.259> close

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
together now if you get them too close

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.749 
together now if you get them too close
together<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.950> depends<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:03.369> what<00:02:03.520> kind<00:02:03.729> of

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
together it depends on what kind of

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.700 
together it depends on what kind of
ground<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.540> got<00:02:04.660> like<00:02:04.869> this<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.380> full<00:02:05.560> of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
ground you got like this is full of

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.010 
ground you got like this is full of
ashes<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.940> has<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.149> tendency<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.750> smother

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
ashes so it has a tendency to smother

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.479 
ashes so it has a tendency to smother
your<00:02:08.200> fire<00:02:08.470> out<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.950> got<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.190> kind<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.369> be

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
your fire out so you got to kind of be

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.110 
your fire out so you got to kind of be
careful<00:02:10.320> how<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.350> lay<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.790> ideally<00:02:12.790> what<00:02:12.970> you

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
careful how you lay it ideally what you

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.290 
careful how you lay it ideally what you
want<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.800> your<00:02:14.800> pieces<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.700> shape<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.180> an

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
want is your pieces in the shape of an

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.770 
want is your pieces in the shape of an
arrow<00:02:16.540> or<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.410> point<00:02:20.880> like<00:02:21.880> such<00:02:22.209> because

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
arrow or a point like such because
