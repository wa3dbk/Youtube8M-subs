has a little plus and basically what
that's<00:01:33.389> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.569> do<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.719> add<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> pixel<00:01:34.319> mask

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:34.529 
that's going to do is add a pixel mask

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:36.800 
that's going to do is add a pixel mask
so<00:01:35.069> you're<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.459> click<00:01:35.639> on<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
so you're going to click on that and you

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.940 
so you're going to click on that and you
can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.079> that's<00:01:37.259> already<00:01:37.439> cropped<00:01:37.799> out

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
can see that's already cropped out

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.349 
can see that's already cropped out
everything<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.639> wasn't<00:01:38.819> in<00:01:38.999> our<00:01:39.090> selection

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
everything that wasn't in our selection

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.690 
everything that wasn't in our selection
so<00:01:39.749> it<00:01:39.869> looks<00:01:40.049> pretty<00:01:40.399> terrible<00:01:41.399> with<00:01:41.579> her

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so it looks pretty terrible with her

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.999 
so it looks pretty terrible with her
hair<00:01:41.939> right<00:01:42.149> now<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.679> we're<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
hair right now and what we're going to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.339 
hair right now and what we're going to
do<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.249> just<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.609> zoom<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.880> right<00:01:45.060> now

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
do I'm just going to zoom in right now

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.679 
do I'm just going to zoom in right now
we're<00:01:46.349> going<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.889> is<00:01:47.369> take<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.029> to<00:01:48.090> mask

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
we're going to do is take and go to mask

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.349 
we're going to do is take and go to mask
edge<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:50.219> what<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:50.999> to<00:01:51.060> allow<00:01:51.149> us

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
edge and what that's going to allow us

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.109 
edge and what that's going to allow us
to<00:01:51.419> do<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.749> really<00:01:52.109> refine<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:53.399> selection<00:01:53.969> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
to do is really refine this selection of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.539 
to do is really refine this selection of
her<00:01:54.240> hair<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.709> the<00:01:55.709> rest<00:01:55.889> of<00:01:56.009> our<00:01:56.069> body<00:01:56.279> but

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
her hair and the rest of our body but

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.569 
her hair and the rest of our body but
specifically<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.419> hair<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.929> tutorial

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
specifically the hair in this tutorial

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.129 
specifically the hair in this tutorial
so<00:01:59.579> what<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.029> first<00:02:00.179> thing<00:02:00.419> you<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.959> this

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139 
so what the first thing you have in this

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.800 
so what the first thing you have in this
box<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.039> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.459> the<00:02:02.609> views<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.209> so<00:02:03.749> you

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
box is going to be the views and so you

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.239 
box is going to be the views and so you
can<00:02:04.020> see<00:02:04.169> that<00:02:04.349> when<00:02:04.529> I<00:02:04.560> click<00:02:04.649> through<00:02:05.039> these

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
can see that when I click through these

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.639 
can see that when I click through these
you<00:02:05.669> have<00:02:05.789> a<00:02:05.819> bunch<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.209> different<00:02:06.569> views<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you have a bunch of different views you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
you have a bunch of different views you
can<00:02:07.829> look<00:02:08.039> at<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.310> image<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
can look at this image for but the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.880 
can look at this image for but the
bottom<00:02:09.840> three<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.170> probably<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.800> be

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
bottom three are probably going to be

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.820 
bottom three are probably going to be
the<00:02:11.340> best<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.239> help<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.410> black<00:02:13.620> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the best to help you so the black and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.710 
the best to help you so the black and
white<00:02:13.950> basically<00:02:14.400> shows<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.970> black<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
white basically shows you a black and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810 
white basically shows you a black and
white<00:02:15.840> version<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.260> your<00:02:16.650> selection<00:02:17.130> then<00:02:17.730> you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
white version of your selection then you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.870 
white version of your selection then you
have<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.240> layers<00:02:18.540> what

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
have the on layers what

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.360 
have the on layers what
your<00:02:19.060> final<00:02:19.680> version<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.860> then<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.070> have<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
your final version and then you have the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.270 
your final version and then you have the
review<00:02:21.640> layer<00:02:21.850> which<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.390> original<00:02:23.280> so

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
review layer which is the original so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.340 
review layer which is the original so
the<00:02:24.630> first<00:02:25.630> thing<00:02:25.780> we're<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.050> do<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.260> go

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
the first thing we're going to do is go

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.540 
the first thing we're going to do is go
to<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.530> black<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.010> white<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.370> then<00:02:27.490> I'm

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
to this black and white and then I'm

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.130 
to this black and white and then I'm
just<00:02:27.580> going<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.820> click<00:02:28.030> off<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.720> apply<00:02:29.080> it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
just going to click off this to apply it

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.020 
just going to click off this to apply it
and<00:02:29.410> then<00:02:30.250> we're<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.670> take<00:02:30.820> and

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and then we're just going to take and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.200 
and then we're just going to take and
drag<00:02:31.270> up<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.630> radius<00:02:32.170> radius<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.430> for<00:02:33.940> edge

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
drag up this radius radius here for edge

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.040 
drag up this radius radius here for edge
detection<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.680> I'm<00:02:35.740> just<00:02:35.950> going<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.160> take<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
detection so I'm just going to take and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
detection so I'm just going to take and
drag<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.230> somewhere<00:02:38.680> around<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.010> middle

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
drag that up somewhere around the middle

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.980 
drag that up somewhere around the middle
and<00:02:39.430> what<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.180> see<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:40.660> already

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
and what you can see is it's already

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.900 
and what you can see is it's already
started<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.530> change<00:02:41.560> how<00:02:42.310> we've<00:02:42.550> used<00:02:42.580> that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
started to change how we've used that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.400 
started to change how we've used that
hair<00:02:43.180> instead<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.600> being<00:02:43.780> blocking<00:02:44.290> out

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
hair instead of being blocking out

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.630 
hair instead of being blocking out
starting<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.800> find<00:02:45.010> each<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.340> those<00:02:45.430> little

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
starting to find each of those little

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.580 
starting to find each of those little
individual<00:02:46.210> hairs<00:02:46.270> have<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.110> turn<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.440> smart

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
individual hairs have you turn on smart

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.100 
individual hairs have you turn on smart
radius<00:02:47.770> is<00:02:48.160> going<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.430> find<00:02:48.730> an<00:02:49.600> even<00:02:49.780> better

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
radius is going to find an even better

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.710 
radius is going to find an even better
selection<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.740> those<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.970> if<00:02:52.030> we<00:02:52.150> go<00:02:52.270> back<00:02:52.480> to

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
selection of those so if we go back to

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.510 
selection of those so if we go back to
our<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.020> layers<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:53.950> can<00:02:54.010> see<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.400> it's

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
our on layers you can see that it's

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.670 
our on layers you can see that it's
already<00:02:54.790> starting<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.120> get<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.300> little<00:02:55.420> better

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
already starting to get a little better

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.080 
already starting to get a little better
so<00:02:56.680> we're<00:02:56.860> still<00:02:57.040> missing<00:02:57.190> quite<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.610> bit<00:02:57.910> of

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
so we're still missing quite a bit of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.780 
so we're still missing quite a bit of
the<00:02:58.510> hair<00:02:58.780> though<00:02:59.050> if<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.380> go<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.590> our<00:02:59.920> on<00:03:00.490> white

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the hair though if we go to our on white

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.390 
the hair though if we go to our on white
and<00:03:01.030> then<00:03:01.660> our<00:03:01.930> original<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:03.160> can<00:03:03.190> see

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
and then our original you can see

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.620 
and then our original you can see
there's<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.670> lot<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.030> hair<00:03:04.210> that<00:03:04.390> we're<00:03:04.510> missing

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
there's a lot of hair that we're missing

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.720 
there's a lot of hair that we're missing
out<00:03:04.960> on<00:03:04.990> so<00:03:05.980> we're<00:03:06.100> going<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.280> leave<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.520> on<00:03:06.580> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
out on so we're going to leave it on the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.250 
out on so we're going to leave it on the
reveal<00:03:07.030> layer<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.570> we're<00:03:07.990> going<00:03:08.020> to<00:03:08.140> make

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
reveal layer and we're going to make

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.360 
reveal layer and we're going to make
sure<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:08.620> have<00:03:08.770> this<00:03:08.950> little<00:03:09.190> tool<00:03:09.340> here

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
sure that we have this little tool here

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.160 
sure that we have this little tool here
selected<00:03:10.060> that's<00:03:10.240> called<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.570> refine<00:03:10.930> radius

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
selected that's called the refine radius

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.260 
selected that's called the refine radius
tool<00:03:11.410> what<00:03:12.310> we're<00:03:12.400> going<00:03:12.520> to<00:03:12.550> do<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:12.880> basically

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
tool what we're going to do is basically

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.530 
tool what we're going to do is basically
just<00:03:13.420> try<00:03:13.960> and<00:03:14.050> highlight<00:03:14.350> around<00:03:15.150> all<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.210> the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
just try and highlight around all of the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.660 
just try and highlight around all of the
hair<00:03:16.780> that's<00:03:17.620> up<00:03:17.860> at<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.070> top<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.490> I'm<00:03:18.550> just

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
hair that's up at the top so I'm just

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.010 
hair that's up at the top so I'm just
going<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.880> try<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.210> get<00:03:19.300> a<00:03:19.330> quick<00:03:19.570> selection

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
going to try and get a quick selection

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.310 
going to try and get a quick selection
here<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.540> you're<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.690> trying<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.990> get<00:03:23.110> all

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
here and you're just trying to get all

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.260 
here and you're just trying to get all
of<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.040> area<00:03:24.400> now<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.790> doesn't<00:03:25.030> matter<00:03:25.150> if

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
of this area now it doesn't matter if

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.460 
of this area now it doesn't matter if
you<00:03:25.330> get<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.510> little<00:03:25.720> bit<00:03:25.810> into<00:03:25.960> the<00:03:26.080> white<00:03:26.230> just

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
you get a little bit into the white just

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.000 
you get a little bit into the white just
try<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.740> stay<00:03:27.550> near<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.880> hair<00:03:28.090> but<00:03:28.930> any<00:03:29.080> white

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
try and stay near the hair but any white

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.070 
try and stay near the hair but any white
that<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:30.400> surrounded<00:03:31.060> by<00:03:31.090> hair<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.020> should

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
that is surrounded by hair you should

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.990 
that is surrounded by hair you should
probably<00:03:32.470> go<00:03:32.920> over<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.520> can<00:03:33.640> add<00:03:33.820> that

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
probably go over so that it can add that

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.450 
probably go over so that it can add that
into<00:03:34.240> the<00:03:34.360> selection<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.680> judge<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.370> it

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
into the selection and judge that it

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.850 
into the selection and judge that it
shouldn't<00:03:36.730> be<00:03:36.910> there<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:38.560> we're<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:38.710> trying

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
shouldn't be there so we're just trying

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.250 
shouldn't be there so we're just trying
to<00:03:39.040> get<00:03:39.130> all<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.490> little<00:03:39.730> wisps<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:40.240> hair<00:03:40.300> and

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
to get all the little wisps of hair and

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.830 
to get all the little wisps of hair and
it<00:03:42.040> will<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.580> able<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.880> detect<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.450> it's

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
it will be able to detect that it's

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.500 
it will be able to detect that it's
different<00:03:44.230> than<00:03:44.620> what's<00:03:44.800> around<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:46.180> so

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
different than what's around it and so

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.670 
different than what's around it and so
once<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.810> have<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.050> pretty<00:03:47.320> good<00:03:47.470> selection

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
once you have a pretty good selection

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.440 
once you have a pretty good selection
you<00:03:47.980> can<00:03:48.100> come<00:03:48.280> somewhere<00:03:48.790> up<00:03:48.910> around<00:03:49.060> here

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
you can come somewhere up around here

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.400 
you can come somewhere up around here
just<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.810> make<00:03:49.930> sure<00:03:49.990> you've<00:03:50.230> gotten

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
just to make sure you've gotten

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.050 
just to make sure you've gotten
everything<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:51.490> we're<00:03:51.730> just<00:03:51.790> going<00:03:52.000> to

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
everything and we're just going to

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.210 
everything and we're just going to
release<00:03:52.420> now<00:03:53.350> you're<00:03:53.470> not<00:03:53.590> going<00:03:53.740> to<00:03:53.830> see<00:03:53.980> any

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
release now you're not going to see any

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.040 
release now you're not going to see any
difference<00:03:54.340> right<00:03:54.940> here<00:03:55.270> but<00:03:55.810> once<00:03:55.990> you

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
difference right here but once you

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.770 
difference right here but once you
change<00:03:56.350> your<00:03:56.440> review<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:57.730> save<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.360> black<00:03:58.540> and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
change your review to save the black and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.940 
change your review to save the black and
white<00:03:58.900> mode<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.290> can<00:03:59.410> see<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.680> we<00:03:59.770> have<00:03:59.920> a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
white mode you can see that we have a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.010 
white mode you can see that we have a
much<00:04:00.250> better<00:04:00.520> selection<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.240> hair<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.630> if

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
much better selection of the hair and if

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.660 
much better selection of the hair and if
you<00:04:02.110> go<00:04:02.230> back<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.709> on<00:04:02.860> layer<00:04:03.130> mode<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.520> can

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
you go back to the on layer mode you can

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you go back to the on layer mode you can
see<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:03.940> we<00:04:04.030> have<00:04:04.150> an<00:04:04.240> even<00:04:04.510> better

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
see that we have an even better

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.570 
see that we have an even better
selection<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:05.800> I'm<00:04:05.860> just<00:04:05.980> going<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.160> click<00:04:06.400> OK

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
selection so I'm just going to click OK

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.210 
selection so I'm just going to click OK
to<00:04:06.880> apply<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.510> but<00:04:07.900> before<00:04:08.320> I<00:04:08.350> do<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.770> can<00:04:09.010> just

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
to apply that but before I do I can just

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.850 
to apply that but before I do I can just
mention<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.730> have<00:04:09.940> all<00:04:10.240> these<00:04:10.450> other

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
mention that you have all these other

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.960 
mention that you have all these other
different<00:04:11.860> options<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.520> smoothing

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
different options you have smoothing

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.640 
different options you have smoothing
feathering<00:04:13.270> contrast<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.140> shifting<00:04:14.500> edge

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
feathering contrast and shifting edge

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.830 
feathering contrast and shifting edge
which<00:04:14.950> basically<00:04:15.250> brings<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.270> in<00:04:16.420> further

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
which basically brings it in further

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.810 
which basically brings it in further
closer<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.650> her<00:04:17.739> head<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.160> then<00:04:18.250> further<00:04:18.520> out

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
closer to her head and then further out

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.910 
closer to her head and then further out
depending<00:04:19.780> on<00:04:19.900> which<00:04:20.020> way<00:04:20.170> you<00:04:20.230> push<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:20.709> and

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
depending on which way you push that and

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.250 
depending on which way you push that and
you<00:04:21.010> can<00:04:21.160> also<00:04:21.750> decontaminate<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.900> colors

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
you can also decontaminate the colors

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.840 
you can also decontaminate the colors
such<00:04:23.530> as<00:04:23.680> if<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.890> were<00:04:24.010> using<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.370> green<00:04:24.580> screen

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
such as if you were using a green screen

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.710 
such as if you were using a green screen
and<00:04:24.970> there<00:04:25.300> was<00:04:25.420> a<00:04:25.450> green<00:04:25.870> tint<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.340> hair

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
and there was a green tint to the hair

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.140 
and there was a green tint to the hair
so<00:04:28.720> I'm<00:04:28.960> just<00:04:29.080> going<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.260> click<00:04:29.500> OK<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.220> that's

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
so I'm just going to click OK and that's

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.640 
so I'm just going to click OK and that's
going<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.419> apply<00:04:31.750> that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
going to apply that

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.290 
going to apply that
you<00:04:32.800> can<00:04:32.919> see<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.190> added<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.639> into<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.970> layer

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
you can see that I added it into a layer

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.180 
you can see that I added it into a layer
mask<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:34.840> if<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.050> wanted<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.350> click<00:04:35.830> on<00:04:35.979> this

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
mask so if you wanted to click on this

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.189 
mask so if you wanted to click on this
and<00:04:36.400> then<00:04:36.790> paint<00:04:37.090> with<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.270> paintbrush<00:04:37.720> black

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
and then paint with a paintbrush black

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.990 
and then paint with a paintbrush black
or<00:04:38.410> white<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:38.740> can<00:04:38.919> add<00:04:39.100> or<00:04:39.280> subtract<00:04:39.699> from

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
or white you can add or subtract from

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.480 
or white you can add or subtract from
what<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.300> already<00:04:40.330> have<00:04:41.190> but<00:04:42.190> what<00:04:42.280> I'm<00:04:42.370> going

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
what you already have but what I'm going

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.529 
what you already have but what I'm going
to<00:04:42.550> show<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.699> is<00:04:42.940> I'm<00:04:43.090> just<00:04:43.120> going<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.360> zoom

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
to show you is I'm just going to zoom

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.390 
to show you is I'm just going to zoom
out<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:44.380> can<00:04:44.500> see<00:04:44.620> we<00:04:44.740> have<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.889> pretty<00:04:45.220> good

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
out you can see we have a pretty good

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.430 
out you can see we have a pretty good
selection<00:04:45.699> of<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.060> hair<00:04:46.240> there<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.690> if<00:04:47.350> you

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
selection of the hair there and if you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.870 
selection of the hair there and if you
take<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:47.919> you<00:04:48.070> can<00:04:48.220> duplicate<00:04:48.669> this<00:04:48.820> layer

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
take and you can duplicate this layer

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.990 
take and you can duplicate this layer
and<00:04:49.330> then<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.930> really<00:04:50.560> makes<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:51.340> effect<00:04:51.580> work

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
and then it really makes the effect work

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.640 
and then it really makes the effect work
a<00:04:52.210> lot<00:04:52.389> better<00:04:52.600> if<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:52.960> duplicate<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.590> layer

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
a lot better if you duplicate that layer

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.439 
a lot better if you duplicate that layer
and<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:53.979> can<00:04:54.070> see<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.520> added<00:04:54.880> in<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.210> bunch

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
and you can see that added in a bunch

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.020 
and you can see that added in a bunch
more<00:04:55.509> color<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:56.710> had<00:04:56.860> been<00:04:57.039> lost<00:04:57.250> previously

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
more color that had been lost previously

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.610 
more color that had been lost previously
you<00:04:58.600> can<00:04:58.750> see<00:04:58.990> right<00:04:59.199> there

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
you can see right there

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.219 
you can see right there
so<00:05:00.550> by<00:05:00.699> doing<00:05:00.759> that<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:01.330> have<00:05:01.539> a<00:05:01.570> pretty<00:05:01.960> good

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
so by doing that you have a pretty good

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.570 
so by doing that you have a pretty good
selection<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.740> hair<00:05:02.919> much<00:05:03.130> better<00:05:03.400> than

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
selection of the hair much better than

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.210 
selection of the hair much better than
you<00:05:03.669> would<00:05:03.699> get<00:05:03.910> with<00:05:03.970> other<00:05:04.300> methods<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.710> I

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
you would get with other methods and I

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.379 
you would get with other methods and I
