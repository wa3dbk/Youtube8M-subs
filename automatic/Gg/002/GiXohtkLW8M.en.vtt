specific<00:00:01.560> heat<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:02.100> metal<00:00:02.840> this<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:03.990> our

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
specific heat of a metal this is our

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:16.929 
specific heat of a metal this is our
motto<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.920> we<00:00:05.190> need<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.520> know<00:00:05.700> its<00:00:06.240> mass

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.150 

okay<00:00:28.759> now<00:00:30.109> we're<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.259> to<00:00:31.380> heat<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.800> metal

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
okay now we're going to heat the metal

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.000 
okay now we're going to heat the metal
in<00:00:32.420> hot<00:00:33.420> water<00:00:33.600> bath<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.440> we're<00:00:34.829> going

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
in hot water bath and then we're going

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.869 
in hot water bath and then we're going
to<00:00:35.100> transfer<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.970> calorimeter<00:00:36.720> with<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
calorimeter we tear it and then we pour

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.650 
calorimeter we tear it and then we pour
the<00:00:48.150> water

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:12.050

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
stay for couple of minutes and we're

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.610 
stay for couple of minutes and we're
going<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.640> measure<00:02:25.790> also<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.870> temperature<00:02:27.409> of

the temperature is 96.5 tic saljem so

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.119 
the temperature is 96.5 tic saljem so
the<00:03:16.440> temperature<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:17.480> boiling<00:03:18.480> water<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:20.360> 96.0

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.880 
calcium which are record in the report
sheet<00:03:27.440> now<00:03:28.440> we're<00:03:29.280> gonna<00:03:30.290> transfer<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.500> metal

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
sheet now we're gonna transfer the metal

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.630 
sheet now we're gonna transfer the metal
into<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.580> calorimeter<00:03:37.190> we're<00:03:38.190> going<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.459> blow

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
into the calorimeter we're going to blow

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.050 
into the calorimeter we're going to blow
dry<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:38.970> metal<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.900> doesn't<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.709> any

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
dry the metal so it doesn't have any

00:03:41.060 --> 00:04:27.230 
dry the metal so it doesn't have any
water<00:03:42.470> droplets

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.900 

okay<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.319> temperature<00:04:28.889> of<00:04:29.069> the<00:04:29.280> water<00:04:29.310> and

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
okay the temperature of the water and

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.180 
okay the temperature of the water and
the<00:04:30.240> metal<00:04:30.509> in<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.710> calorimeter<00:04:32.240> reach<00:04:33.240> 25

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
the metal in the calorimeter reach 25

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.439 
the metal in the calorimeter reach 25
degree<00:04:35.190> Celsius<00:04:36.139> so<00:04:37.789> final<00:04:38.789> temperature<00:04:39.150> of

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
degree Celsius so final temperature of

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.659 
degree Celsius so final temperature of
the<00:04:39.569> water<00:04:39.599> in<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.229> calorimeter<00:04:40.680> after<00:04:41.490> we

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
the water in the calorimeter after we

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.110 
the water in the calorimeter after we
added<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.150> metal<00:04:42.539> is<00:04:44.090> 25.0<00:04:45.090> degree<00:04:45.690> Celsius

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
added the metal is 25.0 degree Celsius

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.779 
added the metal is 25.0 degree Celsius
so<00:04:48.120> from<00:04:48.660> this<00:04:49.199> we<00:04:51.560> can<00:04:52.560> see<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.160> temperature

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
so from this we can see the temperature

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.629 
so from this we can see the temperature
change<00:04:54.240> in<00:04:54.599> the<00:04:54.720> calorimeter<00:04:55.229> is<00:04:57.199> 25-21

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
change in the calorimeter is 25-21

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.770 
change in the calorimeter is 25-21
before<00:04:59.639> we<00:04:59.970> added<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.449> metal<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.620> is<00:05:01.919> four

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
before we added the metal so it is four

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.890 
before we added the metal so it is four
point<00:05:03.780> zero<00:05:04.130> degrees<00:05:05.130> f<00:05:05.569> what<00:05:06.569> is<00:05:06.750> the

point zero degrees f what is the
temperature<00:05:07.229> change<00:05:07.860> of<00:05:08.159> the<00:05:08.310> metal<00:05:08.639> sample

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
temperature change of the metal sample

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.550 
temperature change of the metal sample
the<00:05:10.710> metal<00:05:11.069> initially<00:05:11.580> was<00:05:11.789> at<00:05:12.030> 96<00:05:12.810> degrees

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
the metal initially was at 96 degrees

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.620 
the metal initially was at 96 degrees
Celsius<00:05:14.039> the<00:05:14.280> same<00:05:14.550> as<00:05:14.819> the<00:05:15.090> boiling<00:05:15.419> water

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
Celsius the same as the boiling water

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.279 
Celsius the same as the boiling water
then<00:05:16.520> we<00:05:17.520> put<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.940> in<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.389> calorimeter<00:05:18.870> and

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
then we put it in the calorimeter and

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.070 
then we put it in the calorimeter and
the<00:05:19.470> temperature<00:05:19.889> dropped<00:05:20.250> to<00:05:20.720> 25<00:05:21.720> degrees

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
the temperature dropped to 25 degrees

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.710 
the temperature dropped to 25 degrees

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
calorie per gram per degree salad so we

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.149 
calorie per gram per degree salad so we
can<00:06:14.400> calculate<00:06:14.639> that<00:06:15.180> very<00:06:15.599> easy<00:06:16.159> the

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
calories lost by the metal is the same

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.930 
calories lost by the metal is the same

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
then the calories gained by the water so

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.080 
then the calories gained by the water so
once<00:06:24.449> we<00:06:24.659> calculate<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.650> calories<00:06:26.610> gang<00:06:26.880> by

we know that heat lost by the metal at
the<00:06:46.740> same<00:06:46.949> time<00:06:47.220> is<00:06:47.490> equal<00:06:47.880> to<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:48.330> mass<00:06:48.540> of

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
metal we know the heat loss by the metal

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.469 
metal we know the heat loss by the metal
because<00:07:01.500> it<00:07:01.800> is<00:07:02.010> the<00:07:02.160> same<00:07:02.370> as<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.940> heat<00:07:03.150> gain

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
because it is the same as the heat gain

because it is the same as the heat gain
by<00:07:03.720> the<00:07:03.780> water<00:07:04.699> okay<00:07:05.699> we<00:07:06.060> know<00:07:06.210> the<00:07:06.479> mass<00:07:06.510> of

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
temperature change of the metal so we

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.900 
temperature change of the metal so we
