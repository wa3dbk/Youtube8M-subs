there so this tool comes with the
canister<00:00:54.899> vacuum<00:00:55.260> cleaner<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.340> designed

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
canister vacuum cleaner it is designed

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.360 
canister vacuum cleaner it is designed
so<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.390> always<00:00:57.870> remaining<00:00:58.739> flat<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
so it's always remaining flat on a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.150 
so it's always remaining flat on a
surface<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.930> come<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.500> wall<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:02.070> an

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
surface so if we come up to a wall at an

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
surface so if we come up to a wall at an
angle<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.670> could<00:01:02.820> turn<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.329> wand<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.899> we'll

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
angle we could turn the wand and we'll

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.390 
angle we could turn the wand and we'll
go<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.409> against<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> edge<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.250> could

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
go right up against the edge we could

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730 
go right up against the edge we could
turn<00:01:05.489> 180<00:01:06.000> degrees<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.439> low

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
turn 180 degrees we can actually go low

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.140 
turn 180 degrees we can actually go low
underneath<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> bed<00:01:08.580> or<00:01:08.760> something<00:01:08.790> like

underneath the bed or something like

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
underneath the bed or something like
that<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.659> great<00:01:10.049> tool<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.920> sell<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.189> of
