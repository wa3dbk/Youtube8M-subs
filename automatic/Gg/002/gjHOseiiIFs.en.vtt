and he told me I could have it if I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.089 
and he told me I could have it if I
wanted<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.679> so<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.160> brought<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.000> home<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.670 
wanted it so I brought it home and
plugged<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.220> in<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.700> nothing<00:00:33.510> seemed<00:00:33.810> to<00:00:33.930> work

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
plugged it in and nothing seemed to work

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.660 
plugged it in and nothing seemed to work
after<00:00:35.550> pressing<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> transmitter<00:00:37.200> button

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
after pressing the transmitter button

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.310 
after pressing the transmitter button
several<00:00:38.670> times<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.450> after<00:00:40.140> about<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
several times and then after about the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.650 
several times and then after about the
sixth<00:00:40.740> or<00:00:40.830> seventh<00:00:41.190> time<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.060> opener<00:00:42.420> did

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
sixth or seventh time the opener did

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.590 
sixth or seventh time the opener did
start<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.830> was<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.070> intermittent<00:00:44.850> so

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
start up but it was very intermittent so

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.950 
start up but it was very intermittent so
what<00:00:46.080> I<00:00:46.110> did<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> took<00:00:46.950> off<00:00:47.130> the<00:00:47.160> cover<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:48.510> I

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
what I did is I took off the cover and I

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.800 
what I did is I took off the cover and I
looked<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> motor<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:51.060> discovered

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
looked at the motor and I discovered

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.950 
looked at the motor and I discovered
that<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.060> capacitor<00:00:54.060> which<00:00:54.540> is<00:00:54.720> right<00:00:54.930> here

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that the capacitor which is right here

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.000 
that the capacitor which is right here
the<00:00:55.890> capacitor<00:00:56.580> was<00:00:56.760> very<00:00:57.060> corroded<00:00:57.810> and<00:00:58.010> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the capacitor was very corroded and I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.390 
the capacitor was very corroded and I
suspected<00:00:59.580> that<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.970> was<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.690> fault<00:01:01.110> so<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
suspected that this was the fault so I

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.189 
suspected that this was the fault so I
went<00:01:02.880> ahead<00:01:02.970> and<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.330> went<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> local

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
went ahead and I went to the local

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.090 
went ahead and I went to the local
overhead<00:01:04.679> door<00:01:04.859> company<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.579> area<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.119> I

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
overhead door company in my area and I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
overhead door company in my area and I
purchased<00:01:08.100> another<00:01:08.659> capacitor<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.899> about

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
purchased another capacitor for about

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.620 
purchased another capacitor for about
sixteen<00:01:10.469> dollars<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.609> I<00:01:11.700> came<00:01:11.939> home<00:01:12.149> and<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
sixteen dollars and I came home and I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.520 
sixteen dollars and I came home and I
put<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.649> this<00:01:13.920> motor<00:01:14.579> overhead<00:01:15.030> here

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
put it in to this motor overhead here

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
put it in to this motor overhead here
and<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.859> went<00:01:17.070> ahead<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> hooked<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:17.969> and<00:01:18.240> it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and I went ahead and hooked it up and it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.230 
and I went ahead and hooked it up and it
appears<00:01:18.929> to<00:01:19.109> be<00:01:19.229> working<00:01:19.409> fine<00:01:19.859> so<00:01:20.219> I'm<00:01:20.999> going

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
appears to be working fine so I'm going

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
appears to be working fine so I'm going
to<00:01:21.329> demonstrate<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:22.289> this<00:01:22.439> video<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.520> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
to demonstrate with this video this is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.760 
to demonstrate with this video this is
the<00:01:23.939> push-button<00:01:24.810> transmitter<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.530> don't<00:01:25.710> know

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the push-button transmitter I don't know

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
the push-button transmitter I don't know
if<00:01:25.829> you<00:01:25.920> could<00:01:26.070> see<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.429> with<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.829> lighting<00:01:28.829> in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
if you could see it with the lighting in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.590 
if you could see it with the lighting in
here<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.399> I'm<00:01:29.520> gonna<00:01:29.640> push<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.119> button<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
here but I'm gonna push the button and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.110 
here but I'm gonna push the button and
we'll<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.469> it<00:01:31.499> does

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.050 

very<00:01:37.120> smooth<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.040> very<00:01:39.250> quiet<00:01:39.550> garage

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
very smooth it's a very quiet garage

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.990 
very smooth it's a very quiet garage
door<00:01:40.390> opener

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.510 

and<00:01:45.140> let's<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.320> we'll<00:01:46.500> run<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> again<00:01:47.130> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and let's see we'll run it again here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999 
and let's see we'll run it again here
here's<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.939> picture<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> push-button<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
here's a picture of the push-button that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.490 
here's a picture of the push-button that
there<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> better<00:01:50.880> light<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.539> I'm

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
there it is in the better light here I'm

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.609 
there it is in the better light here I'm
gonna<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.770> ahead<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.009> push<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.520> button<00:01:53.549> again

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.559 

as<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.069> see<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.579> seems<00:02:02.819> to<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.149> working

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
as you can see it seems to be working

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.350 
as you can see it seems to be working
very<00:02:03.600> well

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.810 

I<00:02:08.470> really<00:02:09.470> like<00:02:09.649> how<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.070> machine<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.729> very

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
I really like how this machine is very

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.410 
I really like how this machine is very
quiet<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.600> smooth<00:02:11.930> operating<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:14.150> guess

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
quiet and smooth operating so I guess

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.240 
quiet and smooth operating so I guess
this<00:02:14.570> concludes<00:02:15.050> my<00:02:15.260> video<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.010> my<00:02:16.130> first

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
this concludes my video this is my first

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.430 
this concludes my video this is my first
garage<00:02:16.790> door<00:02:17.000> opener<00:02:17.240> video<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.840> I'm<00:02:18.230> very
