me on Twitter and I don't say anything

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.060 
me on Twitter and I don't say anything
negative<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:45.899> towards<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> 49ers<00:00:46.890> ever

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
negative at all towards the 49ers ever

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.549 
negative at all towards the 49ers ever
but<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.510> love<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.170> hate<00:00:49.320> and
