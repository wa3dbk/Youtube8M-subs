00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.520 
for only 399 not too bad of a deal right
there<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.480> was<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.809> main<00:00:36.960> reason<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.350> went

there that was the main reason I went

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
there that was the main reason I went
after<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.160> believe<00:00:38.550> they<00:00:38.700> did<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> same

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
after and I believe they did the same

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.420 
after and I believe they did the same
thing<00:00:39.300> with<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> original<00:00:40.649> bites<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.250> they

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
off the bat you can tell just by the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.109 
off the bat you can tell just by the
color<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.140> i<00:01:04.170> mean<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.680> has<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> slight<00:01:05.850> off

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
color of it i mean it has a slight off

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
like oranges hint to it but it's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.740 
like oranges hint to it but it's
definitely<00:01:08.400> nothing<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> picture

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
around a while it definitely changes

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.390

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
like oh my god these are super spicy

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.759 
like oh my god these are super spicy
amazing<00:02:27.579> this<00:02:27.730> definitely<00:02:28.480> not<00:02:28.750> my<00:02:29.560> main

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
amazing this definitely not my main

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.380 
amazing this definitely not my main
guess<00:02:30.040> would<00:02:30.190> be<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.549> a<00:02:30.640> cayenne<00:02:31.060> pepper

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
guess would be it's a cayenne pepper

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.150 
guess would be it's a cayenne pepper
breading<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.230> makes<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.799> little<00:02:32.950> bit

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
breading that makes it a little bit

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.620 
breading that makes it a little bit
different<00:02:33.549> that<00:02:33.610> adds<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.060> little<00:02:34.150> bit<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.390> heat

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
different that adds a little bit of heat

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.150 
different that adds a little bit of heat
because<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.959> definitely<00:02:35.170> creeps<00:02:35.680> up<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.099> you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
because it definitely creeps up on you

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.520 
because it definitely creeps up on you
and<00:02:36.489> but<00:02:37.090> once<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.450> reaches<00:02:37.720> its<00:02:37.900> peak<00:02:38.019> it's

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and but once it reaches its peak it's

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.699 
and but once it reaches its peak it's
not<00:02:38.920> really<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.430> spicy<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.299> if<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.260> did<00:02:41.500> have

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
not really that spicy and if I did have

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.410 
not really that spicy and if I did have
to<00:02:41.769> choose<00:02:42.160> between<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.730> two<00:02:42.910> even<00:02:43.299> though<00:02:43.389> I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
to choose between the two even though I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.259 
to choose between the two even though I
rarely<00:02:43.780> ever<00:02:44.019> eat<00:02:44.500> at<00:02:44.620> KFC<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.370> would
