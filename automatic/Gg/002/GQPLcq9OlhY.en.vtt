 I sit on the floor 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.620
 I lift my leg and what I do is turn 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.650
 one side and turn the other here you have to 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.740
 be holding a minute is worth a 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.380
 side and another 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 remember in a minute 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.590
 here so that the whole trunk is 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.010
 move if you find it very difficult to support 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.610
 the feet and here 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.070
 but humble we go to the third 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 squat with vicens let's go back to 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.450
 catch the dumbbells 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.980
 we place along the body we go down 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.680
 doing a squat but when I go up 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.679
 I do biceps according here 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.560
 low and his throwing always got to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.560
 back and there we go down 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.590
 here's worth next we're going to do 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.590
 abdominals with the medicine ball 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.630
 here we will take and extend 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:34.450
 completely the ball back and I 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.520
 shrink is good here we take 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.760

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.930
 one minute 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.790
 for the last 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.040
 fear of deadlift with the dumbbell 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.450
 here we are going to work femoral but 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.599
 apart from the balance you have to 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.250
 get to stand on one leg 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.969
 okay and we're going to tilt the trunk 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.810
 forward 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.810
 mean here 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.950
 OK 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.159
 here we will work the femoral and apart the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.609
 balance here 30 seconds with a 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.109
 leg and 30 seconds with another earth me 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.689
 I'm going to put on the side like that 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.689
 you can see the movement better 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.010
 here we look for the balance and we throw the 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.569
 trunk forward 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.569
 here it's worth 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.010
 it would be 30 seconds with one leg and 30 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.049
 seconds with the other one because this is 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.180
 our toning circuit has 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.670
 liked let's remember what we have 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.420
 fact has been five exercises of a 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.989
 minute that consists of short strides with 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.040
 dumbbells twist abdomen with the ball 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.680

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.680
 raising the fourth extension with biceps 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.290
 and contraction of the abdomen and the fifth 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.000
 deadlift with dumbbells to one leg 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.099
 if you want to achieve your goals 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.129
 you have to do it at least three times a 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.590
 the week remember if you are intermediate 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.049

 seconds and it has just started 30 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.090
