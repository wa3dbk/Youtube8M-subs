00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
and you're just gonna slide that up to

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:49.180 
and you're just gonna slide that up to
the<00:06:38.449> third<00:06:47.439> and<00:06:48.439> then<00:06:48.469> when<00:06:48.680> you<00:06:48.770> get<00:06:48.919> here<00:06:49.159> a

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
the third and then when you get here a

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.390 
the third and then when you get here a
second<00:06:49.639> time<00:06:49.930> go<00:06:50.930> back<00:06:51.139> to<00:06:51.319> the<00:06:51.500> major<00:06:51.889> seventh

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400
