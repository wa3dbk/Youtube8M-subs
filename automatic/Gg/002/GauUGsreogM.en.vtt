00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
is I always start from the back and go

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329 
is I always start from the back and go
to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.210> front<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.530> take<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.890> curling<00:01:05.159> iron

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to the front and I take my curling iron

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.380 
to the front and I take my curling iron
this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> one-inch<00:01:06.710> okay<00:01:08.150> it's<00:01:09.150> not

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
this is about a one-inch okay it's not

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.000 
this is about a one-inch okay it's not
the<00:01:09.689> best<00:01:09.840> quality<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.650> works<00:01:10.799> perfectly

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the best quality but it works perfectly

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.510 
the best quality but it works perfectly
fine<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.200> curl<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.830> wrapping<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> around

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
fine and I curl it wrapping it around

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
fine and I curl it wrapping it around
the<00:01:14.939> barrel<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.420> find<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> wrap<00:01:15.990> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the barrel I find when you wrap it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.770 
the barrel I find when you wrap it
around<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.680> makes<00:01:16.890> them<00:01:17.310> looser<00:01:18.090> curls<00:01:18.540> which

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
around it makes them looser curls which

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.820 
around it makes them looser curls which
I<00:01:18.960> prefer<00:01:19.320> personally<00:01:19.970> over<00:01:20.970> tight<00:01:21.540> curls<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
I prefer personally over tight curls and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.880 
I prefer personally over tight curls and
I<00:01:23.159> hold<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.909> about<00:01:24.030> 10<00:01:24.509> seconds<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:28.740> let

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
I hold it for about 10 seconds and I let

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.999 
I hold it for about 10 seconds and I let
it<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> nice<00:01:29.939> curl<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.689> this

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
it go and you get a nice curl like this

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.550 
it go and you get a nice curl like this
so<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> key<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.880> how<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> curl<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.810> hair<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
so the key to how I curl my hair is that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.490 
so the key to how I curl my hair is that
I<00:01:34.590> curl<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.280> opposite<00:01:35.909> directions<00:01:36.500> which

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
I curl the in opposite directions which

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.710 
I curl the in opposite directions which
makes<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> curls<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:39.150> don't<00:01:39.540> become

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
makes it so the curls all don't become

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.749 
makes it so the curls all don't become
uniform<00:01:40.320> together<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.250> makes<00:01:41.430> your<00:01:41.579> hair

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
uniform together and it makes your hair

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429 
uniform together and it makes your hair
look<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.090> lot<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.899> naturally

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
look a lot more like it's naturally

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.730 
look a lot more like it's naturally
curls<00:01:43.829> rather<00:01:44.100> than<00:01:44.750> really<00:01:45.750> fake<00:01:46.020> curls<00:01:46.380> so

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
curls rather than really fake curls so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
curls rather than really fake curls so
the<00:01:46.860> next<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.399> I'm<00:01:47.579> gonna<00:01:47.759> curl<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.240> wrapping

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the next one I'm gonna curl it wrapping

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.230 
the next one I'm gonna curl it wrapping
it<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.079> ward's<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.770> face<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:51.090> so

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
it to ward's my face like so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.920 
it to ward's my face like so
and<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.740> hold<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.220> for<00:01:55.549> about<00:01:55.700> 10<00:01:56.299> seconds<00:01:58.930> so

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
and I hold it for about 10 seconds so

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.170 
and I hold it for about 10 seconds so
and<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:00.560> get<00:02:00.740> another<00:02:01.070> curl<00:02:01.430> nice<00:02:01.790> throw<00:02:02.030> it

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
and you get another curl nice throw it

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.600 
and you get another curl nice throw it
behind<00:02:02.300> my<00:02:02.570> back<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.710> then<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.979> do<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.310> for<00:02:04.490> my

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
behind my back and then I do that for my

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.460 
behind my back and then I do that for my
whole<00:02:04.790> head<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.300> always<00:02:05.330> tend<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.990> do<00:02:06.170> the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
whole head I always tend to do the

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.919 
whole head I always tend to do the
underside<00:02:07.100> section<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.790> work<00:02:07.970> my<00:02:08.209> way<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.479> top

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
underside section and work my way to top

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.960 
underside section and work my way to top
to<00:02:09.050> my<00:02:09.170> head<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.619> then<00:02:10.340> do<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.729> other<00:02:10.759> side

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
to my head and then do the other side

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.660 
to my head and then do the other side
the<00:02:11.330> exact<00:02:11.630> same<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.860> I'm<00:02:13.130> just<00:02:13.280> grabbing

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
the exact same so I'm just grabbing

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.930 
the exact same so I'm just grabbing
another<00:02:14.000> section<00:02:14.600> um<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:16.010> typically<00:02:16.459> takes<00:02:16.760> me

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
another section um it typically takes me

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.180 
another section um it typically takes me
a<00:02:16.970> pretty<00:02:17.360> long<00:02:17.780> time<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.350> do<00:02:18.470> my<00:02:18.590> hair<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.160> be

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
a pretty long time to do my hair to be

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.600 
a pretty long time to do my hair to be
honest<00:02:19.640> because<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.959> have<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.470> much<00:02:21.620> hair<00:02:21.860> it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
honest because I have so much hair it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.090 
honest because I have so much hair it
thoroughly<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.390> base<00:02:23.540> short<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.800> these

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
thoroughly is the base short and these

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.640 
thoroughly is the base short and these
are<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.310> kind<00:02:25.519> of<00:02:25.580> curls<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:26.290> when<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.440> do

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
are the kind of curls that when you do

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.530 
are the kind of curls that when you do
them<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.670> sleep<00:02:28.910> on<00:02:29.120> it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
them you can sleep on it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.020 
them you can sleep on it
and<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:30.080> just<00:02:30.200> gets<00:02:30.470> looser<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.790> still

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
and it just gets looser and it still

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.350 
and it just gets looser and it still
looks<00:02:32.239> nice<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:34.459> usually<00:02:34.850> if<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:34.970> do<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.239> at

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
looks nice so usually if I do this at

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.600 
looks nice so usually if I do this at
last<00:02:35.540> me<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:36.019> three<00:02:36.500> days<00:02:36.650> clearly<00:02:36.950> wash<00:02:37.250> I

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
last me like three days clearly wash I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.290 
last me like three days clearly wash I
only<00:02:37.700> wash<00:02:37.910> my<00:02:38.060> hair<00:02:38.239> once<00:02:38.570> every<00:02:38.870> three<00:02:39.080> days

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
only wash my hair once every three days

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.759 
only wash my hair once every three days
so<00:02:41.300> I'm<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.480> doing<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.780> backside<00:02:42.050> should<00:02:42.590> now

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
so I'm just doing a backside should now

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.509 
so I'm just doing a backside should now
come<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.550> little<00:02:43.820> bit<00:02:44.000> higher<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:45.310> used<00:02:46.310> to

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
come a little bit higher I used to

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.250 
come a little bit higher I used to
section<00:02:46.940> all<00:02:47.060> my<00:02:47.180> hair<00:02:47.390> off<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.840> start<00:02:48.080> at<00:02:48.170> the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
section all my hair off and start at the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.840 
section all my hair off and start at the
very<00:02:48.440> bottom<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.950> won't<00:02:49.220> like<00:02:49.370> all<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.760> way

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
very bottom and won't like all the way

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.190 
very bottom and won't like all the way
to<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.030> top<00:02:50.239> but<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.480> find<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.840> easier<00:02:51.140> just

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
to the top but I find it easier just

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.479 
to the top but I find it easier just
divide<00:02:51.739> your<00:02:51.890> hair<00:02:52.040> in<00:02:52.250> half

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
divide your hair in half

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.290 
divide your hair in half
and<00:02:52.819> just<00:02:53.030> work<00:02:53.209> like<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.160> less<00:02:55.400> it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
and just work like that it just less it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.640 
and just work like that it just less it
just<00:02:56.510> works<00:02:56.690> for<00:02:56.810> me<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.080> used<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.350> think<00:02:57.470> it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
just works for me I used to think it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.039 
just works for me I used to think it
wouldn't<00:02:57.769> work<00:02:57.920> but<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.660> think<00:02:59.660> it<00:02:59.810> works

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
wouldn't work but I think it works

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.240 
wouldn't work but I think it works
perfectly<00:03:00.590> fine<00:03:01.130> Oh<00:03:02.620> another<00:03:03.620> key<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.190> do

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
perfectly fine Oh another key that I do

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.900 
perfectly fine Oh another key that I do
is<00:03:04.579> I<00:03:04.670> do

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
is I do

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.420 
is I do
I<00:03:05.180> don't<00:03:05.600> hairspray<00:03:06.079> in<00:03:06.140> my<00:03:06.200> hair<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.680> like<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
I don't hairspray in my hair I like the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.509 
I don't hairspray in my hair I like the
way<00:03:07.549> when<00:03:07.880> curls<00:03:08.420> fall<00:03:08.690> out<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.380> just<00:03:10.220> think<00:03:10.430> it

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
way when curls fall out I just think it

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.500 
way when curls fall out I just think it
looks<00:03:10.549> better<00:03:12.070> personally<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.269> don't

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
looks better personally so I don't

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.390 
looks better personally so I don't
pierce<00:03:14.840> very<00:03:15.110> my<00:03:15.200> hair<00:03:15.440> but<00:03:15.709> if<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.040> have<00:03:16.190> hair

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
pierce very my hair but if you have hair

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.640 
pierce very my hair but if you have hair
that<00:03:16.430> doesn't<00:03:16.880> hold<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.390> curl<00:03:17.600> at<00:03:18.079> all<00:03:18.290> I

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
that doesn't hold the curl at all I

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.650 
that doesn't hold the curl at all I
would<00:03:19.340> definitely<00:03:19.610> recommend<00:03:19.670> hairspray<00:03:20.390> I

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
would definitely recommend hairspray I

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.960 
would definitely recommend hairspray I
left<00:03:21.140> out<00:03:21.290> my<00:03:21.440> hair<00:03:21.709> holds<00:03:22.190> anything<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.940> I

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
left out my hair holds anything that I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.940 
left out my hair holds anything that I
put<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.390> basically<00:03:23.989> if<00:03:24.350> it's<00:03:24.500> straight<00:03:24.709> it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
put on it basically if it's straight it

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.680 
put on it basically if it's straight it
will<00:03:25.010> hold<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.340> straighten<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:26.269> holds<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
will hold the straighten it holds the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.289 
will hold the straighten it holds the
curl<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.079> holds<00:03:27.320> anything<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.489> never<00:03:28.790> use

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
curl it holds anything so I never use

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.910 
curl it holds anything so I never use
hairspray<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.930> don't<00:03:30.170> like<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.410> way<00:03:30.500> hairspray

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
hairspray I don't like the way hairspray

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.680 
hairspray I don't like the way hairspray
feels<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.400> my<00:03:31.430> hair<00:03:31.700> either<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.239> just<00:03:32.420> don't

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
feels in my hair either I just don't

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.680 
feels in my hair either I just don't
like<00:03:32.930> hairspray<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.769> much<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.640> never<00:03:35.120> tend

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
like hairspray that much so I never tend

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.260 
like hairspray that much so I never tend
to<00:03:35.930> gravitate<00:03:36.260> towards<00:03:37.190> using<00:03:37.760> it

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
to gravitate towards using it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.100
