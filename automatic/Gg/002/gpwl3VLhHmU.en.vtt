00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
benefits that I want to talk about but

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.550 
benefits that I want to talk about but
the<00:02:02.790> most<00:02:03.150> potent<00:02:03.690> ingredient<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:04.530> need

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the most potent ingredient that you need

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.470 
the most potent ingredient that you need
to<00:02:04.800> understand<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.370> inside<00:02:05.760> these<00:02:05.940> greens<00:02:06.270> is

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
to understand is inside these greens is

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.580 
to understand is inside these greens is
something<00:02:07.200> called<00:02:07.440> di<00:02:07.710> M<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.970> derived

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
something called di M and it's derived

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.259 
something called di M and it's derived
inside<00:02:10.590> these<00:02:10.830> vegetables<00:02:11.489> because<00:02:12.150> they

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
inside these vegetables because they

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.240 
inside these vegetables because they
contain<00:02:12.629> something<00:02:12.959> called<00:02:13.110> IC<00:02:13.830> 3

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
contain something called IC 3

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.369 
contain something called IC 3
now<00:02:14.459> what<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.819> di<00:02:15.120> M<00:02:15.390> does<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.959> acts<00:02:16.200> like

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
now what this di M does is it acts like

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.230 
now what this di M does is it acts like
an<00:02:16.620> anti

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
an anti

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.670

the agriculture in over the years what

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.690 
the agriculture in over the years what
ends<00:02:35.540> up<00:02:35.600> happening<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:36.200> we<00:02:36.650> get<00:02:36.890> bad<00:02:37.100> estrogen

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
ends up happening is we get bad estrogen

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.000 
ends up happening is we get bad estrogen
whether<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.940> guy<00:02:38.210> or<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> girl<00:02:38.870> bad<00:02:39.380> estrogen

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
whether a guy or a girl bad estrogen

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.740 
whether a guy or a girl bad estrogen
levels<00:02:40.370> are<00:02:40.460> blocking<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:41.210> lot<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.480> people's

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
levels are blocking a lot of people's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.600 
levels are blocking a lot of people's
fat<00:02:41.930> loss<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.500> will<00:02:42.650> actually<00:02:42.860> act<00:02:43.220> as<00:02:43.460> an

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
fat loss so this will actually act as an

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.180 
fat loss so this will actually act as an
anti<00:02:43.970> estrogen<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.690> indirectly<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:46.070> will

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
anti estrogen and indirectly it will

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.130 
anti estrogen and indirectly it will
stimulate<00:02:46.400> your<00:02:46.940> immune<00:02:47.120> system<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:48.050> you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
stimulate your immune system and if you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.020 
stimulate your immune system and if you

this<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:23.870> what<00:03:23.990> causes<00:03:24.380> insulin<00:03:24.950> resistance

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
this is what causes insulin resistance

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.460 
this is what causes insulin resistance
this<00:03:25.940> was<00:03:26.150> leading<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.660> type-2<00:03:27.050> diabetes

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
this was leading to the type-2 diabetes

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.380 
this was leading to the type-2 diabetes
epidemic<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.760> if<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:28.910> want<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.060> prevent<00:03:29.270> that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
epidemic so if you want to prevent that

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.850 
epidemic so if you want to prevent that

that I've been reading a lot about is
the<00:04:08.110> vegetables<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.290> this<00:04:09.350> if<00:04:09.860> we<00:04:09.980> consume

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
the vegetables like this if we consume

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.130 
the vegetables like this if we consume
them<00:04:10.640> regularly<00:04:11.180> like<00:04:11.360> five<00:04:11.600> or<00:04:11.750> six<00:04:11.780> days<00:04:12.110> a

them regularly like five or six days a
week<00:04:12.260> we<00:04:12.560> make<00:04:12.800> an<00:04:12.920> effort<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.370> get<00:04:13.490> a<00:04:13.520> lot<00:04:13.730> of

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
week we make an effort to get a lot of

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.010 
week we make an effort to get a lot of
these<00:04:14.000> you're<00:04:14.209> still<00:04:14.450> allowed<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:14.660> eat<00:04:14.870> some

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
cheap food once or twice a week we try

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.090 
cheap food once or twice a week we try
to<00:04:17.180> get<00:04:17.390> these<00:04:17.570> because<00:04:17.930> they<00:04:18.470> actually<00:04:18.920> can

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
to get these because they actually can

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.760 
to get these because they actually can
turn<00:04:19.310> off<00:04:19.549> or<00:04:19.910> Express<00:04:20.750> bad<00:04:21.080> genes<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.620> turn
