00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
the other part is an action-packed and

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.730 
the other part is an action-packed and
unique<00:01:04.820> Western<00:01:05.390> story<00:01:05.720> where<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.470> town's

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
unique Western story where the town's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.950 
unique Western story where the town's
folks<00:01:07.159> currency<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:07.940> water<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.540> they're

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
folks currency is water and they're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.870 
folks currency is water and they're
fresh<00:01:09.230> out<00:01:09.440> of<00:01:09.620> it<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.220> they<00:01:10.400> have<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.700> go<00:01:10.850> out

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
fresh out of it so they have to go out

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.170 
fresh out of it so they have to go out
to<00:01:11.210> find<00:01:11.480> more<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:12.100> love<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.340> they<00:01:13.490> focus<00:01:13.940> more

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
to find more I love that they focus more

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.899 
to find more I love that they focus more
on<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.510> western<00:01:14.900> part<00:01:14.930> but<00:01:15.909> unfortunately

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
on the western part but unfortunately

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.210 
on the western part but unfortunately
with<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.300> other<00:01:17.480> part<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.290> makes<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.860> story<00:01:19.070> a

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
with the other part it makes the story a

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.880 
with the other part it makes the story a
little<00:01:19.490> more<00:01:19.850> predictable<00:01:20.710> although<00:01:21.710> the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
little more predictable although the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.969 
little more predictable although the
story<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:22.430> very<00:01:22.510> interesting<00:01:23.510> it<00:01:24.170> still<00:01:24.680> needs

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
story is very interesting it still needs

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.910 
story is very interesting it still needs
a<00:01:25.130> little<00:01:25.370> more<00:01:25.580> polish<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:28.520> animation<00:01:29.390> now

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
a little more polish the animation now

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.190 
a little more polish the animation now
here's<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.159> reason<00:01:31.520> why<00:01:31.550> I<00:01:31.940> was<00:01:32.330> excited<00:01:32.960> for

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
here's the reason why I was excited for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.610 
here's the reason why I was excited for
this<00:01:33.590> film<00:01:33.890> what<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.000> gave<00:01:35.180> me<00:01:35.510> though<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.990> what

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
this film what it gave me though is what

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.450 
this film what it gave me though is what
I<00:01:36.650> was<00:01:36.890> hoping<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:38.049> more<00:01:39.070> let<00:01:40.070> me<00:01:40.190> tell

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
I was hoping for and more let me tell

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.020 
I was hoping for and more let me tell
you<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.180> most<00:01:41.540> likely<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.860> best

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
you that this is most likely the best

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.180 
you that this is most likely the best
character<00:01:44.030> animation<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.680> seen<00:01:45.979> in

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
character animation that I have seen in

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.920 
character animation that I have seen in
a<00:01:46.580> long<00:01:47.060> time

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
a long time

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.060 
a long time
both<00:01:48.440> in<00:01:48.650> design<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.460> animation<00:01:50.680> heck<00:01:51.680> it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
both in design and animation heck it

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.420 
both in design and animation heck it
might<00:01:52.159> even<00:01:52.580> be<00:01:52.850> better<00:01:52.880> than<00:01:53.350> Pixar<00:01:54.430> the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
might even be better than Pixar the

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.010 
might even be better than Pixar the
first<00:01:55.790> thing<00:01:56.090> you'll<00:01:56.270> notice<00:01:56.510> from<00:01:56.869> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
first thing you'll notice from the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.460 
first thing you'll notice from the
animation<00:01:57.590> is<00:01:57.830> its<00:01:58.520> character<00:01:59.390> design<00:01:59.720> since

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
animation is its character design since

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.640 
animation is its character design since
it<00:02:00.619> looks<00:02:00.830> weird<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.610> unique<00:02:01.930> well<00:02:02.930> for<00:02:03.500> me

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
it looks weird and unique well for me

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.550 
it looks weird and unique well for me
those<00:02:04.400> are<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.790> reasons<00:02:04.970> why<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.420> think<00:02:05.780> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
those are the reasons why I think the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.949 
those are the reasons why I think the
character<00:02:07.040> designs<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:07.820> film<00:02:08.090> might<00:02:08.720> be

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
character designs of this film might be

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.460 
character designs of this film might be
one<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.379> best<00:02:09.619> ever<00:02:10.030> I<00:02:11.030> also<00:02:11.990> heard<00:02:12.410> that

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
one of the best ever I also heard that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.820 
one of the best ever I also heard that
they<00:02:12.740> would<00:02:12.920> film<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.400> actors<00:02:13.610> do<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.360> movie

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
they would film the actors do the movie

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.950 
they would film the actors do the movie

characters<00:04:12.549> as<00:04:12.730> well<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.989> I<00:04:14.260> mean<00:04:14.739> by<00:04:15.370> the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
characters as well so I mean by the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.300 
characters as well so I mean by the
characters<00:04:16.000> being<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.450> rare<00:04:16.780> case<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.470> that<00:04:18.130> the

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
characters being a rare case is that the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.360 
characters being a rare case is that the
ones<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.760> appear<00:04:19.269> less<00:04:19.600> on<00:04:19.840> screen<00:04:20.320> are<00:04:20.680> more

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
ones that appear less on screen are more

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.810 
ones that appear less on screen are more
memorable<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:22.300> even<00:04:22.960> better<00:04:23.440> than<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.520> main

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
memorable and even better than the main

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.250 
memorable and even better than the main
characters<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:26.440> movie

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
characters of the movie

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.970
