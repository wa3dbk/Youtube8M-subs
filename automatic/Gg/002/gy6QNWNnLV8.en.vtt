an<00:02:34.900> article<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.940> those<00:02:37.120> two<00:02:37.420> brake<00:02:37.690> keepers

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
an article with those two brake keepers

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.069 
an article with those two brake keepers
out<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.769> whole<00:02:39.070> assembly<00:02:39.549> now<00:02:39.730> can<00:02:40.000> come<00:02:40.180> out

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.860 

air<00:02:44.079> holes<00:02:44.549> how<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.609> close<00:02:46.350> sit<00:02:47.350> sit<00:02:47.530> on<00:02:47.739> that

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
air holes how to close sit sit on that

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.390 
air holes how to close sit sit on that
now<00:02:49.870> I've<00:02:49.989> got<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.260> remove<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.650> tie<00:02:50.890> rod<00:02:51.160> in

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
now I've got to remove this tie rod in

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.610 
now I've got to remove this tie rod in
here<00:02:51.760> there's<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.570> cotter<00:02:53.079> pin<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.350> winner

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
here there's a cotter pin and winner

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.349 
here there's a cotter pin and winner
basically<00:02:54.340> Bend<00:02:54.579> together<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.030> pull<00:02:55.209> on

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
basically Bend together and pull on

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.759 
basically Bend together and pull on
through<00:02:56.100> okay<00:02:57.100> with<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.400> cotter<00:02:57.609> pin<00:02:57.880> out

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
through okay with the cotter pin out

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.340 
through okay with the cotter pin out
impact<00:02:59.769> wrench<00:03:00.040> get<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:00.609> off<00:03:01.200> let's<00:03:02.200> see<00:03:02.290> if

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
impact wrench get this off let's see if

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.660 
impact wrench get this off let's see if
I<00:03:02.410> can<00:03:02.560> loosen<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:03.010> up<00:03:03.190> come<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.180> wrap<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:07.239> up

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
I can loosen it up come on wrap this up

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.800 
I can loosen it up come on wrap this up
probably<00:03:09.670> not<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.880> best<00:03:09.910> way<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.299> do<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.630> but

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
probably not the best way to do it but

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.780 
probably not the best way to do it but
this<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.170> brass<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:11.980> not<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> piece<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.459> steel

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
this is brass it's not a piece of steel

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.509 
this is brass it's not a piece of steel
so<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.420> should<00:03:13.630> softer<00:03:14.079> than<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.320> nut<00:03:14.530> next<00:03:15.340> I've

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
so it should softer than a nut next I've

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:26.180 
so it should softer than a nut next I've
got<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.359> through<00:03:16.690> bolt<00:03:16.959> out

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.230 

hey<00:03:27.190> that's<00:03:27.430> out<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:29.170> next<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.710> this<00:03:30.240> lower

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
hey that's out so next is this lower

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.360 
hey that's out so next is this lower
spindle<00:03:31.960> arms<00:03:32.320> are<00:03:32.470> lower<00:03:32.650> ball<00:03:32.920> joints

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
spindle arms are lower ball joints

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.660 
spindle arms are lower ball joints
retaining<00:03:33.940> nut<00:03:34.980> all<00:03:35.980> right<00:03:36.190> we've<00:03:36.460> got<00:03:36.490> a

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
retaining nut all right we've got a

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.040 
retaining nut all right we've got a
fifteen<00:03:37.210> sixteenths<00:03:41.370> opening<00:03:42.370> rich<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:43.210> let's

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
fifteen sixteenths opening rich on let's

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.700 
fifteen sixteenths opening rich on let's
move<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:46.180> nut<00:03:46.390> pretty<00:03:46.720> much<00:03:46.930> lose<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.410> put<00:03:47.620> it

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
move the nut pretty much lose I put it

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.190 
move the nut pretty much lose I put it
on<00:03:47.830> for<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.100> couple<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.460> threads<00:03:48.820> there<00:03:49.210> just<00:03:50.020> to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
on for a couple of threads there just to

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.780 
on for a couple of threads there just to
keep<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.590> whole<00:03:50.800> simply<00:03:51.250> from<00:03:51.430> falling

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
keep it whole simply from falling

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.940 
keep it whole simply from falling
completely<00:03:52.330> off<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.930> axle<00:03:53.410> when<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.590> not<00:03:53.770> get

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
completely off the axle when I not get

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.520 
completely off the axle when I not get
free<00:03:54.360> hoping<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.690> a<00:03:55.780> couple<00:03:55.990> of<00:03:56.170> swats

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
free hoping that just a couple of swats

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.030 
free hoping that just a couple of swats
with<00:03:56.770> this<00:03:57.240> pickle<00:03:58.240> bar<00:03:58.560> we'll<00:03:59.560> get<00:03:59.740> the<00:03:59.860> whole

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
with this pickle bar we'll get the whole

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.800 
with this pickle bar we'll get the whole
thing<00:04:00.310> again<00:04:00.580> I<00:04:00.730> know<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:01.000> didn't<00:04:01.270> see<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.600> but

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
the pickle bar worked perfect the whole

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.180 
the pickle bar worked perfect the whole
assemblies<00:04:04.780> now<00:04:05.020> just<00:04:05.290> falling<00:04:05.710> out<00:04:05.800> and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190
