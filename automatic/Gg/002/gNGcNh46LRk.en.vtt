screen the key in the center is a screen
we<00:05:50.919> need<00:05:51.040> simply<00:05:51.340> because<00:05:51.550> we<00:05:51.669> need<00:05:51.820> the

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
we need simply because we need the

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.270 
we need simply because we need the
points<00:05:52.590> otherwise<00:05:53.590> we<00:05:53.860> just<00:05:53.889> keep<00:05:54.160> them

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
points otherwise we just keep them

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.240 
points otherwise we just keep them
locked<00:05:54.430> in<00:05:54.639> the<00:05:54.730> tunnel<00:05:55.710> so<00:05:56.710> we<00:05:56.830> got<00:05:56.980> the<00:05:57.100> key

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
locked in the tunnel so we got the key

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.409 
locked in the tunnel so we got the key
and<00:05:57.280> now<00:05:57.490> we're<00:05:57.610> gonna<00:05:57.700> send<00:05:57.970> them<00:05:58.060> back<00:05:58.210> in

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
and now we're gonna send them back in

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.379
