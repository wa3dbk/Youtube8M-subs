there it makes it a little lighter and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.520 
there it makes it a little lighter and
then<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.060> mounted<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> duckworth

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
then I mounted them to the duckworth

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
then I mounted them to the duckworth
brackets<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.310> there's<00:01:11.790> four<00:01:12.060> machine<00:01:12.479> screw

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
brackets and there's four machine screw

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
brackets and there's four machine screw
holes<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> backs<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.770> these<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.490> course<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
holes on the backs of these of course I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.179 
holes on the backs of these of course I
only<00:01:14.970> use<00:01:15.240> two<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.140> mounted<00:01:16.890> them<00:01:17.009> right

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
only use two and just mounted them right

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.469 
only use two and just mounted them right
to<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> duckworth<00:01:18.600> bracket<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.890> puts<00:01:20.159> them

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
to the duckworth bracket this puts them

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.460 
to the duckworth bracket this puts them
right<00:01:21.479> where<00:01:21.659> they<00:01:21.689> need<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.080> they're

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
right where they need to be they're

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.950 
right where they need to be they're
still<00:01:22.740> adjustable<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.850> fit<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
still adjustable they fit very well and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.600 
still adjustable they fit very well and
so<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.840> took<00:01:27.840> these<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.590> put<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.549> on

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so I took these and put them back on

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.640 
so I took these and put them back on
power<00:01:30.000> supply<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.810> again<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.560> you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
power supply and again you know you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.170 
power supply and again you know you
can't<00:01:31.950> tell<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> camera<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.090> in

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
can't tell here because the camera is in

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.600 
can't tell here because the camera is in
so<00:01:33.360> close<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.900> how<00:01:34.710> bright<00:01:35.040> these<00:01:35.310> are

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
so close just how bright these are

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.749 
so close just how bright these are
here's<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.810> wig<00:01:37.680> wag<00:01:37.860> flasher<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> bought

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
here's the wig wag flasher that I bought

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.050 
here's the wig wag flasher that I bought
from<00:01:38.909> perihelion<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:40.860> 250<00:01:41.460> watts<00:01:41.670> aside

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
from perihelion and it's 250 watts aside

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.810 
from perihelion and it's 250 watts aside
and<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:43.079> light<00:01:43.439> weight<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.130> took<00:01:44.610> these

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and it's light weight so took these

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
and it's light weight so took these
lights<00:01:45.060> mounted<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.600> day<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> right

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
lights mounted one day or in the right

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.050
