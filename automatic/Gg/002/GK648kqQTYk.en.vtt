back to my roots as an environmental
scientist<00:02:10.120> water<00:02:11.120> monitoring<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.599> certainly

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
scientist water monitoring is certainly

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.210 
scientist water monitoring is certainly
a<00:02:11.930> big<00:02:12.080> thing<00:02:12.290> for<00:02:12.319> us<00:02:12.470> here<00:02:12.709> we<00:02:12.739> have<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.010> lot<00:02:13.190> of

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
a big thing for us here we have a lot of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.190 
a big thing for us here we have a lot of
small<00:02:13.549> catchments<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.180> lot<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.629> surface<00:02:14.959> water

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
small catchments a lot of surface water

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.380 
small catchments a lot of surface water
runoff<00:02:15.470> from<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.370> area<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.150> we<00:02:17.269> have

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
runoff from the area so we have

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.420 
runoff from the area so we have
conducted<00:02:17.750> testing<00:02:18.260> at<00:02:18.410> people's<00:02:18.709> houses<00:02:19.099> to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
conducted testing at people's houses to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.680 
conducted testing at people's houses to
make<00:02:19.459> sure<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.819> we're<00:02:20.000> not<00:02:20.030> impacting<00:02:20.569> on

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690

is<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.500> still<00:03:08.010> amazes<00:03:08.459> me<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.879> day<00:03:09.120> that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
is it still amazes me to this day that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.180 
is it still amazes me to this day that
something<00:03:09.629> so<00:03:09.930> big<00:03:10.139> so<00:03:10.379> large<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.889> actually

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
something so big so large can actually

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.800 
something so big so large can actually
get<00:03:11.340> off<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.609> ground<00:03:11.790> I've<00:03:12.329> come<00:03:12.510> out<00:03:12.629> of<00:03:12.720> an

that<00:04:16.260> critical<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.859> think<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.850> level

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
that critical I think just on that level

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.699 
that critical I think just on that level
alone<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.570> pretty<00:04:18.840> rewarding<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.290> be<00:04:19.530> able

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
alone it is pretty rewarding to be able

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.380 
alone it is pretty rewarding to be able
to<00:04:19.829> Hospital<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.400> hand<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.700> over<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.239> see
