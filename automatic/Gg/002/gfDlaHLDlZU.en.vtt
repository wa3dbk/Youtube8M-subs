00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:09.510
 John Paul II 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.880
 Good morning, nice people. 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.460
 Today I'll make you the video that 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.800
 I would think the diary of any 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.439
 solution is something like that because then after 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.449
 What I did is a pain relief for my 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.269
 house under construction pretty people stayed 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.400
 asking me to echo the news 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.190
 what is taking 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.430
 flame 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.660
 She details what I'm doing. 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.160
 there things are coming and everything 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 so I decided to go 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.210
 I do it every time I do something 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.210
 thing 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.030
 the current idea with ZÃ© Mario 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.340
 ae 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.990
 ae 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.710
 I can see if this is wonderful. 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.710
 the stone 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.049
 record a video if you want nobody else 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.049
 but today 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.260
 what allows you to put it for now is 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.260
 visible 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 had glass ever stress the bathroom 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.170
 did not have 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.430
 and now 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.650
 so I just got here in the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.270
 my house for sure the news 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.890
 So let's start here by the door. 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.720
 front of the mall we were feeling 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:51.330
 here and now it already has a glass and looks 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.330
 What cool people did I have? 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:02.970
 our initials here and me from Mauritius and 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:05.820
 good Beatriz increased here is a piece 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.760
 from my closet that I could not put 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.110
 there was a lot and I'll show you 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.960
 very low 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:19.020
 Good here is more a novelty my closet 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.660
 already here almost ready to the already done 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.950
 here this leg 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.420
 in the germ cabinet video has it all 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.060
 detailed if you will see everything 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.980
 straight instead of zero to hand 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.170
 assembly and here is where the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.470
 refrigerator oil air up on the ground 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.150
 here where will the microwave stay 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.150
 Where's Fedra? 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:52.819
 and that part there that I said no 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.900
 You can put it up here. 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.609
 only that is where the space between the stone and it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.680
 I would be too small to put it on. 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.540
 like stirring in the blender in the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.319
 mixer then I'll wait for the stone 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.849
 to put her to send 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.389
 lower cut her a little for a 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.329
 there 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.040
 well here you are talking this hole right 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.170
 This hole goes into the bottle and then comes 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.290
 here is the stone that will not go 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.049
 to see it's going to be all closed 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.730
 so my brother here I will not show 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.930
 detailed for you because then I go 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.470
 take a tour of it 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.219
 here is where an oven goes and look at it 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:35.180
 and here is where the sidewalks go 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:37.689
 here behind and now I will show the boxes 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.689
 for you guys 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.540
 look this is the bathroom box 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.820
 society is also with our 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.590
 Actually this bathroom did not 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.860
 It was to have our initial plus 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.420
 putty put it good 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.010

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.800
 less here everyone will see in our 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.360
 bathroom only people to see good and stayed 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.500
 it was good 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.330
 the box just that little problem right already 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.450
 it's taken so long people will put these 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.240
 glasses I wanted to return or ask 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:20.650
 Other but it was cool, huh? 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:22.330
 and now I'm going to show another box that 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.360
 closet window 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.490
 I do not remember if I think in the video 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.190
 tutor is this glass that has not yet 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.190
 had because it had now broken tael 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.940
 ready 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.580
 and here is our bathroom here 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.740
 was to have the hands the initials but everything 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.090
 Well, it just felt really cool, people do not look at it. 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.090
 Here the initial Linda 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.050
 I loved 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.170
 all this people that the construction is like this 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.830
 Why does it come out then we went today? 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.910
 these little things that we have more is 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.310
 every time we went putting 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.740
 something is left for you if 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.910
 you want a new detailed video 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.130
 videos 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.920
 I did not do it even more if you wanted me 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.870
 I make the closet and I 'll do it then. 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.270
 soon it will fall on the channel for you 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.890
 and if you want surgical video 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.320
 detail of anything you 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.970
 have seen here and suddenly I do not 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.780
 I thought to make you're in order to 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.670
 adapt 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.250
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.830
 always liked asking signed up for 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.870
 channel and until the next 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.670
 we were almost forgotten about 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.760
 show a detail that was placed here 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.400
 It's a pretty basic detail, but it's 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.070
 very cool because it's a moment that gives 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.290
 a flower difference that this angle 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.200
 bye 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.850
 Is it going to be the best test? 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.630
 here is the case of the protection she wanted 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.970
 enjoy 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.190
 she sang black corner that goes in the repair 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.980
 thousand and also an angle that will 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.650
 aquino in the corner between the tile 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.310
 to finish and stay 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.310
 pretty handsome 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.560
 we here and there 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.039
 why when cutting the tile it will never 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.880
 It looks perfect, it looks ok, we do not 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:31.280
 placed 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:33.020
 but look how we stay here 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.639
 did not put it because you 're going to paint here 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.580
 people give a finish 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:40.340
 but here we are here because O across 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.919
 around the door and we went to the 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.509
 bathroom, I'll show you, too. 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:50.259
 So we put it in the bathroom. 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.259
 also people o from the window note 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:57.280
 it got dark because of the contracts 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.280
 but it was not a note for you 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.840
 now yes I finished the homeless then 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.060
 I hope you have enjoyed that you 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.039
 can take advantage of something here that 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.099
 I showed it to you. 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:12.440
