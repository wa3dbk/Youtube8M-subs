man<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:26.320> lot<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:26.830> people<00:04:27.130> out<00:04:27.610> there<00:04:27.990> thought

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
man a lot of people out there thought

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.990 
man a lot of people out there thought
Simon<00:04:29.350> should<00:04:29.440> have<00:04:29.590> taken<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.920> win<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.430> it

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
Simon should have taken the win and it

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.670 
Simon should have taken the win and it
could<00:04:31.240> have<00:04:31.330> gone<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.600> either<00:04:31.900> way<00:04:32.110> man<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.410> mean

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
could have gone in either way man I mean

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.560 
could have gone in either way man I mean
but<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.130> think<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.580> deciding<00:04:34.000> factor<00:04:34.300> tonight

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
but I think the deciding factor tonight

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.540 
but I think the deciding factor tonight
was<00:04:34.810> him<00:04:35.410> only<00:04:35.560> getting<00:04:35.830> five<00:04:36.010> hits<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.490> not

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
was him only getting five hits and not

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.580 
was him only getting five hits and not
spinning<00:04:36.940> both<00:04:37.090> ways<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.660> me<00:04:38.050> getting<00:04:38.290> seven

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
spinning both ways and me getting seven

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.410 
spinning both ways and me getting seven
hits<00:04:38.740> spinning<00:04:39.130> both<00:04:39.280> ways<00:04:39.550> switch<00:04:40.000> hit<00:04:40.240> and

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
hits spinning both ways switch hit and

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.390 
hits spinning both ways switch hit and
alley-oops<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.050> there<00:04:41.200> it's<00:04:41.830> just<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:42.220> think

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
alley-oops in there it's just I think

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.370 
alley-oops in there it's just I think
it's<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.640> natural<00:04:42.820> evolution<00:04:43.810> of<00:04:43.870> pipe<00:04:44.110> ski

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
it's the natural evolution of pipe ski

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.680 
it's the natural evolution of pipe ski
and<00:04:44.530> man<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.680> mean<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.610> can<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:46.210> mean<00:04:46.540> you're

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.440
