00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.790
 we are with salvatore siena doctor 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.200
 director of oncology doctor siena 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.790
 niguarda has been one in recent years 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.130
 of the most important world centers for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.019
 research on colorectal cancer with 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.949
 metastasis and for personalization 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.359
 I would say that some of the data for the treatment of the cda 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.490
 the hospital looks on thanks to 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.230
 collaboration with his anatomy 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.550
 pathological collaboration 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 of the candiol cancer institute 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.010
 torino managed to bring to the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.399
 registration and drugs like cetuximab 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.710
 panitumumab and more recently 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.300
 therefore definitely adjustable therapies 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.640
 at molecular target were 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.800
 subject of the clinical research of 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.770
 concerns up to realistic development 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.329
 concrete marketing are not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.059
 more recently this has been 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.980
 published in the medium in 2012 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.270
 we discovered together with the colleagues of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.219
 candiol than drug resistance 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.070
 of colorectal cancer therapy 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.500
 with metastasis resistance due to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.920
 mutations of particular genes such as gene 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.080
 k ras and the gene n rucks and gen 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.210
 will say today we have therapies against raf 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.220
 and experiment against b raf 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.590
 that's just for patients who 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.200
 present this profile instead 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 genetic is already underway in ours 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 a clinical trial hospital 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.790
 very important we can mention of 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.320
 what is it and what will it be 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.799
 of the study's objectives 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.790
 today in fact the interesting thing about 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.830
 which 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.450
 I wanted to discuss is precisely the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.510
 availability and farewell occurred in 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.690
 past weeks of a therapy of 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.760
 combination with anti raf drugs 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.180
 anti network for therapy of 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.030
 colorectal carcinomas with metastases 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.820
 and with the mutation of b raf that like 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.160
 we know and to the mutation it causes 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.830
 resistance to conventional therapies 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.020
 so the cases that are they become 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.290
 resistant to conventional therapies e 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.160
 who have mutations of b raf today 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.170
 can be treated with therapies that 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.070
 today I am still experimental and on 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.340
 which we count for an effective one 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.110
 pink of initial data here is Dr. Siena 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.090
 which patients are candidates and what 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.080
 you have to do to take part in this 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.820
 experimentation 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
 thanks for the question if the patients 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.480
 Patients are therefore candidates with 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.950
 then carcinoma of the large intestine 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.140
 of the rectal colon with metastasis 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.480
 after the successful resistance then after 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.280
 progression after conventional therapies 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.200
 so after floro game and dine 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.480
 irinotecan after oxaliplatin bevacizumab 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.600
 and for now also cetuximab what is needed 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.220
 do but I'd say consult the site 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.010
 internet hospital niguarda ca 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.980
 granda 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.989
 milano and make an appointment first 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.060
 design of oncology follow the 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.360
 instructions on the website first 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.799
 he said of oncology and we oncologists 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.439
 at the niguarda hospital in Milan 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.959
 we will take care of the cases with one 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.599
 budget allocation on the vaccine seemed 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.510
 static well we thank Dr. 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.319
 salvatore is director of oncology 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.000
 of the hospital company about 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.000
 granda thanks to Dr. Siena
