00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This just came in the mail today.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:10.001
This is the AutoChron wall switch timer.

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:14.002
And what makes this unique from any other wall timer is this one doesn't have

00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:22.003
to actually be wired in to the wall. It actually fits over your light switch that you already have

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.004
and then you can program it to turn the switch on and off.

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:32.005
I plan on using this with a ceiling fan.

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:36.006
I know the air conditioner draws a lot of power, and I spend a lot of money

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:41.007
keeping that running. So I figure if I use my ceiling fan at night

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:45.008
instead of running the air conditioner at a cooler temperature at night,

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.009
I could save a bit of money. 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.010
I do live in an apartment, though, so wiring in an in-wall timer

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:59.011
is probably a no-no. So I figured, I can go ahead and get this

00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:03.012
and just pop it over my wall switch, and then I'll be able to program it

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:08.013
just like I could with a more sophisticated wall timer.

00:01:08.014 --> 00:01:13.014
The installation is supposed to be pretty simple.

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:17.015
You just take out the bottom wall plate screw, and stick the one they give you in there

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:23.016
and you install 2 'AA' batteries and you're all set to go.

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:27.017
So, I'll go ahead and get it set up and programmed, and I'll show you how it works.

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:32.018
Alright, I've got the AutoChron installed.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:37.019
Installation was fairly straightforward; as said all you have to do is remove the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.020
bottom screw from your wall plate and put the one in that they provide you.

00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:47.021
If you tighten it down well, it shouldn't be able to move back and forth.

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:50.022
I was worried about that when I bought this, since it's only secured with one screw

00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:52.523
it might want to slide back and forth, but the wall switch

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:56.024
helps hold it in place somewhat. But if you tighten it good

00:01:56.025 --> 00:01:59.025
you shouldn't have trouble. Just don't tighten it too much because

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:02.026
you don't want to crack this wall plate.

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:06.027
This green thing here, I just took a peice of masking tape--I have green tape

00:02:06.028 --> 00:02:15.028
for some reason--I just stuck the original screw in there so I can find it easily when I move out.

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.029
Then I can just take that out and put the original one back in, and no one will ever

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.030
know that this was ever here. Which is quite nice when you're living in an

00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:26.031
apartment or renting a place where you can't make changes to it.

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:33.032
Reading some reviews online, another common use for these:

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:38.033
Some people who aren't electrically inclined might want to get this

00:02:38.034 --> 00:02:42.034
because they don't want to do the wiring. I personally don't find it to be difficult, but

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:45.035
some people may be intimidated by it, and probably best for safety reasons

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:50.036
to not mess around with wiring if you don't know exactly what you're doing.

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:55.037
Another good reason for getting one of these;

00:02:55.038 --> 00:03:01.038
Older houses. Some older houses don't have neutral wiring in the box, 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:05.039
and that is a problem for hardwire timers that need to have that neutral wire

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.040
to operate. So if you don't have that, you can always go with this.

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:13.041
It's pretty straightforward.

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:17.042
Programming was pretty easy, it has buttons for 'Day,' 'Hour,' 'Minute,'

00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:23.043
so you just press those to advance the days, hours, minutes, to get what you want.

00:03:23.044 --> 00:03:29.044
You can set up to 9 different programs; on, off, or both.

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:32.045
And it's pretty much like a programmable thermostat.

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:36.046
The best thing about it too is that you don't lose manual control of the switch.

00:03:36.047 --> 00:03:40.047
Over here is the light and as you can see it's pretty close to the other switch here.

00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:44.048
If you have a double plate, it's going to be pretty close. I can still

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.049
turn it on and turn it off, but you're not going to be able to get your hand

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.050
around it, so if you someone who can't move their hands easily or something

00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:58.051
it could be a problem, but otherwise it's not going to be an issue.

00:03:58.052 --> 00:04:03.052
You can also turn the switch on and off manually using the 'ON' and 'OFF' buttons

00:04:03.053 --> 00:04:09.053
located in a way that you would be moving the light switch. I'll press 'ON'

00:04:09.054 --> 00:04:12.054
and I'll show you how it works.

00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:15.055
[WHIRRING, SWITCH CLICKS]

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:17.056
Nice, isn't it?

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:20.057
And the ceiling fan now is turning on.

00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:24.058
And to switch it off, we'll do the same.

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:28.059
[WHIRRING, SWITCH CLICKS]

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.060
And we'll let that spin down.

00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:41.062
Quite neat, isn't it?

00:04:41.063 --> 00:04:44.063
And you can also bypass this by moving this little piece out the way.

00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:50.064
It'll still move up and down but it won't be turning the switch on or off anymore.

00:04:50.065 --> 00:04:53.065
So if you want to temporarily bypass the programs for a couple of days

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:56.066
like if you're going out of town, you can leave the switch off,

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:59.067
slide that over, and it'll still try to move it up and down but

00:04:59.068 --> 00:05:06.068
it won't be doing anything, so you won't have to worry about it using power if you're not around.

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.069
I'll flip that back.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.070
So yeah, it's a pretty neat little thing. I'm glad I got it.

00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:20.071
It was a little pricey at $30, I was able to get it a little cheaper on a closeout site, "Overstock.com."

00:05:20.072 --> 00:05:25.072
They had it for about $26 or $27, I can't remember

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:30.073
the exact price now, but I got it a little cheaper than they normally go for.

00:05:30.074 --> 00:05:36.074
Do keep in mind although it's a little pricey, in the long run if it helps you

00:05:36.075 --> 00:05:39.075
save energy and helps save money on your power bill

00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:45.076
then it'll pay for itself. So its definitely a good thing to have, and I would

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:49.077
like to see this getting more popular in the future.

00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:54.078
It's a nice little thing for people like me who either can't change the wiring

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:58.079
because of where they live, or just because they don't want to mess with the wires,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.080
or they just don't have the right setup behind the wall to do so.

00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:05.081
So, there you go. The AutoChron wall switch timer.
