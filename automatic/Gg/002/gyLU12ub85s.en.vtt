00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.900
 the mclaren m 23 is an example of a car 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.799
 extremely long-lived participates in 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.830
 World Championships from 73 to 78 and wins 2 1 with 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.410
 fittipaldi in 74 second with james hunt 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.330
 and in 1976 just in the last race in 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.040
 Japan and it's the car we take 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.500
 under consideration because it is a car that among the 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.840
 its designers sees in the name of john 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.420
 barnard a young engineer who understands 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.210
 immediately the value of the engine the four 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.450
 cosola 8 cylinders and then concentrates 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.619
 immediately on suspension frame e 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.809
 aerodynamics realizes a car that is 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.969
 extremely effective unbeatable 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.640
 whereas the Ford was an engine 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.260
 effective dimensionally compact e 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.170
 above all it consumed little but had 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.899
 about 30 40 horses less in ferrari than 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.149
 aerodynamic chassis is recovered 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.010
 this performance gap comes 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.729
 made an extraordinary season 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.800
 found more in 1976 than those of james hunt 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.339
 and for the second world title of the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.620
 mclaren 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.139
 the very angular conformation of the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.360
 bodywork on the nose and in each individual 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:06.790
 particular is definitely evident too 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.829
 on the car body with sharp corners between 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.659
 body shell and air intakes 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.820
 the passenger compartment with considerable development 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.340
 vertical provides an element in 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.539
 additional plexiglass that increases it 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.189
 the overall height 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.289
 the goal is to improve the 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.509
 resistance to advancement and reduce the 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.070
 rear-end turbulence so as to 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.259
 guarantee a flow of flows 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.439
 clean and effective at the height 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:33.100
 of the rear wing the mclaren m 23 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.229
 is designed by gordon coppock inspired 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.930
 the 72 also shares the engine with the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.850
 hawk 0 8 cylinders of 90 degrees av 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.369
 the preparation of the radiating masses 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.380
 provides four separate elements two 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.600
 front radiators dedicated to the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.149
 engine cooling 2 inclined for 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.280

 of hewland gearbox transmission at 5

 gear to which the system is anchored 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.850
 suspensive configuration that allows 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.270
 to compact the overall dimensions to the best
