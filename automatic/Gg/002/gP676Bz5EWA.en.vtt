00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone welcome 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.040
 again to practical in the tutorial of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.680
 Now I'm going to show you how to eliminate 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.980
 bad odors good 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.080
 one of the things that does not happen very much to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.190
 often especially in rainy seasons 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.090
 is that our shoes are when we 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.020
 it gets wet 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.360
 they stink then I 'm going to give them a tip 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.080
 what I use to remove that evil 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.489
 smell of the shoes is baking soda or 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.970
 bicarbonate what they're going to do is I'm going to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.920
 remove the tapes from their shoes and they go to 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.920
 apply baking 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.820
 they are not going to apply inside 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.200
 worry if they see it there too white 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.600
 but the result is very good 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.660
 especially if we say how these 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.940
 shoes that I have washed and I have 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.760
 clean and maybe they have been good to me 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.580
 grabbing that bad smell then and I say 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.680
 I do not want to wash them yet but the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.380
 I need for the next day then 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.930
 only what I do I apply bicarbonate and what 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.580
 let rest throughout the night and for 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 the next day in the morning they are already 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.250
 ready so they're going to put it in both 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.820
 shoes and in the morning you are going to see 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.000
 the result that those are no longer going to be 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.430
 shoes with that bad smell 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.470
 practice them and leave me their 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.570
 comments to see if it works for them 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.700
 you can also do it 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.270
 you can put a little water if 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.560
 you want but I like it more 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.590
 only apply the very well the powder 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.220
 well this is one of the tips that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.930
 I have the following is how to eliminate 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:06.210
 the bad smell of good sweat what are going to 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.060
 do again they are going to use the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.620
 baking or soda baking and they go to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.480
 apply the amount that you 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.970
 they need 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.510
 believe me this if it works when I 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.690
 I have used only I applied it in 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.730
 the morning and I do not need to be 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.400
 applying more and earlier when I used 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 the deodorant applied to me many times 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.770
 on the good day and they will mix it with 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.770
 a little water 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.900
 and they're going to make it like a paste 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.540
 good if they are left as very watered down what 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.780
 what they can do is apply a little 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.780
 plus 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.790
 A) Yes 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.970
 and when they have it ready 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:10.010
 they grab half for an armpit and half is 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.629
 for the other and with this tip I have 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.579
 given some friends you know that 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.470
 many times to men they have 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.700
 the sweat stronger than us the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.010
 women and good they have told me that 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.079
 yes that has worked for them so that's why 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.450
 is that I had these two tips 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.269
 prepared for how to eliminate those 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.920
 pains that many times because it displeases 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:37.420
 so I hope and it serves them a lot and 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.420
 I wait for you until next video
