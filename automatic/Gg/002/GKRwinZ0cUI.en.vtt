00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.620
 the ranchera music of lilac downs the 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:06.870
 chacarera from the conosur by 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.060
 part of solitude and girl flamenco 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.430
 pastori merged for the project 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.530
 root record material that brings together 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.030
 three exponents of folklore who 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.010
 they want to return to the navel of the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.400
 creation to exalt their nations 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.150
 what is a very nice cool fusion 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.760
 we are very different and we have a way 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.190
 to sing very different 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.590
 the styles of music very different 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.860
 we use very different instruments 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.830
 but but if we have the same 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.739
 feel each one each represent or 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:46.000
 we are one of the representatives is a 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:49.930
 restlessness I think of the three of knowing 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.449
 another kind of music for me in 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.940
 particular of also knowing about 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.860
 to learn the root of my land is the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.110
 only unpublished subject presented in the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.420
 disc which includes four themes and 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.800
 each one contributes besides they will be able 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.120
 listen to three pieces that represent 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.530
 Spain Argentina and Mexico initially 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.170
 the project was going to be different it was not going to 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.640
 having unpublished was going to be a project 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.320
 armed with the repertoire of the three 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.659
 but right because of the fact made by the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.360
 another is not each each one chose 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.360
 four songs to me I played two for 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.940
 each one I took it to my country and we give 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.290
 and I also took it to my rhythms not to my 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.840
 way of singing and the same thing they did 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.729
 them when we met here in Mexico 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.170
 there were things that surprised us many 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.929
 others that had to be worked on a little bit 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.179
 plus all the root songs were 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.369
 worked especially in the arrangements 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.429
 musicians from different nations collaborated 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.630
 among them are aneiro taño 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.150
 julio jiménez chaboli and paul coin 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.480
 this is the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.280
 the opportunity for us to 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.020
 demonstrate I believe well join forces of 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.189
 certain way 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.899
 to show the beauty of the root and 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.079
 also that it is not so simple or is it 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.829
 as we said before we are just one 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.050
 exponent of this tradition that is very 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.600
 big in each case 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.700
 root was recorded during 2013 under the 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.550
 Sony Music label and is the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.620
 sale of physical and digital news 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.620
