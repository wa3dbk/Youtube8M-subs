00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
didn't think we actually started the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439 
didn't think we actually started the
game<00:00:22.080> particularly<00:00:22.410> well<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.180> I'm

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
game particularly well but you know I'm

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.540 
game particularly well but you know I'm
away<00:00:24.750> from<00:00:24.779> home<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.529> Tim<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.859> stadium<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
away from home in and Tim a stadium I

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.220 
away from home in and Tim a stadium I
really<00:00:27.060> wasn't<00:00:27.210> expecting<00:00:27.359> us<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.199> know

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

putting quite much particularly great
performance<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.279> thought<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:33.090> their<00:00:33.570> first

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
performance I thought that their first

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.330 
performance I thought that their first
up<00:00:33.960> was<00:00:34.079> very<00:00:34.320> intense<00:00:34.770> I've<00:00:34.920> always<00:00:35.070> real

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
up was very intense I've always real

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
up was very intense I've always real
end-to-end<00:00:35.790> stuff<00:00:36.180> both<00:00:36.809> sides<00:00:37.110> seeing<00:00:37.500> their

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
end-to-end stuff both sides seeing their

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.010 
end-to-end stuff both sides seeing their
fair<00:00:37.920> share<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.250> possession<00:00:38.790> Arsenal<00:00:39.149> sliding

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
fair share of possession Arsenal sliding

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.959 
fair share of possession Arsenal sliding
with<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> upper<00:00:40.649> hand<00:00:40.860> however<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.700> didn't

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
with the upper hand however we didn't

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.369 
with the upper hand however we didn't
met<00:00:42.149> create<00:00:42.480> many<00:00:42.629> chance<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.050> don't<00:00:43.230> think

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
met create many chance I don't think

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.979 
met create many chance I don't think
we'd<00:00:43.469> even<00:00:43.500> had<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> shot<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.219> target<00:00:44.629> but<00:00:45.629> by

dorman played extremely well actually

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.080 
dorman played extremely well actually
for<00:02:31.530> they<00:02:31.680> could<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.430> won<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:32.730> game<00:02:32.790> at

for they could have won this game at

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.970 
for they could have won this game at
times<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.870> ref<00:02:34.110> gave<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> lot<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.800> sit-ins

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
times the ref gave a lot of the sit-ins

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.560 
times the ref gave a lot of the sit-ins
in<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> first<00:02:35.460> half<00:02:35.640> Dorman's<00:02:36.180> way<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.330> thought

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
in the first half Dorman's way I thought

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.560 
in the first half Dorman's way I thought
of<00:02:36.830> representing<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> first<00:02:38.160> off<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:39.540> I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
of representing the first off but I

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.610 
of representing the first off but I
don't<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.020> fair<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.170> say<00:02:40.290> we<00:02:40.380> were

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
don't think it's fair to say we were

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.590 
don't think it's fair to say we were
lucky<00:02:40.830> because<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.580> defended<00:02:41.910> extremely

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
lucky because we just defended extremely

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.270 
lucky because we just defended extremely
well<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:42.990> took<00:02:43.260> our<00:02:43.440> chance<00:02:43.709> when<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:43.980> got<00:02:44.160> it

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
well we took our chance when we got it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280 
well we took our chance when we got it
something<00:02:44.610> Dortmund<00:02:45.030> didn't<00:02:45.360> do<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.080> we<00:02:46.170> were

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
something Dortmund didn't do and we were

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.780 
something Dortmund didn't do and we were
clinical<00:02:46.740> it's<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.100> these<00:02:47.370> shows<00:02:47.610> of

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
clinical it's just these shows of

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.310 
clinical it's just these shows of
difference<00:02:48.150> if<00:02:48.240> we<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.510> win<00:02:48.720> games<00:02:48.990> like<00:02:49.140> this

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
difference if we can win games like this

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.199 
difference if we can win games like this
then<00:02:49.980> we've<00:02:50.130> got<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.550> contenders<00:02:51.030> for

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209
