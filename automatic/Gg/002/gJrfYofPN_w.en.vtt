you guys remember Jurgen Lowe Katya had

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.220 
you guys remember Jurgen Lowe Katya had
the<00:02:30.040> potential<00:02:30.670> showing<00:02:31.390> great<00:02:31.629> potential

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the potential showing great potential

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.970 
the potential showing great potential
and<00:02:32.410> now<00:02:33.099> he<00:02:33.610> has<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:34.540> potential<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.440> be

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and now he has the potential to be

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.729 
and now he has the potential to be
special<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:37.269> insane<00:02:37.989> he<00:02:38.349> will<00:02:38.590> be

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
special that is insane he will be

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.070 
special that is insane he will be
growing<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.310> lot<00:02:39.790> as<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:40.360> see<00:02:40.629> right<00:02:40.840> here

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
growing a lot as you can see right here

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.229 
growing a lot as you can see right here
has<00:02:41.349> potential<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.190> special<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.060> this

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
has potential to be special so this

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.979 
has potential to be special so this
means<00:02:43.510> he<00:02:44.019> now<00:02:44.260> went<00:02:44.560> from<00:02:44.860> 84<00:02:45.760> ish<00:02:46.060> potential

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
means he now went from 84 ish potential

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.729 
means he now went from 84 ish potential
to<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.799> 88<00:02:48.730> 89<00:02:49.329> and<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.110> will<00:02:50.319> help<00:02:50.500> you

to keep it some kind of realistic I

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.380 
to keep it some kind of realistic I
would<00:03:14.769> recommend<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.340> guys<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.790> do<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.150> with

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
would recommend you guys to do this with

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.240 
would recommend you guys to do this with
players<00:03:16.690> where<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.230> truly<00:03:17.620> believe<00:03:18.220> that

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
players where you truly believe that

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.729 
players where you truly believe that
they<00:03:18.760> should<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:19.060> higher<00:03:19.540> potential<00:03:20.049> for

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
they should have higher potential for

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.610 
they should have higher potential for
example<00:03:21.280> Munir<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.120> Haddadi<00:03:22.600> from<00:03:23.019> barcelona

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
example Munir and Haddadi from barcelona

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.890 
example Munir and Haddadi from barcelona
is<00:03:23.920> now<00:03:24.190> playing<00:03:24.519> for<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:24.880> first<00:03:25.150> team<00:03:25.420> but<00:03:25.750> he

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
is now playing for the first team but he

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.680 
is now playing for the first team but he
only<00:03:26.139> has<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> potential<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.220> 80<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.420> if<00:03:28.569> you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
only has a potential of 80 so if you

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.629 
only has a potential of 80 so if you
have<00:03:28.840> players<00:03:29.170> like<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.500> where<00:03:30.069> you<00:03:30.220> really

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
have players like that where you really

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.789 
have players like that where you really
know<00:03:30.970> they<00:03:31.540> are<00:03:31.780> playing<00:03:32.079> at<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.410> biggest

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
know they are playing at the biggest

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.190 
know they are playing at the biggest
clubs<00:03:33.160> but<00:03:33.459> their<00:03:33.609> potential<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.329> low<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.930> would

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
clubs but their potential is low I would

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.170 
clubs but their potential is low I would
recommend<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:35.920> guys<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.130> do<00:03:36.519> that<00:03:36.549> with<00:03:36.970> those

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
recommend you guys to do that with those

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.750 
recommend you guys to do that with those
kind<00:03:37.569> of<00:03:37.690> players<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.260> Munir<00:03:38.889> al-hadi<00:03:39.459> is

kind of players and Munir al-hadi is
just<00:03:40.150> one<00:03:40.359> example<00:03:40.540> for<00:03:41.319> that<00:03:41.470> one<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:42.010> really

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
just one example for that one I really

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.000 
just one example for that one I really
