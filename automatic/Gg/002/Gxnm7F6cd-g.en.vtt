taken<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.620> liberty<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:07.950> making<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.790> heading

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
taken the liberty of making this heading

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.120 
taken the liberty of making this heading
one<00:00:09.450> kind<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.019> making<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.380> larger<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:10.769> it'd<00:00:11.040> be

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
one kind of making it larger so it'd be

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.039 
one kind of making it larger so it'd be
easier<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> see<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.090> go<00:00:12.120> through<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.929> just

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
easier to see as we go through it's just

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.400 
easier to see as we go through it's just
for<00:00:13.349> reference<00:00:13.500> purposes<00:00:14.299> now<00:00:15.299> as<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.289> can
