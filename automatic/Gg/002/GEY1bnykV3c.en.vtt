00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.650
 dynamic protection system is essentially 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.880
 two metal plate sandwich 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.610
 between which there is an explosive 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.380
 substance in contact with the projectile and the top 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.420
 the plate on the explosive turns out to be 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.789
 pressure which leads to undermining 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.699
 charge the blast wave goes like this 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 way that affects the projectile without giving him 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.050
 damage the armor itself 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.440
 curtain active protection system at first 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.980
 look like fireworks but due to 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.110
 smoke screen and power 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.150
 to the false main targets protects the tank from 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.150
 laser -guided missiles 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.660
 190 with the easier as any other 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.820
 armored vehicles can be equipped with a complex 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.829
 active protection arena designed it 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.140
 engineering design bureau 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.309
 from Moscow region Kolomna and today you 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.930
 first see their action shoot 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.820
 a war shell to break through to us of course 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.979
 not allowed so we took advantage 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.170
 others who saw it and not such tanks 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.399
 Covered for armor became a target for us 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.399
 d80 plates 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.910
 in my hands the famous legendary 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.580
 rpg-7 released there were over 9 million 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.430
 pieces having such a successful hit 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.260
 you can destroy the whole tank we 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 installed an anti-tank grenade launcher 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.880
 special carriage distance to the tank 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.150
 about 50 meters and the shell will overcome 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.260
 cases in less than a second 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.310
 resist the rocket grenade will 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.470
 complex arena 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 it consists of three main elements 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.150
 first of all, this is a radar view 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.020
 also protective ammunition located 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.790
 launch shaft 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.760
 and of course computing 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.310
 which is to manage this principle 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.900
 the arena's work such a radar to detect 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.729
 flying grenade or rocket 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.460
 determine its speed and direction 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.619
 flight post to secondary ammunition 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.640
 who are exploding their shards 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.979
 destroys it without letting it reach its goal 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.979
 readiness one attention by usb 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.710
 the fire 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.850
 on a rocket grenade fired by me 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.580
 was established cumulative combat 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.550
 a piece capable of piercing armor thick 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.950
 up to half a meter the speed of its flight is more 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:39.990
 200 meters per second but the complex is active 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.990
 protection arenas worked like clockwork 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.189
 here you can see how ammunition is protected 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.780
 shot out of the launch shaft and 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:53.709
 turns the projectile into a beautiful line 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.709
 all-seeing eye
