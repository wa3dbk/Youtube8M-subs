00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
want to note that 4G it's in green this

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.730 
want to note that 4G it's in green this
is<00:01:22.649> a<00:01:23.060> phone<00:01:24.060> call<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.810> much<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> phone

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
video you video reveille and then LTE so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.920 
video you video reveille and then LTE so
for<00:01:33.259> green<00:01:34.259> 4G<00:01:34.710> signifies<00:01:35.310> an<00:01:35.729> LTE<00:01:36.570> connection

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
for green 4G signifies an LTE connection

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.029 
for green 4G signifies an LTE connection
so<00:01:38.810> even<00:01:39.810> when<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> phone<00:01:40.200> call<00:01:40.439> comes<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
so even when the phone call comes in you

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.920 
so even when the phone call comes in you
should<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.700> four<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.689> four

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
should see that the four and the four

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.020 
should see that the four and the four
the<00:01:43.229> green<00:01:43.439> 4G<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> LTE<00:01:44.250> connection<00:01:44.549> does<00:01:44.850> not

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the green 4G the LTE connection does not

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.280 
the green 4G the LTE connection does not
drop<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.829> during<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.549> phone<00:01:47.820> call

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.069 

during<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.439> phone<00:01:53.680> call<00:01:53.710> let's<00:01:54.280> do<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:55.079> speed

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
during the phone call let's do a speed

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.499 
during the phone call let's do a speed
test<00:01:56.259> here<00:01:56.470> just<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:57.790> do<00:01:57.939> a<00:01:57.970> quick<00:01:58.330> one<00:02:00.509> okay

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
test here just just do a quick one okay

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.910 
test here just just do a quick one okay
so<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.689> connection<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.229> pretty<00:02:05.470> good<00:02:05.619> at

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
so so the connection is pretty good at

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.120 
so so the connection is pretty good at
state<00:02:06.189> time<00:02:06.460> so<00:02:07.000> people<00:02:07.420> are<00:02:07.720> on<00:02:08.050> data<00:02:08.619> heavily

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
state time so people are on data heavily

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.960 
state time so people are on data heavily
but<00:02:09.700> uh<00:02:10.080> maybe<00:02:11.080> not<00:02:11.769> uploading<00:02:12.310> as<00:02:12.430> much<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:12.849> we

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
but uh maybe not uploading as much so we

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.410 
but uh maybe not uploading as much so we
should<00:02:13.120> see<00:02:13.269> a<00:02:13.300> big<00:02:13.630> jump<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:15.250> data<00:02:15.910> rates<00:02:16.180> for

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
should see a big jump on data rates for

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.220 
should see a big jump on data rates for
the<00:02:16.510> upload<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.250> yeah<00:02:18.550> definitely<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.420> great

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
the upload so yeah definitely a great

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.080 
the upload so yeah definitely a great
feature<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.800> have<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.489> in<00:02:21.610> case<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.880> want<00:02:22.060> to

you the a glimpse of what to expect the
full<00:03:50.769> t<00:03:50.980> connection<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.810> hopefully<00:03:52.810> it'll<00:03:52.959> be

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
full t connection and hopefully it'll be

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.250 
full t connection and hopefully it'll be
coming<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:54.040> US<00:03:54.370> carriers<00:03:54.940> soon<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:56.109> that

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
coming to the US carriers soon so that

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.080
