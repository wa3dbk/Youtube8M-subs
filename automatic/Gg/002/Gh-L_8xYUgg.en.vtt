been against elite quarterbacks for the
year<00:01:23.850> Carolina's<00:01:24.390> defense<00:01:24.830> they've<00:01:25.830> allowed

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
year Carolina's defense they've allowed

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.260 
year Carolina's defense they've allowed
opposing<00:01:26.369> quarterbacks<00:01:26.880> complete

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
opposing quarterbacks complete

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
opposing quarterbacks complete
sixty-seven<00:01:27.930> percent<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
sixty-seven percent for like a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
sixty-seven percent for like a
two-to-one<00:01:29.340> tikida<00:01:29.909> int<00:01:30.450> ratio<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.930> close<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
two-to-one tikida int ratio are close to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
two-to-one tikida int ratio are close to
it<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.100> i<00:01:32.130> think<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.820> breeze<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> be

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it so i think the breeze is going to be

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.569 
it so i think the breeze is going to be
able<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> huge<00:01:34.259> game<00:01:34.560> yeah<00:01:35.009> pretty

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
able to have a huge game yeah pretty

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.609 
able to have a huge game yeah pretty
easily<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.079> when<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
easily and you know that when that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.319 
easily and you know that when that
happens<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.220> good<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.549> Carolina's<00:01:38.970> defense

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
happens as good as Carolina's defense

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.660 
happens as good as Carolina's defense
has<00:01:39.420> been<00:01:39.450> playing<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.170> last<00:01:40.320> few<00:01:40.530> weeks<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
has been playing the last few weeks you

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.190 
has been playing the last few weeks you
know<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.060> ordinarily<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.869> Saints<00:01:43.110> will

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
know I think ordinarily the Saints will

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.980 
know I think ordinarily the Saints will
be<00:01:43.290> poised<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.530> 33<00:01:44.220> or<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.729> points<00:01:44.990> knock

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
be poised for 33 or more points knock

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
be poised for 33 or more points knock
off<00:01:46.170> three<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:46.500> four<00:01:46.649> points<00:01:47.220> because

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
off three or four points because

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.460 
off three or four points because
Carolina's<00:01:48.090> defensive<00:01:48.479> playing<00:01:48.659> well<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
Carolina's defensive playing well you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.039 
Carolina's defensive playing well you
still<00:01:49.740> got<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> saints<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.729> around<00:01:50.880> 29<00:01:51.420> now

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
still got the saints at around 29 now

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
still got the saints at around 29 now
can<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.040> hold<00:01:53.250> Carolina<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
can they can can they hold Carolina to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
can they can can they hold Carolina to
24<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:55.140> less<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.530> 23<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.009> less<00:01:56.130> i<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.460> they
