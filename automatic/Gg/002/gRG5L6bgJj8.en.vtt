00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 the other I have already done and 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.960
 with today I have mine 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.750
 sporting goals are done I always have 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.610
 Go straight with your partner as well 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.190
 her caring andrea mass talked 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.859
 and he said the tiger the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.359
 always achieved the goals they themselves 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.840
 Even for this season you have yourself 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.810
 quite explicitly these olympic games 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.760
 performed 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.719
 I had these goals of this 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.440
 Season last year I wanted 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.390
 Overall World Cup win 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.780
 but this year i was really 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.559
 focused on the olympia de and i wanted 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.840
 show you here my best performance 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.520
 this best services that show up 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 for years in the World Cup 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.460
 Of course, the past season was one 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.320
 Except they are an exception season 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.600
 This year it is not that easy 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.800
 went 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.480
 they really have one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.430
 have taken an extraordinary step 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.619
 During the season the trainer 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.840
 has changed them suits the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.200
 decisive push given that it 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.960
 running here so well is normal so that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.500
 if a team wins the change toni 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.170
 and our manager was not like us 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.430
 Wanted to stay home because he has 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.830
 family now and were 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.360
 we had to change that 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.660
 Wanted to find new trainers 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.390
 but it's not just good people too 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.390
 find and people that fit 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.080
 thought that was not the right thing 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.510
 and I am very happy that we have 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.100
 made that decision and from there 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.930
 has gone a bit easier 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.580
 the successful trainer in the past 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.560
 season that was it addressed the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.030
 libya agony then is walter and crown 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.000
 they got separated from each other 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.580
 and now mauro pini is a great team 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.710
 You can push yourself or how can 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.750
 you have to imagine a new one 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.430
 coach a very different philosophy of 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.770
 Skiing had a completely different experience 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.340
 training program what does a coach do? 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.340
 different than the other 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.100
 there was no discussion that was 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.330
 just that with a human you can 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.030
 you find the right energy right 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.760
 I do not say to fellow man as 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.280
 you can not get in with a person 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.070
 that if you try and where you want but 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.959
 never works and unfortunately not like that 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.989
 that we do not feel that first and 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.630
 we are looking for that maybe everybody is doing it 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.690
 better day but sometimes that happens 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.180
 not and it's not us now 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.190
 have changed everything with training or 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.020
 sat or personal I'm coming myself 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.040
 think that's important that's good 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.140
 energy intimate 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.470
 I always say that's not just mine 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.620
 work but that must all physio coach 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.940
 it has to fit everything the ps has today 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.350
 something given what it has never 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.690
 has given at olympic 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.790
 winter play namely an ex aequo 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.800
 decision to win in one 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.340
 alpine discipline together with dominik 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.530
 they have won that the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.580
 double joy then you have it all 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.580
 nice taken at hand 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.970
 but nice and 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.980
 a special one
