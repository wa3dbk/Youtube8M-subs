00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
search so these two opponent advantage

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.680

and<00:02:01.429> we'll<00:02:01.700> all<00:02:01.880> still

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.170 

the<00:02:11.410> second<00:02:11.860> time<00:02:12.040> we're<00:02:12.670> becoming<00:02:12.820> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.300 
the second time we're becoming the
church<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:13.930> usual<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:14.680> us<00:02:14.770> but<00:02:15.040> this

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
year we came here to be the champion so

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.590 
year we came here to be the champion so
it<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> success<00:02:18.700> for<00:02:18.850> us<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.450> is

it is not a success for us this is

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.020 
it is not a success for us this is
almost<00:02:20.220> maybe<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.340> means<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.700> we<00:02:21.850> lose

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
