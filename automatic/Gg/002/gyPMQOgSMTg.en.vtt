00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
before I'll try to avoid the obvious

and seamless look to it especially on

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.670

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
the top and bottoms the power button is

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.290 
the top and bottoms the power button is
rather<00:01:20.830> small<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.490> located<00:01:21.970> right<00:01:22.120> in<00:01:22.270> the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
middle and that will definitely take

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.220 
middle and that will definitely take
some<00:01:23.890> time<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.310> get<00:01:24.460> used<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:24.910> and<00:01:25.300> also<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
some time to get used to and also the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.720 
some time to get used to and also the
fact<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.620> it<00:01:26.800> comes<00:01:27.010> in<00:01:27.160> at<00:01:27.280> just<00:01:27.310> seven

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
fact that it comes in at just seven

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.430 
fact that it comes in at just seven
point<00:01:27.940> three<00:01:28.000> millimeters<00:01:28.750> thick<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.260> weighs

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
point three millimeters thick and weighs

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.500 
point three millimeters thick and weighs
in<00:01:29.470> at<00:01:29.680> 152<00:01:30.460> grams<00:01:30.580> makes<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.330> very

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
in at 152 grams makes it very

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.140 
in at 152 grams makes it very
comfortable<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:32.140> hold<00:01:32.260> in<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.800> hand<00:01:33.150> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
one of the things that I don't know why

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.370 
one of the things that I don't know why
every<00:02:17.580> phone<00:02:17.820> manufacturer<00:02:18.480> hasn't<00:02:18.930> done<00:02:19.110> yet

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
every phone manufacturer hasn't done yet

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.890 
every phone manufacturer hasn't done yet
and<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.860> front-facing<00:02:20.550> speakers<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.510> it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
and that is front-facing speakers and it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.020 
and that is front-facing speakers and it
definitely<00:02:22.230> makes<00:02:22.380> logical<00:02:22.710> sense<00:02:23.040> there<00:02:23.850> is

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
definitely makes logical sense there is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.550 
definitely makes logical sense there is
a<00:02:24.060> high<00:02:24.300> likelihood<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.200> will<00:02:25.440> be

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
a high likelihood that you will be

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.350

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.070

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
bringing up that the battery was

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.350 
bringing up that the battery was
impressive<00:04:54.390> on<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.870> Sony<00:04:55.110> Xperia<00:04:55.380> z3<00:04:56.360> but

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
impressive on the Sony Xperia z3 but
