00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.760
 the fundamental rules of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.210
 the training you have decided on yourself 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.190
 train 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.110
 that's fine I 'm going to give you 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 some ideas some good leads 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.900
 to ensure efficiency in your 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.210
 training 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.320
 the first rule is already to know 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.029
 why am I training 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.119
 ask yourself the question of your 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.760
 motivation it's a great idea 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.920
 will allow you to re motivate yourself in 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.760
 the phases of demotivation the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.040
 progressivity 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.170
 ie you have to know how to start if 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000
 you are beginner started by playing 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.890
 on the training time 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.120
 and then with the progression you will 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.399
 also play on the intensity 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.239
 intensity is the speed or the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.969
 cardiac frequency 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.350
 the variety you have to vary you have to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.149
 diversify your workouts 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.860
 if you repeat all the same time gesture 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 muscles get used to this routine 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.039
 where you have to surprise them 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.770
 we can change the playground is 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.030
 to say go on track go in the forest 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.760
 urban race 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.800
 you can also varied the session in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 herself do a running session at 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.900
 single foot in slow race 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.650
 varied or rather a reinforcement 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.930
 muscular 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.600
 it's the regularity your body has 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 tend to forget the exercises that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.619
 you propose him so he must 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.270
 repeat these same regularly 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.549
 exercises so that's one of the keys 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 important to progress enough 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.680
 paradoxically to rest is also 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 therefore train not only to think 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.579
 advanced years but also to all 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.610
 resting sequences to avoid the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.890
 obviously overtraining injuries 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.840
 listen to each other and listen to each other 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460
 have the right to be tired you have 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
 the right to prefer to rest and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.840
 and especially during your sessions each 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.380
 month during your cycles go there 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 slowly 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.540
 listen you slow down he's resting and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.490
 you so if you follow all these 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.770
 rules I promise you that you 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.869
 will arrive at your goal while 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.130
 keeping the fun and motivation 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.130
 a true Parisian
