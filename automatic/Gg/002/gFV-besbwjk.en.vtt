once again the goalkeeper well I mean I
guess<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.889> can't<00:04:23.070> blame<00:04:23.160> him<00:04:23.550> too<00:04:23.760> much<00:04:23.970> for

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
guess you can't blame him too much for

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.490 
guess you can't blame him too much for
that<00:04:24.240> but<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.600> know<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.780> takes<00:04:24.960> Carroll<00:04:25.290> down

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
that but you know it takes Carroll down

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.960 
that but you know it takes Carroll down
there<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.860> ball<00:04:26.010> seemed<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.310> roll<00:04:26.490> under<00:04:26.730> his

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
there the ball seemed to roll under his

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.330 
there the ball seemed to roll under his
body<00:04:27.449> before<00:04:27.780> he<00:04:27.990> took<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.290> man<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:29.160> was<00:04:29.280> a

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
body before he took the man so it was a

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.680 
body before he took the man so it was a
definite<00:04:29.699> penalty<00:04:30.030> booking<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.540> right

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690
