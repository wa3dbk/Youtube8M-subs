 This game can be found here as well 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.180
 again the note easily 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.949
 assemble 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.710
 okay here is the reference to others 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.590
 lego city sets very cool 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.359
 ok the comic definitely back 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.420
 very cool the office already often at lego 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.799
 city ​​seen here very much back 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 very cool 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.320
 okay, what do we see here yet 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.590
 the crook and the criminal try 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.420
 to flee from the police 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.180
 not so great if that will succeed well 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.920
 Let's see if our policeman is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.159
 I'm still looking really good here 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.430
 the other side to see if we have anything else left 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.079
 not really be overlooked 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.540
 we can see that in the front of the big one too 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.380
 Okay then I would say 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.259
 we always pack the thing out hey okay 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.210
 I am very careful but I can 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.159
 open because said 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:53.399
 may I do it ok 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:02:01.000
 Packing is open might be fine 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:03.939
 number one was really a lot of lego pieces 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.399
 Your gut assembly will be really cool 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:11.769
 I think there are a lot of parts we share 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:15.099
 already see a life culture here 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.500
 that's number one so we'll look 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:23.790
 even if company from showing the same to me 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.980
 once again, the number two on 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.569
 very cool here what the police car 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.720
 bit wise of the caught 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.349
 if you want to say transporter 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.349
 to grab 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.959
 ok then lift the kmu already contrary 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.459
 the stickers for our prisoner 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.970
 transporter yes always the mark 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:52.049
 to match number 60 043 exactly 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:55.090
 I have police here and then 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:59.910
 Number 03 caught transporter number 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:05.769
 03 Okay, what else do we have in here? 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:11.500
 we will see the help for the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.590
 Assembling fat I have to say that will 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.959
 to assemble a more complex 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.720
 probably easy but a lot and here 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.560
 again that looks cool 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.359
 and stadium monstertrucks okay but we 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.220
 today have the escape from the 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.989
 caught transporter with a quad 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.019
 also there may be quite you forget 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.760
 tell the prisoners of sorry here because 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.130
 that comes and here the prisoner 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.919
 transporter of course tries the 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.209
 ganove here are criminal friend with 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:44.889
 the choir from the captured transporter 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.480
 yes try to help them that he is there 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:52.599
 the war even escapes the guitar hero 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.370
 wood takes the grid here ice-cold 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.239
 from the captured transporter 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.110
 are ok but something very dangerous 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:07.459
 No, that's it, you make it back to him 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:11.390
 says haye is again too deep air 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:14.329
 from the captured transporter two 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.209
 bags full of powerful that we now have a 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.699
 really cool assembly and also believe 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.560
 I have a really cool escape since 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.210
 every case at the next video 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.190
 if we assemble the thing here and 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.560
 even the escape may reenact 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.940
 or not so if he curses 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.350
 but the escape succeeds or not 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.880
 Of course, the fur men in the video 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.350
 be seen in any case, while I 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.150
 had a lot of fun today i hope we 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.240
 So until the next time 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.240
