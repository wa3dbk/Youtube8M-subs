and good morning this is Abraham Sultan

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.710 
and good morning this is Abraham Sultan
from<00:00:32.810> Jerusalem<00:00:33.490> with<00:00:34.490> a<00:00:34.760> suspicious<00:00:35.240> face

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
from Jerusalem with a suspicious face

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.340 
from Jerusalem with a suspicious face
today<00:00:36.500> we'll<00:00:36.830> be<00:00:36.860> learning<00:00:37.100> how<00:00:37.310> to<00:00:38.350> draw

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
today we'll be learning how to draw

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.430 
today we'll be learning how to draw
using<00:00:39.860> symbols<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:42.280> suspicious<00:00:43.280> face<00:00:44.230> all<00:00:45.230> the

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
using symbols a suspicious face all the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.970 
using symbols a suspicious face all the
symbols<00:00:45.680> that<00:00:45.980> were<00:00:46.250> previously<00:00:46.700> created<00:00:47.980> can

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
symbols that were previously created can

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.660 
symbols that were previously created can
be<00:00:49.190> found<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.570> website<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:51.020> can<00:00:51.440> download

be found on the website you can download

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.030 
be found on the website you can download
source<00:00:52.670> files<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.530> there<00:00:54.530> are<00:00:54.620> previous

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
source files and there are previous

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.180 
source files and there are previous
tutorials<00:00:55.580> where<00:00:55.850> we<00:00:56.059> created<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:58.059> bases<00:00:59.059> arm

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
tutorials where we created the bases arm

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.460 
tutorials where we created the bases arm
here<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.640> nose<00:01:01.879> would<00:01:02.839> be<00:01:02.989> creating<00:01:03.320> new

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
here the nose would be creating new

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.680 
here the nose would be creating new
symbols<00:01:03.860> today<00:01:04.160> that<00:01:05.089> they're<00:01:05.300> pretty<00:01:05.480> much

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
symbols today that they're pretty much

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.220 
symbols today that they're pretty much
simple<00:01:06.230> and<00:01:06.500> by<00:01:06.920> observation<00:01:07.670> is<00:01:08.510> possible<00:01:09.080> to

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
simple and by observation is possible to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.550 
simple and by observation is possible to
create<00:01:09.440> yield<00:01:09.950> symbols<00:01:10.430> yourself<00:01:11.560> let's

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
create yield symbols yourself let's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.370 
create yield symbols yourself let's
create<00:01:12.980> the<00:01:13.330> static<00:01:14.330> elements<00:01:15.490> no<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.760> ears

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
create the static elements no the ears

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.700 
create the static elements no the ears
they<00:01:18.380> don't<00:01:18.710> change<00:01:19.010> much<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.060> they<00:01:20.390> can<00:01:20.540> drop

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
they don't change much and they can drop

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710 
they don't change much and they can drop
and<00:01:21.710> let's<00:01:22.550> use<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.940> free<00:01:23.120> transform<00:01:23.420> tool

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
and let's use the free transform tool

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.630 
and let's use the free transform tool
and<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:26.210> have<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.360> nose<00:01:26.630> we<00:01:26.840> have<00:01:27.020> here<00:01:27.460> we<00:01:28.460> have

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
and you have a nose we have here we have

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.359 
and you have a nose we have here we have
a<00:01:28.670> face<00:01:29.920> now<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.100> time<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.610> move<00:01:31.880> on<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.329> more

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
a face now it's time to move on to more

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.149 
a face now it's time to move on to more
expressive<00:01:34.369> elements<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.799> let's<00:01:36.799> duplicate

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
expressive elements and let's duplicate

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.639 
expressive elements and let's duplicate
this<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.969> this<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.360> normal<00:01:38.630> why<00:01:38.930> we<00:01:39.439> created

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
this I this is the normal why we created

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.060 
this I this is the normal why we created
another<00:01:40.280> previous<00:01:40.790> tutorial<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.500> circle

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
another previous tutorial just a circle

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.719 
another previous tutorial just a circle
with<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.369> dot<00:01:43.640> in<00:01:43.969> the<00:01:44.570> middle<00:01:45.280> don't<00:01:46.280> need<00:01:46.430> a

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
with a dot in the middle don't need a

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.190 
with a dot in the middle don't need a
tutorial<00:01:47.180> for<00:01:47.390> that<00:01:48.100> people<00:01:49.100> might<00:01:49.990> but<00:01:50.990> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
tutorial for that people might but the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.399 
tutorial for that people might but the
fact<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.619> we<00:01:51.680> will<00:01:52.070> need<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.579> special<00:01:53.479> eye<00:01:53.630> for

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
fact is we will need a special eye for

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.330 
fact is we will need a special eye for
our<00:01:54.619> suspicious<00:01:55.430> face<00:01:55.670> why<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:57.829> man<00:01:58.070> is

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
our suspicious face why the man is

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.450 
our suspicious face why the man is
suspicious<00:01:59.149> he's<00:01:59.390> looking<00:01:59.869> sideways<00:02:00.460> who's

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
suspicious he's looking sideways who's

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.060 
suspicious he's looking sideways who's
coming<00:02:02.000> now

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
coming now

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.650 
coming now
something<00:02:04.070> wrong<00:02:04.310> here<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.790> people<00:02:07.790> could

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
something wrong here so the people could

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.860 
something wrong here so the people could
be<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.110> element<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:11.420> could<00:02:11.570> express

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
be a element that could express

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.800 
be a element that could express
something<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.880> we're<00:02:14.030> going<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.240> have<00:02:14.360> both

something so we're going to have both

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.990 
something so we're going to have both
eyes<00:02:16.060> looking<00:02:17.060> one<00:02:17.390> way<00:02:17.860> sideways<00:02:19.000> what's

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
general do you could in clinic rotate

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.820 
general do you could in clinic rotate
the<00:03:08.690> added<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.440> little<00:03:09.739> bit<00:03:09.890> too<00:03:10.250> inclined<00:03:10.580> ah

expressive when I have a open their eyes
wide<00:03:19.519> open<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:20.560> suspicious<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.100> also

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
wide open is suspicious it is also

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.020 
wide open is suspicious it is also
effective<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.410> could<00:03:24.410> be<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.830> nice<00:03:25.070> solution

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
effective and could be a nice solution

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.140 
effective and could be a nice solution
to<00:03:27.489> one<00:03:28.489> y<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.450> eyelid<00:03:30.320> rotated<00:03:31.150> pointing

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
to one y one I eyelid rotated pointing

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.900 
to one y one I eyelid rotated pointing
down<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.390> other<00:03:32.750> one<00:03:32.989> straight<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.620> also

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
down the other one straight this also

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.660 
down the other one straight this also
indicates<00:03:34.910> some<00:03:35.630> are<00:03:36.230> suspicions<00:03:36.980> which<00:03:37.459> is

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
indicates some are suspicions which is

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.190 
indicates some are suspicions which is
also<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.420> good<00:03:38.810> solution<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.739> this<00:03:39.920> way<00:03:40.100> to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
also a good solution I like this way to

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.509 
also a good solution I like this way to
everything<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.320> possible<00:03:42.530> nothing<00:03:43.430> is

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
everything is possible nothing is

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.720 
everything is possible nothing is
written<00:03:43.640> in<00:03:43.940> stone<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:45.799> goes<00:03:46.010> according

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
written in stone and that goes according

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.910 
written in stone and that goes according
to<00:03:46.940> situation<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.810> goes<00:03:48.019> according<00:03:48.709> to

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
to situation that goes according to

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
to situation that goes according to
tasted<00:03:49.549> style<00:03:50.739> let's<00:03:51.739> put<00:03:51.920> some<00:03:52.130> under<00:03:52.730> lids

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
tasted style let's put some under lids

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.800 
tasted style let's put some under lids
and<00:03:53.660> again<00:03:54.230> we<00:03:54.560> are<00:03:54.590> not<00:03:54.890> creating<00:03:55.100> any<00:03:55.489> new

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
and again we are not creating any new

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.990 
and again we are not creating any new
symbol<00:03:56.810> you'll<00:03:57.049> be<00:03:57.290> using<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.830> upper<00:03:58.549> lid<00:03:58.730> and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
symbol you'll be using the upper lid and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.860 
symbol you'll be using the upper lid and
rotating<00:03:59.510> and<00:04:00.140> copy<00:04:00.799> paste<00:04:01.190> in<00:04:02.180> place<00:04:02.420> for

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
rotating and copy paste in place for

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.210 
rotating and copy paste in place for
alignment

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
alignment

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.460 
alignment
and<00:04:04.610> we<00:04:04.820> have<00:04:05.000> now<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.480> see<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.080> eyelid

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
and we have now you see that the eyelid

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.850 
and we have now you see that the eyelid
is<00:04:06.710> covering<00:04:07.250> part<00:04:07.610> of<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.820> nose<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:09.560> is<00:04:09.740> to

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
is covering part of the nose it is to

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
is covering part of the nose it is to
say<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.940> layers<00:04:11.480> are<00:04:12.050> adjusted<00:04:12.980> we<00:04:13.310> have<00:04:13.520> one

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
say the layers are adjusted we have one

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.300 
say the layers are adjusted we have one
element<00:04:14.240> on<00:04:14.420> each<00:04:14.630> layer<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:15.740> have<00:04:15.980> to

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
element on each layer and we have to

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.800 
element on each layer and we have to
have<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:17.030> nose<00:04:17.630> on<00:04:17.660> top<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.760> first<00:04:20.209> let's<00:04:20.420> name

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
have the nose on top so first let's name

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.130 
have the nose on top so first let's name
the<00:04:21.049> layer<00:04:21.230> but<00:04:22.070> since<00:04:22.340> we<00:04:22.490> know<00:04:22.700> what<00:04:23.600> which

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
the layer but since we know what which

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.620 
the layer but since we know what which
layer<00:04:24.380> contains<00:04:25.160> what<00:04:25.460> you're<00:04:26.240> going<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.450> drag

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
layer contains what you're going to drag

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.960 
layer contains what you're going to drag
and<00:04:26.780> drop<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:26.990> nose<00:04:27.320> layers<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.890> top<00:04:28.130> so

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
and drop the nose layers to the top so

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.120 
and drop the nose layers to the top so
we<00:04:29.000> saw<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.420> problem<00:04:29.960> now<00:04:30.110> we<00:04:30.170> have<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.860> nose

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
we saw the problem now we have the nose

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.190 
we saw the problem now we have the nose
nothing<00:04:31.640> is<00:04:31.730> covering<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.270> nose<00:04:32.510> anymore<00:04:32.840> the

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
nothing is covering the nose anymore the

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.540 
nothing is covering the nose anymore the
nose<00:04:33.440> is<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:33.860> top<00:04:34.600> one<00:04:35.600> more<00:04:36.380> good<00:04:36.980> reason<00:04:37.340> for

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
nose is on top one more good reason for

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.000 
nose is on top one more good reason for
naming<00:04:37.880> layers<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.470> they<00:04:39.680> are<00:04:39.710> clear

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
naming layers is that they are clear

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.860 
naming layers is that they are clear
when<00:04:40.220> we<00:04:40.250> need<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:41.560> rearrange<00:04:42.560> them<00:04:43.010> let's
