00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.900
 to the good colombian saturdays today we are going 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.070
 to make a look that side because here 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.300
 before I did not have a little screen now 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.310
 I have a screen before I had to look 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.950
 the target and now I go sight to 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.130
 the little screen is good, you'll forgive me 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.280
 they look our eyes in the eyes 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.250
 two are the suns in the nails 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.670
 today what we are going to do in a 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.410
 very funny figurine that what 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.800
 what it does is somehow we substitute 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.090
 the chord and re for simply the string 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.550
 re the fourth the rope fourth dance is worth 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.590
 so that allows us to say 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.650
 suggests the chord network which is 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.720
 listening knows what was 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.100
 putting in a network chord but it leaves you 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.350
 the hands free a little to do 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.350
 some clever or some story 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.050
 many issues appear and one of them 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.220
 for example the brou lenin plus sweet baby 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.220
 sounds that a kitchen makes 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.850
 ah 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.330
 I see the rope of the air and now I have 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.330
 put to zero 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.079
 s 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.950
 and what are we going to do? Let's do a 13 0 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.950
 two 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.870
 a figure multiplying the 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.850
 how 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.850
 we make it a culotte 320 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.750
 we do a slide two three 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.620
 how 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.460
 and then we come back we repeat it and it's 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.460
 when we put the side 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.350
 and we see it reasoning 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.460
 a very very very typical resource of 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.730
 bluegrass you've already heard 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.050
 you will see that it sounds all the time this is 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.860
 what my teacher calls jean nois is to say 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.540
 noise in the sun because they are a series of 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.150
 ix that everyone makes all the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.520
 world repeats that they are part of all the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.460
 repertoire of bluegrass and generally 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.040
 melodically it does not say anything that's why it's 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.320
 Chinese is worth but you have to know before 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.180
 to huti nois then we can get him 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.360
 our melodies but Chinese is at 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.990
 what to hook 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.990
 good 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.590
 all right 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.730
 for me 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.080
 Hello 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.459
 well of the homemade bread so that the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.459
 right hand 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.670
 to 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.960
 for 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.960
 to 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.610
 the rest 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.880
 to food 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.530
 but 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.530
 today 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.270
 ah 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.340
 good the figure that I want to see 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.340
 I was only 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.480
 here
