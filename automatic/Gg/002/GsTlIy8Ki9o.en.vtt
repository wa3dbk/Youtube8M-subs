 they are very irritable individuals it is very aggressive very impulsive about everything that 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.950
 it comes to mind the first thing that makes good with this confluence of these 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.669
 three personality dimensions 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.820
 very difficult note to understand is happening and especially something very 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.219
 important 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.349
 it is not very difficult to know what can happen because they move inside it 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.179
 in child behavior when they are 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.559
 a corrala dares to the extremely aggressive behavior that can come 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:31.279
 to the obelisk only when they are also cornered tamgho and anguished scared 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.400
 worried stunned 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.250
 hit by a car 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.800
 but this is a tool and minor conditions next to a 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.720
 dimension of personality structure that are at this moment totally 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.990
 csat closed I do not fear that they are the personality of the uma - moment more 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.780
 difficult is the will be activated 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.520
 intensify and the results the club that we are seeing of course are 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.960
 perhaps it joins the smaller dimensions next to the complexity these structures 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.680
 the narcissistic histrionics and associates and dean phillip lies 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.400
 we can understand the denial that the financial reality of the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.840
 world and the petrov circumstances you will read from the country 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.790
 that big of lies in building in percent oo structures 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.890
 large percent and physios of uncertain plans 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.930
 do not forget that they are not like that because they want 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.240
 they are like this because they can not be otherwise and it is that perhaps the world is not 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:40.810
 moves by leading narcissists perhaps we are not seeing the reality of 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.829
 respected in the political world I believed that what politicians and society 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.610
 she ma populism 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 where is the resolution to all this we can quickly decide what 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.510
