Mickey was actually a Google search and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.319 
Mickey was actually a Google search and
I<00:01:26.430> did<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.270> liner<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.930> inside<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.770> card<00:01:29.329> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
let me take that in now I'm not really

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.859 
let me take that in now I'm not really
sure<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.960> believe<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.270> going

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
sure but I do believe that this is going

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.770 
sure but I do believe that this is going
to<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> photograph<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.729> child<00:01:41.780> inside

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to have a photograph of the child inside

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
to have a photograph of the child inside
of<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.340> I'm<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.549> 100%<00:01:44.970> positive<00:01:45.470> because<00:01:46.549> my

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
of it I'm not 100% positive because my

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.530 
of it I'm not 100% positive because my
membrane<00:01:47.939> bites<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.350> don't<00:01:49.560> remember<00:01:50.540> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
membrane bites and I don't remember I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.179 
membrane bites and I don't remember I
have<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.320> don't<00:01:52.439> even<00:01:52.649> remember<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.979> eat

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
have the time don't even remember to eat

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.830 
have the time don't even remember to eat
so<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.090> pretty<00:01:54.299> bad

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
so it's pretty bad

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.410 
so it's pretty bad
I<00:01:54.979> get<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.130> busy<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> don't<00:01:56.909> remember<00:01:57.119> anything

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
I get so busy I don't remember anything

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.929 
I get so busy I don't remember anything
but<00:01:57.600> anyway<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> put<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.409> there

wording I can finish this card up and
these<00:02:42.680> what<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.709> did<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:45.060> color<00:02:45.389> this<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:45.959> that

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
these what I did to color this so that

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.039 
these what I did to color this so that
they<00:02:46.230> would<00:02:46.379> match<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.919> is<00:02:47.609> this<00:02:48.120> map<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.810> all

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
they would match up is this map is all

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.170 
they would match up is this map is all
jig<00:02:49.379> it<00:02:49.620> has<00:02:49.769> all<00:02:49.950> sorts<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.310> cuts<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.669> swirls

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
jig it has all sorts of cuts and swirls

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.899 
jig it has all sorts of cuts and swirls
so<00:02:51.930> what<00:02:52.109> I<00:02:52.139> did<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.739> duplicated<00:02:53.250> this

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
so what I did is I duplicated this

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.559 
so what I did is I duplicated this
before<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.329> before<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:55.049> attached<00:02:55.469> it<00:02:55.799> I<00:02:56.569> hated

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
before I before I attached it I hated

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.409 
before I before I attached it I hated
the<00:02:58.019> math<00:02:58.199> by<00:02:58.439> itself<00:02:58.769> then<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.760> flood<00:03:00.120> filled

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
the math by itself then I flood filled

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.759 
the math by itself then I flood filled
it<00:03:00.599> with<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.780> color<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.199> the<00:03:01.260> parchment<00:03:01.739> paper

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
it with the color of the parchment paper

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.020 
it with the color of the parchment paper
so<00:03:02.010> then<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.489> went<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.560> match<00:03:04.560> them<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.310> made

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
so then when I went to match them I made

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.119 
so then when I went to match them I made
this<00:03:06.180> one<00:03:06.359> a<00:03:06.419> little<00:03:06.599> bit<00:03:06.780> smaller<00:03:07.099> when<00:03:08.099> I

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
this one a little bit smaller when I

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.089 
this one a little bit smaller when I
went<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.430> match<00:03:08.730> them<00:03:09.060> up<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:10.169> the<00:03:10.680> Nicks<00:03:10.919> and

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
went to match them up the the Nicks and

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.099 
went to match them up the the Nicks and
jigs<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.639> everything<00:03:12.030> all<00:03:12.239> matched<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.900> on

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
jigs and everything all matched up on

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.559 
jigs and everything all matched up on
the<00:03:13.230> card<00:03:13.669> and<00:03:14.669> now<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:14.909> see<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> little<00:03:15.359> bit<00:03:15.510> of

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
not necessary let's see here

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.730 
not necessary let's see here
I'm<00:04:11.270> gonna<00:04:11.720> put<00:04:11.990> it<00:04:12.110> over<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.410> little<00:04:12.590> bit

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
I'm gonna put it over a little bit

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.560 
I'm gonna put it over a little bit
closer<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.340> him<00:04:13.610> because<00:04:14.030> he's<00:04:14.180> already<00:04:14.360> found

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
closer to him because he's already found

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.009 
closer to him because he's already found
the<00:04:14.780> treasure<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.730> I<00:04:16.970> think<00:04:17.239> I'm<00:04:17.450> gonna<00:04:17.630> tuck

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
the treasure and I think I'm gonna tuck

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.470 
the treasure and I think I'm gonna tuck
it<00:04:18.620> under<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.100> little<00:04:19.549> tiny<00:04:19.760> bit<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.150> probably

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
it under a little tiny bit I probably

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.820 
it under a little tiny bit I probably
should<00:04:20.720> have<00:04:20.750> put<00:04:20.840> that<00:04:20.989> out<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.380> little<00:04:21.620> bit

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
should have put that out a little bit

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.410 
should have put that out a little bit
the<00:04:22.460> inside<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:25.180> handle<00:04:26.180> on<00:04:26.300> this

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
the inside of the the handle on this

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.240 
the inside of the the handle on this
treasure<00:04:26.750> chest<00:04:26.900> here<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.680> can't<00:04:27.920> see<00:04:28.190> it

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
treasure chest here you can't see it

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.190 
treasure chest here you can't see it
because<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:28.730> this<00:04:29.180> is<00:04:29.330> just<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.600> printing<00:04:29.990> cut

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
because it's this is just a printing cut

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.780 
because it's this is just a printing cut
