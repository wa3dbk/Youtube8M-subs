basically going to be a strategy on how
to<00:00:03.959> get<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.620> power<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.910> map<00:00:06.060> 5<00:00:06.390> and

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
to get the power on on the map 5 and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.750 
to get the power on on the map 5 and
also<00:00:06.990> how<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.230> get<00:00:08.010> into<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> pack<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> punch

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
also how to get into the pack a punch

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.700 
also how to get into the pack a punch
room<00:00:09.000> I've<00:00:09.540> had<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> lot<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> requests<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.590> do

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
room I've had a lot of requests to do

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.049 
room I've had a lot of requests to do
some<00:00:10.860> more<00:00:11.010> zombie<00:00:11.309> video<00:00:11.460> stuff<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> do

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
some more zombie video stuff what I do

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.450 
some more zombie video stuff what I do
this<00:00:12.300> pretty<00:00:12.679> much<00:00:13.679> assuming<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.340> this

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
this pretty much assuming that this

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.460 
this pretty much assuming that this
isn't<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> get<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> hundred<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.690> hundred

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
isn't going to get a hundred and hundred

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.439 
isn't going to get a hundred and hundred
thousand<00:00:16.859> or<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.100> views<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> previous

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
thousand or so views like the previous

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.630 
thousand or so views like the previous
video<00:00:18.840> did<00:00:19.050> where<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.619> did<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> kino<00:00:20.400> der<00:00:20.490> toten

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
video did where I did the kino der toten

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.920 
video did where I did the kino der toten
and<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> think<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.359> how<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.449> pronounce<00:00:21.570> it

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
and I think that's how you pronounce it

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.279 
and I think that's how you pronounce it
at<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> kino<00:00:22.590> der<00:00:22.680> toten<00:00:23.269> strategy<00:00:24.289> because

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
at the kino der toten strategy because

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.960 
at the kino der toten strategy because
this<00:00:25.410> has<00:00:25.529> been<00:00:25.680> done<00:00:25.890> before<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.550> probably

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
this has been done before and probably

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.790 
this has been done before and probably
been<00:00:27.510> done<00:00:27.779> bad<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
been done bad but this is going to be a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
been done bad but this is going to be a
really<00:00:28.980> quick<00:00:29.250> video<00:00:29.580> about<00:00:30.060> two<00:00:30.599> minutes

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
really quick video about two minutes

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.650 
really quick video about two minutes
long<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.399> yes<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.149> see<00:00:33.329> here<00:00:33.570> I'm

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
long and yes so as you can see here I'm

long and yes so as you can see here I'm
just<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:34.079> through<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.530> control<00:00:34.800> room<00:00:35.100> into

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
just going through the control room into

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.740 
just going through the control room into
this<00:00:35.430> huge<00:00:35.730> elevator<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.390> you'll<00:00:36.510> need<00:00:36.630> about

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
this huge elevator and you'll need about

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.209 
this huge elevator and you'll need about
three<00:00:37.079> thousand<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> clear<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> debris

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
three thousand to clear all the debris

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.549 
three thousand to clear all the debris
first<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> smaller<00:00:39.660> elevator<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> as

first with the smaller elevator and as
you<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.280> you'll<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> stairs

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
you go out of that you'll see the stairs

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.569 
you go out of that you'll see the stairs
in<00:00:42.120> front<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> control<00:00:42.989> room<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.790 
in front of you in the control room and
then<00:00:44.579> you'll<00:00:44.730> need<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.110> contribute<00:00:46.110> their

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that's on the stairs and then you'll

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.330

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
on the big elevator here is the power

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.160 
on the big elevator here is the power
I've<00:00:53.100> already<00:00:53.219> turned<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.030> yes<00:00:54.899> pretty

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
I've already turned it on but yes pretty

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.299 
I've already turned it on but yes pretty
much<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> same<00:00:55.559> anyway<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.100> how<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
much the same anyway and this is how to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
much the same anyway and this is how to
get<00:00:57.000> into<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> pack<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> punch<00:00:58.050> room<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.379> pretty

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
get into the pack a punch room is pretty

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.849 
get into the pack a punch room is pretty
easy<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> crawler<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.649> yeah<00:01:01.649> you'll

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
easy just make a crawler and yeah you'll

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.619 
easy just make a crawler and yeah you'll
find<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> pretty<00:01:02.250> simple<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.449> just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
find it pretty simple to do you just

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.390 
find it pretty simple to do you just
turn<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.170> these<00:01:04.290> switches<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:05.220> are

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
turn on all these switches there are

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.460 
turn on all these switches there are
four<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.670> them<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.060> go<00:01:06.180> from<00:01:06.420> DEFCON<00:01:06.900> level<00:01:06.930> one

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
four of them to go from DEFCON level one

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
four of them to go from DEFCON level one
to<00:01:07.799> five<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.479> through<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to five and then you go through the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.500 
to five and then you go through the
teleporter<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> control<00:01:11.040> room<00:01:11.510> you'll

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
teleporter in the control room you'll

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.969 
teleporter in the control room you'll
know<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> works<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.290> well<00:01:13.770> first

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
know if it works because well first

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.450 
know if it works because well first
let's<00:01:14.250> say<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:15.229> clearance<00:01:16.229> level<00:01:16.950> lift<00:01:17.220> it'll

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
let's say a clearance level lift it'll

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.620 
let's say a clearance level lift it'll
something<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> can't<00:01:18.540> really

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
something like that I can't really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.880 
something like that I can't really
remember<00:01:18.720> exactly<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.409> says<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
remember exactly what it says but it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.700 
remember exactly what it says but it
says<00:01:20.070> something<00:01:20.369> different<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.560> you'll<00:01:22.560> also

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
says something different and you'll also

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
says something different and you'll also
see<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> teleporter<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> sort<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
see in the teleporter there is a sort of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
see in the teleporter there is a sort of
computer<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.860> TV<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.759> sure<00:01:26.880> what

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
computer or TV I'm not really sure what

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
computer or TV I'm not really sure what
it's<00:01:27.180> supposed<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.770> into<00:01:29.009> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it's supposed to be but you go into that
