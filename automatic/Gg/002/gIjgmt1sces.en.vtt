00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
commentary I can just go back and edit

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.820 
commentary I can just go back and edit
out<00:04:47.820> what<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.000> don't<00:04:48.330> want<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.290> can<00:04:49.320> edit<00:04:49.620> out

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
out what I don't want and I can edit out

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.470 
out what I don't want and I can edit out
just<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.250> spaces<00:04:50.970> of<00:04:51.000> just<00:04:51.270> where<00:04:51.390> I'm

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
just the spaces of just where I'm

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.750 
just the spaces of just where I'm
thinking<00:04:51.960> about<00:04:52.140> where<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.320> left<00:04:52.500> off<00:04:52.770> now<00:04:53.610> when

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
thinking about where I left off now when

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.340 
thinking about where I left off now when
you<00:04:53.850> do<00:04:53.970> record<00:04:54.360> your<00:04:54.510> commentaries<00:04:55.110> like

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
you do record your commentaries like

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.170 
you do record your commentaries like
this<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.860> recording<00:04:56.460> itself<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:57.030> actually

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
this the recording itself is actually

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.360 
this the recording itself is actually
going<00:04:57.540> to<00:04:57.720> be<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.840> bit<00:04:58.050> longer<00:04:58.350> than<00:04:58.680> usual<00:04:58.710> I

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
going to be a bit longer than usual I

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.220 
going to be a bit longer than usual I
mean<00:04:59.970> it's<00:05:00.090> not<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.330> fastest<00:05:00.900> way<00:05:00.930> of

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
mean it's not the fastest way of

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.960 
mean it's not the fastest way of
recording<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.890> editing<00:05:01.980> your<00:05:02.310> commentary

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
recording and editing your commentary

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.240 
recording and editing your commentary

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
but that's how I like to do it I like to

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.650 
but that's how I like to do it I like to
put<00:05:05.520> a<00:05:05.550> lot<00:05:05.700> of<00:05:05.730> time<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.150> effort<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.630> lot
