00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.910 
on a way that you'll be able to cross by
so<00:02:18.310> you'd<00:02:18.460> be<00:02:18.580> able<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.820> buy<00:02:19.240> Minecraft<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
so you'd be able to buy Minecraft on the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.810 
so you'd be able to buy Minecraft on the
PlayStation<00:02:21.460> 3<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.240> be<00:02:22.930> able<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.460> have<00:02:24.460> what

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
PlayStation 3 and be able to have what

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.610 
PlayStation 3 and be able to have what
the<00:02:24.940> same<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.390> purchase<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.410> would<00:02:26.500> also

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the same as that purchase you would also

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.210 
the same as that purchase you would also
get<00:02:26.800> minecraft<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.490> Playstation<00:02:27.820> 4<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:29.350> well

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
get minecraft on a Playstation 4 as well

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.630 
get minecraft on a Playstation 4 as well
so<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.210> mean<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.600> brings<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:33.010> many<00:02:33.250> collisions

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
so I mean that brings so many collisions

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.610 
so I mean that brings so many collisions
you<00:02:34.270> know<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:34.990> days<00:02:35.140> working<00:02:35.410> on
