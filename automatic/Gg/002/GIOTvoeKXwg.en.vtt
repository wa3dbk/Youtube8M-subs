00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the trees I planted here in the yard so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.819 
the trees I planted here in the yard so
this<00:00:37.559> first<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.629> is<00:00:40.550> an<00:00:41.550> enterprise<00:00:42.829> dwarf

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
this first one is an enterprise dwarf

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.970 
this first one is an enterprise dwarf
apple<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.660> four<00:00:45.960> trees<00:00:46.260> from<00:00:46.559> Starke

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
apple I got four trees from Starke

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.619 
apple I got four trees from Starke
brothers<00:00:47.399> last<00:00:47.670> year<00:00:47.910> they're<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.180> dwarf

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
brothers last year they're all dwarf

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.130 
brothers last year they're all dwarf
trees<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.590> should<00:00:49.829> grow<00:00:50.039> only<00:00:50.219> oh<00:00:51.140> 12

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
trees so they should grow only oh 12

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.860 
trees so they should grow only oh 12
feet<00:00:52.500> high<00:00:52.829> something<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:54.600> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
feet high something like that about that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.650 
feet high something like that about that
wide<00:00:55.730> I'll<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> trim<00:00:57.329> them<00:00:57.480> each<00:00:57.629> year

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
wide I'll have to trim them each year

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.410 
wide I'll have to trim them each year
but<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> should<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.500> able<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> get<00:00:59.100> I'm<00:00:59.940> hoping

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
but I should be able to get I'm hoping

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.080 
but I should be able to get I'm hoping
40<00:01:00.930> 50<00:01:01.379> 60<00:01:01.800> pounds<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.280> fruit<00:01:02.550> off<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> each

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
40 50 60 pounds of fruit off of each

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.170 
40 50 60 pounds of fruit off of each
tree<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.589> first<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> enterprise

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
tree so the first one is a enterprise

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.690 
tree so the first one is a enterprise
apple<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.810> let<00:01:06.930> me<00:01:07.049> clip<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.430> I'll<00:01:08.520> show

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
apple and let me clip over and I'll show

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.310 
apple and let me clip over and I'll show
you<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> other<00:01:09.060> trees<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.570> put<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.930> alright<00:01:10.110> so

you the other trees I put in alright so
here's<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> second<00:01:11.159> tree<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:11.909> oak<00:01:12.090> tree

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
here's the second tree I got an oak tree

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.090 
here's the second tree I got an oak tree
I<00:01:12.360> planted<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.930> several<00:01:13.260> years<00:01:13.530> ago<00:01:13.799> that's

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I planted of several years ago that's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.179 
I planted of several years ago that's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
very end of the yard I actually have
another<00:01:20.369> apple<00:01:21.000> tree<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.600> hoping<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
another apple tree then I'm hoping you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.550 
another apple tree then I'm hoping you
know<00:01:22.140> become<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> nice<00:01:23.930> twelve<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.170> fourteen

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
know become a nice twelve or fourteen

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
doing in this bed I just had ripped out

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.270 
doing in this bed I just had ripped out
everything<00:01:35.610> last<00:01:36.270> November<00:01:36.920> there<00:01:37.920> were<00:01:38.070> some

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
plants and flowers here and I pulled

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.710 
plants and flowers here and I pulled
them<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.140> put<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> tree<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:42.360> one

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
them out to put the tree in and this one

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
them out to put the tree in and this one
is<00:01:43.610> goldrush<00:01:45.079> apple<00:01:46.079> now<00:01:46.770> something<00:01:47.130> you'll

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
is goldrush apple now something you'll

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.030 
is goldrush apple now something you'll
notice<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.110> all<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> fruit<00:01:49.500> trees<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
notice here is all the fruit trees you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.100 
notice here is all the fruit trees you
get<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.420> rootstock

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
get will actually have a rootstock

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.649 
get will actually have a rootstock
and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:52.860> they<00:01:53.040> attach<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.119> graft<00:01:54.390> onto<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
and then they attach a graft onto it and

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.679 
and then they attach a graft onto it and
the<00:01:57.659> root<00:01:57.869> stock<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.409> used<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.670> determine<00:02:00.479> how

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the root stock is used to determine how

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.870 
the root stock is used to determine how
big<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> tree<00:02:01.530> grows<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> roots<00:02:02.610> draw

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
big the tree grows so the roots draw

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.840 
big the tree grows so the roots draw
root<00:02:03.420> stock<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.890> restrict<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.610> size

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
root stock is going to restrict the size

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.270 
root stock is going to restrict the size
of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> tree<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.869> keep<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.099> buy<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
of the tree and keep it when you buy a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.490 
of the tree and keep it when you buy a

trees<00:04:02.810> after<00:04:03.280> two<00:04:04.280> seasons<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.240> in<00:04:05.360> their

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
trees after two seasons it that in their

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.199 
trees after two seasons it that in their
third<00:04:05.780> season<00:04:06.160> they'll<00:04:07.160> start<00:04:07.459> producing<00:04:07.910> a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
moderate crop and by their fourth season

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.070
