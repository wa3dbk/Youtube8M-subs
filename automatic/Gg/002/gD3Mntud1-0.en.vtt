today<00:00:11.759> our<00:00:11.790> goal<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.450> download<00:00:13.370> to<00:00:14.370> an

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
today our goal is to download to an

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.150 
today our goal is to download to an
excel<00:00:15.269> 100<00:00:15.719> controller<00:00:16.139> will<00:00:16.740> first<00:00:16.980> select

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
excel 100 controller will first select

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.480 
excel 100 controller will first select
that<00:00:17.520> controller<00:00:18.470> then<00:00:19.470> we'll<00:00:20.160> need<00:00:20.279> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
that controller then we'll need to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730 
that controller then we'll need to
translate<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.810> file<00:00:22.050> before<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.560> can

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
translate the file before we can

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.160 
translate the file before we can
download<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:24.109> once<00:00:25.109> completed<00:00:26.210> after<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
download it once completed after the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.580 
download it once completed after the
controller<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:29.029> downloaded<00:00:30.289> will<00:00:31.289> flash<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
controller is downloaded will flash the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.280 
controller is downloaded will flash the
controller<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.820> make<00:00:32.969> sure<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.930> put<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
controller to make sure we put the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290 
controller to make sure we put the
software<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> EEPROM<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> controller

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
software in the EEPROM of the controller

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.790 
software in the EEPROM of the controller
that<00:00:36.680> is<00:00:38.329> making<00:00:39.329> sure<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.629> file<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.410> burnt

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that is making sure the file is burnt

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.630 
that is making sure the file is burnt
into<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.309> controller<00:00:41.670> from<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:43.410> we'll<00:00:43.770> check

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
into the controller from now we'll check

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.029 
into the controller from now we'll check
our<00:00:44.940> bus<00:00:45.570> wide<00:00:45.809> access<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.710> our<00:00:46.860> network

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
our bus wide access that is our network

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.470 
our bus wide access that is our network
want<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.730> make<00:00:47.850> sure<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> other

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
want to make sure all the other

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350 
want to make sure all the other
controllers<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.200> still<00:00:49.230> online<00:00:50.360> once

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
controllers are still online once

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
controllers are still online once
completed<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.079> new<00:00:52.230> control<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:53.399> this

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
completed with our new control at this

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.389 
completed with our new control at this
location<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.379> points<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
location we can see the points on the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.200 
location we can see the points on the
Left<00:00:56.930> labels<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.219> are<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.789> far<00:01:00.090> as

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
Left labels and what they are as far as

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
Left labels and what they are as far as
inputs<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> readout

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
inputs and on the right we get a readout

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.060 
inputs and on the right we get a readout
we<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.690> also<00:01:03.809> put<00:01:04.170> multiple<00:01:04.619> points<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
we can also put multiple points in a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.700 
we can also put multiple points in a
watch<00:01:05.309> list<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> selecting<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.560> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
watch list you have to selecting them we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.399 
watch list you have to selecting them we
can<00:01:07.860> select<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> plus<00:01:08.729> sign<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:10.229> get

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
can select the plus sign and we get

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
can select the plus sign and we get
multiple<00:01:10.920> points<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.340> watch<00:01:11.549> lists<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.540> way

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
multiple points now watch lists this way

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.710 
multiple points now watch lists this way
we<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.729> monitor<00:01:14.729> more<00:01:14.939> than<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.270> points<00:01:15.600> at

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
we can monitor more than one points at

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
we can monitor more than one points at
once<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.799> how<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.250> download<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
once so that's how we would download a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.649 
once so that's how we would download a
project<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.380> controller<00:01:20.180> we're<00:01:21.180> using<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
project to a controller we're using the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.859 
project to a controller we're using the
Excel<00:01:22.140> 100<00:01:22.920> controller<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:24.180> demonstrate<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
Excel 100 controller to demonstrate the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.350 
process but the Excel 50 controller
download<00:01:28.170> process<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.430> same<00:01:29.460> after

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
download process is the same after

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:40.039 
download process is the same after
translation<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.890> download<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.400> file

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
