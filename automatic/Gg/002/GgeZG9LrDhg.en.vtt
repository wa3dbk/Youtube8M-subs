worry about that and restart you'll get
a<00:02:19.770> new<00:02:19.980> orb<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.540> took<00:02:21.540> four<00:02:21.810> more<00:02:22.290> orbs<00:02:22.620> you

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
a new orb and took four more orbs you

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.570 
a new orb and took four more orbs you
can<00:02:22.860> again<00:02:23.099> check<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.540> deviant<00:02:25.470> art<00:02:25.620> all

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
can again check the deviant art all

can again check the deviant art all
right<00:02:26.790> having<00:02:27.750> done<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:29.690> look<00:02:30.690> for

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
right having done that you can look for

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.020 
right having done that you can look for
some<00:02:31.650> system<00:02:32.010> files<00:02:32.360> supplied<00:02:33.360> by<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.750> team

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
some system files supplied by the team

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.860 
some system files supplied by the team
craters<00:02:36.170> here<00:02:37.170> I've<00:02:37.290> got<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:38.870> system
