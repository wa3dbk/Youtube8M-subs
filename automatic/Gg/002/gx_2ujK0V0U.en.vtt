metal look in Europe they don't like

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.280 
metal look in Europe they don't like
wood<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:20.770> we're<00:02:20.980> getting<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.310> kind<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.610> European

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290

real<00:02:26.020> pretty<00:02:26.290> car<00:02:26.530> I'm<00:02:26.770> noticing<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.370> it's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
real pretty car I'm noticing that it's

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.970 
real pretty car I'm noticing that it's
wider<00:02:27.850> than<00:02:28.810> its<00:02:28.989> competitor<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.770> there's<00:02:29.950> a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
wider than its competitor so there's a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.290 
wider than its competitor so there's a
lot<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:32.069> elbow<00:02:33.069> room<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.550> lot<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.819> spaciousness

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
lot of elbow room a lot of spaciousness

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.990 
lot of elbow room a lot of spaciousness
even<00:02:35.200> though<00:02:35.319> it's<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.560> sporty<00:02:35.980> midsize<00:02:36.670> car

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000

even though it's a sporty midsize car
now<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.080> terms<00:02:38.319> of<00:02:38.470> driving<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.099> car<00:02:40.620> very

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
now in terms of driving the car very

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.440 
now in terms of driving the car very
