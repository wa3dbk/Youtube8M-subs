I<00:03:29.560> really<00:03:30.010> do<00:03:30.130> take<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.400> as<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> compliment

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
I really do take it as a compliment

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.210 
I really do take it as a compliment
because<00:03:31.060> people<00:03:31.570> buy<00:03:31.720> weave<00:03:32.079> if<00:03:32.940> they<00:03:33.940> want<00:03:34.180> to

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
because people buy weave if they want to

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.640 
because people buy weave if they want to
enhance<00:03:36.220> their<00:03:36.609> hair<00:03:36.820> I<00:03:37.060> guess<00:03:37.359> so<00:03:38.320> if<00:03:38.530> you

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
enhance their hair I guess so if you

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.930 
enhance their hair I guess so if you
think<00:03:38.799> my<00:03:38.950> hair<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.220> already<00:03:39.370> enhance<00:03:39.730> that's

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
think my hair is already enhance that's

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.370 
think my hair is already enhance that's
probably<00:03:40.180> that's<00:03:40.329> pretty<00:03:40.540> cool<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.930> don't<00:03:41.260> get

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
probably that's pretty cool I don't get

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.690 
probably that's pretty cool I don't get
mad<00:03:41.560> at<00:03:41.739> people<00:03:41.769> if<00:03:42.070> they<00:03:42.190> think<00:03:42.220> it's<00:03:42.519> beef

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
mad at people if they think it's beef

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.240 
mad at people if they think it's beef
like<00:03:43.000> hey<00:03:43.410> there's<00:03:44.410> people<00:03:44.620> who<00:03:44.829> wear<00:03:45.010> weave

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
like hey there's people who wear weave

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.370 
like hey there's people who wear weave
and<00:03:45.519> they<00:03:45.609> look<00:03:45.820> good<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.780> if<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.989> think<00:03:47.200> I

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
and they look good so if you think I

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.949

want to know but sometimes maybe they

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.290 
want to know but sometimes maybe they
are<00:03:55.239> mean

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300
