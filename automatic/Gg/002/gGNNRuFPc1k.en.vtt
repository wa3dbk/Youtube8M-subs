solution<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.509> update<00:00:13.139> within<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> viewport<00:00:14.610> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
solution to update within the viewport I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.450 
solution to update within the viewport I
can<00:00:15.630> see<00:00:15.809> here<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.500> your<00:00:17.160> render

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
can see here that you have your render

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.700 
can see here that you have your render
and<00:00:17.730> within<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.420> viewport<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.289> showing<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and within the viewport it's showing the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.870 
and within the viewport it's showing the
first<00:00:19.920> image<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.580> did<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:22.400> similar<00:00:23.400> thing

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
first image I did a similar thing

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.720 
first image I did a similar thing
actually<00:00:24.630> probably<00:00:25.320> right<00:00:25.830> her<00:00:26.010> right<00:00:26.519> around

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
actually probably right her right around

when you posted your your your question

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.479 
when you posted your your your question
I<00:00:32.099> did<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> similar<00:00:33.030> thing<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.480> wanted<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
I did a similar thing I wanted to do a

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.369 
I did a similar thing I wanted to do a
texture<00:00:35.489> base<00:00:35.840> animation<00:00:38.149> where<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.260> go

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
texture base animation where if I go

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.220 
texture base animation where if I go
ahead<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.559> render<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.870> animator

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
ahead and render this out the animator

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.299 
ahead and render this out the animator
can<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.559> ahead<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.829> move<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> slider<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
can go ahead and move a slider here and

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.810 
can go ahead and move a slider here and
change<00:00:47.309> different<00:00:47.700> states<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> animation

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
change different states of the animation

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.279 
change different states of the animation
and<00:00:50.820> also<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> control<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:54.170> go<00:00:55.170> ahead

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and also have a control here go ahead

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.080 
and also have a control here go ahead
and<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.500> my<00:00:55.620> render<00:00:55.890> region<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:56.940> can

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and do my render region so that they can

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.290 
and do my render region so that they can
go<00:00:57.210> ahead<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.390> animate<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> mouth<00:01:00.000> around

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
go ahead and animate the mouth around

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.830 
go ahead and animate the mouth around
the<00:01:00.449> head<00:01:00.680> if<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.920> needed<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> problem

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the head if they needed to the problem

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.859 
the head if they needed to the problem
just<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.589> yours<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.360> wanted<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
just like yours I wanted to see the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.660 
just like yours I wanted to see the
update<00:01:07.200> within<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> viewport<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.460> wasn't

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
update within the viewport and I wasn't

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910 
update within the viewport and I wasn't
able<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.080> definitely<00:01:10.500> quite

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
able to which is definitely quite

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.800

frustrating<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:14.240> when<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> saw<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:15.780> thread

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
frustrating so when I saw your thread

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.359 
frustrating so when I saw your thread
today<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:17.009> let's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
today I was like you know what let's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.240 
today I was like you know what let's
find<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> solution<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.799> what<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> ended<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.189> doing

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
find a solution so what I ended up doing

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
find a solution so what I ended up doing
I<00:01:25.670> ended<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.820> creating<00:01:27.350> let's<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:29.930> let's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
I ended up creating let's see here let's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.760 
I ended up creating let's see here let's
find<00:01:31.200> our<00:01:31.729> property<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.960> ended<00:01:34.710> up

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
find our property just like I ended up

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.859 
find our property just like I ended up
doing<00:01:34.829> everything<00:01:35.189> within<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.090> effects<00:01:36.509> tree

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
doing everything within the effects tree

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.950 
doing everything within the effects tree
and<00:01:38.060> piped<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.329> my<00:01:39.810> tree<00:01:40.310> my<00:01:41.310> solution<00:01:42.180> into

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and piped in my tree my solution into

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
and piped in my tree my solution into
this<00:01:43.200> image<00:01:43.590> clip<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.850> image<00:01:45.240> clip

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
this image clip and then this image clip

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.560 
this image clip and then this image clip
is<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:47.570> piped<00:01:48.570> into<00:01:49.640> into<00:01:50.640> my<00:01:50.880> render<00:01:51.420> tree

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
is then piped into into my render tree

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.230 
is then piped into into my render tree
so<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.740> render<00:01:53.189> tree<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.460> pretty<00:01:53.700> clean<00:01:54.000> I

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
so the render tree is pretty clean I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170 
so the render tree is pretty clean I
have<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.990> complex<00:01:55.439> effects<00:01:55.860> tree<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.430> all

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
have this complex effects tree and all

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.780 
have this complex effects tree and all
this<00:01:57.479> kind<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.140> pipes<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.920> my<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.759> my

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
this kind of just pipes in to my to my

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.149 
this kind of just pipes in to my to my
material<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.200> double<00:02:01.469> click<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:03.649> my<00:02:04.649> my

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
material so if I double click my my my

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.160 
material so if I double click my my my
image<00:02:05.670> clip<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.750> go<00:02:06.869> ahead<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
image clip here and if I go ahead and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.400 
image clip here and if I go ahead and
change<00:02:08.450> let's<00:02:09.450> go<00:02:09.509> ahead<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.690> keep<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
change let's go ahead and keep that and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.509 
change let's go ahead and keep that and
back<00:02:10.619> up

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
back up

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.140 
back up
so<00:02:12.519> if<00:02:12.610> i<00:02:12.670> go<00:02:12.790> ahead<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:12.939> change<00:02:13.299> this<00:02:14.909> guy<00:02:15.909> you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
so if i go ahead and change this guy you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.390 
so if i go ahead and change this guy you
can<00:02:16.269> see<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.689> three<00:02:17.079> nice<00:02:17.439> III<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.159> I<00:02:18.219> go<00:02:18.340> to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
can see it's three nice III if I go to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.929 
can see it's three nice III if I go to
one<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.359> can<00:02:19.480> see<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.750> updates<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:21.489> all

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
one you can see it updates and it's all

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.300 
one you can see it updates and it's all
good<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.310> my<00:02:25.299> solution<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.680> do

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
good so my solution is to just do

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.460 
good so my solution is to just do
everything<00:02:27.430> within<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.359> within<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.170> effects

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
everything within the within the effects

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.179 
everything within the within the effects
tree<00:02:29.709> i<00:02:29.890> will<00:02:30.549> save<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.030> file<00:02:31.239> out<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:33.010> say

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
tree i will save the file out and say

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.369 
tree i will save the file out and say
the<00:02:33.310> project<00:02:33.489> out<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.180> uploaded<00:02:34.659> for<00:02:34.900> anyone

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
the project out and uploaded for anyone
