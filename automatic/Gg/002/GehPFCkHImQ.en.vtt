00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.670
 water in Korea and watched the video by chance 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.519
 somehow got hit video about korea 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.450
 the woman was very interesting 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.050
 korea tourist visa impressions 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.750
 I came with my family and she talked about 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.330
 water that water here is very hard and us 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.580
 on lotion i'm there so very fat 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.580
 body lotions 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:39.390
 I lived in different in different areas of Korea and 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.430
 so now I can say about 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.489
 the fact that water is different everywhere I lived let's say 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.350
 in pulses before this in mass not 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.860
 these sixth year there was water 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.050
 soft enough from the fact that these both 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:07.020
 cities were on the seashore possibly water 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:10.680
 softer well plus not far there yet 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.720
 mountains chirisan figures from where flows all 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.520
 water 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 perhaps this is also connected with it 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.729
 very soft people who live close to 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.130
 by the mountains 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.659
 on someone soft and now i'm moved to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.310
 Gyeonggi District 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.970
 it's around the seoul and here the water is just 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.640
 need very tough i used to i don't 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.659
 I used any body lotions 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.320
 such a mitch need was in courses 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.259
 let's go down a little 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.890
 his village here without it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 just impossible when I bent over 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.210
 I had a feeling in that 603 all 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.080
 it was so tight and the skin on the back 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.100
 just painfully 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.890
 so everywhere differently had to 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.440
 buy lotion and that 's johnson's type 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.800
 baby butter it doesn't help it too 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.150
 soft needed something very fat 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.120
 this is a greasy lotion and what else with water in 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.830
 korea 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.580
 people don't use tap water 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.460
 to drink that is they use in 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.390
 Mostly this dispensers they buy 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:40.080
 dispensers or water purchased before 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.800
 dispensary filters there and boiled 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.709
 water then these are hotter cold therefore 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:53.580
 boil water is not particularly necessary here either 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:03:01.200
 This in cylinders, too, dispensers and cylinders 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:04.880
 bathe in the offices of the mass I do not remember there 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.440
 there was just drinking water separately 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.970
 in the courtyard of the complex were lying entrance 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.360
 there were such taps with drinking water 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.600
 you could just type my 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.150
 sister used to take spring water 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.950
 that is, the city ​​from almost everywhere on 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.220
 Korea there are glaciers and springs there 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.850
 They are very well-proven 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.980
 nevertheless clean or for arriving 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.620
 there to collect water earlier now here 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.370
 she stopped listening to these android children 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:49.519
 as if quite a constant kind of oksana 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.790
 constantly went and drew water those 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.790
 sources and now buys the masses 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.690
 the dancers were springs in the mountain 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.100
 terrain 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:05.420
 and since the city is 70 percent korea there 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.420
 10 sources
