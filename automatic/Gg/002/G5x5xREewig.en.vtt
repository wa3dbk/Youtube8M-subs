no<00:02:26.690> one<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:26.900> see<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.650> my<00:02:27.890> teeth<00:02:28.069> area<00:02:28.569> it's

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
no one can see on my teeth area it's

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.420 
no one can see on my teeth area it's
easier<00:02:30.019> for<00:02:30.080> me<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.500> mean<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.739> guess<00:02:30.980> I'll<00:02:31.190> I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
easier for me I mean I guess I'll I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.090 
easier for me I mean I guess I'll I
might<00:02:31.790> do<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.180> probably<00:02:32.750> not<00:02:33.050> but<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.620> might

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100
