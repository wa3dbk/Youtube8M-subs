here's a brief history of the green
rhino<00:00:02.669> building<00:00:03.149> system<00:00:03.600> like<00:00:04.560> so<00:00:04.710> many<00:00:04.799> other

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
rhino building system like so many other

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.769 
rhino building system like so many other
builders<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.580> started<00:00:05.940> off<00:00:06.060> with<00:00:06.240> wood<00:00:06.480> frame

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
builders I started off with wood frame

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.140 
builders I started off with wood frame
it<00:00:07.500> was<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> simple<00:00:08.069> way<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.189> build<00:00:08.519> most

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
it was a simple way to build most

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.780 
it was a simple way to build most
everyone<00:00:09.630> was<00:00:09.809> doing<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:11.130> seemed<00:00:11.460> like<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
everyone was doing it it seemed like the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.450 
everyone was doing it it seemed like the
best<00:00:11.820> way<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.269> build<00:00:12.570> at<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.870> time<00:00:13.110> but<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.280> knew

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
best way to build at the time but I knew

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.279 
best way to build at the time but I knew
there<00:00:14.610> were<00:00:14.700> other<00:00:14.820> systems<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.480> there<00:00:15.509> when

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
there were other systems out there when

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.779 
there were other systems out there when
my<00:00:16.440> son<00:00:16.680> came<00:00:16.890> along<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.340> thought<00:00:17.520> there's

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
my son came along I thought there's

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.460 
my son came along I thought there's
going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> new<00:00:18.270> generation<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:19.050> builders

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
going to be a new generation of builders

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.939 
going to be a new generation of builders
so<00:00:20.130> let's<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:21.000> started<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.630> started<00:00:22.560> spraying

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
so let's get started I started spraying

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.429 
so let's get started I started spraying
the<00:00:23.130> wall<00:00:23.340> cavities<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.119> urethane<00:00:24.539> foam<00:00:24.810> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the wall cavities with urethane foam to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.259 
the wall cavities with urethane foam to
make<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.740> house<00:00:25.920> much<00:00:26.189> tighter<00:00:26.519> more<00:00:26.880> energy

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
make the house much tighter more energy

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.210 
make the house much tighter more energy
efficient<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> great<00:00:28.740> way<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> go

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
efficient and it was a great way to go

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
efficient and it was a great way to go
it<00:00:29.849> was<00:00:30.060> simple<00:00:30.420> enough<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:30.960> added<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
it was simple enough to do added a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.250 
it was simple enough to do added a
little<00:00:31.679> bit<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.949> cost<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> house<00:00:33.110> but<00:00:34.110> then

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
little bit of cost to the house but then

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.180 
little bit of cost to the house but then
I<00:00:34.350> met<00:00:34.530> Don<00:00:34.800> Don<00:00:35.520> grebe<00:00:36.050> he<00:00:37.050> told<00:00:37.320> me<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:38.070> was

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I met Don Don grebe he told me there was

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
I met Don Don grebe he told me there was
a<00:00:38.219> much<00:00:38.520> better<00:00:38.790> way<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> build<00:00:39.350> Don<00:00:40.350> had<00:00:40.500> done

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
a much better way to build Don had done

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.260 
a much better way to build Don had done
some<00:00:40.860> incredible<00:00:41.340> things<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.940> Mitchell<00:00:42.239> Park

encouraged<00:01:08.250> me<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:08.880> foam<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> start

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
encouraged me to get some foam and start

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.460 
encouraged me to get some foam and start
experimenting<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.740> my<00:01:10.920> own<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:13.049> foam<00:01:13.290> was

experimenting on my own the foam was

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.429 
experimenting on my own the foam was
cheap<00:01:13.770> enough<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:15.420> knowledge<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:16.110> what<00:01:16.290> was

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
cheap enough the knowledge was what was

me about his macro therm houses that he
built<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.100> Milwaukee<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.210> still<00:01:24.509> stand<00:01:24.840> to

buildings I worked on his guest house in
North<00:01:29.610> Scottsdale<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:31.170> fun<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.400> was

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
North Scottsdale and it was fun it was

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.340 
North Scottsdale and it was fun it was
great<00:01:32.790> working<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.210> him<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.659> started

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
great working with him I started

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.819 
great working with him I started
building<00:01:34.829> with<00:01:34.979> sips<00:01:35.750> great<00:01:36.750> system<00:01:37.259> but

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
building with sips great system but

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.609 
building with sips great system but
there<00:01:38.009> was<00:01:38.100> something<00:01:38.490> lacking<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:40.229> plumbers

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
there was something lacking the plumbers

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.700 
there was something lacking the plumbers
the<00:01:40.710> electricians<00:01:41.430> didn't<00:01:42.500> didn't<00:01:43.500> really

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the electricians didn't didn't really

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.109 
the electricians didn't didn't really
enjoy<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.850> more<00:01:44.970> difficult

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
enjoy it it was a little more difficult

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
enjoy it it was a little more difficult
for<00:01:45.570> them<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.750> work<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.070> super<00:01:47.070> insulated

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
for them to work with super insulated

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
for them to work with super insulated
but<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.810> expensive

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
but a little bit expensive

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.179 
but a little bit expensive
Don<00:01:50.430> system<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:51.030> much<00:01:51.210> simpler<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:52.189> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Don system was much simpler just the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
Don system was much simpler just the
styrofoam<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.329> secret<00:01:54.689> sauce<00:01:54.930> no

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
styrofoam and the secret sauce no
