00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
this video will cover the fundamentals

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.210 
this video will cover the fundamentals
of<00:00:35.650> moving<00:00:36.070> objects<00:00:36.670> using<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.330> move<00:00:37.510> tool

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
of moving objects using the move tool

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.189 
of moving objects using the move tool
the<00:00:39.220> move<00:00:39.430> tool<00:00:39.730> is<00:00:40.000> an<00:00:40.269> auto<00:00:40.480> select<00:00:40.960> tool

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
the move tool is an auto select tool

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.920 
the move tool is an auto select tool
this<00:00:42.129> means<00:00:42.460> as<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.790> hover<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.330> cursor<00:00:43.449> over

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
this means as you hover the cursor over

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.320 
this means as you hover the cursor over
edges<00:00:44.470> and<00:00:44.619> surfaces<00:00:45.400> they<00:00:46.000> become

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
edges and surfaces they become

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.469 
edges and surfaces they become
highlighted<00:00:46.720> letting<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:47.799> select<00:00:48.190> them<00:00:48.479> this

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
highlighted letting you select them this

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.990 
highlighted letting you select them this
only<00:00:49.839> works<00:00:50.199> however<00:00:50.470> if<00:00:50.890> nothing<00:00:51.610> else<00:00:51.790> is

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
only works however if nothing else is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.869 
only works however if nothing else is
pre-selected<00:00:53.040> when<00:00:54.040> you<00:00:54.159> select<00:00:54.549> an<00:00:54.729> object

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
pre-selected when you select an object

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.390 
pre-selected when you select an object
it<00:00:55.390> becomes<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:56.140> single<00:00:56.409> focus<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.220> move

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
it becomes a single focus of the move

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.060 
it becomes a single focus of the move

handy<00:01:22.600> but<00:01:23.110> usually<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.680> will<00:01:23.800> pre<00:01:24.100> select

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
handy but usually you will pre select

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.000 
handy but usually you will pre select
the<00:01:24.640> object<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:25.120> need<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.510> move<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:26.800> can

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
the object you need to move you can

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.520 
the object you need to move you can
pre-select<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.760> single<00:01:28.120> entity<00:01:28.480> or<00:01:29.050> many

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
pre-select a single entity or many

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.720 
pre-select a single entity or many
objects<00:01:30.040> together<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:30.790> move<00:01:30.970> them

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.310 

when<00:01:35.730> moving<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.660> need<00:01:36.870> to<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.200> about

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
when moving you need to think about

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.910 
when moving you need to think about
points<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.010> 3d<00:01:38.400> space<00:01:38.660> for<00:01:39.660> example<00:01:40.230> let's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
points in 3d space for example let's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.880 
points in 3d space for example let's
move<00:01:41.130> some<00:01:41.370> furniture<00:01:41.430> around<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.360> room

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
move some furniture around this room

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.460 
move some furniture around this room

space<00:02:00.050> this<00:02:01.050> is<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.260> good<00:02:01.530> way<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> move<00:02:02.010> things

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
space this is a good way to move things

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.940 
space this is a good way to move things
exactly<00:02:02.730> by<00:02:03.630> moving<00:02:03.900> from<00:02:04.260> and<00:02:04.650> two<00:02:05.070> corners

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
exactly by moving from and two corners

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.800 
exactly by moving from and two corners
another<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> move<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.390> use<00:02:09.600> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
another way to move this is to use the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.840 
another way to move this is to use the
inference<00:02:10.320> directions

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
inference directions

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
move it in the green direction until it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.730 
move it in the green direction until it

Sketchup is doing exactly what we've
asked<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:41.000> we<00:02:41.870> started<00:02:42.350> moving<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.770> fridge

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
asked it to we started moving the fridge

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.480 
asked it to we started moving the fridge
by<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.280> point<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:44.060> 3d<00:02:44.480> space<00:02:44.800> then<00:02:45.800> by

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
by this point in 3d space then by

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.910 
by this point in 3d space then by
hovering<00:02:46.730> over<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.330> floor<00:02:47.690> we<00:02:48.290> are<00:02:48.410> moving<00:02:48.680> it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
hovering over the floor we are moving it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.600 
hovering over the floor we are moving it
to<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.190> point<00:02:49.490> in<00:02:49.640> 3d<00:02:50.120> space<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:52.370> will

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
to that point in 3d space this will

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.790 
to that point in 3d space this will
certainly<00:02:52.970> happen<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.960> when<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.560> does

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
certainly happen to you and when it does

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.940 
certainly happen to you and when it does
just<00:02:55.670> hit<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.060> Escape<00:02:56.450> key<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:57.350> will<00:02:57.410> cancel

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
just hit the Escape key this will cancel

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.580 
just hit the Escape key this will cancel
the<00:02:58.250> move<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.300> start<00:02:59.630> over<00:02:59.870> picking

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
the move and you can start over picking

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.830 
the move and you can start over picking
a<00:03:00.680> more<00:03:00.890> meaningful<00:03:01.100> spot<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:02.060> your<00:03:02.300> object<00:03:02.720> to

a more meaningful spot on your object to
move<00:03:03.020> by<00:03:03.760> always<00:03:04.760> remember<00:03:05.330> that<00:03:05.780> you're
