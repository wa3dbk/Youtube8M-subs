design has been many leaks of the device
actually<00:01:03.780> staying<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.769> similar<00:01:05.489> design<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
actually staying like similar design to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.710 
actually staying like similar design to
the<00:01:06.510> s4<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.820> plasticy<00:01:08.820> aluminum<00:01:09.270> type<00:01:09.570> of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the s4 so like plasticy aluminum type of

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.679 
the s4 so like plasticy aluminum type of
design<00:01:10.020> glass<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.670> plastic<00:01:12.030> kind<00:01:12.540> of

design glass from a plastic kind of
aluminum<00:01:13.170> brushed<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
aluminum brushed at the back and the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
aluminum brushed at the back and the
only<00:01:15.299> difference<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.080> might<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
only difference is it might be like a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859 
only difference is it might be like a
curved<00:01:17.580> display<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.689> sure

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
curved display but I'm not really sure

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
curved display but I'm not really sure
about<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> yet<00:01:19.380> there's<00:01:19.860> been<00:01:20.009> rumors<00:01:20.100> about

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
about that yet there's been rumors about

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.920 
about that yet there's been rumors about
it<00:01:20.549> being<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> flexible<00:01:21.479> display<00:01:21.780> or

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it being like a flexible display or

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870 
it being like a flexible display or
curved<00:01:22.170> display<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.890> by<00:01:23.159> flexible<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.700> don't

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
curved display and by flexible I don't

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
curved display and by flexible I don't
mean<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> Davone<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.200> phone<00:01:25.380> doesn't

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
mean like the Davone the phone doesn't

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.310 
mean like the Davone the phone doesn't
bend<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> screen<00:01:26.580> bends<00:01:27.080> but<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
bend like the screen bends but like you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.749 
bend like the screen bends but like you
won't<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.590> able<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.460> harder<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
won't be able to so will be harder to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.510 
won't be able to so will be harder to
crack<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.840> makes<00:01:31.020> sense

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
crack if that makes sense

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.190 
crack if that makes sense
spec<00:01:32.520> wise<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.729> most<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> 64-bit

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
spec wise this most like can be a 64-bit

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.830 
spec wise this most like can be a 64-bit
octa-core<00:01:34.590> CPU<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.700> along<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.540> three

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
octa-core CPU but and along with three

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
octa-core CPU but and along with three
gigabytes<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.290> RAM<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> note<00:01:38.070> 3<00:01:38.369> has

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
gigabytes of RAM like the note 3 has

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.060 
gigabytes of RAM like the note 3 has
right<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.240> once<00:01:39.869> again<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.439> screen<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
right now and once again the screen is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.160 
right now and once again the screen is
probably<00:01:41.909> gonna<00:01:42.119> move<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.750> maybe<00:01:42.930> five

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
probably gonna move up to maybe five

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830 
probably gonna move up to maybe five
point<00:01:43.409> two<00:01:43.470> inches<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.159> might<00:01:44.430> say<00:01:44.640> f5<00:01:45.060> there's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
point two inches or might say f5 there's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.440 
point two inches or might say f5 there's
been<00:01:45.990> rumors<00:01:46.140> from<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.680> 55.1<00:01:47.670> flatpoint<00:01:48.210> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
been rumors from like 55.1 flatpoint to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.050 
been rumors from like 55.1 flatpoint to
some<00:01:49.020> reason<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.350> 5.35<00:01:50.340> before<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> don't

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
some reason like 5.35 before so I don't

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
some reason like 5.35 before so I don't
know<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.360> they'll<00:01:51.570> stay<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.530> around

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
know I think they'll stay and around

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.639 
know I think they'll stay and around
like<00:01:53.040> five<00:01:53.460> inches<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.720> they<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.380> many

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
like five inches because they have many

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.039 
like five inches because they have many
devices<00:01:55.799> already<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.579> there's<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> Galaxy

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
devices already like there's the Galaxy

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.450 
devices already like there's the Galaxy
mega<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> Galaxy<00:01:58.890> Note<00:01:59.040> which<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
mega and the Galaxy Note which are a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.179 
mega and the Galaxy Note which are a
bigger<00:01:59.880> device<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:01.890> it'd<00:02:02.159> be

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
bigger device and I don't think it'd be

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.679 
bigger device and I don't think it'd be
logical<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> release<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.450> bigger

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
logical for them to release a bigger

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.410 
logical for them to release a bigger
device<00:02:03.840> than<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.619> s4<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.369> right<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:06.240> the

device than the s4 is right now also the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.780 
device than the s4 is right now also the
screen

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
be possibly 2k resolution which is very

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.580 
be possibly 2k resolution which is very
very<00:02:10.030> high<00:02:10.270> it'll<00:02:10.630> have<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.930> pixel<00:02:11.170> density<00:02:11.530> of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
very high it'll have a pixel density of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.180 
very high it'll have a pixel density of
over<00:02:11.860> 500<00:02:12.900> 560<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.930> believe<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:15.010> current

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
over 500 560 I believe the current

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.920 
over 500 560 I believe the current
displays<00:02:15.550> 1080p<00:02:16.150> which<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.450> still<00:02:16.660> really

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
displays 1080p which is still really

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.270 
displays 1080p which is still really
really<00:02:17.140> nice<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.500> don't<00:02:17.590> see<00:02:17.740> any<00:02:17.920> pixelation

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
really nice you don't see any pixelation

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.090 
really nice you don't see any pixelation
anyway<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:19.810> they<00:02:20.020> do<00:02:20.080> put<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> 2k<00:02:20.770> display

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
anyway but if they do put a 2k display

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.920 
anyway but if they do put a 2k display
it'll<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.340> like<00:02:21.490> very<00:02:21.670> like<00:02:22.330> sharp<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.780> vivid

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
it'll be like very like sharp and vivid

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.260 
it'll be like very like sharp and vivid
which<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.650> pretty<00:02:24.130> nice<00:02:24.280> device<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.150> also

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
which is pretty nice device is also
