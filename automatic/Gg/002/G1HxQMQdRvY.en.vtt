00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:09.240
 look at it then the new today 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.490
 video tags and this is a book of how me 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.860
 I am madly in love as soon as 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.480
 I saw it because as you will have third of the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.250
 titolo is a video tag 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.100
 I am an examination par excellence 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.630
 i love the disney adori cartoons disney there 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.910
 I grew up there continues to grow 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 etc. I will grow old and therefore I did not know 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.189
 resist and I immediately had to turn 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.290
 This video is one to two years davero 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.530
 years 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.280
 questions the first is a healthy diso and that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.899
 you would like to try then you know 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.090
 I'm a huge fan of peter pan 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.719
 so sincerely what I would like 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.510
 try flying with peter but i think 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.109
 sincerely the human being for 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.059
 his nature has a desire to fly 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.059
 but is that since ke are small that 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.049
 we would certainly like to fly in order to fly 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.210
 with peter pan but there are others too 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.479
 scenes and disney that I wanted to live 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.659
 like for example don't ask me why 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.790
 however expected cats a scene in which the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:29.460
 handsome butler prepares the cream of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.470
 cream I've always done because it's here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.240
 in short, there are various disney scenes 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.009
 he had wanted to try second question then 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.650
 an unforgettable experience he has 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.600
 had true then i d revealing us done 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.990
 been three times two when I was over 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.240
 small at 35 years is a bigger thing 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.030
 at 19 the emotions were the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.280
 same in the sense when I was little 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.740
 inter that everything I saw was 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.780
 real I mean I really need to talk 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.630
 then with photos strikes hunger then 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.460
 although real 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.140
 I was convinced that it was all true 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.950
 naturally then growing to yield 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.780
 I realize that this is not the case 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.430
 and yet when I returned to the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.440
 great I realized however that 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.519
 I was justified in really believing it 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.810
 because disneyland is an enchanted world 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.160
 it has left us the heart 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.750
 those who know me always know it 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.970
 I will definitely go back there anyway 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.769
 things I liked depended on 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.660
 you were definitely the parade and you 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.489
 evening show escapes his name 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.650
 however if you search on youtube show 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.480
 final disneyland paris you find it 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.790
 something fantastic 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.709
 and then it goes well various attractions that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.470
 because anyway nice anyway 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.849
 of the itinerants accurate and placed there for 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:57.470
 really nature will come back 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:59.750
 surely then what song or breeches 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.220
 don't disney make you remember something 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.049
 of the disa of dsa 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.150
 honestly this is a question to which 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.549
 or I can't answer all the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.600
 songs that remind me of himself in 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.920
 I 'm actually from Disney so sorry 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.319
 if I see that I don't like how before 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.489
 I was therefore not sure what 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.250
 answers this question 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.440
 then when was the first time 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.250
 you were disneyland just said it 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.840
 to three years if you could choose one 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 any character say how best 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.940
 friend who you would choose then 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:44.620
 we see then the emperor 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.370
 let's prepare for me made of very avantissimo 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:52.780
 coach I don't remember what it's called good 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:57.010
 as a cosco, however, is also an example 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.150
 filolaete of arcola without acors the like 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.020
 boy who would choose peter pan 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.989
 or hercules and no well as best 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:14.440
 friend to these so that they do so much 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:17.019
 then laughs then favorite capitalisms 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.709
 when I was younger I liked it 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:25.990
 very very much 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:28.540
 still good in beauty and the beast 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.400
 then growing up I discovered the tip 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.140
 however came out later and also in the 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.850
 I really like computers to make them 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.000
 very much her 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.669
 that is me then in louis in the boy 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.930
 it is in her of survival we are 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:48.760
 right then we will pass the ball at the moment 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.260
 of a disney movie that every time not 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.180
 fails to make you cry 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.800
 surely the first fatah death he has 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.660
 my own traumatized 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.430
 childhood and every time I cry 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.310
 quietly but also to say 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:08.740
 when I am a mother I cry or 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:12.930
 let's see when the beast turns into the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.930
 boy emotions men and weep 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.909
 in short, in many cases with kangur with 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:26.669
 then white multicast which was the 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:29.699
 business to have seen I am visiting 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.650
 from cinderella and peter pan however to say 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.400
 also grange as he also says 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.300
 my dad is also my mom of whom 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.749
 she was in love 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.419
 the gazette brings it back to the scene 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:48.150
 told bee in the field was 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:50.669
 really i on the bed so why 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.080
 I really if it still exists 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.009
 wearing those emotions when me 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.529
 I saw Peter Pan as a favorite Disney 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.719
 then in absolute peter pan ner own 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.610
 I say as a child I was also a fan 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.740
 sfegatate still are Cinquini was 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.979
 spent a lot rather than made of 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.120
 the wood of the animals therefore also 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.589
 what has always liked so much 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.309
 so he wanted print accompanied by the 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:16.050
 resistance and we say that then there are 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:19.919
 also other disney films I like 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:25.969
 a lot like for example here we say of the gods 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:28.680

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.990
 these which are forbidden by want more 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.240
