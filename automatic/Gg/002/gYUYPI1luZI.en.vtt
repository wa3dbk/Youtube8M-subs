00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.670 

but<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> said<00:01:21.600> before<00:01:21.870> it<00:01:22.200> does<00:01:22.440> seem<00:01:22.650> like

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
but like I said before it does seem like

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.100 
but like I said before it does seem like
that<00:01:23.010> there's<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.610> bit<00:01:23.900> all<00:01:24.900> mostly

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that there's a little bit all mostly

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
that there's a little bit all mostly
like<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.440> there's<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.800> weight<00:01:26.190> holding

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
like that there's like a weight holding

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700 
like that there's like a weight holding
sonic<00:01:27.119> down<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.960> try<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.470> get

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
sonic down when you like try to get

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.310 
sonic down when you like try to get
going<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.510> bothers<00:01:30.930> me<00:01:31.140> but

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
going and that kind of bothers me but

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.570 
going and that kind of bothers me but
maybe<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.740> something<00:01:32.190> I<00:01:32.280> need<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> be

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
maybe it's just something I need to be

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.240 
maybe it's just something I need to be
