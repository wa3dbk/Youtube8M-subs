calibration artifacts up and look at

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.870 
calibration artifacts up and look at
what<00:00:20.369> benefit<00:00:20.939> they<00:00:21.060> may<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.050> user<00:00:22.880> the

what benefit they may be to the user the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.939 
what benefit they may be to the user the
first<00:00:24.150> thing<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.510> need<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.840> do<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.410> select<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
first thing we need to do is to select a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.730 
first thing we need to do is to select a
probe<00:00:26.250> buildup<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.449> will<00:00:27.599> allow<00:00:27.900> access<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
probe buildup that will allow access to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.380 
probe buildup that will allow access to
each<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> calibration<00:00:29.670> artifacts

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
each of the calibration artifacts

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.250 
each of the calibration artifacts
without<00:00:30.779> crashing<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.360> probe<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.930> here

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
without crashing the probe I have here

to<00:00:40.290> each<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.010> tooling<00:00:41.850> balls<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> next

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to each of these tooling balls the next

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
to each of these tooling balls the next
thing<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:44.940> need<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.690> add<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> hardware

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
thing we need to do is add a hardware

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.760 
thing we need to do is add a hardware
profile<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.640> describes<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:49.079> tooling<00:00:49.559> ball

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
profile that describes this tooling ball

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
profile that describes this tooling ball
so<00:00:50.219> under<00:00:50.730> measure<00:00:51.000> probe<00:00:51.449> we're<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so under measure probe we're going to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.160 
so under measure probe we're going to
select<00:00:52.289> add<00:00:52.739> tool<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:54.449> we're<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
select add tool and we're just going to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
select add tool and we're just going to
build<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.949> profile<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.789> each<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.090> these

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
build up the profile for each of these

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.410 
build up the profile for each of these
calibration<00:00:57.870> tools<00:00:58.969> it's<00:00:59.969> important<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
calibration tools it's important that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.529 
calibration tools it's important that
you<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.079> calibration<00:01:01.890> artifacts<00:01:02.850> vector

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
you get the calibration artifacts vector

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.920 
you get the calibration artifacts vector
correctly<00:01:04.580> inside<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> Edit<00:01:06.150> tool<00:01:06.390> dialog

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
correctly inside of the Edit tool dialog

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.770 
correctly inside of the Edit tool dialog
you'll<00:01:07.619> notice<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.070> green<00:01:08.430> sphere<00:01:08.970> points

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you'll notice this green sphere points

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.520 
you'll notice this green sphere points
in<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.590> z+<00:01:11.220> direction<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.689> I've<00:01:12.990> input<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
in the z+ direction and so I've input a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.789 
in the z+ direction and so I've input a
vector<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.100> 0<00:01:14.460> 0<00:01:14.549> &amp;<00:01:15.240> 1<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.229> down<00:01:16.470> here

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
vector of 0 0 &amp; 1 and then down here

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.749 
vector of 0 0 &amp; 1 and then down here
I've<00:01:16.979> added<00:01:17.220> its<00:01:17.520> size<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:20.250> next<00:01:20.520> thing<00:01:20.670> we

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
I've added its size the next thing we

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.120 
I've added its size the next thing we
want<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.479> add<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.200> second<00:01:22.650> tool<00:01:22.830> which

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
want to do is add the second tool which

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.789 
want to do is add the second tool which
is<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.520> orange<00:01:23.850> artifact<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.409> I've<00:01:25.560> selected

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
is this orange artifact so I've selected

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.580 
is this orange artifact so I've selected
the<00:01:26.220> add<00:01:26.369> tool<00:01:26.729> icon<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.540> add<00:01:27.659> tool<00:01:27.990> dialog

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the add tool icon the add tool dialog

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.060 
the add tool icon the add tool dialog
appears<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.960> again<00:01:30.960> I've<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> vector

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
appears and again I've got the vector

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.060 
appears and again I've got the vector
the<00:01:33.030> same<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.229> inside<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> my

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the same as what I see inside of my

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.749 
the same as what I see inside of my
graphics<00:01:35.759> window<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.829> Schank<00:01:37.829> vector<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.520> X

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
graphics window here Schank vector for X

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.920 
graphics window here Schank vector for X
is<00:01:39.000> minus<00:01:39.479> 1<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:41.240> shank<00:01:42.240> points<00:01:42.750> in

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
is minus 1 because this shank points in

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.920 
is minus 1 because this shank points in
the<00:01:43.049> minus<00:01:43.439> X<00:01:43.680> direction<00:01:44.420> we<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.570> our<00:01:45.689> size

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the minus X direction we got our size

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
the minus X direction we got our size
down<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:46.979> click<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.399> OK<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.420> save<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
down here we can click on OK to save it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.000 
down here we can click on OK to save it
and<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.510> what<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.810> need<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.050> do<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.770> need<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
and now what we need to do is we need to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.460 
and now what we need to do is we need to
locate<00:01:53.670> both<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.210> these<00:01:54.300> measuring<00:01:54.780> artifacts

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
locate both of these measuring artifacts

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
locate both of these measuring artifacts
inside<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.400> machines<00:01:56.760> measuring<00:01:57.360> volume<00:01:57.510> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
inside the machines measuring volume and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
inside the machines measuring volume and
that's<00:01:58.650> simply<00:01:59.220> done<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.910> by<00:02:00.060> measuring

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that's simply done just by measuring

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.920 
that's simply done just by measuring
them<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.110> tip<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.710> 0<00:02:02.340> B<00:02:02.670> 0<00:02:02.700> using<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.660> probe

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
them with tip a 0 B 0 using the probe

configuration<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.980> called<00:02:05.370> up<00:02:05.580> I'm<00:02:06.060> going

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
configuration that I called up I'm going

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
configuration that I called up I'm going
to<00:02:06.660> start<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> green<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.520> green

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to start with the green one the green

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.750 
to start with the green one the green
sphere<00:02:09.360> first<00:02:09.930> so<00:02:10.350> we'll<00:02:10.470> select<00:02:10.740> that<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
sphere first so we'll select that and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.910 
sphere first so we'll select that and
we'll<00:02:12.030> select<00:02:12.210> measure<00:02:15.080> now<00:02:16.080> at<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.380> dialog

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.110 
prior tool position and we've just done
that<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.620> dialog<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.610> creates

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
that so this is the dialog that creates

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.270 
that so this is the dialog that creates
that<00:03:39.450> relationship<00:03:40.110> or<00:03:40.350> at<00:03:40.410> least<00:03:40.590> affirms

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
that relationship or at least affirms

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.370 
that relationship or at least affirms
the<00:03:41.640> creation<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.510> relationship<00:03:43.170> between

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
the creation of the relationship between

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.170 
the creation of the relationship between
the<00:03:44.250> green<00:03:44.550> sphere<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.510> orange<00:03:45.959> sphere

the green sphere and the orange sphere

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.700 
the green sphere and the orange sphere
we'll<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.360> select<00:03:48.510> ok<00:03:49.080> here

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.990 

so<00:03:52.710> that<00:03:52.860> we've<00:03:52.980> now<00:03:53.190> established<00:03:53.370> the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
so that we've now established the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.120 
so that we've now established the
relationship<00:03:54.660> between<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.410> orange<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:55.980> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
relationship between the orange and the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.970 
relationship between the orange and the
green<00:03:56.160> spheres<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.300> we<00:03:57.990> can<00:03:58.170> now<00:03:58.319> use<00:03:58.350> this

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
green spheres and we can now use this

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.010 
green spheres and we can now use this
relationship<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.819> our<00:04:00.150> advantage<00:04:00.750> to

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
relationship to our advantage to

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.000 
relationship to our advantage to
calibrate<00:04:01.980> odd<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.390> unusual<00:04:03.510> probe<00:04:04.470> buildups

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
calibrate odd and unusual probe buildups

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.480 
calibrate odd and unusual probe buildups
and<00:04:05.580> we're<00:04:05.730> going<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:05.910> do<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.209> next
