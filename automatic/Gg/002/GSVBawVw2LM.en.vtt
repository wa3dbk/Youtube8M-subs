00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.630 
and they're hoping that this car is
gonna<00:02:56.350> turn<00:02:56.830> them<00:02:57.040> around

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
gonna turn them around

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.180

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
don't really think so I mean it's a good

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.620 
don't really think so I mean it's a good
car<00:03:02.290> but<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.280> competition's<00:03:03.970> too<00:03:04.150> stiff<00:03:04.450> and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
the price points too high and frankly

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.160 
the price points too high and frankly
the<00:03:07.900> force<00:03:08.739> nice<00:03:09.010> as<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.370> car<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.690> doesn't

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170

like<00:03:33.150> how<00:03:33.450> he<00:03:33.510> did<00:03:34.040> with<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.130> TT<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:36.270> could

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
like how he did with the TT it could

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.950 
like how he did with the TT it could
possibly<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:37.740> turned<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.070> brand<00:03:38.310> around

possibly have turned the brand around
earlier<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.970> now<00:03:41.970> force<00:03:42.330> them<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.540> be<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.870> the

feel like something very adequate for

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.260 
feel like something very adequate for
the<00:04:18.329> present<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:21.140> you<00:04:22.140> know<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:23.700> do<00:04:23.850> its<00:04:24.030> job

quite<00:04:24.570> well<00:04:25.070> but<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.460> don't<00:04:26.760> know<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:26.970> guess<00:04:27.300> I

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
quite well but I don't know I guess I

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.909 
quite well but I don't know I guess I
just<00:04:27.510> think<00:04:27.870> that<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.110> market<00:04:28.440> needs<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.740> lot

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
just think that the market needs a lot

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.980 
just think that the market needs a lot
more<00:04:29.130> than<00:04:29.250> that<00:04:29.340> today<00:04:29.550> especially<00:04:30.510> for

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
more than that today especially for

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.700 
more than that today especially for

going to be here for the long run and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.250 
going to be here for the long run and
certainly<00:04:38.310> long<00:04:38.580> enough<00:04:38.990> while<00:04:39.990> you're<00:04:40.169> on

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
certainly long enough while you're on

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.050 
certainly long enough while you're on
your<00:04:40.470> car<00:04:42.380> but<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.460> know<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.610> know<00:04:44.729> that
