 hello and welcome to this first 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.410
 episode of pushing a new concept of 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.210
 video report that will follow me all at 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.480
 long achievements in France to 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.480
 overseas 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.500
 we are now in the middle of the country 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 Basque in the city of Saint Pee on 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.879
 level for the motorcycle club bastia éric 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.020
 fortin debt with me today for 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.790
 tell us about his bike club 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.170
 oh yes it's a motorcycle club was created in 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:56.580
 2010 under the impulse of light that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.690
 wanted to give this ground an activity 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.720
 unauthorized actually 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.699
 and so after three years of fighting 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.830
 because it starts in 2007 in fact and 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.000
 after three years of fighting with the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.810
 different administrations as 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.460
 everyone is calm 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.140
 well we managed to sign a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.040
 2010 Convention and to have it homologated 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.479
 in 2011 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.690
 so that's about four years 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.210
 that we are in place and with 76 members at 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.430
 right now at the club we have 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 kept two members and barely 200 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.539
 budget euros so here it was a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.369
 great success so far so 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.100
 we are quite happy how did you come 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 the idea of ​​resuming your circuit to do 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.470
 call to my services 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.789
 there is a lack of the club launched the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.770
 project she holds would not prove 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.930
 call someone a professional who 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.959
 could we back the track and so 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.039
 it's a name that came out and so everything 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.890
 the world played the game we looked for a 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.869
 machinery budget 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.940
 and then and then we have launched the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.140
 project it's done now 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.330
 can you tell us a word about 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.560
 new rules rts I think that's 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.649
 can be a little bit motivated too 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.470
 worth your desire to see a little bit again 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.740
 copy it to fit all that with the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.170
 new standards that the ffm does not 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 inflicts then quite a few 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.229
 accidents that took in motocross 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.770
 actually finally he had to do 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.440
 Something 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.880
 and since we knew a few 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.590
 technical safety rules but good 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.300
 not everything and I know you 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.040
 know and have a get tested 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.790
 good distances for the public and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.860
 and so on 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.440
 so well here we called on you 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.510
 it was really that relieves us in 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.950
 all the work upstream to do so I 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.900
 am really good what you need 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.970
 point out that following all the accidents 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.610
 who has had in recent years 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.500
 olivier robert the french federation 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.260
 motorcycle is responsible for making a 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.780
 Tour de France tracks and put back 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.520
 in a way to Norman people with 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.160
 dimensions more consistent with the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.990
 engined 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.490
 one day all the tracks that 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.970
 unfortunately we are no longer 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.260
 standards 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.000
 you can tell us about my 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.740
 work if you are satisfied how the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.990
 on his past yeah so we're 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.000
 satisfied because finally we 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.390
 removes a lot of worries about 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.770
 the search for diesel fuel machines 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.270
 time spent on a circuit because we 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.730
 are all volunteers and we all have a 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.900
 work alongside a family life and the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.780
 hall advantage is that we confirm 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.640
 work to someone on ten two days 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.810
 and here we take care of anything which the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.450
 know it's something clear or 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.450
 shit and finally we make money 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.970
 finally because everything is not done 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.320
 worry is not to worry about 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.770
 a machine that break and also 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.770
 after 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.210
 really it relieves the presidents the 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.920
 club people all the volunteers 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.420
