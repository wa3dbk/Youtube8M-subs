the<00:00:14.009> model<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:15.299> all<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.780> Redstone<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the model with all the Redstone and

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.720 
the model with all the Redstone and
there's<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.060> model<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:19.920> house

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.290 

and<00:00:26.750> three<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.080> space<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.090> build

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
and three is the space for you to build

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.530 
and three is the space for you to build
so<00:00:31.289> let's<00:00:31.619> start<00:00:33.410> each<00:00:34.410> kit<00:00:35.160> has<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> exact

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
so let's start each kit has the exact

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.560 
so let's start each kit has the exact
number<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.110> blocks<00:00:37.710> needed<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.210> model

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
number of blocks needed for this model

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.369 
number of blocks needed for this model
I'm<00:00:40.190> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.340> release<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:42.030> my<00:00:42.480> build<00:00:43.079> in

creative we put the note talks about the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.920 
creative we put the note talks about the
halls

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
halls

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.780

you

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.560 

you

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:16.120 

you

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:26.120 

I<00:01:16.750> put<00:01:17.750> war<00:01:18.259> in<00:01:18.590> front<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.310> each<00:01:19.549> of<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.179 

now<00:01:27.130> redstone<00:01:27.850> on<00:01:28.090> top<00:01:28.150> of<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.780> wall

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.069 

not<00:01:33.149> blocks<00:01:33.840> don't<00:01:34.619> work<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.250> there's<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:36.079> block

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
not blocks don't work if there's a block

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.560 
not blocks don't work if there's a block
over<00:01:37.350> them

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:51.500 

here<00:01:43.160> shouldn't<00:01:44.160> touch<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.630> redstone<00:01:50.510> so

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
here shouldn't touch the redstone so

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.850 
here shouldn't touch the redstone so
here<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.170> use<00:01:52.730> half<00:01:53.730> slabs<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:55.620> aim

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
here we use half slabs you have to aim

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:17.759 
here we use half slabs you have to aim
at<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.640> top

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:26.500 

the<00:02:18.769> pressure<00:02:19.159> plates<00:02:20.109> and<00:02:21.250> tests<00:02:25.450> now<00:02:26.450> to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
the pressure plates and tests now to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:52.650 
the pressure plates and tests now to
build<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.109> piano<00:02:35.019> keyboard

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.480 

you

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:12.390 

the<00:02:59.490> legs

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.729 

and<00:03:13.780> there<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.110> working<00:03:16.989> by<00:03:17.989> from<00:03:18.590> the

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
and there it is working by from the

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.610 
and there it is working by from the
