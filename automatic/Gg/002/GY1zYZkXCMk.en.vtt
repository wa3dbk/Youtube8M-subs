this those been on this month i seem
like<00:01:56.659> some<00:01:56.899> sort<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.170> graduation<00:01:57.979> as<00:01:58.430> well<00:01:58.759> as

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
like some sort of graduation as well as

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.880 
like some sort of graduation as well as
our<00:01:58.969> promotion<00:01:59.570> for<00:02:00.079> mistake<00:02:00.619> in<00:02:00.770> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
our promotion for mistake in the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.270 
our promotion for mistake in the
football<00:02:01.579> analogy<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:02.659> um<00:02:02.810> i<00:02:03.140> suppose<00:02:04.100> this

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
football analogy but um i suppose this

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.010 
football analogy but um i suppose this
feels<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.729> little<00:02:04.850> bit<00:02:05.060> like<00:02:05.119> that<00:02:05.329> too<00:02:05.570> or

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
feels a little bit like that too or

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.060 
feels a little bit like that too or
maybe<00:02:06.320> this<00:02:06.649> is<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:08.210> triangulation<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.620> the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
maybe this is the triangulation of the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.610 
maybe this is the triangulation of the
milestones<00:02:10.730> of<00:02:10.940> 2013<00:02:11.600> with<00:02:11.870> Glastonbury
