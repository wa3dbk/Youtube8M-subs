already<00:01:47.500> done<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:48.280> don't<00:01:48.430> need<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.640> do<00:01:48.759> a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
already done you don't need to do a

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.940 
already done you don't need to do a
posture<00:01:49.240> analysis<00:01:49.689> you<00:01:50.259> can<00:01:50.409> do<00:01:50.560> just<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
posture analysis you can do just the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.039 
posture analysis you can do just the
lean<00:01:51.189> screen<00:01:51.490> analysis<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.299> soon<00:01:52.750> you'll<00:01:52.930> be

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
lean screen analysis and soon you'll be

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.389 
lean screen analysis and soon you'll be
able<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.380> lean<00:01:53.590> screen<00:01:53.890> as<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.040> standalone

here<00:01:57.250> we<00:01:57.460> actually<00:01:57.610> have<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.329> front<00:01:58.810> inside

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
here we actually have a front inside

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.590 
here we actually have a front inside
view<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.710> his<00:01:59.860> posture<00:02:00.340> ok<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.090> of<00:02:01.149> course<00:02:01.420> we
