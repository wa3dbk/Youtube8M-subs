00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
you cannot find them then I show you how

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.229 
you cannot find them then I show you how
to<00:00:34.890> direct<00:00:35.280> connect<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.760> go<00:00:35.880> back<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.090> your

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
to direct connect then go back to your

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
to direct connect then go back to your
history<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.840> then<00:00:36.989> add<00:00:37.140> them<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> favorites

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
history and then add them to favorites

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.680 
history and then add them to favorites
so<00:00:37.920> basically<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.850> could<00:00:39.000> add<00:00:39.149> servers

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so basically here you could add servers

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.819 
so basically here you could add servers
to<00:00:39.809> favorites<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> your

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
find it there and join now obviously I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.310 
find it there and join now obviously I
have<00:00:56.879> all<00:00:57.030> these<00:00:57.210> servers<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.719> favorites<00:00:58.140> old

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
have all these servers as favorites old

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.130 
have all these servers as favorites old
rgn<00:00:58.739> servers<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> a<00:01:00.000> couple<00:01:00.210> MX<00:01:00.510> li<00:01:00.780> servers

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
rgn servers and a couple MX li servers

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
rgn servers and a couple MX li servers
but<00:01:01.289> anyways<00:01:01.559> these<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.059> basically

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
but anyways these are this is basically

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
but anyways these are this is basically
it<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.750> could<00:01:03.899> join<00:01:04.019> from<00:01:04.290> your<00:01:04.409> favorites

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it you could join from your favorites

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.560 
it you could join from your favorites
and<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.010> much<00:01:05.159> easier<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and it's much easier so even if you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.880 
and it's much easier so even if you
don't<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> server<00:01:07.170> list<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.740> something

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
don't see a server list or something

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530 
don't see a server list or something
like<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> or<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.670> really<00:01:08.909> fucked<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.299> if

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
like that or it's really fucked up if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090 
like that or it's really fucked up if
you<00:01:09.900> could<00:01:10.049> still<00:01:10.260> direct<00:01:10.530> connect<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.950> see

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you could still direct connect and see

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.469 
you could still direct connect and see
servers<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.729> history<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.270> could

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
servers in your history then you could

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.090 
servers in your history then you could
be<00:01:12.630> able<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.930> favor<00:01:13.200> them<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.799> I'll<00:01:13.860> show<00:01:14.010> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
be able to favor them so I'll show you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890 
be able to favor them so I'll show you
how<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.670> right<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.659> I'll

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
how to do this right now and then I'll

right back guys hey guys so basically

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.230 
right back guys hey guys so basically
this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.280> how<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> direct<00:01:26.790> connect<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
this is how you direct connect to the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.550 
this is how you direct connect to the
server<00:01:27.450> after<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.930> double-click<00:01:28.320> your

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
server after you double-click your

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.069 
server after you double-click your
technology<00:01:28.860> 3<00:01:29.490> launcher<00:01:29.939> you'll<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.930> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
technology 3 launcher you'll see this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
technology 3 launcher you'll see this
little<00:01:31.320> launcher<00:01:31.829> over<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:32.579> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
little launcher over here so then you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.060 
little launcher over here so then you
want<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> click<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.299> multiplayer<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.320> then

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
want to click on a multiplayer and then

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.370 
want to click on a multiplayer and then
you<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> click<00:01:35.610> over<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you want to click over here and then you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
you want to click over here and then you
put<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> IP<00:01:37.890> address<00:01:38.250> over<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.790> then

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
put the IP address over here and then

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.230 
put the IP address over here and then
you<00:01:38.909> put<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> port<00:01:39.509> number<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.020> 2<00:01:40.860> 7<00:01:41.340> 0<00:01:41.520> 1<00:01:41.640> 6<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you put the port number so 2 7 0 1 6 I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
you put the port number so 2 7 0 1 6 I
think<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> ports<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
think is one of the ports for one of the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.190 
think is one of the ports for one of the
servers<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> hit<00:01:45.600> settings<00:01:45.990> over

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
servers and then you hit settings over

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.539 
servers and then you hit settings over
here<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.470> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> change<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.070> fov<00:01:47.310> in

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
here if you want to change your fov in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.850 
here if you want to change your fov in
your<00:01:47.729> username<00:01:48.200> if<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.350> guys<00:01:49.439> did<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.619> know

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
your username if you guys did not know

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.889 
your username if you guys did not know
that<00:01:50.009> already<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.310> anyways<00:01:50.970> yeah<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.780> hit

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that already but anyways yeah just hit

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.450 
that already but anyways yeah just hit
save<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> click<00:01:53.100> start

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
save and then you want to click start

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.889 
save and then you want to click start
that<00:01:53.670> rec<00:01:53.820> connect<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.479> how<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.869> I

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that rec connect this is how you do I

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.990 
that rec connect this is how you do I
reckon<00:01:55.290> ACTU<00:01:55.500> server<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.280> put<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> IPS<00:01:56.850> here

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
reckon ACTU server you put the IPS here

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.530 
reckon ACTU server you put the IPS here
then<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> hit<00:01:57.390> start<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> rec<00:01:58.020> connect<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
then you hit start the rec connect and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.760 
then you hit start the rec connect and
let's<00:02:00.540> see<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.869> fraps<00:02:01.170> open<00:02:01.469> yes<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.710> do

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
let's see if I have fraps open yes I do

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
let's see if I have fraps open yes I do
have<00:02:01.950> perhaps<00:02:02.219> open<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.909> after<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.240> have

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
have perhaps open so after I have

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.319 
have perhaps open so after I have
perhaps<00:02:03.600> open<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.170> guys<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.560> able<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
perhaps open you guys will be able to

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.760 
perhaps open you guys will be able to
not<00:02:06.329> fraps<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> X<00:02:06.869> or<00:02:07.020> you'll<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.350> able<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.680> see

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
not fraps the X or you'll be able to see

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.979 
not fraps the X or you'll be able to see
what<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.099> want<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> actually<00:02:09.060> run<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
what I do want to actually run so the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.330 
what I do want to actually run so the
game<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> start<00:02:10.860> running<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
game it's going to start running and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.340 
game it's going to start running and
then<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.090> want<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> click

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
then you want to click

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.380 
then you want to click
you<00:02:13.800> want<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> click<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.250> f12<00:02:14.790> button<00:02:15.060> after

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
you want to click the f12 button after

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.850 
you want to click the f12 button after
you<00:02:15.630> wait<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> couple<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.170> seconds<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.650> 10

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
you wait a couple of seconds like 10

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.640 
you wait a couple of seconds like 10
seconds<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:18.240> hit<00:02:18.420> f12<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:19.470> it'll

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
seconds you hit f12 and then it'll

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.080 
seconds you hit f12 and then it'll
automatically<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.400> reckon<00:02:20.700> ektu<00:02:20.940> that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
automatically that reckon ektu that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.210 
automatically that reckon ektu that
server<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.080> as<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.800> connecting

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
server so as you can see it's connecting

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.430 
server so as you can see it's connecting
but<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.970> think<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.300> put<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.660> wrong<00:02:24.840> port<00:02:25.290> or

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
but I think I put in the wrong port or

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.530 
but I think I put in the wrong port or
whatever<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.280> server<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.000> hold<00:02:27.300> on<00:02:27.420> let

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
whatever for the server so hold on let

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.280 
whatever for the server so hold on let
me<00:02:27.600> go<00:02:27.750> back

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
me go back

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.290 
me go back
let<00:02:29.040> me<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.250> exit<00:02:29.550> out<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.700> techno<00:02:30.090> guides

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
let me just exit out of techno guides

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.820 
let me just exit out of techno guides
but<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.870> pretty<00:02:31.140> much<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> same<00:02:31.410> procedure

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
but it's pretty much the same procedure

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
but it's pretty much the same procedure
for<00:02:31.950> any<00:02:32.250> server<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.670> want<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.910> join<00:02:33.120> that's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
for any server you want to join that's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600 
for any server you want to join that's
how<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.840> connect<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.830> think<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.370> pour<00:02:35.580> is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
how you connect so I think the pour is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.120 
how you connect so I think the pour is
17<00:02:36.120> maybe<00:02:36.360> hold<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.020> start<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.650> reckon<00:02:37.950> act

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
17 maybe hold on start that reckon act

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.090 
17 maybe hold on start that reckon act
again<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.330> then<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.440> just<00:02:40.470> wait<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
again and then you just wait for it to

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.860 
again and then you just wait for it to
load<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.610> then<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.180> see<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.450> thing<00:02:42.660> right

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
load and then you see this thing right

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.720 
load and then you see this thing right
here<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.890> wait<00:02:44.100> again<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.700> then<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.630> hit<00:02:45.750> f12

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
here you wait again and then you hit f12

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.660 
here you wait again and then you hit f12
and<00:02:47.730> then<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.120> should<00:02:48.240> start<00:02:48.480> connecting

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
and then it should start connecting

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.580 
and then it should start connecting
immediately<00:02:50.670> well<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:51.840> pretty<00:02:52.020> much<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
immediately well it's pretty much the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.100 
immediately well it's pretty much the
same<00:02:52.770> method<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.940> does<00:02:54.240> what<00:02:54.750> will<00:02:54.960> have

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
same method and it does what will have

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.020 
same method and it does what will have
the<00:02:55.200> correct<00:02:55.470> server<00:02:55.650> IPS<00:02:56.070> on<00:02:56.280> our<00:02:56.430> website<00:02:56.850> at

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the correct server IPS on our website at

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.730 
the correct server IPS on our website at
Roggeveen<00:02:57.360> nation<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.140> you'll<00:02:58.320> be<00:02:58.470> able<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
Roggeveen nation and you'll be able to

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.710 
Roggeveen nation and you'll be able to
see<00:02:58.830> all<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.070> super<00:02:59.250> IPS<00:02:59.430> over<00:02:59.790> there<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.540> it

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
see all the super IPS over there so it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.330 
see all the super IPS over there so it
could<00:03:00.840> connect<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> host<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:02.010> same<00:03:02.190> one

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
could connect to the host the same one

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.800 
could connect to the host the same one
or<00:03:02.550> let's<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.330> server<00:03:03.600> right<00:03:03.750> here

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
or let's just do a server right here

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.400 
or let's just do a server right here
server<00:03:04.200> info<00:03:04.730> oh<00:03:05.730> no<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.930> actually<00:03:07.110> say

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
server info oh no you can actually say

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.160 
server info oh no you can actually say
here<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:09.540> see<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.780> patch<00:03:09.960> it's

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
here but you can see the patch it's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.050 
here but you can see the patch it's
running<00:03:10.440> one<00:03:10.560> point<00:03:10.800> for<00:03:11.010> patch<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.910> how

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
running one point for patch that's how

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.060 
running one point for patch that's how
you<00:03:12.120> connect<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> these<00:03:12.600> servers<00:03:12.960> but<00:03:13.770> anyways

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
you connect to these servers but anyways

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.540 
you connect to these servers but anyways
I'm<00:03:14.880> gonna<00:03:15.060> disconnect<00:03:15.470> from<00:03:16.470> technology<00:03:16.560> so

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
I'm gonna disconnect from technology so

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.790 
I'm gonna disconnect from technology so
yeah<00:03:18.360> like<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.630> was<00:03:18.690> saying<00:03:18.750> before<00:03:18.960> that's<00:03:19.590> how

the exact port number for one of the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.920 
the exact port number for one of the
servers<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.730> did<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.910> would<00:03:36.120> probably<00:03:36.300> do<00:03:36.780> it

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
servers if I did I would probably do it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.720

but<00:03:37.200> we<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.680> made<00:03:37.830> these<00:03:37.980> servers<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.490> I'll

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
but we just made these servers so I'll

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.130 
but we just made these servers so I'll

on a separate game folder that's my

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
number one tip because it is running the

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
running the 1.9 patch so it's different
