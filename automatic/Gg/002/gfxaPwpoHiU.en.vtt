golf mark - electric window regulator I
one<00:00:09.630> do<00:00:09.809> done<00:00:10.320> these<00:00:10.530> five<00:00:12.230> t20<00:00:13.849> bolts<00:00:14.849> here

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
one do done these five t20 bolts here

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.550 
one do done these five t20 bolts here
about<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.929> take<00:00:16.110> off

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
about to take off

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
I believe you pull the green kind of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.169 
I believe you pull the green kind of
plastic<00:00:24.599> bit<00:00:24.750> back<00:00:24.929> there<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:26.130> top<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.029> come

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
plastic bit back there the top to come

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.300 
plastic bit back there the top to come
off<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:29.279> that's<00:00:29.550> inside<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.750> see

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
off and that's inside if you can see

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.920 
off and that's inside if you can see
that's<00:00:32.310> inside<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> actual<00:00:33.000> window

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that's inside the actual window

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
that's inside the actual window
regulator<00:00:36.830> reason<00:00:37.830> why<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.010> doing<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
regulator reason why I'm doing this is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
regulator reason why I'm doing this is
because<00:00:39.020> when<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.850> why<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:42.090> window<00:00:42.360> down<00:00:42.540> it's

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
because when I why my window down it's

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
because when I why my window down it's
absolutely<00:00:43.860> fine<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.880> when<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.060> wind<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.510> back

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
absolutely fine but when I wind it back

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
absolutely fine but when I wind it back
up<00:00:45.920> there's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> horrible<00:00:47.310> kind<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:49.670> squeaky

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
up there's a horrible kind of squeaky

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.050 
up there's a horrible kind of squeaky
noise<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.320> hoping<00:00:52.560> to<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:53.060> lubricate

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
noise so I'm hoping to just lubricate

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.870 
noise so I'm hoping to just lubricate
all<00:00:54.240> of<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.570> insides<00:00:54.900> of<00:00:55.080> here<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:56.610> hopefully

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
all of the insides of here and hopefully

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.640 
all of the insides of here and hopefully
that<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.270> fix<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.550> yeah<00:00:59.760> there<00:01:00.150> goes<00:01:00.650> I've

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
that will fix it so yeah there goes I've

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.189 
that will fix it so yeah there goes I've
just<00:01:01.860> lubricated<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.810> regulator

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
just lubricated the in a regulator

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.410 
just lubricated the in a regulator
pulley<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.430> cable<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.030> I'm<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.240> about

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pulley and the cable so I'm just about

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
pulley and the cable so I'm just about
to<00:01:06.479> build<00:01:07.259> it<00:01:07.409> back<00:01:07.500> together<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> push

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to build it back together so if you push

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:31.209 
to build it back together so if you push
these<00:01:09.450> under<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> green<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> guides<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:16.560> 20

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
just about to lubricate inside here just

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:04.419 
just about to lubricate inside here just
see<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.810> helps<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.759> squeaky<00:01:59.759> noise
