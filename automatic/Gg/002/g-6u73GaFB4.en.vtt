00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
and I was not really aiming to use a lot

and I was not really aiming to use a lot
of<00:04:22.200> spells<00:04:22.710> on<00:04:23.010> one<00:04:23.250> person<00:04:23.849> and<00:04:24.030> then<00:04:24.390> getting

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
of spells on one person and then getting

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.890 
of spells on one person and then getting
nothing<00:04:25.320> like<00:04:26.310> those<00:04:26.490> free-to-play<00:04:27.090> guys

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
nothing like those free-to-play guys

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.350 
nothing like those free-to-play guys
so<00:04:28.350> many<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.830> them<00:04:28.979> logging<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.669> like<00:04:30.030> every

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
so many of them logging in like every

five to ten minutes

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.920 
five to ten minutes
someone<00:04:32.400> from<00:04:32.610> free-to-play<00:04:33.240> will<00:04:33.419> log<00:04:33.660> in

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
with full Arun which looks nice but I

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.499 
with full Arun which looks nice but I
killed<00:04:36.810> maybe<00:04:37.289> ten<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.740> them<00:04:38.150> plenty<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.330> them

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
killed maybe ten of them plenty of them

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.150 
killed maybe ten of them plenty of them
logged<00:04:39.750> in<00:04:39.930> by<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.169> way<00:04:40.350> but<00:04:40.560> eventually<00:04:40.860> I

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
logged in by the way but eventually I

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.980 
logged in by the way but eventually I
stopped<00:04:41.669> killing<00:04:41.910> them<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.330> every<00:04:42.720> time<00:04:42.960> I

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
stopped killing them and every time I

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.020 
stopped killing them and every time I
would<00:04:43.139> get<00:04:43.380> maybe<00:04:43.620> Arun<00:04:43.979> full<00:04:44.280> helm<00:04:44.550> or<00:04:44.820> the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
would get maybe Arun full helm or the

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.260 
would get maybe Arun full helm or the
rune<00:04:45.479> scimitar<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.320> that's<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:47.160> like<00:04:47.729> I<00:04:47.970> waste

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
rune scimitar and that's it like I waste

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.749 
rune scimitar and that's it like I waste
more<00:04:48.570> money<00:04:48.630> on<00:04:49.169> supplies<00:04:49.889> on<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.550> runes

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
more money on supplies on the runes

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.330 
more money on supplies on the runes
casting<00:04:51.479> on<00:04:51.630> on<00:04:51.840> them<00:04:52.080> they<00:04:52.560> always<00:04:52.770> have<00:04:53.130> full

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
casting on on them they always have full

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.939 
casting on on them they always have full
inventory<00:04:53.669> of<00:04:54.120> food<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:54.720> thought<00:04:55.289> maybe<00:04:55.530> they'd

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
inventory of food I thought maybe they'd

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.610 
inventory of food I thought maybe they'd
kill<00:04:56.550> someone<00:04:56.970> like<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:57.750> know<00:04:57.870> team<00:04:58.169> versus

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
kill someone like you know team versus

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.430 
kill someone like you know team versus
team<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:59.220> they<00:04:59.880> eventually<00:05:00.300> loot<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.110> lot<00:05:01.260> of

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
team and they eventually loot a lot of

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.529 
team and they eventually loot a lot of
stuff<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.039> they'll<00:05:02.250> log<00:05:02.490> off<00:05:02.729> to<00:05:03.240> pay<00:05:03.479> the

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
stuff and they'll log off to pay the

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.540 
stuff and they'll log off to pay the
play<00:05:03.810> world<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:04.710> they<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:05.039> full<00:05:05.280> inventory

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
play world so they have full inventory

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.180 
play world so they have full inventory
of<00:05:05.880> rune<00:05:06.210> items<00:05:06.600> but<00:05:07.020> now<00:05:07.289> they<00:05:07.710> have<00:05:07.889> full

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
of rune items but now they have full

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.760 
of rune items but now they have full
inventory<00:05:08.490> of<00:05:08.820> food<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.900> have<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:10.350> waste<00:05:10.560> a

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
inventory of food and I have to waste a

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.370 
inventory of food and I have to waste a
lot<00:05:10.919> of<00:05:10.979> supplies<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.550> kill<00:05:12.000> them<00:05:12.240> so<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.110> still

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
lot of supplies to kill them so I still

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.770 
lot of supplies to kill them so I still
don't<00:05:13.710> know<00:05:13.949> why<00:05:14.220> they<00:05:14.550> do<00:05:14.610> this<00:05:15.030> there<00:05:15.600> must

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
don't know why they do this there must

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.379 
don't know why they do this there must
be<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.020> reason<00:05:16.650> obviously<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:17.789> think<00:05:18.090> it's

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
be a reason obviously I think it's

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.279 
be a reason obviously I think it's
because<00:05:18.690> agility<00:05:19.530> works<00:05:20.010> in<00:05:20.330> paid<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.360> play<00:05:21.690> so

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
because agility works in paid a play so

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.589 
because agility works in paid a play so
they<00:05:22.440> drink<00:05:22.740> like<00:05:22.979> a<00:05:23.010> stamina<00:05:23.460> potion<00:05:23.849> they

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
they drink like a stamina potion they

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.839 
they drink like a stamina potion they
run<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.139> one<00:05:25.289> place<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.919> then<00:05:26.130> they<00:05:26.280> log<00:05:26.610> back

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
run to one place and then they log back

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.020 
run to one place and then they log back
into<00:05:27.120> free-to-play<00:05:27.919> yeah<00:05:28.919> that<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.430> guess<00:05:29.759> that

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
into free-to-play yeah that I guess that

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.420 
into free-to-play yeah that I guess that
may<00:05:30.449> be<00:05:30.509> the<00:05:30.750> reason<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.259> I<00:05:31.949> want<00:05:32.039> to<00:05:32.310> say

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
may be the reason and I want to say

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.980 
may be the reason and I want to say
