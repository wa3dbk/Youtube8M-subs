00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.200 
there and I'm a little bit of a
perfectionist<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.130> can't<00:00:20.550> stand<00:00:20.910> having

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
for shaping so much I used two crystal

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.289 
for shaping so much I used two crystal
nail<00:02:46.020> file<00:02:46.380> -<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:46.980> shaping<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.820> removing

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.460 
length
I<00:02:48.840> used<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:50.690> what<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.959> thickest

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
I used the the what is it the thickest

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.130 
I used the the what is it the thickest
grid<00:02:52.709> oh<00:02:52.950> well<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.420> what<00:02:54.780> would<00:02:54.989> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
grid oh well the what would the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.570 
grid oh well the what would the
word<00:02:55.320> be<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:57.330> would<00:02:57.600> be<00:02:57.780> though<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.580> don't

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
word be for it would be though I don't

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.430 
word be for it would be though I don't
know<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> coarser<00:03:00.600> one<00:03:00.810> for<00:03:01.049> removing

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
length and I also had to use the nail

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.690 
length and I also had to use the nail
clipper<00:03:04.320> because<00:03:04.680> they<00:03:04.799> were<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.160> long<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.640> I

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
clipper because they were so long so I

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.180 
clipper because they were so long so I
clipped<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.390> half<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.440> rest<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.830> filed
