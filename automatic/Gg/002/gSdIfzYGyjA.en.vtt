00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 You 're bringing something that also 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.259
 was missing the Flemish that the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.970
 Ball does not make you a goal too much 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.280
 beautiful lack but also in the corners 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.690
 you are being moved to collect 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.639
 even with the arm of a foul 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.370
 Temporary week at the clinic even your 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.900
 which is adding I had yes 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:23.820
 It's always always been to hit the corners 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:28.230
 And the teacher said that was was what 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 You've been charged and always lacking in you. 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.100
 training is the day before the match until 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.899
 people trained enough edson himself 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.780
 we had a good performance and in the game 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.480
 I was happy, I was able to make a beautiful 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.469
 then quoted edson was the premiere 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.730
 his right he goes for fatigue even just in the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.960
 beginning of the second half right 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.969
 He's gone for a long time, right? 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.289
 I was talking to him, he said 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 that seven months ago he did not play and then 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:07.470
 He said that it's a little bit missing, but it's okay. 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.979
 Coaching is working hard to 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.490
 improve and in training and of course 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.920
 which in games is also where it goes will 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.530
 will be perfected and in the physical part 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.000
 him and with him is able to play the 90 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.770
 minutes and warrior coming back how 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.850
 you're seeing the team's formation 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.799
 Flamengo 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.970
 What's the only place for you in this you? 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.009
 likes to play by the sides too 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.500
 prefers to play in the middle as it stands 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.710
 so this fit in the international year 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.049
 I passed in the gaucho championship until I did 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.100
 a third man in the middle field 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.720
 nelly the third and a half steering wheel he is e 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.250
 a third wheel or the appearance 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.640
 Flamengo 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.990
 the steering wheel / half happening in the middle field 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.320
 well baptized and then after the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.509
 brazilian championship abel started to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.049
 use more in the attack by 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.930
 edge of the field so I guess that 's where the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.920
 Teacher thinks that what I can 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.420
 to pay well I'm always there and always 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 help the flamengo will have a place here 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.319
 It's your there that you feel more 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.209
 comfortable that whatever 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.659
 I'd been playing where the sock 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.519
 there that the function of one 1 2 3 4 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:25.549
 half centralized but I also like 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:30.060
 type starting the plays right there 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:32.879
 taking there year of the defender of the steering wheel 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.500
 to start the plays speak captain 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.349
 I wanted to talk about scrolling or I'm 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.849
 trying to start a campaign 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.659
 here to end this name in 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.840
 rolling 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.969
 I am radically with a player of 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.769
 midfield when the opponent has the 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.260
 possession must know how to score and 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.730
 when the team has possession of the ball and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.010
 know how to get out on the attack, huh? 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.409
 This has to be the spirit that goes back and forth. 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.120
 the Flemish I have been with and I do not 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.790
 I have seen the flamengo games but have 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.639
 accompanied by the press the people 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.290
 criticizing the senator Christian because 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.480
 he always uses three fliers 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.810
 Then I'm in pain, I want you to take this 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.760
 doubt today here the Flemish has today 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.870
 alan patrick the agent in flower beds 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.669
 flower beds 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.609
 jonas and the giving and returning everton 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:26.609
 what position do you think the 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.889
 people considering a steering wheel or sock 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.900
 Jonas is the steering wheel. 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.509
 the bed already the steering wheel you are the steering wheel 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.209
 It's true for me to get my face off. 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:38.459
 I do not think he's in Christ. 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.729
 suffering a team campaign in my 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.629
 in my opinion I'm a newspaper all 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:47.639
 I believe they see me as half as 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.959
 I was there doing this yesterday. 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:55.310
 third half man helping martyr 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.310
 araujo and the flowerbed
