livestream at twitch TV we decided to

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.419 
livestream at twitch TV we decided to
calculate<00:00:06.120> how<00:00:06.390> much<00:00:06.569> DPS<00:00:07.350> I'm<00:00:07.529> doing<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.340> I'm

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
calculate how much DPS I'm doing and I'm

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.890 
calculate how much DPS I'm doing and I'm
not<00:00:08.580> talking<00:00:08.849> about<00:00:08.910> my<00:00:09.179> character<00:00:09.690> sheet

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
not talking about my character sheet

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.620 
not talking about my character sheet
damage<00:00:10.230> which<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.769> 100k<00:00:11.550> unbuffed<00:00:12.330> right

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
damage which is a 100k unbuffed right

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.079 
damage which is a 100k unbuffed right
now<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.900> 127<00:00:13.740> K<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.160> magic<00:00:14.639> weapon<00:00:14.910> in

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
now it's 127 K with magic weapon in

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.910 
now it's 127 K with magic weapon in
glass<00:00:15.299> cannon<00:00:15.690> I'm<00:00:16.289> talking<00:00:16.619> about<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
glass cannon I'm talking about the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.220 
glass cannon I'm talking about the
actual<00:00:17.250> damage<00:00:17.820> per<00:00:18.060> second<00:00:18.480> I'm<00:00:18.600> doing<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
actual damage per second I'm doing to a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.040 
actual damage per second I'm doing to a
single<00:00:19.830> target<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> test<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.660> decided

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
single target so for the test we decided

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.840 
single target so for the test we decided
to<00:00:22.140> use<00:00:22.289> ghom<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:23.160> he's<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.369> single<00:00:23.580> target

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
to use ghom because he's a single target

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.000 
to use ghom because he's a single target
he<00:00:24.449> has<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> lot<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> health<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.500> he<00:00:25.859> does

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
he has a lot of health and he does

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310 
he has a lot of health and he does
damage<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.670> even<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.480> him<00:00:27.689> stun

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
damage to you even if you have him stun

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.810 
damage to you even if you have him stun
locked<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.800> means<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.099> can't<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
locked which means you can't just go so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
locked which means you can't just go so
squishy<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.449> can't<00:00:30.689> take<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> single<00:00:31.380> hit

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
squishy that you can't take a single hit

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.920 
squishy that you can't take a single hit
you<00:00:31.980> still<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.579> some<00:00:32.640> defense<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you still have to have some defense so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.350 
you still have to have some defense so
it<00:00:34.050> seemed<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> good<00:00:34.680> test<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.360> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it seemed like a good test and to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.670 
it seemed like a good test and to
calculate<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.110> take<00:00:37.230> his<00:00:37.440> health

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
calculate it we just take his health

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.049 
calculate it we just take his health
divided<00:00:38.250> by<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> amount<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> seconds<00:00:38.969> it

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
divided by the amount of seconds it

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.880 
divided by the amount of seconds it
takes<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> kill<00:00:39.510> him<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.320> were<00:00:40.530> coming<00:00:40.800> up

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
takes to kill him and we were coming up

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.660 
takes to kill him and we were coming up
with<00:00:41.100> between<00:00:41.309> 600<00:00:42.090> K<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.680> 800<00:00:43.680> K<00:00:43.890> damage<00:00:44.460> per

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
with between 600 K and 800 K damage per

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.459 
with between 600 K and 800 K damage per
second<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.780> wanted<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.050> show<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.200> guys

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
that I'm using storm armor I use that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
that I'm using storm armor I use that
sometimes<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.100> extra<00:00:50.309> damage<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
sometimes to get some extra damage I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.299 
sometimes to get some extra damage I
might<00:00:51.510> switch<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> prismatic<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.410> runs<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:53.039> I'm

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

was<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.490> I'll<00:01:08.610> put<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:08.790> an<00:01:08.939> annotation

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
was but I'll put up an annotation

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.530 
was but I'll put up an annotation

mass Wizards can do a lot of damage for

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
mass Wizards can do a lot of damage for
how<00:01:14.490> much<00:01:14.729> character<00:01:15.210> sheet<00:01:15.450> damage<00:01:15.750> they

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
how much character sheet damage they

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.219 
how much character sheet damage they
have<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.470> i<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.070> pretty<00:01:17.490> cool<00:01:18.330> now<00:01:19.080> on

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
have which i think is pretty cool now on

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.770
