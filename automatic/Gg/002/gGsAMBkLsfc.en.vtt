00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
I've been doing pretty much ever since I

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.650 
I've been doing pretty much ever since I
started<00:00:12.840> cooking<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.440> myself<00:00:13.559> when<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.009> 18

although I was kind of doing it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.099

unknowingly<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
unknowingly and that is just to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.830 
unknowingly and that is just to
basically<00:00:19.500> cook<00:00:20.100> my<00:00:20.310> own<00:00:20.430> food<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:21.359> all

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
of tricky because you can't really

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.319 
of tricky because you can't really
guarantee<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.520> they're<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.730> frying<00:00:45.030> things
