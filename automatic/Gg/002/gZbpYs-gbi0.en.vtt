 actor's information ie number 12 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.860
 of minecraft presents this is going to be the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.240
 1.3 point 1 and very good in the part of 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.530
 below I'll leave a link with all 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.390
 this information everything that will bring 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.770
 everything that is going to be used all the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.840
 new things that are going to come for the 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.760
 people that good do not know exactly what 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.470
 is what is going to come or does the 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.320
 sorry is the first time they enter what 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.179
 that I'm doing xbox 360 minecraft and 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.400
 good many things are going to come like 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.800
 example is going to add the biome of 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.000
 jungle was not as good as it was 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.980
 some little things that maybe 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.930
 It seems that I was jealous but 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.120
 I just was not good then 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.040
 they are also going to add this biome so that 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.680
 you see more or less the difference 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.060
 is the jungle the prairies what comes 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.860
 being the snow and all those things that 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.240
 you already know more or less what you have already 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.160
 played before what I'm going 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.500
 doing the minecraft then good is going 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.790
 to come what he told me about the jungle go 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.170
 to add what has been the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.880
 ocelots and these are going to be able 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.500
 find the same biome that is in the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.280
 jungle so you do not have to have any 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.440
 problem 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.810
 another thing to come is to add the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.240
 cats and good cats are going to be 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.979
 time to find it you can 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.740
 to raise with one I have it well 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.060
 obviously we will be able to unite what I 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.060
 say two cats and you will leave a 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.350
 kitty so that you domestic already 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.420
 they know that they are domestic with the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.740
 customers and the fish and others I do not think 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.479
 that there are many things that we have to 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.729
 know there are many things that we already know 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.979
 where we do not really know I 'm not 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.360
 a great sage of what I'm doing the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.030
 minecraft but good the information that 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.250
 is here is reliable is a page of 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.470
 actress is dedicated to minecraft then 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.030
 well the other page that I had the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.440
 I lost with the way you have a computer 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.450
 but well it's also a good source of 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.590
 the truth and good also says that we 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.750
 is going to add what I'm doing 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.970
 jungle tree in the jungle biome 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.319
 logically and well now yes it is going to 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.759
 to be able to plant what has been the 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.190
 cocoa seed because it's good at 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.140
 previous performance in 11 there was what 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.670
 is the cocoa seed but not 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.319
 there was where to plant the cocoa be 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.300
 normal but good this is already 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.619
 starting all that is already added to 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.080
 all the details then good 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.060
 also the iron golem that since 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.580
 previous updates say that what 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.320
 they are going to put in but nothing else 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.260
 So, right now, they already say that 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.300
 is this 100 legal that they are going to put it 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.040
 they will also put intelligence 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.290
 artificial for the villagers for 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.470
 Sorry mods for the mods and for the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.000
 villagers are already going to be able to have children like this 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.680
 that for people who like that the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.960
 Haitians have relationships and have 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.850
 good children are going to be able to have their 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.350
 breed tourists to the villages are going to have 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.660
 much more space so they can have 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.520
 his kids are not going to 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.070
 increase the maximum height before was 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.050
 of 128 blocks if you put one 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.790
 after another of earth or stone whatever 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.210
 and they wanted to raise him up in the house of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.730
 your good guy could just put 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.160
 128 now they are going to duplicate it and it can be 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.720
 256 blocks up I say some 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.070
 people who say why I want so many 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.620
 blocks but so there are many people who 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.360
 like to create I do not know a sky blog or something 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.200
 you can say it well now you can 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.390
 upload 256 blocks without any problem 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.250
 so good also new blocks and 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.170
 new items so be more earrings 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.910
 or less to know exactly which 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.709
 are the ones that are going to add the doors 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.019
 doubles will work better when using 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.960
 rest have the last updates 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.900
 because they gave 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.610
 the king troll will also be added to the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.770
 mods such as the zombies that now 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.600
 they will jump for ingots and other things 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.150
 as in fish 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.190
 if you killed a zombie if he killed 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.190
 an archer was given things at the same time 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.230
 to this enchanted and so now I 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.970
 already the vain can do they can no longer 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.250
 gift materials you could say 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.620
 that giving away those objects before 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.270
 could the tutorial be updated according to 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.550
 implement it the update you know 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.650

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.100
 tutorial in the tutorial part 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.840
