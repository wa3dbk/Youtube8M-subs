00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 we have seen at least once the guy from 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.120
 eight ' that's why today I bring you some 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.130
 curiosities that I found out there of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.010
 this program that took us more than one 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.210
 smile 10 things you did not know about the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.210
 eight ' 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.540
 there's only one chapter that they recorded with the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.850
 full cast that was one of the most 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.510
 sad about this program that was when 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 they were acapulco 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.110
 the famous barrel of the guy is his 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.760
 secret hideaway in the place where 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.130
 they sleep as many of us believe 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.920
 or we actually believed the guy clarifies this 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.719
 several times 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.059
 the guy lives in the apartment number 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.649
 8 together with another person but both 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.990
 department as the person never 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.120
 no chapter appeared 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.260
 the guy has a real name but 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.390
 whenever you want to make it known 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.210
 someone arrives and interrupts him with another 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.700
 talking point 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.379
 I never knew and maybe never knows 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.449
 where did the witch from 71 get money? 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.100
 it would be super interesting his party that 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.850
 If you have any theory, leave it in a 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.950
 comment here abajito 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.830

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.020

 that kiko can be seen with her godmother and 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.730
