it stand out from the crowd of layered
shots<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> busca

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
shots so this is going to be the busca

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.130 
shots so this is going to be the busca
pain<00:00:20.039> method<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:21.539> these<00:00:21.720> different

pain method and with these different
type<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.320> liquors<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.070> use<00:00:23.250> today<00:00:23.570> where

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
type of liquors that we use today where

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
type of liquors that we use today where
they<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.140> different<00:00:25.619> densities<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.189> want

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
they have different densities you want

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.519 
they have different densities you want
to<00:00:26.609> check<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.090> specific<00:00:27.810> density<00:00:27.990> chart

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
to check at your specific density chart

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.099 
to check at your specific density chart
to<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.250> which<00:00:29.670> liquor<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.150> heavier<00:00:30.510> which

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
to see which liquor is heavier which

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.709 
to see which liquor is heavier which
liquor<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.590> lighter<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
liquor is lighter that way we get the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.990 
liquor is lighter that way we get the
layering<00:00:33.960> effect<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:35.219> we're<00:00:35.430> looking<00:00:35.730> for

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
layering effect that we're looking for

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
layering effect that we're looking for
so<00:00:36.630> let's<00:00:36.899> go<00:00:37.079> ahead<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> make<00:00:37.590> our<00:00:37.770> brain

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
so let's go ahead and make our brain

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010 
so let's go ahead and make our brain

little tricky is you're going to have to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
little tricky is you're going to have to
use<00:01:21.030> grenadine<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.990> you're<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> have

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
use grenadine and you're going to have

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.700 
use grenadine and you're going to have
to<00:01:23.159> put<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> grenadine<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.270> spoon<00:01:24.710> okay

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
to put the grenadine in your spoon okay

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
to put the grenadine in your spoon okay
this<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> take<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.909> time<00:01:27.240> but

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this is going to take a little time but

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.319 
this is going to take a little time but
what<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.439> trying<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
what we're trying to go for here is

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.679 
what we're trying to go for here is
making<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.829> brain<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> drop

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
making a little brain it's going to drop

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.060 
making a little brain it's going to drop
down<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.610> fit<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:35.790> into<00:01:36.150> our<00:01:37.070> peach

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
down and fit right into our peach

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.200 
down and fit right into our peach
schnapps<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.140> slowly<00:01:41.810> drip<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.399> drop<00:01:44.399> by

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
schnapps here so slowly drip and drop by

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.399 
schnapps here so slowly drip and drop by
drop<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:46.250> move<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.369> around<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.790> little<00:01:48.409> that

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
drop and move it around a little that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.999 
drop and move it around a little that
way<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> full<00:01:50.220> brain<00:01:51.290> they<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.590> our

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
way you get a full brain they of our

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.980 
way you get a full brain they of our
grenadine<00:01:54.770> okay<00:01:56.000> drop<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.030> down<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
grenadine okay drop it down so you get a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.660 
grenadine okay drop it down so you get a
little<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.770> brain<00:01:59.070> look<00:02:01.490> right<00:02:02.490> from

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
little bit of a brain look right from

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.490 
little bit of a brain look right from
there<00:02:02.880> you'll<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.450> start<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.840> form<00:02:04.110> into

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
there you'll see it start to form into

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.639 
there you'll see it start to form into
the<00:02:04.619> glass<00:02:05.719> it's<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> look<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the glass it's going to look like a

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.550 
the glass it's going to look like a
bloody<00:02:08.429> brain<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.780> right<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.259> got

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
bloody brain we do it right you just got
