00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that we can use then we're going to go

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010 
that we can use then we're going to go
ahead<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.579> remove<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.969> existing<00:00:54.239> straw<00:00:54.750> from

this<00:00:55.199> air<00:00:55.500> canister<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> use

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.220 

now<00:01:00.860> in<00:01:01.010> order<00:01:01.220> to<00:01:01.400> mount<00:01:01.670> our<00:01:01.790> new<00:01:01.910> straw

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
now in order to mount our new straw

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.780 
now in order to mount our new straw
we're<00:01:03.230> going<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.440> modify<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.890> nozzle<00:01:04.760> a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
we're going to modify the nozzle a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.790 
we're going to modify the nozzle a
little<00:01:05.089> bit

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.230 

so<00:01:11.800> now<00:01:11.950> by<00:01:12.190> eating<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.910> end<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.150> this

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
so now by eating the end of this

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.540 
so now by eating the end of this
paperclip<00:01:13.570> we're<00:01:14.440> essentially<00:01:14.770> making<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.310> hot

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
paperclip we're essentially making a hot

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.220 
paperclip we're essentially making a hot
knife<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.330> we're<00:01:16.600> going<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.780> go<00:01:16.900> ahead<00:01:16.990> and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
knife and we're going to go ahead and

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.560 
knife and we're going to go ahead and
melt<00:01:17.410> through<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.710> plastic<00:01:18.700> end<00:01:18.910> here<00:01:19.180> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
melt through the plastic end here the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:30.340 
melt through the plastic end here the
nozzle<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:21.130> help<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.400> room<00:01:21.640> for<00:01:21.850> our<00:01:21.940> straw

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.480 

so<00:01:31.350> we're<00:01:31.470> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.620> go<00:01:31.770> ahead<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so we're going to go ahead and do the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:46.070 
so we're going to go ahead and do the
other<00:01:32.520> side<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:33.060> well

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.840 

now<00:01:47.080> sew<00:01:47.290> straw<00:01:48.010> should<00:01:48.250> slip<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.670> end

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
now sew straw should slip on the end

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.400 
now sew straw should slip on the end
here<00:01:49.060> if<00:01:49.780> not<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.410> can<00:01:50.650> use<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.820> end<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.150> the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
here if not you can use the end of the

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.600 
here if not you can use the end of the
gel<00:01:53.410> pen<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.940> flare<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.150> end<00:01:55.420> out<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:56.140> help

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
gel pen to flare this end out to help

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:08.880 
gel pen to flare this end out to help
get<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.790> straw<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.060> fit<00:01:58.300> on<00:01:58.420> there<00:02:07.890> once

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
get that straw to fit on there once

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.859 
get that straw to fit on there once
you've<00:02:08.979> got<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.130> strong<00:02:09.850> connected<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.840> can

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
you've got that strong connected you can

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.490 
you've got that strong connected you can
go<00:02:11.080> ahead<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.350> use<00:02:12.280> electrical<00:02:12.730> tape<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
go ahead and use electrical tape to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:24.540 
go ahead and use electrical tape to
secure<00:02:14.650> those<00:02:15.070> two<00:02:15.310> pieces<00:02:15.490> together<00:02:15.820> so<00:02:23.550> you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
secure those two pieces together so you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.280 
secure those two pieces together so you
want<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.880> tape<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.270> there<00:02:25.450> pretty<00:02:25.690> tight<00:02:25.750> so

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
want that tape on there pretty tight so

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.830 
want that tape on there pretty tight so
you<00:02:26.860> don't<00:02:27.010> get<00:02:27.100> any<00:02:27.160> air<00:02:27.400> escaping<00:02:27.790> at<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you don't get any air escaping at it and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.690 
you don't get any air escaping at it and
again<00:02:31.840> using<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.230> hot<00:02:32.440> knife<00:02:32.680> we're<00:02:33.520> going<00:02:33.640> to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
again using the hot knife we're going to

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.730 
again using the hot knife we're going to
go<00:02:33.820> ahead<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.150> poke<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.960> little<00:02:34.990> hole<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.440> that

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
go ahead and poke a little hole in that

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.510 
go ahead and poke a little hole in that
second<00:02:36.250> little<00:02:36.400> piece<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
second little piece of that of the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.710 
second little piece of that of the
cartridge<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:43.030> hole<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.300> going<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.600> be

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
cartridge and that hole is going to be

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.470 
cartridge and that hole is going to be
just<00:02:43.930> big<00:02:44.140> enough<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.820> put<00:02:45.820> our<00:02:45.940> pen<00:02:46.210> through

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
just big enough to put our pen through

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.000 
just big enough to put our pen through
there

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.410 

so<00:02:51.010> now<00:02:51.160> we<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:51.340> bed<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.670> reattach<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.270> end

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
so now we can bed and reattach the end

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.620 
so now we can bed and reattach the end
piece<00:02:52.660> back<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.500> straw

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630
