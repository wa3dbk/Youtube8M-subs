00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
through it it's gonna go and worst case

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.760 
through it it's gonna go and worst case
scenario<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.930> fly<00:02:49.170> through<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.470> again<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
scenario you fly through it again and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.640 
scenario you fly through it again and
restart<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.580> race<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.540> one's<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.140> fairly

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
restart the race but this one's a fairly

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.550 
restart the race but this one's a fairly
simple<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.370> obviously<00:02:54.360> fairly<00:02:54.810> slow<00:02:55.080> -<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
simple it's obviously fairly slow - the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.290 
simple it's obviously fairly slow - the
old<00:02:55.680> Pteranodon<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.490> only<00:02:56.610> move<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:56.880> fast

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
old Pteranodon can only move so fast

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.240 
old Pteranodon can only move so fast
it's<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:57.840> them<00:02:58.020> Ironman<00:02:58.590> races<00:02:58.890> from

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
I guess up and around this gets a little

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.070 
I guess up and around this gets a little
squirrely<00:03:23.850> up<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.270> around<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.570> trees<00:03:24.810> here

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
seems like it goes on forever and it

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.240 
seems like it goes on forever and it
kind<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.450> does<00:03:30.630> but<00:03:30.930> that's<00:03:31.410> good<00:03:31.739> it's<00:03:32.010> all

the Dino Hynek icon which took me a few
tries<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.850> get<00:03:57.000> once<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.050> get<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.530> actually

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
tries to get once I get it I actually

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.850 
tries to get once I get it I actually
hop<00:03:59.130> up<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.670> the<00:04:00.269> switch<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.230> grab<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.680> and

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
hop up on the switch and I grab it and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.740 
hop up on the switch and I grab it and
that's<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:02.430> great<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:03.209> as<00:04:03.360> soon<00:04:03.510> as<00:04:03.600> you

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
that's all great but as soon as you

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.420 
that's all great but as soon as you
release<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.410> switch<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.950> believe<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:05.310> when

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
release the switch I believe it's when

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.110 
release the switch I believe it's when
you<00:04:05.519> release<00:04:05.760> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
you release it

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.490 
you release it
maybe<00:04:06.390> it's<00:04:06.570> yet<00:04:06.780> when<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.019> release<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.290> it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
maybe it's yet when you release it it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.620 
maybe it's yet when you release it it

get up finally I'm like alright I gotta
try<00:04:14.490> this<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.700> different<00:04:15.060> way<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.390> get<00:04:15.510> over

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
try this a different way so I get over

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.400 
try this a different way so I get over
to<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.930> side<00:04:16.109> so

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
to the side so

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.020 
to the side so
you<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.769> troubles<00:04:17.100> flying<00:04:17.370> away<00:04:17.550> make<00:04:18.000> sure

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you have troubles flying away make sure

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.430 
you have troubles flying away make sure
you<00:04:18.269> just<00:04:18.420> kind<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.660> change<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.110> angle

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
you just kind of change the angle

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.320 
you just kind of change the angle
because<00:04:19.620> it's<00:04:19.650> kind<00:04:19.920> of<00:04:19.980> a<00:04:20.040> funny<00:04:20.280> angle<00:04:20.519> but

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
because it's kind of a funny angle but

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.580 
because it's kind of a funny angle but
all<00:04:21.810> right<00:04:22.019> so<00:04:22.080> we'll<00:04:22.290> go<00:04:22.410> ahead<00:04:22.440> and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
all right so we'll go ahead and

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.320 
all right so we'll go ahead and
basically<00:04:23.250> there's<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.580> series<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.030> these

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
basically there's a series of these

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.390 
basically there's a series of these
tables<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.900> we<00:04:25.050> lift<00:04:25.260> each<00:04:25.500> table<00:04:25.770> presents

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
tables that we lift each table presents
