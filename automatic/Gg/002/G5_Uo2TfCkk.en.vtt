00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 bring people to cologne and all over 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.910
 Germany kickboxing at my today's 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.679
 theme are boxing gloves maybe stands 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.630
 he is also new to you shortly before 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.549
 boxing gloves to buy or generally 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.059
 For the first time boxing gloves too 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.240
 to buy 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.130
 and I want you and you outside all over 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.199
 like to give some tips on what to look for 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 should and which boxing gloves on 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 best chooses I have two here now 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 different models brought for 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.670
 Look at you a little bit 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.949
 show differences 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.899
 what should I start with, I would say 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.239
 I'll just start with that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.969
 beginner model to what maybe on 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.420
 the most interesting is out there for you 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.550
 I now have our entry-level model 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.420
 here from my club itself 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 skating and what can i say to you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 yes, so a boxing glove has one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 certain weight of this box in protection 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.120
 for example, ten ounces has weight 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.480
 us is a weight unit stands for 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.940
 so much grams kilograms and ever 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.739
 the heavier a glove is the more 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.299
 more exhausting is your training 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.970
 these gloves have for example 10 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.010
 ounces and that is actually quite a bit 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.250
 good weight training also for 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.200
 Beginners typical features the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.759
 This box has gloves for example 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 is the velcro 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.060
 you should definitely on 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.330
 refrain from boxing gloves 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.009
 you have to tie because this box 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960
 gloves have to be extra shared 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.430
 and these bendels are not allowed 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.920
 flying around would be your partner 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.210
 flying in the eye and so on and that 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.490
 with the velcro is yet 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.110
 really much better as well 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.079
 First, the feeling should be quite good 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
 if he's in this boxing glove 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.189
 It should not be too big and not too 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.409
 be small here at the wrist 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.729
 we still have to do the bandages 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.759
 wrapped around it 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.200
 and when they are there and you 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.800
 power closes the hand again 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.720
 then you have one here too 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.610
 stable connection at the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.860
 entry-level model is extra rubber again 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.490
 with you there you can again those 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.040
 wrist thickness vary again 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 pull 10 looser and then hold 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.340
 he did it with the velcro 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.300
 the next point in the boxing gloves 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.830
 here is the sewn thumb very 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.510
 very important is always remembered here 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 I would box now and you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.960
 just make sure to top up with that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.780
 thumb would be completely backwards 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.640
 Fold the weir sprain and this 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.750
 this connection ago 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 the merged connection 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.950
 prevents just that the thumb is free 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.810
 and that he will be folded backwards 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.880
 In addition, there is still the here 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.620
 Protect this hump of the front of her 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.960
 see the prevented just again 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.600
 Resistances right in the thumb 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.620
 meet but the topic slips away something 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.090
 we still have everything here is one 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.030
 nice stabilizer in it 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.680
 Wrist feels good in the front 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.180
 is a bit more for the breathing 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.520
 so you do not sweat so hard in the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.510
 glove and also normally attack the 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.500
 feels even a little bit crowded 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.290
 a fist 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.830
 Now the most important thing is dampening 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.930
 ahead 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.010
 The damping of this glove is 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.410
 extremely big 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.150
 That's the best way to be aware of it 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.190
 a little lower child then pushes 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.470
 you have a good insulation here 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.020
 two advantages he was injured one 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.820
 partner is not so much at training 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.290
 one training gloves and the next 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.989
 advantage is your ankles 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.850
 they are very much spared it 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.290
 There are many fighters who say where I have them 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.780
 so painful to the ankles 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.150
 what can I do yes they have to just for 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.459
 training again on a beginner 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.100
 Gloves is about to change 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.600
 that also means a glove for me 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.989
 personally , the hand is nothing 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.090
 more 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.290
 I do not feel like it anymore 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.040
 a muffled boxing gloves 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.020
 to box in front 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.670
 and that is me too much too easily 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.860
 Training is as with the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.590
 boxing glove I prefer myself 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.420
 actually heavy boxing gloves man 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.600
 just say train with one 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.060
 heavy boxing glove here that the zum 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.830
 Example 20 ounces and fight with one 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.800
 light boxing gloves for example 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.840
 with twelve of us in the fight 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.580
 one has a certain ease the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.860
 one is not used one is so heavy 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.810
 boxing gloves used and therefore 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.320
 I personally prefer to train 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.540
 20 not us and this boxing glove is 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.840
 much larger encloses even more 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.070
 from the whole a gives more stability and 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.230
 front is not so strong 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.180
 Muted that means the beats the 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.850
 popping better I just have another 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.710
 more feeling with the whole blows 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.480
 be sure to get an entry-level model 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.770
 it would not be on me 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.840
 no case recommend but only 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.000
 after about kickboxing year 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.390
 I would only make it with a 10 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.150
 us boxing glove at the beginning of the lighter 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.050
 and also brings a few benefits for 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.410
 the hand itself for the ankles up and 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.300
 then I would like to say from the price 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.950
 Now do not beat you anyway 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.080
 yourself before cheap gloves too 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.450
 Buy and good glove starts about 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.050
 so at 50 euros 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.180
 I would say you know who cheap 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.740
 Buy buys twice you will 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.230
 Guaranteed then buy the go quickly 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.540
 broken always pay attention to that 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.530
 boxing glove also made of leather and 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.780
 not made of imitation leather 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.760
 yes, that was me 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.250
 Wish you good buys in any case 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.960

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.000
