00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.350
 pretty swag on a game for blogger 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.020
 and today's video will tell you how 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.389
 increase the number of fps in games and how u 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.519
 mosques water and for that we need 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.230
 program kapu back all link 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.109
 on it you will find in the description under the video 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.970
 but before we deal with 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.920
 the program is most important before you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.650
 will any game of course 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.600
 turn off all unnecessary type programs 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.910
 skype let's say even 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 the stim is here now that's it picked up with only 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 of course play 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 game that is associated with stimulation john 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.410
 here it will not work and of course 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.989
 whether the steam itself rent 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.719
 so have to play with him in general 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.360
 there are other programs like skype and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.700
 other compression would cut down of course but 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.870
 also antivirus and so go to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.969
 the program to help control is all 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.070
 just pretty touch here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.010
 nothing is important here too 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.739
 that's here that's when we start the game 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 let's say any altogether troy and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.160
 title 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.769
 here here and in general having defined it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.140
 name we press the right mouse button on 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.930
 for example and here it is our ticket 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.000
 the most interesting if you have 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.580
 dual core processor then you choose 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.350
 kapu 1 plus 2 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.520
 if 4 3 choose 3 plus 4 all 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.280
 just picked 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 and in general, minimize this program and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.180
 then you play first 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.200
 run the game 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.450
 further roll it giving again with 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.229
 use the controller to choose one too 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.390
 nicknamed b3 b4 and at the same time several 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.000
 close and to the floor the controller needs it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:48.360
 collapse his photo, you can safely continue 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.460
 play also have another bun in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.909
 general then after using the kapu 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.340
 the controller will increase the number of fps and this 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.299
 should help you, I'm telling and you can 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.710
 still do here so here in general 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.520
 open task manager in processes 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.259
 in general, that is 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.560
 the title is also your games right click 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.720
 mouse button priority is above average 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.310
 it is by becoming above average high and 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.410
 never put in real time 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.019
 otherwise you will have water society all 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.910
 also possible using task manager 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.610
 groan all programs that are not 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.430
 displayed for example losing weight the same 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.830
 antivirus and the like is very 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.440
 in general, this is a comfortable bed 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.610
 We will understand first to reduce the lags 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.739
 and before you start playing 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.450
 turn off all the programs just let the threads 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.280
 about this this and the like further 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.110
 controversy on the controller by running the game 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.630
 of course you already do 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.870
 priority in the kabul controller as in 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.180
 turn off the controller and continue to play 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.620
 wear you still tormented lags can 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.200
 then again through the task manager in 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.540
 In general, by clicking on the name of the game 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.079
 mouse practice also increase priority 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.090
 above average and putting all 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.180
 you should have much less lags 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.049
 but of course such an operation 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.260
 have to do every time that is 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.359
 turned off louder and computer and again 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.040
 will have to cut everything down 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.400
 extra programs include a drop 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.989
 controller and task manager dispatcher 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.799
 tasks not necessarily dug up the controller 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.350
 Of course, it is the decanter that is required for those 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.329
 who plays the batu I advise another jump 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.730
 This settled on the server and close 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:36.019
 In general, your browser, that is, let's say 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.030
 went to the north already appeared a tag 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:45.319
 your game that is iraq battles 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:47.239
 and immediately turn off everything on it 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.769
 video at the end thanks for watching 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.329
