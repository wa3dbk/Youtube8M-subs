00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.310 
test and the only reason I passed it
because<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.300> lady<00:02:40.420> felt<00:02:40.690> bags<00:02:40.870> i<00:02:41.050> think<00:02:41.230> if

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
because the lady felt bags i think if

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.570 
because the lady felt bags i think if
you<00:02:41.410> fail<00:02:41.620> three<00:02:41.890> times<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.250> feel<00:02:42.340> like<00:02:42.460> wait

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
you fail three times you feel like wait

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.490 
you fail three times you feel like wait
a<00:02:42.610> year<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.910> take<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.750> lady<00:02:43.990> was<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.320> you

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500
