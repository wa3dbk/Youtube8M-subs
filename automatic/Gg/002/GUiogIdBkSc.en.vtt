know<00:00:59.300> if<00:00:59.390> you<00:00:59.510> can<00:00:59.659> see<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.109> or<00:01:00.289> not

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.830 

I<00:01:13.210> already<00:01:14.210> have<00:01:14.660> it<00:01:15.640> low<00:01:16.640> 56<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.510> just<00:01:17.780> like

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
I already have it low 56 it's just like

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.290 
I already have it low 56 it's just like
mine<00:01:18.230> sweeper<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.370> set<00:01:19.610> these<00:01:19.760> numbers<00:01:20.120> to

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
mine sweeper so you set these numbers to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.420 
mine sweeper so you set these numbers to
however<00:01:20.390> many<00:01:20.570> flags<00:01:21.050> around<00:01:21.260> it<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.250> this

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
however many flags around it so this

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.620 
however many flags around it so this
one's<00:01:22.640> for<00:01:23.290> and<00:01:24.290> this<00:01:24.770> one<00:01:24.950> has<00:01:25.070> three<00:01:25.630> so

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
one's for and this one has three so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.300 
one's for and this one has three so
that's<00:01:26.810> five<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:28.640> that's<00:01:28.850> five<00:01:31.270> sometimes<00:01:32.270> too
