00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.760
 dear tar it is now time to choose 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.680
 if the history of the it with ends 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.530
 here or if it will still continue 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.900
 indeterminate period of time we have 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.360
 been working on this for nine 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.599
 years and we are not willing to leave it 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.029
 even nightwish is a way of life something 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.300
 so live and we are convinced 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.580
 of not leaving it is equally true that 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.369
 we can not continue with you and with marcelo 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.040
 longer during the last year has 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.680
 something sad happened something that has been 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.710
 present in my mind day and night every 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.100
 day your attitude and behavior no longer 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.150
 they have to do with the uis there 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.150
 characteristics that would never have 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.190
 thought to see in my dear old friend the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.310
 people who do not talk for a year with 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.650
 the others do not belong to the same band 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.840
 we are in an industry where the part 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.820
 of business is necessarily evil and 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.550
 something to worry all the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.860
 time we are a band that has always 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.780
 made music from the heart by the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.150
 friendship and the music itself 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.570
 mental satisfaction should be 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.840
 always more important than money 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.580
 nightwish is a band is an emotion 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.080
 for you 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.790
 unfortunately business money and the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.940
 things that have nothing to do with 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.619
 those emotions have become much more 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.390
 important you feel that you have 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.159
 sacrificed to you to your musical career 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.990
 by main guys 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.229
 instead of thinking what that has given you 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.450
 you showed me this attitude clearly with 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.000
 the two things you told me on an airplane 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.759
 in toronto I do not need nightwish anymore and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.280
 remember you or more I can leave the 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.850
 band at any time telling you what 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.350
 just a day before 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.960
 I really can not write more 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.600
 songs so that the cantes 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.690
 you have always said that you are simply 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.360
 a guest musician in it with now 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.020
 this visit ends and we will continue with 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.250
 the itunes with a new vocalist 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.670
 we are sure that it will be a great 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.080
 relief for both you and us 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.560
 we have all felt bad too 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.840
 time you told us what would happen 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.200
 will pass the next nightwish album 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.360
 would be the last one that would tax despite 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.660
 this the rest of us want 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.910
 continue while the flame burns so 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.510
 it does not make sense to make the next album 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.430
 with you the four of us have discussed this 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.410
 situation countless times and we have 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.140
 come to the conclusion that this is 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.660
 what we want to do in life is everything 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.600
 what we can do in December 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.570
 2004 in germany you said do not spin and 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.580
 you have more than two weeks you also said 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.980
 that we could forget about states 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.220
 united from america and australia because the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.770
 rooms were very small 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.890
 in interviews I said that if homework is 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.800
 would be the end of the band I understand 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.050
 that there will be people who think well nightwish 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.360
 is a representation of my soul and not 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.000
 I'm willing to let him go for a 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.790
 person a person who wants to focus 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.450
 your creativity elsewhere a person 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.400
 whose values do not match mine not 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.350
 we have been bothered by the fact 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.200
 that you do not want to participate in 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.240
 compose songs never in these nine 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.209
 years you came to try the songs 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.130
 before entering the study or the 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.850
 fact that while we were on tour 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.770
 you always wanted to fly without us 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.780
 accompanying your husband or the fact of 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.570
 that you are the indisputable image to 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.690
 front of the band we accepted it and what 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.320
 we understood everything except greed the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.090
 disdain the fans and break promises 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.130
 it was agreed between all that nightwish 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.790
 would be the priority in everything that 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.940
 we did during 2004 and 2005 there was 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.550
 most important things for you the last 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.040
 example is in the oslo concert with 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.080
 all tickets sold that you 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.209
 you wanted to cancel because you needed 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.630
 Make your dates solo 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.459
 meet with friends and go to the movies 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.470
 those were the words that marcelo 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.940
 I use in the email explaining the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.580
 cancellation 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.700
 this has been just one example of many 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.380
 they could not think of a worse way to be 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.830
 selfish and upset our 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.630
 followers 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.210
 nightwish is a way of life and a job 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.910
 with many obligations to us and 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.160
 with the followers with you we could not 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.750
 take care of those duties for more 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.610
 weather 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.800
 we do not really know who of you 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.230
 it has led us to this situation 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.200
 somehow marcelo has changed you 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.480
 going from being an adorable girl to a 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.510
 diva who does not think or act like he used to 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.440
 do you are very sure of you and replace 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.080
 skill and status 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.870
 It is clear that you are to blame for your 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.700
 stress and your sorrows to the four of us and 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.030
 you think we do not respect you or 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.310
 we listen we think we've always had 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.130
 the greatest respect towards you as 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.080
 wonderful vocalist and friend and 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.330
 very often in the last two 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.510
 years the plans will be made according to your 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.310
 decisions were always the only one 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.650
 I wanted more concert money 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.570
 this attitude of compensation and more 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.680
 money for everything is what has most 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.509
 injured 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.240
 we wish that from now on 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.030
 listen to your heart instead of marcelo 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.430
 the cultural differences combined 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.820
 with greed opportunism and love is 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.010
 a dangerous combination 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.830
 this decision is not something that 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.590
 we are especially proud but not 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.140
 let us pick the separation between 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.480
 we are too big and the 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.180
 decision we made it between the four of 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.360
 unanimously we are beyond the 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.990
 point of fixing things talking the 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.800
 best wishes for your life and your career 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.800
 had more single comb
