00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
third side chairs are first second third

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.199 
third side chairs are first second third
and<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:55.400> same<00:02:55.580> with<00:02:55.730> stalls

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
and the same with stalls

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.080 
and the same with stalls
second<00:02:57.080> third<00:02:57.349> so<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.459> really<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.910> a

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
second third so it really is a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.750 
second third so it really is a
democratic<00:03:00.049> vote<00:03:00.349> as<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:00.860> taking<00:03:01.370> our

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
democratic vote as it's taking our

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.900 
democratic vote as it's taking our
Greenwood<00:03:02.569> workers<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.200> their<00:03:03.319> families

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
Greenwood workers and their families

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.210 
Greenwood workers and their families
scoring<00:03:04.910> on<00:03:05.030> their<00:03:05.269> sheets<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:06.380> then<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
scoring on their sheets and then the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.820 
scoring on their sheets and then the
marks<00:03:07.519> being<00:03:07.760> taught<00:03:08.060> adapt<00:03:08.349> so<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.380> think<00:03:09.709> it's

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
marks being taught adapt so I think it's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.770 
marks being taught adapt so I think it's
fair<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.099> say<00:03:10.190> there's<00:03:10.819> not<00:03:10.940> really<00:03:11.209> any<00:03:11.510> bars

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
fair to say there's not really any bars

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.039 
fair to say there's not really any bars
is<00:03:12.170> actually<00:03:12.650> being<00:03:13.310> judged<00:03:13.700> by<00:03:13.910> people<00:03:14.120> who

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
is actually being judged by people who

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.660 
is actually being judged by people who
probably<00:03:15.709> have<00:03:15.859> a<00:03:15.950> fair<00:03:16.220> bit<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.519> knowledge

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
probably have a fair bit of knowledge

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.849 
probably have a fair bit of knowledge
about<00:03:17.060> how<00:03:17.600> these<00:03:17.840> things<00:03:18.109> are<00:03:18.350> made<00:03:18.530> and

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
about how these things are made and

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.970 
about how these things are made and
what's<00:03:19.700> involved<00:03:20.500> which<00:03:21.500> i<00:03:21.620> think<00:03:21.680> is

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
what's involved which i think is

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.690 
what's involved which i think is
actually<00:03:22.370> quite<00:03:22.579> nice<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.940> healthy

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
actually quite nice and healthy

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.640 
actually quite nice and healthy

very nicely made

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.100 
very nicely made
bobak<00:04:29.169> Windsor<00:04:29.770> I<00:04:30.009> thought<00:04:30.849> it<00:04:31.030> was<00:04:31.120> very<00:04:31.150> very

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
bobak Windsor I thought it was very very

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.129 
bobak Windsor I thought it was very very
good<00:04:32.470> work<00:04:32.860> on<00:04:33.129> the<00:04:33.250> seat<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.930> made

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
good work on the seat and this is made

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.860 
good work on the seat and this is made
by<00:04:35.169> a<00:04:35.349> professional<00:04:35.560> chair<00:04:36.220> maker<00:04:36.629> and<00:04:37.629> I<00:04:37.720> mean

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
by a professional chair maker and I mean

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.499 
by a professional chair maker and I mean
the<00:04:37.960> quality<00:04:38.349> really<00:04:38.620> does<00:04:38.919> show<00:04:39.849> well<00:04:40.180> there

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
the quality really does show well there

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.330 
the quality really does show well there
this<00:04:43.509> one<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.780> thought<00:04:44.020> was<00:04:44.199> quite<00:04:45.009> a<00:04:45.129> clever

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
this one I thought was quite a clever

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.570 
this one I thought was quite a clever
design<00:04:45.699> bit<00:04:46.479> unusual<00:04:46.659> perhaps<00:04:47.470> maybe<00:04:48.069> quite

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
design bit unusual perhaps maybe quite

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.129 
design bit unusual perhaps maybe quite
modern<00:04:48.909> for<00:04:49.060> some<00:04:49.210> people's<00:04:49.569> tastes<00:04:49.960> I

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
modern for some people's tastes I

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.779 
modern for some people's tastes I
personally<00:04:50.919> liked<00:04:51.159> it<00:04:51.310> very<00:04:51.340> much<00:04:51.580> and

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
personally liked it very much and

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.659 
personally liked it very much and
thought<00:04:52.180> it<00:04:52.360> was<00:04:52.449> a<00:04:52.479> rather<00:04:53.110> clever<00:04:53.409> and<00:04:53.979> this

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
thought it was a rather clever and this

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.659 
thought it was a rather clever and this
was<00:04:54.879> awarded<00:04:55.389> third<00:04:55.630> place<00:04:56.340> there<00:04:57.340> really<00:04:57.460> was

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
was awarded third place there really was

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.189 
was awarded third place there really was
a<00:04:57.699> tough<00:04:57.970> competition<00:04:58.180> on<00:04:58.659> the<00:04:58.750> armchairs

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
a tough competition on the armchairs

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.050 
a tough competition on the armchairs
visee<00:04:59.620> yeah<00:05:00.039> and<00:05:00.220> I<00:05:00.280> think<00:05:00.460> these<00:05:00.550> people<00:05:00.789> did

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
visee yeah and I think these people did

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.149 
visee yeah and I think these people did
really<00:05:01.300> well<00:05:01.569> I<00:05:01.930> mean<00:05:02.530> there<00:05:02.800> are<00:05:02.860> some<00:05:02.919> other

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
really well I mean there are some other

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.399 
really well I mean there are some other
very<00:05:03.340> good<00:05:03.639> chairs<00:05:03.970> which<00:05:04.900> didn't<00:05:05.259> get

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
very good chairs which didn't get

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.920 
very good chairs which didn't get
placings<00:05:06.039> but<00:05:06.970> I'm<00:05:07.240> afraid<00:05:07.389> that's<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.780> way

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
placings but I'm afraid that's the way

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.450 
placings but I'm afraid that's the way
life<00:05:08.229> goes<00:05:10.139> this<00:05:11.139> is<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.409> side<00:05:12.130> share

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
life goes this is the side share

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.670 
life goes this is the side share
category<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:13.930> was<00:05:14.020> a<00:05:14.050> very<00:05:14.289> nice<00:05:14.440> little

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
category and that was a very nice little

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.070 
category and that was a very nice little
low<00:05:15.130> child<00:05:15.849> sideshow<00:05:16.599> beautifully<00:05:17.259> made<00:05:17.469> and

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
low child sideshow beautifully made and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.670 
low child sideshow beautifully made and
and<00:05:20.080> that's<00:05:20.259> the<00:05:20.380> second-place<00:05:20.680> chair<00:05:21.280> and

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
and that's the second-place chair and

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.649 
and that's the second-place chair and
this<00:05:23.680> one<00:05:23.889> quite<00:05:24.159> genius<00:05:24.370> is<00:05:24.849> the<00:05:25.030> third-place

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
this one quite genius is the third-place

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.230 
this one quite genius is the third-place
chair<00:05:26.080> but<00:05:26.830> it<00:05:26.979> used<00:05:27.219> to<00:05:27.340> wood-grained<00:05:27.819> very

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
chair but it used to wood-grained very

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.860 
chair but it used to wood-grained very
good<00:05:28.419> effect<00:05:28.719> on<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.050> slats<00:05:30.690> we're<00:05:31.690> now<00:05:31.810> to

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
good effect on the slats we're now to

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.649 
good effect on the slats we're now to
distill<00:05:32.349> class<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.940> think<00:05:34.240> this<00:05:34.479> was<00:05:34.630> a

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
distill class and I think this was a

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.709 
distill class and I think this was a
very<00:05:34.870> worthy<00:05:35.229> winner<00:05:35.710> indeed<00:05:36.159> it's<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.669> vase<00:05:37.599> of

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719
