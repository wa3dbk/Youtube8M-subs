00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.309
 Hello, let's go to this video to give 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.650
 Thanks to our suppliers 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.559
 material 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.720
 to explain a little the different material 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.490
 what can we get 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.140
 The barnacle fishes in our friend Miguel 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.450
 of colony 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.910
 we have cages on frames to put 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.210
 to the queen once it's going to start 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.230
 his stance 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 Marking piston to mark the queen 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.230
 we put the queen and then with the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.260
 marker pen 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.000
 in this case in 2014 it is green 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.000
 we would paint the queen 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.200
 picking to move 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.560
 wire tensioner for paintings 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.950
 Very useful four discs 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.370
 positions for baby nuclei or cores 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.380
 as now excluded from queen hole 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.530
 open for the departure of drones and 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.180
 others and one for transport and opaque 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.180
 also four positions 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.880
 I will also explain the bale cores and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.880
 how do they work 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.280
 this is a new baby 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.280
 of two queens 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.960
 with its feeders a feeder 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.070
 for each one for both liquid and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.070
 for solid 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:42.100
 and here we have processions one of them 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.100
 is to have two queens we have the separator 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.229
 and the pictures 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.190
 a separator that we can remove to 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.200
 make two queens or with the separator 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.810
 we removed it and we would have only one queen 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.720
 with much more breadth the peculiarity 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.030
 of this test is not this baby's core 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.190
 is that the boxes can be joined together 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.990
 Once we have breeding and food in the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.610
 four boxes or two if there are two 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.610
 we can unite queens 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.760
 with cables and we can pass them like this 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.340
 we can join them to form 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.340
 so a full picture langstrump 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.130
 we have it first what we can do 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.020
 is to stretch it first in a core of the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.600
 we put it in and once 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.060
 let's have in the upper chamber once 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.310
 that the queen climbs and has postures in 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.310
 any of them we can separate it 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.160
 we can separate them and put it and if 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.200
 we want a single queen we would have 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.170
 four frames and if we had two 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.510
 queens we could use the separator 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.129
 since he has an entrance on this side 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.129
 and another on the other
