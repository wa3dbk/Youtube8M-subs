00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Today I want a new charger 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.030
 imagine extra and that the vp 2 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.559
 So do not be the vp once right 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.940
 similar is our best at the moment 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.630
 charger because of the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.869
 digital display the v2 I'll stop here 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.720
 the word p1 just misses 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.279
 this is svp deployment planning that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:37.739
 a little bigger is the vp 22 p2 so can 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.890
 once 26 50 years in 2 pieces 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.190
 load at the same time and still has one 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:51.930
 output for 5 volt usb output as well 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.989
 Can you do that because that is not 32 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.180
 Load 36 volts of 38 volts 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.629
 that means again clearly here 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.860
 said 38 volts then gives an output 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.530
 of 4.3 volt charge voltage 3.5 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 volt gives a dali termination voltage of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.420
 42 want these are the usual 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 have activated 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.330
 and 32 gives a charge voltage 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.040
 I do not think 3.6 volt times the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.860
 but plays in the documents or 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 indoors 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:33.210
 We'll do that once 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:36.299
 on the 36 volt at our normal 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.220
 The usual battery theoretically does his 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.659
 at 3.8 volts, I say now 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.710
 I'll just go from there 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:53.159
 because because you the battery of the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.119
 protected ag will and will support 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.439
 switch off at 4.2 forest itself where you 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.119
 be careful when unprotected 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.659
 Battery is then you really nothing 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.759
 happen 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.680
 paco is probably going relatively fast 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.460
 broken if you have too much electricity 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.869
 is loaded 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.910
 So we could be here for example now 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:28.500
 left to do a 16 43 years old purely 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:30.599
 tour happening now recognized the shows 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.239
 in short, how much voltaire has and starts 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.930
 to load 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.300
 Incidentally, here I can choose the current 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.349
 that's just us both alike so if 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.480
 I am now on the one hand to 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.540
 little rheintor on the in the big ones 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.720
 then I would load a maximum of 0 5 with courage 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.959
 and he wants it pretty loaded 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:00.750
 na good showing me shows threatens 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:04.290
 and load again now so that's 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.810
 in principle who the vp 1 he needs him 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.720
 to annoy 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:15.140
 So I think you can be good to me as well 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.930
 You can also do some tricks in 16 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:23.450
 26 650 battery in a vp load a slider 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.360
 because of the problem that the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.870
 behind contact and front contact gets 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.129
 It's a bit harder then 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.700
 but definitely a very good one again 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:41.549
 good camp of exter and here 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.690
 are just a few newer loader 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.549
 I prepared the same again 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.280
 imagine going I had 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.739
 presented the rc1 the promise of 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.159
 I like it pronounced 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.099
 to 26 650 and small of course only with 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.160
 a current and with usb so on 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.810
 wonderful travel loader 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.810
 in the c1 of xt
