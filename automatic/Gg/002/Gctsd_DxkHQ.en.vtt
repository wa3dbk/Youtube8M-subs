souls is actually located next to
juggernog<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.430> is<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.820> generator<00:01:13.240> station

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
juggernog this is the generator station

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.620 
juggernog this is the generator station
for<00:01:14.020> so<00:01:14.619> go<00:01:14.890> ahead<00:01:15.009> travel<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.549> that<00:01:15.700> area<00:01:15.880> Kiln

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630
