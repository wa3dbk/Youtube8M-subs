going to show you why you should be

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.189 
going to show you why you should be
using<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> Continental<00:00:23.820> grip<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:25.109> you

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
using the Continental grip now when you

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.990 
using the Continental grip now when you
start<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.920> times<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.430> easy<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.789> use

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
start out a lot of times as easy to use

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
start out a lot of times as easy to use
what<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.330> call<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.599> frying-pan<00:00:28.019> grip<00:00:28.710> which

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
what we call the frying-pan grip which

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.040 
what we call the frying-pan grip which
is<00:00:29.189> closer<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.789> an<00:00:29.910> Eastern<00:00:30.359> forehand<00:00:30.689> grip

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
is closer to an Eastern forehand grip

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.380 
is closer to an Eastern forehand grip
and<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.769> great<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> start<00:00:32.189> off<00:00:32.489> because<00:00:33.059> when

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and it's great to start off because when

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
and it's great to start off because when
you<00:00:33.480> think<00:00:33.660> about<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.620> grip<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> serve

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you think about it the grip on the serve

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.040 
you think about it the grip on the serve
is<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.700> necessarily<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.420> most<00:00:36.510> natural

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
is not necessarily the most natural

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020 
is not necessarily the most natural
thing<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> start<00:00:38.129> advancing<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.969> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
thing but as you start advancing and you

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
thing but as you start advancing and you
want<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> create<00:00:39.450> more<00:00:39.629> power<00:00:39.960> spin<00:00:40.500> accuracy

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
want to create more power spin accuracy

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.470 
want to create more power spin accuracy
on<00:00:41.219> your<00:00:41.370> serve<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.910> need<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.180> start<00:00:42.390> thinking

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
on your serve you need to start thinking

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.580 
on your serve you need to start thinking
about<00:00:42.719> switching<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.230> grip<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
about switching that grip to a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
about switching that grip to a
continental<00:00:44.219> grip<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.969> first<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.390> why<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
continental grip so first of all why is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
continental grip so first of all why is
the<00:00:46.500> Continental<00:00:47.129> grip<00:00:47.160> important<00:00:47.730> why<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the Continental grip important why is it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
the Continental grip important why is it
more<00:00:48.539> important<00:00:48.899> than<00:00:48.930> using<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> frying-pan

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
more important than using the frying-pan

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.380 
more important than using the frying-pan
grip<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> might<00:00:50.789> already<00:00:50.969> be<00:00:51.120> using

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
grip that you might already be using

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.569 
grip that you might already be using
first<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.440> when<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.250> content

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
first of all when you have the content

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.889 
first of all when you have the content
of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> grip<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> allows<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> add<00:00:54.660> more

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
of the grip it allows you to add more

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.619 
of the grip it allows you to add more
spin<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> ball<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.550> why<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.789> adding<00:00:57.390> spin

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
spin to the ball so why is adding spin

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
spin to the ball so why is adding spin
to<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> ball<00:00:58.230> important<00:00:58.710> well<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.670> can

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to the ball important well if you can

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
to the ball important well if you can
add<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.239> spin<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.079> also<00:01:01.320> add<00:01:01.710> some<00:01:01.739> more

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
add more spin we can also add some more

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.549 
add more spin we can also add some more
power<00:01:02.430> because<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.030> control<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
power because we can control it now the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.440 
power because we can control it now the
reason<00:01:04.890> why<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.280> you're<00:01:05.519> using<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.820> pancake

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
reason why if you're using a pancake

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
reason why if you're using a pancake
grip<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> Eastern<00:01:07.619> forehand<00:01:07.830> grip<00:01:08.040> for

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
grip or the Eastern forehand grip for

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.219 
grip or the Eastern forehand grip for
your<00:01:08.250> serve<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.909> limits<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.659> serve<00:01:09.900> because

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
your serve it limits your serve because

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
your serve it limits your serve because
it<00:01:10.439> limits<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.010> amount<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.369> topspin<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it limits the amount of topspin that you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
it limits the amount of topspin that you
can<00:01:12.659> put<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> ball<00:01:13.170> which<00:01:13.740> means<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.159> can

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
can put on the ball which means you can

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.980 
can put on the ball which means you can
only<00:01:14.430> hit<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> ball<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.360> hard<00:01:15.540> before<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
only hit the ball so hard before the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.320 
only hit the ball so hard before the
ball<00:01:16.140> sails<00:01:16.439> long<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> content

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
ball sails long so what is the content

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
ball sails long so what is the content
of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> grip<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.259> Continental<00:01:19.860> grip<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
of the grip the Continental grip is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.350 
of the grip the Continental grip is
where<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> hold<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> racket<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.090> front

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
where you hold the racket out in front

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.950 
where you hold the racket out in front
and<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.810> grab<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:23.009> top<00:01:23.310> pad<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and you grab it with your top pad on the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.969 
and you grab it with your top pad on the
top<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.040> second<00:01:26.610> bevel<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:28.560> hold<00:01:28.829> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
top of the second bevel and you hold it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.370 
top of the second bevel and you hold it
with<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.520> knuckles<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.840> across<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
with your knuckles going across the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
with your knuckles going across the
racket<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.950> great<00:01:32.790> way<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.060> find<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.780> you're

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
racket a great way to find out if you're

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
racket a great way to find out if you're

using the content of the grip the
correct<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.619> contact<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.340> when<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.820> go

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
correct way at contact is when we go

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.160 
correct way at contact is when we go
through<00:01:54.180> our<00:01:54.210> motion<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> Continental

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
grip and we go up to hit it what you're

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.459 
grip and we go up to hit it what you're
going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> notice<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.079> you're<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> have

this flat part of your wrist if you're

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.480 
this flat part of your wrist if you're
using<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.590> incorrect<00:02:01.979> grip<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
using the incorrect grip like the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
using the incorrect grip like the
pancake<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.210> you're<00:02:03.689> trying<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.110> up

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
pancake and you're trying to go up

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.420 
pancake and you're trying to go up
you're<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> notice<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.189> wrist

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
you're going to notice this wrist

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.449 
you're going to notice this wrist
buckles<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.390> pops<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.649> don't<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
buckles and pops up you don't want that

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.850 
buckles and pops up you don't want that
now<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> advantage<00:02:09.929> again<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.709> we're

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
now the advantage again because we're

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.140 
now the advantage again because we're
using<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.129> content<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> grip<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.910> allows

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
using that content on the grip it allows

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.730 
using that content on the grip it allows
me<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.450> go<00:02:12.540> up<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.080> run

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
me to go up and run

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
me to go up and run
the<00:02:14.010> ball<00:02:14.220> which<00:02:14.820> means<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.330> also<00:02:15.480> add<00:02:15.750> more

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
the ball which means I can also add more

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.440 
the ball which means I can also add more
powering<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> swing<00:02:16.950> harder<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.270> use

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
powering and swing harder and I can use

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.790 
powering and swing harder and I can use
the<00:02:18.600> spin<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.930> control<00:02:19.290> where<00:02:19.440> I'm<00:02:19.530> putting

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
the spin to control where I'm putting

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.740 
the spin to control where I'm putting
the<00:02:19.890> ball<00:02:20.040> versus<00:02:20.910> when<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.330> go<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.570> with<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the ball versus when we go up with a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.990 
the ball versus when we go up with a
pancake<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.830> notice<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.280> can't<00:02:23.670> really<00:02:23.790> go

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
pancake if you notice I can't really go

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.210 
pancake if you notice I can't really go
up<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.870> much<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> ball<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:26.010> very

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
up that much on the ball it's very

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.640 
up that much on the ball it's very
limiting<00:02:26.670> how<00:02:27.060> much<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.840> allows<00:02:28.140> me<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.380> push

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
limiting how much it allows me to push

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.200 
limiting how much it allows me to push
up<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.130> ball<00:02:29.250> compared<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.880> content

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
up on the ball compared to the content

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.450 
up on the ball compared to the content
of<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> grip<00:02:30.540> now<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:31.380> hit<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.770> lot<00:02:32.250> more

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
of the grip now I can hit a lot more

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.130 
of the grip now I can hit a lot more
spin<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.910> ball<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.510> allows<00:02:33.780> me<00:02:33.990> it

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
spin on the ball this allows me it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.460 
spin on the ball this allows me it
serves<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.620> kicks<00:02:35.210> slices<00:02:36.210> even<00:02:37.140> adding

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
serves like kicks slices even adding

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.620 
serves like kicks slices even adding
more<00:02:37.740> spin<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.340> my<00:02:38.490> flat<00:02:38.850> serve<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.570> hit

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
more spin to my flat serve so I can hit

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.430 
more spin to my flat serve so I can hit
it<00:02:39.750> harder<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.200> more<00:02:40.310> consistent<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
it harder and more consistent so the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.960 
it harder and more consistent so the
biggest<00:02:43.650> thing<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.980> want<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.220> know<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.490> hey

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
biggest thing you want to know if hey

biggest thing you want to know if hey
you<00:02:45.030> know<00:02:45.330> I'm<00:02:45.420> using<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.750> pancake<00:02:46.020> grip<00:02:46.350> I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
you know I'm using this pancake grip I

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.140 
you know I'm using this pancake grip I
want<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.860> switch<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.340> Continental<00:02:48.120> grip

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
want to switch to the Continental grip

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.070 
want to switch to the Continental grip
what<00:02:48.630> do<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.780> do

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
what do I do

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020

so<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:49.620> we're<00:02:49.770> making<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.250> switch<00:02:50.520> from<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
so if we're making the switch from the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.270 
so if we're making the switch from the
pancake<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.080> Continental<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.980> first

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
pancake to the Continental the first

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.800 
pancake to the Continental the first
thing<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.580> got<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.820> understand<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.420> your

thing you got to understand is your

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.380 
thing you got to understand is your
swing<00:02:55.110> path<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.680> different<00:02:56.070> if<00:02:56.730> you're<00:02:57.120> used

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
swing path is different if you're used

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.820 
swing path is different if you're used
to<00:02:57.570> hitting<00:02:57.780> with<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.080> pancake<00:02:58.500> your<00:02:58.620> swing

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
to hitting with the pancake your swing

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.260 
to hitting with the pancake your swing
path<00:02:59.070> or<00:02:59.370> what<00:02:59.910> I<00:02:59.940> mean

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
path or what I mean

the path of the racket is going straight

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.000 
the path of the racket is going straight
so<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:03.960> see<00:03:04.080> I'm<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.470> straight<00:03:04.740> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
so you can see I'm going straight and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.670 
so you can see I'm going straight and
this<00:03:05.580> opens<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.270> racket<00:03:06.630> face<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
this opens up the racket face so the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.770 
this opens up the racket face so the
ball<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.160> go<00:03:08.190> where<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.940> rackets<00:03:09.330> telling<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
ball can go where the rackets telling it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.260 
ball can go where the rackets telling it
the<00:03:10.530> difference<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.130> with<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.610> continental

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
the difference is with a continental

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.930 
the difference is with a continental
grip<00:03:12.300> my<00:03:12.930> path<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:14.100> my<00:03:14.220> racket<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.610> going<00:03:14.880> to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
grip my path of my racket is going to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.090 
grip my path of my racket is going to
come<00:03:15.180> at<00:03:15.420> an<00:03:15.780> angle<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.680> notice<00:03:16.920> where<00:03:17.040> I'm

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
come at an angle if you notice where I'm

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.710 
come at an angle if you notice where I'm
swinging<00:03:17.490> it's<00:03:17.850> almost<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.300> if<00:03:18.450> I'm<00:03:18.570> looking

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
swinging it's almost like if I'm looking

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.210 
swinging it's almost like if I'm looking
in<00:03:18.960> this<00:03:19.110> direction<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.740> I'm<00:03:20.040> going<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
in this direction and I'm going to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.510 
in this direction and I'm going to
tomahawk<00:03:20.760> chop<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:22.080> racket<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.590> way<00:03:22.770> the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
tomahawk chop the racket this way the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.150 
tomahawk chop the racket this way the
key<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:24.030> when<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.420> do<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
key is when you do this is that the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.040 
key is when you do this is that the
strings<00:03:26.550> have<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.420> look<00:03:27.570> where<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> want<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
strings have to look where you want the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.460 
strings have to look where you want the
ball<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.260> go<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.740> know<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.310> lot<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:30.170> my<00:03:31.170> players

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
ball to go I know a lot of my players

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.170 
ball to go I know a lot of my players
have<00:03:31.770> tried<00:03:32.160> making<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.700> switch<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
have tried making the switch and the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.310 
have tried making the switch and the
first<00:03:33.420> thing<00:03:33.600> they<00:03:33.690> do<00:03:33.750> when<00:03:33.870> they<00:03:34.080> go<00:03:34.200> up<00:03:34.290> to

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
first thing they do when they go up to

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.410 
first thing they do when they go up to
the<00:03:34.410> line<00:03:34.560> they<00:03:34.740> try<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.220> they<00:03:36.030> go<00:03:36.210> through

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
the line they try it and they go through

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.970 
the line they try it and they go through
the<00:03:36.510> serve<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.990> they<00:03:37.290> try<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.530> hit<00:03:37.710> it<00:03:37.740> what

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
the serve and they try to hit it what

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.950 
the serve and they try to hit it what
happens<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.610> ball<00:03:38.760> veers<00:03:39.240> off<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.690> court

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
happens is the ball veers off the court

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.320 
happens is the ball veers off the court
because<00:03:40.560> even<00:03:41.430> though<00:03:41.520> they<00:03:41.670> switch<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.120> grip

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
because even though they switch the grip

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.300 
because even though they switch the grip
now<00:03:42.360> from<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.930> pancake<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.710> Continental

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
now from the pancake to the Continental

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.680 
now from the pancake to the Continental
look<00:03:44.730> what<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.000> strings<00:03:45.240> have<00:03:45.390> done<00:03:45.540> is

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
look what the strings have done is

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.480 
look what the strings have done is
closed<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.470> racket<00:03:46.830> face<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.010> aiming<00:03:47.460> that

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
closed the racket face is aiming that

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.880 
closed the racket face is aiming that
way<00:03:47.790> off<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.480> court<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.320> what<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.770> to

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
people having trouble with is that when

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.030 
people having trouble with is that when
they're<00:04:12.630> making<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.020> switch<00:04:13.260> when<00:04:13.740> they<00:04:13.860> go

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
they're making the switch when they go

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.710 
they're making the switch when they go
through<00:04:14.280> their<00:04:14.400> motion<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.820> lot<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.000> times<00:04:15.300> what

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
through their motion a lot of times what

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.240 
through their motion a lot of times what
you<00:04:15.870> see<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.140> they<00:04:16.410> go<00:04:16.590> through<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.890> motion

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
you see is they go through the motion

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.099 
you see is they go through the motion
and<00:04:17.400> then<00:04:17.609> they<00:04:17.730> switch<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.330> grip<00:04:18.480> back<00:04:18.900> to

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
and then they switch the grip back to

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.300 
and then they switch the grip back to
their<00:04:19.260> old<00:04:19.410> grip<00:04:19.770> because<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.160> feels

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
comfortable now like you know I just

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.570 
comfortable now like you know I just
can't<00:04:22.290> get<00:04:22.440> around<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:23.040> go<00:04:23.370> through<00:04:23.550> my

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
can't get around it I go through my

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.120 
can't get around it I go through my
motion<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.480> switches<00:04:24.720> back<00:04:25.020> one<00:04:25.830> great

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
motion and it switches back one great

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.560 
motion and it switches back one great
tool<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.430> can<00:04:26.580> use<00:04:26.640> as<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> pen<00:04:27.270> or

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
notice that actually it's a lot harder

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.620 
notice that actually it's a lot harder
just<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.640> move<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:44.880> because<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.240> have<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.390> pen

there so what it does is it makes you

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.800 
there so what it does is it makes you
keep<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.760> grip<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.180> if<00:04:48.270> you're<00:04:48.450> struggling
