most of us have always been taught to

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.309 
most of us have always been taught to
believe<00:00:02.429> that<00:00:02.850> high<00:00:03.120> GPA<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:03.780> test<00:00:03.870> scores

believe that high GPA and test scores
are<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.680> criteria<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:05.520> need<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.910> get<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.180> a

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
are the criteria we need to get in a

are the criteria we need to get in a
graduate<00:00:06.690> school<00:00:06.990> but<00:00:07.290> these<00:00:07.830> days<00:00:08.040> are

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
graduate school but these days are

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.250 
graduate school but these days are
starting<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.580> look<00:00:08.730> at<00:00:08.880> other<00:00:09.000> factors<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:10.110> why

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
starting to look at other factors so why

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140 
starting to look at other factors so why
the<00:00:10.320> change<00:00:10.440> well<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.580> has<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.759> do<00:00:11.969> with<00:00:12.059> a

process well for admissions purposes it

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.590 
process well for admissions purposes it
means<00:00:40.680> academic<00:00:41.399> character<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.000> becoming<00:00:42.390> the

so now that we know what academic

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.660 
so now that we know what academic
character<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.470> how<00:01:27.860> do<00:01:27.920> we<00:01:28.009> show<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.369> on<00:01:28.610> the

statement of purpose comes in so that

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.210
