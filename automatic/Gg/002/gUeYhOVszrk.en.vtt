00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.910
 what's up everybody talks to brand next 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.280
 and a guys welcome to an episode 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.920
 more of the best class so 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.510
 guys this time there was not a tie 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.580
 between dcr 50 and p 57 double as 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.640
 can see in the comment of the time 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.710
 of 0 50 wish that only 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.250
 want this snyder to see how it is 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.670
 they gave me and good in the double p 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.620
 double 57 say we had 28 more likes 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.450
 two of another comment plus many 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.010
 comments like but a few guys before 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.530
 to start with this episode cree 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.500
 tell them that these classes and these videos 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.140
 I do them to help them, I do not want to 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.789
 prove neither what a super good game nor what 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.660
 I am very good at all weapons 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.020
 nothing more 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.670
 let's say it has always been my goal 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.129
 make these videos to help them and not 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.079
 for something else so also our 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.699
 why I did not choose to be 50 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.920
 because I thought it was super absurd that nothing 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.110
 more so they wanted to see how I was 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.860
 they gave the sniper a class 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.980
 for that is night 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.930
 so good the support of the 57 guys 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.960
 as you can see here we have it in 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.310
 screen and these musicians want to see the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.560
 better in a better way I have left you 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.630
 a link in the description where they can 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.520
 see the class in a better way ac with 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.729
 the boys as you can see we take it 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.920
 with silencer and unsheathed more than 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.440
 nothing the muffler is due to the great 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.060
 recoil that this weapon has already know 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.510
 that since he started then 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.580
 unfortunately they removed him very much 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.830
 rather they raised the recoil of 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.690
 an incredible way and I believe that a 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.880
 great way to let's say control this 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.530
 is the silencer , however, 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.479
 obviously it will be impossible to kill 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.340
 ahmed and good not to medium so but to 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.290
 long distance is going to be pretty 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.970
 difficult to kill with this one with the 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.500
 silencer plus that's pretty 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.020
 imprecise for all that was the moved 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 and as you can see unsheathed that 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.920
 basically because it's a submachine gun and 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.200
 we need to react very very fast 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.390
 so how is it in the unsheathed or the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.890
 quick drop will help us to aim for 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.229
 a much faster way and then have 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.640
 an advantage over the enemy and good 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.000
 as you can see guys I have not put him 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.280
 neither enlarged chargers nor fassmer 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.620
 or fast creators and that's basically 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.790
 because I've noticed that this weapon recharges 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.610
 very very fast 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.020
 let's say obviously with the race 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.060
 pro is going to recharge much faster but 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.710
 let's say it's not so necessary and the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.530
 loaders extended the truth is me 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.940
 makes too many bullets and as I have already 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.310
 said by decade very fast so I think 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.040
 which is a bit necessary in the advantage 1 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.650
 as you can see we took a wildcard 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.720
 of the double advantage that is basically 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.980
 bulletproof vest and hard line but 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.850
 it's already guys that this is basically 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.790
 to get high gusts and survive 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.560
 but let's say you can choose to preside 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.480
 of one of those two and put on weight 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.220
 light that also goes very well but in 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.500
 my case I like to take out more high gusts 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.670
 as you can see in the gameplay and it is 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.620
 basically because of what I wear online 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.410
 hard in the lead two guys here 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.930
 we carry scavenger let's say maybe 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.790
 it can also go well hard however 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.560
 the truth is that it does not move too much 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.989
 when you shoot this hoop with this 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.390
 weapon so I opted to put nothing else 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.520
 scavenger and the truth is very good 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.830
 let's say you're never going to be left without 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.300
 bullets with scavenger disk on the pvd 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.160
 57 and 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.430
 of advantage 3 as you can see mask 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.490
 tactic and that's basically because it's 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.440
 a sub-machine gun let's say you're going to have 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.120
 a lot of melee combat so 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.550
 which is highly recommended that is mask 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.150
 tactics let's say it could also be 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.010
 good dexterity but the truth is that 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.390
 Tactical mask is going much better on me 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.890
 all for the grenades and those that you 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.870
 they throw in these move very fast 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.930
 so I have commented on the combat 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.030
 body to body of lethal c4 as always 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.780
 is the best the best best equipment 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.920
 lethal and tactical the pomegranate of pm goes 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.410
 very good especially to do 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.030
 many points goes excellent so 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.790
 well nothing guys this is basically the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.320
 class remember that you can not let 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.350
 your suggestions for the next 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.640
 episode I already tell you guys who are 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.110
 comments because they really want 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.640
 know not because they want to see us 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.070
 how to greet them knight because the truth 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.680
 it's not the purpose of being let's say series 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.850
 so for guys to comment to those who 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.840
 comment action what weapon they 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.570
 like to see for the next episode 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.700
