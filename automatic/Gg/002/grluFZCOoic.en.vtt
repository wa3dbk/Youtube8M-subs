the<00:02:15.260> elevator<00:02:15.680> rods<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.460> was<00:02:16.640> actually

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
the elevator rods I was actually

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.400 
the elevator rods I was actually
thinking<00:02:17.030> about<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.810> morning<00:02:17.870> I

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
thinking about that this morning I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.510 
thinking about that this morning I
probably<00:02:19.130> spent<00:02:19.760> about<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:21.290> day<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.130> my<00:02:22.280> life

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
probably spent about a day of my life

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.340 
probably spent about a day of my life
now<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:23.000> an<00:02:23.090> elevator<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.870> after<00:02:24.170> one

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
now in an elevator just after one

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.530 
now in an elevator just after one
semester<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:26.030> don't<00:02:26.120> think<00:02:26.240> that's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
semester and I really don't think that's

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.350 
semester and I really don't think that's
an<00:02:26.690> exaggeration

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
an exaggeration

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.660 
an exaggeration
I'd<00:02:29.360> say<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.810> rooms<00:02:30.050> are<00:02:30.230> kind<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.440> small<00:02:30.670> so

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
I'd say the rooms are kind of small so

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.280 
I'd say the rooms are kind of small so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
like to move in something a little

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.370 
like to move in something a little
