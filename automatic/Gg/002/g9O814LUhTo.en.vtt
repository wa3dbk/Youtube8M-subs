so<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> nut<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.880> big<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.570> top<00:00:30.869> where

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
so the nut is the big at the top where

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.130 
so the nut is the big at the top where
where<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.210> where<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> sort<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.079> the

where the the where the sort of the
fingerboard<00:00:34.469> ends<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.219> then<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.399> goes<00:00:35.550> into

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
fingerboard ends and then it goes into

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880 
fingerboard ends and then it goes into
the<00:00:36.180> sort<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.899> hole<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.410> neck<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the sort of the hole or the neck of a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.040 
the sort of the hole or the neck of a
violin<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.329> where<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
violin but you can see where it's a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.650 
violin but you can see where it's a
little<00:00:40.140> bit<00:00:40.290> rigid<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.820> easy<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.300> explain

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
little bit rigid so just easy to explain

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.790 
little bit rigid so just easy to explain
your<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.110> look<00:00:43.290> you're<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> be

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
your you look you're going to be

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.010 
your you look you're going to be
measuring<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.460> from<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> part<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.690> so

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
measuring from from that part there so

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.260 
measuring from from that part there so
you're<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.399> not<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.000> from<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you're not it's not going to be from the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.459 
you're not it's not going to be from the
top<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.200> from<00:00:49.379> this

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
top here but it's going to be from this

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
top here but it's going to be from this
bit<00:00:49.680> underneath<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.370> imagine<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> top<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
bit underneath I imagine the the top of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.950 
bit underneath I imagine the the top of
my<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.260> top<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.739> ruler<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
my the top of my ruler here then it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.920 
my the top of my ruler here then it
would<00:00:55.199> start<00:00:55.530> from<00:00:55.829> from<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.940> line<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
would start from from the line that you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.869 
would start from from the line that you
get<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.309> where<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
get there so not up here where the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389 
get there so not up here where the
finger<00:01:00.180> board<00:01:00.329> properly<00:01:00.809> ends<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.309> from

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
finger board properly ends but just from

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.850 
finger board properly ends but just from
that<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.820> notch<00:01:03.149> underneath<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that little notch underneath that so you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.980 
that little notch underneath that so you
going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.869> where

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
going to be here not up here but where

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
going to be here not up here but where
the<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.260> notches<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.189> where<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> put<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the little notches so where you put the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
the little notches so where you put the
first<00:01:09.180> dot<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:10.340> 36<00:01:11.340> millimeters<00:01:12.299> from<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
first dot is 36 millimeters from the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
first dot is 36 millimeters from the
from<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> place<00:01:14.580> where<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.939> showed<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.420> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
from the place where I showed you so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.240 
from the place where I showed you so
what<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.380> you'll<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:16.920> ruler

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
what you do is you'll get your ruler

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.060 
what you do is you'll get your ruler
you'll<00:01:17.520> measure<00:01:17.930> 36<00:01:18.930> millimeters<00:01:19.590> which<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
you'll measure 36 millimeters which is

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.789 
you'll measure 36 millimeters which is
three<00:01:20.310> point<00:01:20.610> six<00:01:20.850> centimeters<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.900> where

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
three point six centimeters and where

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
three point six centimeters and where
that<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> measures<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that well where that measures on the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
that well where that measures on the
violin<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.920> where<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.520> put<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> dot<00:01:27.090> so

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
violin is where you will put the dot so

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.350 
violin is where you will put the dot so
wherever<00:01:27.720> 36<00:01:28.759> millimeters<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:29.939> three<00:01:30.150> point

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
wherever 36 millimeters or three point

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
wherever 36 millimeters or three point
six<00:01:30.540> centimeters<00:01:30.780> measures<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.890> where<00:01:32.340> you're

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
six centimeters measures is where you're

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.760 
six centimeters measures is where you're
going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> put<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> middle<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.990> dot<00:01:34.200> don't

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
going to put the middle of the dot don't

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.670 
going to put the middle of the dot don't
sort<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.189> put<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:36.140> now<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> put<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
sort of put it now I kind of put it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
sort of put it now I kind of put it
above<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.790> bottom<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> dot<00:01:39.659> is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
above it so the bottom of the dot is

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.420 
above it so the bottom of the dot is
sitting<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.380> top<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> line<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> top<00:01:41.310> of

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
sitting on top of the line on the top of

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.770 
sitting on top of the line on the top of
the<00:01:41.490> dot<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> sitting<00:01:41.970> underneath<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the dot is sitting underneath the the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.980 
the dot is sitting underneath the the
line<00:01:43.710> where<00:01:43.979> where<00:01:44.310> 36<00:01:44.820> millimeters<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> but

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
line where where 36 millimeters is but

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
line where where 36 millimeters is but
so<00:01:46.200> 36<00:01:46.799> millimeters<00:01:47.340> he's<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.610> straight

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
so 36 millimeters he's going straight

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
so 36 millimeters he's going straight
the<00:01:48.299> way<00:01:48.450> through<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> middle<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> dot

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the way through the middle of the dot

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.910 
the way through the middle of the dot
next<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.970> second<00:01:51.360> dot<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.600> 68<00:01:52.140> millimeters<00:01:52.380> so

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
next the second dot is 68 millimeters so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
next the second dot is 68 millimeters so
six<00:01:53.220> point<00:01:53.460> eight<00:01:53.549> centimeters<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.899> that's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
six point eight centimeters so that's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.899 
six point eight centimeters so that's
for<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.439> second<00:01:55.829> finger<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> would<00:01:56.729> be

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
for the second finger so that would be

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.450 
for the second finger so that would be
there<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.020> want<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> put<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> third<00:01:58.860> dot<00:01:59.250> in

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
there if you want to put a third dot in

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.850 
there if you want to put a third dot in
that's<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.329> 82<00:02:00.990> millimeters<00:02:01.680> or

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that's going to be 82 millimeters or

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.130 
that's going to be 82 millimeters or
eight<00:02:02.040> point<00:02:02.340> two<00:02:02.430> centimeters<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> measure
