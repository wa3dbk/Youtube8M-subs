this<00:02:00.240> Razer<00:02:01.240> synapse<00:02:01.690> macro<00:02:02.440> so<00:02:02.770> when<00:02:03.550> you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
this Razer synapse macro so when you

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.550 
this Razer synapse macro so when you
play<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.850> game<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.120> involves<00:02:04.750> some<00:02:05.140> clicking

play a game that involves some clicking

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.750 
play a game that involves some clicking
you're<00:02:05.650> like<00:02:05.800> man<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.040> mean<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.370> have<00:02:06.550> an<00:02:06.610> auto

you're like man I mean I have an auto

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.760 
you're like man I mean I have an auto
clicker<00:02:07.120> oh<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.870> know<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.320> is<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.590> is

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
clicker oh I know this is this is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.350 
clicker oh I know this is this is
potentially<00:02:09.310> extremely<00:02:09.520> scummy<00:02:10.090> I

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
potentially extremely scummy I

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.900 
potentially extremely scummy I
understand<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.770> made<00:02:12.130> my<00:02:12.310> decision<00:02:12.370> to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
understand I have made my decision to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.760 
understand I have made my decision to
make<00:02:13.030> use<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.690> Razer<00:02:13.840> synapse<00:02:14.140> clicking

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
make use of the Razer synapse clicking

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.590 
make use of the Razer synapse clicking
thing<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.850> guys<00:02:15.970> don't<00:02:16.210> want<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.450> that's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
thing if you guys don't want to that's

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.840 
thing if you guys don't want to that's
completely<00:02:16.930> up<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.260> but<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:18.160> thought<00:02:18.640> maybe

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
completely up to you but I thought maybe

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.940 
completely up to you but I thought maybe
making<00:02:19.300> use<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.690> Razer<00:02:19.870> synapse<00:02:20.170> macro

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
making use of the Razer synapse macro

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.030 
making use of the Razer synapse macro
system<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.490> make<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> auto<00:02:22.030> clicker<00:02:22.420> for<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.750> is

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
system to make a auto clicker for you is

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.110 
system to make a auto clicker for you is
safer<00:02:24.040> than<00:02:24.160> trying<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.490> go<00:02:24.670> online<00:02:24.880> and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
safer than trying to go online and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.000 
safer than trying to go online and
downloading<00:02:25.750> some<00:02:25.930> auto<00:02:26.380> clicker<00:02:26.800> that's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
downloading some auto clicker that's

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.380 
downloading some auto clicker that's
going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.400> give<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.850> bunch<00:02:28.270> of

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
going to like give you a bunch of

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.290 
going to like give you a bunch of
viruses<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.200> install<00:02:30.040> Bing<00:02:30.460> and<00:02:31.150> all

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
viruses with you install Bing and all

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.110 
viruses with you install Bing and all
these<00:02:31.420> affordable<00:02:31.780> things<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.970> what<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
these affordable things so what the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.850 
these affordable things so what the
macro<00:02:34.510> looks<00:02:34.780> like<00:02:35.020> is<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.380> looks<00:02:35.530> like<00:02:35.680> this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
macro looks like is it looks like this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.160 
macro looks like is it looks like this
it's<00:02:36.610> gonna<00:02:36.790> click<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.420> bazillion<00:02:37.900> times

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
it's gonna click like a bazillion times

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.680 
it's gonna click like a bazillion times
for<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.830> does<00:02:39.070> sort<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.370> burst<00:02:39.760> okay<00:02:40.330> it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
for you it does sort of burst okay it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.150 
for you it does sort of burst okay it
gives<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.990> like<00:02:41.140> bursts<00:02:41.560> clicks<00:02:41.830> but<00:02:41.980> as<00:02:42.070> you

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
gives you like bursts clicks but as you

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.190 
gives you like bursts clicks but as you
can<00:02:42.280> see<00:02:42.490> I'm<00:02:42.700> actually<00:02:43.150> able<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.720> deal<00:02:43.990> damage

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
can see I'm actually able to deal damage

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.870 
can see I'm actually able to deal damage
to<00:02:44.500> these<00:02:44.590> moms<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.160> when<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.580> activate

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
to these moms and when I activate

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.740 
to these moms and when I activate
cooldowns<00:02:46.510> um<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.710> do<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:49.180> know<00:02:49.300> enough<00:02:49.720> to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
cooldowns um you do you know enough to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.440 
cooldowns um you do you know enough to
have<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.620> be<00:02:50.740> worth<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.340> thank<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.000> I'm

gonna<00:02:52.570> form<00:02:52.870> up<00:02:52.990> some<00:02:53.200> gold<00:02:53.410> about<00:02:53.650> 30<00:02:53.860> seconds

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
gonna form up some gold about 30 seconds

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.090 
gonna form up some gold about 30 seconds
but<00:02:54.430> how<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:55.720> thing<00:02:56.530> works

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
but how this thing works

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.380 
but how this thing works
is<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.520> just<00:02:57.610> go<00:02:57.820> into<00:02:58.000> your<00:02:58.090> Razer

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
is that you just go into your Razer

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.570 
is that you just go into your Razer
synapse<00:02:58.920> file<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.100> I'm<00:03:00.190> going<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.340> show<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.520> to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
synapse file and I'm going to show it to

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.380 
synapse file and I'm going to show it to
you<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:00.850> what's<00:03:01.030> like<00:03:01.090> what<00:03:01.300> on

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
you it's like what's like what on

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.390 
you it's like what's like what on
forever<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.920> do<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> couple

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
forever but you can do it a couple

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.680 
forever but you can do it a couple
different<00:03:03.489> ways<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.060> way<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.209> have<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.540> set

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
different ways the way I have this set

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.870 
different ways the way I have this set
right<00:03:04.870> now<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.350> have<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.860> point<00:03:06.430> zero

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
right now is I have it on a point zero

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.479 
right now is I have it on a point zero
zero<00:03:06.970> zero<00:03:07.480> one<00:03:07.780> second<00:03:08.290> delay<00:03:08.590> between<00:03:09.070> Mouse

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
zero zero one second delay between Mouse

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.850 
zero zero one second delay between Mouse
up<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.630> means<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.080> it's<00:03:11.650> going<00:03:11.800> to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
up so that means that it's going to

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.710 
up so that means that it's going to
register<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> click<00:03:12.670> every<00:03:13.060> point<00:03:13.360> zero<00:03:13.630> zero

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
register a click every point zero zero

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.900 
register a click every point zero zero
zero<00:03:14.200> one<00:03:14.350> seconds<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.130> may<00:03:15.459> lead<00:03:15.880> to

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
zero one seconds and that may lead to

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.479 
zero one seconds and that may lead to
this<00:03:16.270> sort<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.510> burst<00:03:16.900> look<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:17.920> maybe

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
this sort of burst look to it and maybe

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.770 
this sort of burst look to it and maybe
there<00:03:18.880> are<00:03:18.940> people<00:03:19.180> who<00:03:19.270> have<00:03:19.360> said<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.690> they

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
there are people who have said that they

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.870 
there are people who have said that they
have<00:03:19.810> gone<00:03:20.230> with<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.650> shorter<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.520> mean<00:03:21.850> a

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
have gone with a shorter I mean a

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.020 
have gone with a shorter I mean a
slightly<00:03:22.630> longer<00:03:23.140> cooldown<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:24.730> makes<00:03:24.880> it

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
slightly longer cooldown and it makes it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.699 
slightly longer cooldown and it makes it
behave<00:03:25.270> more<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:25.810> quick<00:03:26.020> storm<00:03:26.410> where<00:03:26.590> you

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
behave more like quick storm where you

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.190 
behave more like quick storm where you
can<00:03:26.860> see<00:03:27.100> every<00:03:27.310> click<00:03:27.520> like<00:03:28.270> that<00:03:28.450> but<00:03:28.930> for<00:03:29.080> me

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
can see every click like that but for me

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.720 
can see every click like that but for me

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
I have a normal mouse click this looks

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.050 
I have a normal mouse click this looks
like<00:04:08.570> as<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.840> can<00:04:08.930> see<00:04:09.170> left<00:04:09.380> foot<00:04:09.620> enough

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
like as you can see left foot enough

like as you can see left foot enough
want<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.180> point<00:04:11.420> one<00:04:11.690> second<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:11.990> land<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.320> how

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
want to point one second to land and how

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.320 
want to point one second to land and how
I<00:04:12.440> created<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.130> macro<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.640> I<00:04:13.820> guess<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.240> go

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
I created this macro is I guess you go

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.020 
I created this macro is I guess you go
to<00:04:14.390> new<00:04:14.650> go<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.740> macro<00:04:16.100> one<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:16.940> call

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
to new go to macro one you can call

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.090 
to new go to macro one you can call
whatever<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.420> want<00:04:17.630> now<00:04:18.049> for<00:04:18.410> this<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.980> can

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
whatever you want now for this you can

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.100 
whatever you want now for this you can
recorded<00:04:19.670> the<00:04:19.760> light<00:04:19.910> we<00:04:20.060> can<00:04:20.209> actually<00:04:20.330> spend

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
recorded the light we can actually spend

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.450 
recorded the light we can actually spend
yourself<00:04:21.200> clicking<00:04:21.709> but<00:04:22.130> you're<00:04:22.220> not<00:04:22.340> going

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
yourself clicking but you're not going

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.370 
yourself clicking but you're not going
to<00:04:22.520> be<00:04:22.610> nearly<00:04:22.790> as<00:04:22.880> fast<00:04:23.180> as<00:04:23.420> a<00:04:23.540> point<00:04:23.870> zero<00:04:24.170> one

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
to be nearly as fast as a point zero one

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.650 
to be nearly as fast as a point zero one
second<00:04:24.710> okay<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.160> how<00:04:25.670> I<00:04:25.700> did<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:26.300> point

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
second okay so how I did it is a point

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.550 
second okay so how I did it is a point
zero<00:04:26.900> one<00:04:27.140> second<00:04:27.440> away<00:04:29.830> one<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.100> then<00:04:31.640> as

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
zero one second away one and then as

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.470 
zero one second away one and then as
opposed<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.590> me<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:35.030> then<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.210> just<00:04:35.360> go<00:04:35.420> over

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
opposed to me and then you just go over

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.820 
opposed to me and then you just go over
here<00:04:35.570> eat<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.530> record<00:04:36.920> and<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.160> just<00:04:37.280> click

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
here eat a record and you just click

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.380 
here eat a record and you just click
you're<00:04:39.830> not<00:04:40.640> gonna<00:04:40.790> be<00:04:40.880> able<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.030> look<00:04:41.180> like<00:04:41.330> a

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
you're not gonna be able to look like a

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.670 
you're not gonna be able to look like a
hundred<00:04:41.660> million<00:04:41.810> times<00:04:41.930> we<00:04:42.230> Mabel<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.530> pick

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
hundred million times we Mabel to pick

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.420 
hundred million times we Mabel to pick
for<00:04:42.920> you<00:04:43.070> or<00:04:43.130> something

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
for you or something

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.070 
for you or something
so<00:04:43.610> going<00:04:44.210> plagues<00:04:44.480> many<00:04:44.570> times<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:44.930> feel

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
so going plagues many times you feel

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.950 
so going plagues many times you feel
like<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.560> then<00:04:46.430> stop<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.180> then<00:04:47.840> you'll

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
like it and then stop it and then you'll

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.510 
like it and then stop it and then you'll
have<00:04:48.050> your<00:04:48.110> macro<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.920> name<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.160> whatever<00:04:49.310> you

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
have your macro you name it whatever you

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.850 
have your macro you name it whatever you
want<00:04:49.760> in<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:50.870> case<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.260> have<00:04:51.470> my<00:04:51.590> other<00:04:51.680> one

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
want in this case I have my other one

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.500 
want in this case I have my other one
named<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.550> left<00:04:52.760> mouse<00:04:52.880> click<00:04:53.060> now<00:04:53.240> I<00:04:53.270> also

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
named the left mouse click now I also

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.330 
named the left mouse click now I also
made<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> macro<00:04:54.230> where<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.530> has<00:04:54.620> no<00:04:54.800> delay<00:04:55.100> and

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
made a macro where it has no delay and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.860 
made a macro where it has no delay and
it<00:04:55.760> seems<00:04:55.970> like<00:04:56.180> they<00:04:56.270> work<00:04:56.420> which<00:04:56.630> is<00:04:56.690> not<00:04:56.780> the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
it seems like they work which is not the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.410 
it seems like they work which is not the
