00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.180 
had to remove it I thought I could pin
it<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> tractor<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.930> was<00:02:47.190> too

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
it on the tractor but it was too

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.039 
it on the tractor but it was too
complicated<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.239> it's<00:02:49.360> just<00:02:49.629> going<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.870> go

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
complicated so it's just going to go

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.369 
complicated so it's just going to go
over<00:02:50.290> here<00:02:51.010> before<00:02:51.849> I<00:02:52.150> put<00:02:52.360> this<00:02:52.510> panel<00:02:53.049> up<00:02:53.200> I'm

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
over here before I put this panel up I'm

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.259 
over here before I put this panel up I'm
going<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.590> paint<00:02:53.920> all<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.430> bolts<00:02:54.790> with<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
green so they matched the panel so I've

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.509 
green so they matched the panel so I've
just<00:02:58.450> got<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.930> panel<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.530> all<00:02:59.830> the<00:03:00.099> bolts<00:03:00.370> are

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
just got that panel on all the bolts are

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.059 
just got that panel on all the bolts are
on<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.849> painted<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:02.170> at<00:03:02.349> this<00:03:02.470> point<00:03:02.769> I'm

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
on and painted so at this point I'm

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.110 
don't lose that next you should put a
block<00:04:59.660> in<00:04:59.870> right<00:05:00.020> here<00:05:00.550> just<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.730> support<00:05:02.030> the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
block in right here just to support the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.140 
block in right here just to support the
tractor<00:05:02.630> in<00:05:02.720> case<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.110> falls<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.970> now<00:05:04.970> while

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
tractor in case it falls and now while

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.580 
tractor in case it falls and now while
I've<00:05:05.270> got<00:05:05.450> this<00:05:05.630> apart<00:05:06.050> I'm<00:05:06.170> going<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.350> throw<00:05:06.560> a

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
I've got this apart I'm going to throw a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.930 
I've got this apart I'm going to throw a
bit<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:06.860> paint<00:05:07.070> in<00:05:07.280> right<00:05:07.430> here<00:05:07.610> where<00:05:07.850> I<00:05:07.880> can

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
bit of paint in right here where I can

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:18.550 
bit of paint in right here where I can
reach<00:05:08.390> when<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.930> wheel<00:05:09.080> was<00:05:09.110> on<00:05:17.530> anyway<00:05:18.530> so

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
reach when the wheel was on anyway so

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.170 
reach when the wheel was on anyway so
this<00:05:19.010> should<00:05:19.190> do<00:05:19.310> for<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.580> paint<00:05:19.850> now<00:05:20.090> I'm

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
this should do for the paint now I'm

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.870 
this should do for the paint now I'm
going<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.420> move<00:05:20.510> on<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.110> wheel<00:05:21.760> so<00:05:22.760> I'm

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
going to move on to the wheel so I'm

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.520 
going to move on to the wheel so I'm
just<00:05:23.000> going<00:05:23.150> to<00:05:23.210> sand<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.720> inside<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.230> the<00:05:24.350> rim

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
just going to sand the inside of the rim

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.670 
just going to sand the inside of the rim
with<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.920> 320<00:05:25.580> grit<00:05:25.760> sandpaper<00:05:29.230> will<00:05:30.230> rest<00:05:30.470> on

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
with the 320 grit sandpaper will rest on

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.350 
with the 320 grit sandpaper will rest on
the<00:05:30.830> rim<00:05:30.980> so<00:05:31.340> that'll<00:05:31.730> make<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.150> lot<00:05:32.330> easier

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
the rim so that'll make it a lot easier

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.140 
the rim so that'll make it a lot easier
so<00:05:33.110> I'm<00:05:33.230> just<00:05:33.470> really<00:05:33.890> sanding<00:05:34.640> it<00:05:34.790> to<00:05:34.970> give

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
so I'm just really sanding it to give

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.820 
so I'm just really sanding it to give
the<00:05:35.330> next<00:05:35.570> coat<00:05:35.750> of<00:05:35.840> paint<00:05:36.020> some<00:05:36.290> teeth<00:05:36.590> to

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
the next coat of paint some teeth to

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.010 
the next coat of paint some teeth to
grab<00:05:37.070> on<00:05:37.310> because<00:05:38.090> if<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.360> don't<00:05:38.510> stand<00:05:38.810> it

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
grab on because if you don't stand it

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.810 
grab on because if you don't stand it
it's<00:05:39.170> a<00:05:39.260> big<00:05:39.440> glossy<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.220> paint<00:05:40.520> could

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
it's a big glossy and the paint could

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.230 
it's a big glossy and the paint could
chip<00:05:41.090> away<00:05:41.120> later<00:05:41.840> on<00:05:45.340> so<00:05:46.340> just<00:05:46.670> a<00:05:46.760> quick<00:05:46.940> sand

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
chip away later on so just a quick sand

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.260 
chip away later on so just a quick sand
like<00:05:47.480> this<00:05:47.980> and<00:05:48.980> then<00:05:49.400> wake<00:05:49.640> it<00:05:49.820> off<00:05:49.970> and

rings on tight by moving the wheel back

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.110 
rings on tight by moving the wheel back
and<00:07:18.470> forth<00:07:19.180> and<00:07:20.180> that's<00:07:20.510> good<00:07:21.730> next<00:07:22.730> just<00:07:22.910> pop
