00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.920 
to 70s and it was pinpointing that 8
inches<00:04:40.580> deep<00:04:40.639> so<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.360> figured<00:04:41.600> I'd<00:04:41.690> dig<00:04:41.840> the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
inches deep so I figured I'd dig the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.810 
inches deep so I figured I'd dig the
hole<00:04:42.080> now<00:04:42.530> dug<00:04:42.710> down<00:04:42.860> about<00:04:43.039> 8<00:04:43.250> inches<00:04:43.430> and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
hole now dug down about 8 inches and

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.520 
hole now dug down about 8 inches and
when<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.449> got<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:44.720> out<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.930> hole<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.260> starts

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
when I got it out the hole it starts

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.010 
when I got it out the hole it starts
showing<00:04:45.710> up<00:04:45.889> good<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:47.180> check<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:47.720> out<00:04:47.840> it's

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
showing up good and check it out it's

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.159 
showing up good and check it out it's
right<00:04:48.199> there<00:04:48.699> it's<00:04:49.699> a<00:04:49.850> musket<00:04:50.180> ball<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:50.630> the

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
right there it's a musket ball and the

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.930 
right there it's a musket ball and the
reason<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.530> showed<00:04:51.710> up<00:04:51.800> like<00:04:51.919> iron<00:04:52.190> was

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
reason it showed up like iron was

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.450 
reason it showed up like iron was
because<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.389> was<00:04:53.510> deep<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.220> that's<00:04:55.220> pretty

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
because it was deep and that's pretty

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.040 
because it was deep and that's pretty
deep<00:04:55.639> for<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.910> small<00:04:56.120> coil<00:04:56.389> but<00:04:56.599> I<00:04:56.660> found<00:04:56.870> it
