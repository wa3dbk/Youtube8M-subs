showing the teens beforehand just

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.780 
showing the teens beforehand just
because<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.760> how<00:00:36.690> fifth-gen<00:00:37.199> works<00:00:37.550> as<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
because it is how fifth-gen works as you

can<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.150> using<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.540> fairly<00:00:39.809> offensive

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
can see I'm using a fairly offensive

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.509 
can see I'm using a fairly offensive
type<00:00:41.100> team<00:00:41.430> don't<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.120> much<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:43.519> really

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
type team don't have much for really

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.640 
type team don't have much for really
almost<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.239> guess<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> considered<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.409> offense

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
almost I guess you considered on offense

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.200 
almost I guess you considered on offense
probably<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.010> closest<00:00:47.519> thing<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.790> have<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
probably the closest thing I have to a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
probably the closest thing I have to a
wall<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.540> everything<00:00:49.379> else<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.769> far<00:00:50.190> from

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
wall and everything else is far from

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.149 
wall and everything else is far from
that<00:00:50.549> but<00:00:50.729> anyway<00:00:51.360> huge<00:00:52.229> mistake<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.769> made<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
that but anyway huge mistake I made and

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.920 
that but anyway huge mistake I made and
leading<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.519> them<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.089> being<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.720> he<00:00:54.809> had

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
leading with them on being that he had

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.289 
leading with them on being that he had
so<00:00:55.379> much<00:00:55.559> water<00:00:56.250> type<00:00:56.580> oaks<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.150> I<00:00:57.180> was

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
so much water type oaks and then I was

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.660 
so much water type oaks and then I was
so<00:00:57.510> weak<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.839> star<00:00:58.110> me<00:00:58.290> I<00:00:58.460> really<00:00:59.460> should<00:00:59.640> have

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
so weak to star me I really should have

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.729 
so weak to star me I really should have
just<00:00:59.850> led<00:01:00.089> with<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> scissor<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:01.140> begin<00:01:01.530> with

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
just led with the scissor to begin with

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.410 
just led with the scissor to begin with
because<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.129> am<00:01:02.400> only<00:01:02.640> gonna<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:03.000> able<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.239> take

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
because I am only gonna be able to take

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.039 
because I am only gonna be able to take
one<00:01:03.839> hit<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> star<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.280> uh<00:01:05.750> they're<00:01:06.750> two

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
one hit from the star me uh they're two

one hit from the star me uh they're two
hits<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.440> guess<00:01:07.909> before<00:01:08.909> he's<00:01:09.119> able<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.479> take<00:01:09.720> me

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
hits I guess before he's able to take me

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.140 
hits I guess before he's able to take me
out<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.380> switch<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.100> being<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.760> can't

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
out so switch it in as being one I can't

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.899 
out so switch it in as being one I can't
afford<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.510> take<00:01:12.720> another<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.520> I'm<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:14.729> gonna

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
afford to take another and I'm not gonna

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.760 
afford to take another and I'm not gonna
waste<00:01:15.150> time<00:01:15.330> bullet<00:01:15.810> plunging<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.350> early<00:01:16.680> in

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
waste time bullet plunging this early in

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
waste time bullet plunging this early in
the<00:01:16.799> game<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.280> switch<00:01:17.549> out<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.030> shame<00:01:18.359> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the game I switch out to my shame and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.929 
the game I switch out to my shame and
and<00:01:18.829> I<00:01:19.829> figured<00:01:20.399> I'd<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.579> able<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> take

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and I figured I'd be able to take

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
and I figured I'd be able to take
anything<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.719> he<00:01:21.780> had<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:22.289> hadn't<00:01:22.829> gone

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
anything that he had if he hadn't gone

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.529 
anything that he had if he hadn't gone
for<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> ice<00:01:23.520> beam<00:01:23.789> which<00:01:23.969> was<00:01:24.090> kind<00:01:24.359> of<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
for the ice beam which was kind of the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.209 
for the ice beam which was kind of the
turn<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.960> hoping<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.829> he<00:01:25.920> went<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
turn I was hoping when he went on the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.740 
turn I was hoping when he went on the
Donna<00:01:26.579> fan<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> he<00:01:27.119> used<00:01:27.329> that<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.719> I

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
Donna fan that he used that when I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.200 
Donna fan that he used that when I
switched<00:01:28.049> him<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:28.759> but<00:01:29.759> anyway<00:01:30.030> he

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
switched him this is or but anyway he

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.060 
switched him this is or but anyway he
gets<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.479> paralyze<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.649> completely

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
gets the paralyze so that completely

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649

sucks<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.759> would<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.119> been<00:01:33.240> maybe<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659

the bulky waters he had that I'd

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.140 
the bulky waters he had that I'd
probably<00:02:40.350> get<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.680> chance<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.400> ever<00:02:41.580> get<00:02:41.940> those

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
probably get a chance to ever get those

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.590

up<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.600> that's<00:02:42.780> very<00:02:43.380> important<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.040> did

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
up and that's very important that I did

up and that's very important that I did
anyway<00:02:45.600> took<00:02:46.170> out<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.440> isn't<00:02:46.709> worth<00:02:46.950> the

matter what so I just decided to stay in
and<00:04:05.000> go<00:04:06.000> for<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:07.340> hidden<00:04:08.340> power<00:04:08.519> eyes<00:04:08.790> as<00:04:09.090> he

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
and go for the hidden power eyes as he

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.240 
and go for the hidden power eyes as he
does<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.840> same<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.410> that's<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.799> most<00:04:11.040> he

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
does the same and that's the most he

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.120 
does the same and that's the most he
could<00:04:11.400> have<00:04:11.519> done<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.730> me<00:04:12.060> um<00:04:12.299> about<00:04:12.780> 50%<00:04:13.769> right

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
could have done to me um about 50% right

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.880 
could have done to me um about 50% right
there<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.970> fact<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.870> think<00:04:15.930> it's<00:04:16.229> right<00:04:16.530> on<00:04:16.709> the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
there in fact I think it's right on the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.539 
there in fact I think it's right on the
nose<00:04:17.039> 50%<00:04:17.910> but<00:04:18.690> anyway<00:04:19.650> able<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.130> take<00:04:20.280> out<00:04:20.430> the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
nose 50% but anyway able to take out the

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.250 
nose 50% but anyway able to take out the
shaman's<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.390> very<00:04:21.750> good<00:04:21.930> because

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
shaman's so that is very good because

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.930 
shaman's so that is very good because
that<00:04:22.289> would<00:04:22.500> have<00:04:22.590> been<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.740> big<00:04:23.250> issue<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.820> my

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
that would have been a big issue to my

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.610 
that would have been a big issue to my
team<00:04:24.150> again<00:04:24.570> II<00:04:24.600> as<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> star<00:04:25.200> me<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.560> know

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
team again II as a star me and I know

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.790 
team again II as a star me and I know
the<00:04:26.010> star<00:04:26.250> me<00:04:26.430> can<00:04:26.610> take<00:04:26.789> me<00:04:27.000> out<00:04:27.150> with<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.050> ice

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
the star me can take me out with the ice

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.200 
the star me can take me out with the ice
beam<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:29.310> I'm<00:04:29.400> going<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.550> just<00:04:29.729> switch<00:04:29.850> into

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
beam so I'm going to just switch into

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.330 
beam so I'm going to just switch into
the<00:04:30.330> donna<00:04:30.570> fan<00:04:30.870> again<00:04:31.289> as<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.830> death<00:04:32.039> fodder

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
the donna fan again as the death fodder

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.080 
the donna fan again as the death fodder
and<00:04:33.440> again<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.590> can<00:04:34.770> see<00:04:34.919> right<00:04:35.070> here<00:04:35.130> i<00:04:35.580> kind

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
and again you can see right here i kind

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.520 
and again you can see right here i kind
of<00:04:36.210> thought<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.450> first<00:04:36.960> turn<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.229> the<00:04:37.349> game

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
of thought that first turn of the game

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.020 
of thought that first turn of the game
that<00:04:37.770> he<00:04:37.830> might<00:04:38.070> go<00:04:38.280> for<00:04:38.490> ice<00:04:38.669> be

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
that he might go for ice be

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.460 
that he might go for ice be
I<00:04:39.060> don't<00:04:39.570> know<00:04:39.660> if<00:04:39.750> he<00:04:39.840> was<00:04:39.930> predicting<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
I don't know if he was predicting the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.050 
I don't know if he was predicting the
switch<00:04:40.740> or<00:04:40.920> what<00:04:41.130> but<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:41.850> would<00:04:42.030> have

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
switch or what but that would have

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.240 
switch or what but that would have
easily<00:04:42.420> killed<00:04:42.840> my<00:04:43.140> Donna<00:04:43.380> fan<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.950> would

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
easily killed my Donna fan and would

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.040 
easily killed my Donna fan and would
have<00:04:44.340> made<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.700> lot<00:04:44.940> easier<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.390> my<00:04:45.600> sis<00:04:45.840> or

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
have made it a lot easier for my sis or

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.320 
have made it a lot easier for my sis or
again<00:04:46.890> I<00:04:47.070> just<00:04:47.280> didn't<00:04:47.580> have<00:04:47.700> really<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.060> safe

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
again I just didn't have really a safe

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.660 
again I just didn't have really a safe
switch<00:04:48.630> here<00:04:49.590> I'm<00:04:49.800> kind<00:04:50.250> of<00:04:50.310> hoping<00:04:50.550> he

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
switch here I'm kind of hoping he

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.520 
switch here I'm kind of hoping he
doesn't<00:04:51.000> carry<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.240> psychic<00:04:51.750> but<00:04:52.020> being<00:04:52.350> that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
doesn't carry the psychic but being that

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.050 
doesn't carry the psychic but being that
he<00:04:52.590> led<00:04:52.830> with<00:04:52.950> them<00:04:53.190> it<00:04:53.490> makes<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:53.910> pretty

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
he led with them it makes it pretty

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.180 
he led with them it makes it pretty
likely<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.540> he<00:04:54.780> does<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.380> as<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.710> see<00:04:55.920> here

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
likely that he does and as you see here

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.130 
likely that he does and as you see here
he<00:04:56.340> does<00:04:56.700> have<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.090> psychic<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:57.600> that<00:04:57.750> sucks

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
he does have the psychic so that sucks

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.680 
he does have the psychic so that sucks
but<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:58.830> am<00:04:59.010> able<00:04:59.220> to<00:04:59.340> get<00:04:59.580> up<00:04:59.730> the<00:04:59.940> 1/4<00:05:00.390> cup

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
but I am able to get up the 1/4 cup

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.750 
but I am able to get up the 1/4 cup
knowing<00:05:01.200> that<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:01.350> can<00:05:01.530> live<00:05:01.710> any<00:05:01.890> one<00:05:02.220> single

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
knowing that I can live any one single

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.810 
knowing that I can live any one single
move<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.300> then<00:05:03.620> again<00:05:04.620> after<00:05:05.190> all<00:05:05.610> the

stealth rock damages from switches and

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.580 
stealth rock damages from switches and
the<00:05:08.580> life<00:05:08.790> orb<00:05:09.060> damage<00:05:09.480> now<00:05:09.900> after<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.320> bulk

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
the life orb damage now after that bulk

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.410 
the life orb damage now after that bulk
up<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.920> mock<00:05:11.130> punch<00:05:11.400> is<00:05:11.580> going<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.790> be<00:05:11.910> an<00:05:12.030> easy

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
up a mock punch is going to be an easy

I believe all he has left now is the
vaporeon<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.260> Blaziken<00:05:19.830> so<00:05:19.980> I'm<00:05:20.100> feeling

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
vaporeon and the Blaziken so I'm feeling

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
he might if he had toxic have been able

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.450 
he might if he had toxic have been able
to<00:05:26.490> toxic<00:05:27.060> stall<00:05:27.360> me<00:05:27.540> eventually<00:05:27.840> but<00:05:28.320> um<00:05:28.800> I

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
to toxic stall me eventually but um I

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.180 
to toxic stall me eventually but um I
make<00:05:29.670> a<00:05:29.700> huge<00:05:30.360> misclick<00:05:31.290> right<00:05:31.500> here<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.040> this
