we will remove this hip bone so we can
see<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.630> femur<00:02:19.990> better<00:02:21.450> we'll<00:02:22.450> start<00:02:22.950> with

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
see the femur better we'll start with

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.680 
see the femur better we'll start with
the<00:02:24.450> proximal<00:02:25.710> extremity<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:27.450> will<00:02:28.450> select

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the proximal extremity I will select

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.220 
the proximal extremity I will select
some<00:02:28.960> water<00:02:29.140> bone<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:31.690> bone<00:02:31.960> is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
some water bone so that this bone is

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.860 
some water bone so that this bone is
better<00:02:33.040> visible<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.180> not<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.720> a

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
better visible and it's not like a

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.380

yellow<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.020> upper<00:02:38.230> extremity<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.120> see

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
yellow in the upper extremity we can see

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.030 
yellow in the upper extremity we can see
the<00:02:40.930> head<00:02:41.140> here<00:02:42.540> then<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.930> see<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.800> neck

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
the head here then we can see the neck

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:55.200 
the head here then we can see the neck
and<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:47.230> two<00:02:47.470> trochanters<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:54.550> here<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.060> the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
and the two trochanters this here is the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.620 
and the two trochanters this here is the

greater trochanter and this year is the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.270 
greater trochanter and this year is the
lesser<00:02:59.380> trochanter<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.960> look<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:02.590> the
