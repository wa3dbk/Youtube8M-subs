00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
of curvatures so that it suits these are

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.320 
of curvatures so that it suits these are
more<00:01:03.600> angular<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.129> curved<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
more angular these are more curved so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.990 
more angular these are more curved so
this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> little<00:01:07.710> more<00:01:07.890> curved<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.760> for
