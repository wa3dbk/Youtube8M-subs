00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.783
We traveled a long journey.

00:00:06.617 --> 00:00:09.757
Filled with experiences that nurtured our hearts and souls.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.140
An itinerant journey that creates vibrational atmospheres

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.454
to activate the memory of our true identity.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.600
Today it gets rooted in a marvelous natural reserve

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.680
in the banks of Laguna del Sauce in Uruguay.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.060
We are committed to mold a new and more harmonious reality with nature.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.200
Experiencing the beauty, magic and respect of our soul's life.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.840
A space where we unite diversity, free from religious or cultural flags,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.160
a Space with an universal heart.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.240
We assumed the commitment to build the foundation for a more peaceful society

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.495
that respect the essential values.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.411
A space that promotes the coexistence among different generations,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.790
highlighting the importance of any community's most basic component, the family.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.240
A lab where people of all ages engage together in innovative creative projects,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.320
promoting a loving and respectful interaction

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.240
that leads them to experience a feeling of safety, clarity, peace

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.660
and happiness while each person discovers his or her own inner potential.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.860
We want to give you a lovely welcome,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.980
Mahua is our project, in Punta Ballena Uruguay.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.740
Building what we call a city of light.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.480
We hope you can find and discover the beauty of this place

00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:55.463
and what we're doing with other families

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.400
who were integrated into this adventure.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.620
Mahua is open to all who is looking for a personal transformation.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.740
I invite you from my heart to support this beautiful project

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.140
so that the Mahua family can inspire us

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.280
to live a better live in peace and harmony with the universe.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.266
What does Mahua represent for us?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.920
It's the demonstration of our heart

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.220
from our deepest feelings to create a new humanity.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.120
My name is Daniel.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.160
We´re in Switzerland supporting this project.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.900
Mahua is a strong inner call for us

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.825
and represents what our hearts are feeling right now.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.280
The base of this project is a nature education

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.620
to find the harmony

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.700
between human being and natural kingdoms.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.900
We believe that personal transformation is possible,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.500
and from this change, to create peaceful spaces in harmony with nature

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.160
collaborating with global transformation.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.660
Art for us is a gateway to the soul.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.380
So that is one of the tools we´re using in Mahua.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.280
a way to enter the heart

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.100
Mahuá, a small scale City of Light

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.560
that inspires communities to lead a self sustainable life.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.580
We need to expand our building areas in this nature reserve,

00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:44.778
which has 3.5 hectares

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.960
and is on the edge of the lagoon and near to the ocean.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.890
We want to build two geodesics domes,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.660
a forest school and a dome for the children who are participating in this plan.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.316
Our idea is to create a space where children have the opportunity

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:20.360
to express the beauty of their souls through art and can build a forest school.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:25.971
Because we need to recognize kids as guardians of the new consciousness.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.022
Everyone who feels the call to live a new lifestyle

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.474
can come to make a spiritual experience and multiply it.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.739
This is a collective creation.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.080
We want to make this call.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.971
You can make an impact on the world !!!

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.591
This is a great opportunity to actively participate in this transformation to a new lifestyle.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.640
Thanks you to our family.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.877
This great project needs your unconditional love and support.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.360
We hope can receive you in Mahuá.
