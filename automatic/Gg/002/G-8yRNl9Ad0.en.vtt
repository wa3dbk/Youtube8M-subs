so<00:00:23.349> this<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.800> paper<00:00:24.009> support<00:00:24.189> that<00:00:24.939> broke

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
so this the paper support that broke

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.700 
so this the paper support that broke
after<00:00:25.450> about<00:00:25.840> six<00:00:26.200> weeks

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
after about six weeks

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.389 
after about six weeks
it<00:00:27.400> didn't<00:00:28.000> really<00:00:28.090> last<00:00:28.329> long<00:00:29.369> cacophony<00:00:30.369> of

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
it didn't really last long cacophony of

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.960 
it didn't really last long cacophony of
issues<00:00:30.730> with<00:00:30.939> this<00:00:31.090> thing<00:00:31.360> ain't<00:00:32.050> cheap

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
issues with this thing ain't cheap

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.319 
issues with this thing ain't cheap
possibly<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.030> worst<00:00:35.370> other<00:00:36.370> than<00:00:36.640> Lexmark

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
possibly the worst other than Lexmark

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.640 
possibly the worst other than Lexmark
obviously<00:00:37.780> this<00:00:37.930> is<00:00:38.080> one<00:00:38.230> of<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.410> worst

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
obviously this is one of the worst

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.350 
obviously this is one of the worst
printers<00:00:39.070> I've<00:00:39.220> ever<00:00:39.370> had<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.640> misfortune<00:00:39.820> of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
printers I've ever had the misfortune of

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.210 
printers I've ever had the misfortune of
owning<00:00:41.220> so<00:00:42.220> just<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.610> little<00:00:42.990> demonstration

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.990 

just<00:00:48.220> standard<00:00:48.670> a4<00:00:49.180> paper<00:00:49.770> drop<00:00:50.770> in<00:00:50.920> here<00:00:51.190> plop

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
just standard a4 paper drop in here plop

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.300 
just standard a4 paper drop in here plop
that<00:00:52.930> doesn't<00:00:53.230> really<00:00:53.380> help<00:00:53.560> much<00:00:53.770> to<00:00:53.980> be<00:00:54.070> fair

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
that doesn't really help much to be fair

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.010 
that doesn't really help much to be fair
and<00:00:55.650> we'll<00:00:56.650> get<00:00:56.829> a<00:00:56.890> little<00:00:57.100> print<00:00:57.490> run<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.870> we

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
and we'll get a little print run here we

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
and we'll get a little print run here we
go<00:00:59.700> so<00:01:00.700> in<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:00.910> print<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.420> little<00:01:01.690> booklet

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
go so in the print a little booklet

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.819 
go so in the print a little booklet
let's<00:01:03.640> see<00:01:03.880> if<00:01:04.000> this<00:01:04.150> can<00:01:04.180> really<00:01:04.780> work<00:01:07.829> it's

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
let's see if this can really work it's

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.230 
let's see if this can really work it's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
paper out again this is a scanner that's

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.410 
paper out again this is a scanner that's
crap<00:02:41.650> as<00:02:41.830> well<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:45.190> leaves<00:02:45.370> lines<00:02:45.820> all<00:02:46.390> over

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420

crap as well it leaves lines all over
the<00:02:46.690> place<00:02:46.959> those<00:02:47.260> scan<00:02:47.560> lines<00:02:47.830> everywhere

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the place those scan lines everywhere

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.050 
the place those scan lines everywhere
it's<00:02:48.880> worse<00:02:49.150> than<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.390> trip<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> 80s<00:02:50.200> really

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.759 

-<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.420> work<00:02:54.660> again<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.470> final

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
- can we work again this is the final

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.080 
- can we work again this is the final
time<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.950> doing<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.370> because<00:02:56.580> it's<00:02:56.790> probably

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
time of doing this because it's probably

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.729 
time of doing this because it's probably
a<00:02:57.120> bit<00:02:57.209> boring<00:02:57.450> by<00:02:57.720> now<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.440> certainly

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
a bit boring by now it's certainly

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.500 
a bit boring by now it's certainly
boring<00:02:59.099> me<00:02:59.250> oh<00:02:59.459> there<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.120> go<00:03:00.239> again

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
boring me oh there we go again

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.210 
boring me oh there we go again
okay<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.050> we<00:03:01.200> can<00:03:01.349> safely<00:03:01.470> say<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:04.220> so

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
okay so we can safely say this is not so

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.080 
okay so we can safely say this is not so
we<00:03:05.730> join<00:03:05.940> us<00:03:06.090> later<00:03:06.239> we're<00:03:07.080> going<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:08.030> show<00:03:09.030> you

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
we join us later we're going to show you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.840 
we join us later we're going to show you
what<00:03:09.330> we<00:03:09.480> truly<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.319> printer

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.740 

this<00:03:18.850> concludes<00:03:19.330> our<00:03:19.510> review<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:20.080> the
