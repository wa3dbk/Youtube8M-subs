let's go ahead and get into it um the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.570 
let's go ahead and get into it um the
bottom<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.490> bottom<00:01:17.610> bottom<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
bottom the bottom bottom just like I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.820 
bottom the bottom bottom just like I
said<00:01:20.790> I've<00:01:21.270> received<00:01:21.600> these<00:01:21.780> last<00:01:22.110> night<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
said I've received these last night I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.149 
said I've received these last night I
should<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.250> these<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.600> yesterday<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.560> wore

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
should got these in yesterday and I wore

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.870 
should got these in yesterday and I wore
them<00:01:26.340> today<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.530> are<00:01:28.530> very<00:01:28.880> comfortable

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
them today and they are very comfortable

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.289 
them today and they are very comfortable
a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.780> more<00:01:30.930> comfortable<00:01:31.110> than<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.470> thought

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
a lot more comfortable than I thought

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.660 
a lot more comfortable than I thought
they<00:01:33.299> would<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.680> bottom<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.130> some

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
they would be so the bottom we have some

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.770 
they would be so the bottom we have some
pods<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> front

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
pods right there you got the front

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.170 
pods right there you got the front
rubber<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.530> also<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> heel<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
rubber and also in the heel which are a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730 
rubber and also in the heel which are a
little<00:01:42.360> bit<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:42.659> dense<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
little bit more dense so because you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
little bit more dense so because you
know<00:01:43.829> those<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> highway<00:01:44.610> areas<00:01:45.090> then

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
know those are the highway areas then

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.289 
know those are the highway areas then
you<00:01:45.990> got<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.290> torsion<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.460> says<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
you got this torsion it says it's like a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.850 
you got this torsion it says it's like a
little<00:01:48.450> plate<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.320> torsion

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
little plate right there so it's torsion

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.830 
little plate right there so it's torsion
which<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.970> adds<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> little<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.600> more

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
which is just adds a little bit more

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.480 
which is just adds a little bit more
stability<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> shoe<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.340> more

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
stability in the shoe a little bit more

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.280 
stability in the shoe a little bit more
rigidness<00:01:53.880> through<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> mid<00:01:54.750> foot<00:01:54.990> plate

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
rigidness through the mid foot plate

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
rigidness through the mid foot plate
then<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> got<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.939> got<00:01:57.210> two<00:01:57.509> kinds<00:01:57.689> of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
then you got this you got two kinds of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.800 
then you got this you got two kinds of
foams<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.399> midsole<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.659> got<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
foams on the midsole you actually got a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.789 
foams on the midsole you actually got a
a<00:02:01.369> denser<00:02:02.369> material<00:02:02.899> foam<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.530> which

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
a denser material foam right here which

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.830 
a denser material foam right here which
obviously<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.060> little<00:02:06.540> bit<00:02:06.659> more

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
obviously has to be a little bit more

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.930 
obviously has to be a little bit more
harder

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
harder

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
harder
and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.420> midsole<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.190> just<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.570> mean<00:02:12.570> EBA

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
and then the midsole is just I mean EBA

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.770 
and then the midsole is just I mean EBA
or<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:14.280> could<00:02:14.460> be<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.940> uva<00:02:15.930> or<00:02:17.330> just<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.390> phylon

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
or it could be a uva or just a phylon
