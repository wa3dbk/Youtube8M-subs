00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.029
 west of Shetland 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.139
 the ship is on its way to a cooler and in the North Sea 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:18.769
 there is a rig supply ship equipped with a special 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.189
 the government its interest development chief of the Volkssturm where 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.319
 marine 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.979
 tests the drive system of the supply ship on this trip 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.070
 Jürgens explains the drive of the unique for a ship this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.070
 Size is 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.510
 that's how Vilbel made it for animation 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
 the euro shows us the shape 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.100
 around seven percent 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.290
 Every ship looks underwater 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.510
 Coming soon for pieces 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.630
 becomes özdemir 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.630
 fully taxed 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.930
 landing very often would end up 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.040
 and really follow 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 Losses London 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.340
 within just four days 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.259
 The supply ship needs to replenish a total of seven rigs 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.830
 the first goal looks like 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 somewhere between the Slavic places 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.890
 is amazingly good 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.329
 for the crane driver on the rig 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.890
 it is still an acrobatic act 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.700
 the containers from the rocking ship to the platform 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 and back to the dance 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.119
 in such situations, the two propellers 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.280
 r keep the ship stable even at high waves 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.119
 "If we wanted that, we would be without a point 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.729
 as a film role is produced because of feared 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.349
 that will inspire us 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.160
 this is a great invention of our house this possibility of 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.689
 Wiesbaden MacBook pro 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.549
 for tourists who wanted to talk 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.069
 that's a smart wolf cutter everyone else will 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.999
 the two million euros drive is so much too expensive 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.999
 the conventional flu 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:44.129
 but for that the ship Villiger now lowers the fuel consumption of a so-called 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.129
 It is very bad St something 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:51.239
 she too has become meanwhile 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.239
 Time for a special test 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.810
 Check Jürgen Smid 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.029
 how the supplier is stuck at the different speeds 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.380
 four disciplines lighting 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.809
 it is forbidden night on the bridge 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.789
 Dr 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.789
 the number of propellers is starting up slowly 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.329
 suddenly for Dieter Schiff 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.329
 to vibrate terribly 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.359
 missing for that 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.659
 so it has to be turned up now 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.659
 Berlusconi is we know it is 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:39.489
 show that so close to vibrations that the professionals can but the problem 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.979
 can be fixed quickly 1 ORF 2 from Date is necessary 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.399
 the next morning for you need 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.200
 ideal conditions to test the so-called voice stabilization 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.629
 and now the propellers are switched Fritz is the ship 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.090
 Quiet on the water even when driving hardly anybody is able to 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.590
 recognize 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.960
 the Danes are playing on the bridge at all 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.210
 no problem to safely supply an oil rig 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.050
 For us, too, was taxing taxes of EUR 2 05 million red red red color leadership 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.409
 had stumbled 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.300
 or significantly better rehearsals and education 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.469
 Block 50 percent 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.929
 we have to get better so will the competition for Opel's future 

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:47.090
 Minden Much 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.390
 The new system he proves himself the otherwise camera-shy captain 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.039
 is enthusiastic about the technology 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.610
 Trevor bb 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.999
 It is much better to position it later 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.219
 from two to three meters Weseke into a ring of one meter and that 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:05.240
 Pull the ship 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.529
 and they will see how we stay winners 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.129
 this window would have been leaning against it 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.069
 Image Mishka in the care 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.920
 The job is done for the engineers 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.599
 Storm is announced and still 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.199
 Nevertheless, there are some rigs
