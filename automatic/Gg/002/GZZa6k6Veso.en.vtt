00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 what is the lenny people doing here again? 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.830
 It's not too outlandish or see 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.540
 you can save the trend as well 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 yes my dear friends only one more 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.740
 sleep for half a year and then it is 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.080
 finally as far as one or the other 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 may have heard nintendo has 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.300
 for november a remake of the third 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.840
 generation of pokémon announced you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.550
 would be alpha sapphire and formiga ruby and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.349
 if you still have the happy news 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:37.680
 Did not notice the pace 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:39.750
 announced that I would agree 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.309
 can save actually I had 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.809
 only then to do this video 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.180
 if you are a little bit more about that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.190
 edition has experienced us today 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.570
 the twentieth of may and what you have so far 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.449
 of the emotions is so noticed 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.579
 pretty much nothing 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.550
 oh yes and of course this sneak 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.199
 preview gameplay-trailer I'm allowed to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 the original does not show because of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.890
 copyright stories so but me 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.520
 Try them somehow different 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.520
 to illustrate 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.210
 yes directly super insight into the game yes 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.880
 let nintendo game freak and be 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.440
 Pretty dancing that is definitely fact 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.700
 but because I'm not so long now 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.960
 wanted to wait with the video and because you 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.860
 so often asked if I had something to do 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.979
 I can do that, of course 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.210
 of course I can do that and 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.190
 That's why I want to be with you 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.530
 this videos and in the comments 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.350
 fantasize about it a bit 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.619
 could look like the new edition series 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.200
 it will be given back in plastic that 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.289
 you can use it around your pokemon too 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.759
 Exercising outside in the real life world 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.979
 to be able to or around with his friends 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.409
 to be able to communicate or something like that 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.479
 then somehow after two weeks around 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.610
 found and there I have in the corner 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.950
 lies and much more interesting as 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.710
 the whole thing will look like a graphic 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.880
 to the graphic I said that the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.069
 play the games xy relatively similar 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.250
 it's going to be easy for the reason 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:20.030
 because xy is easy for your relationships 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.880
 already very far ahead and me 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.959
 do not think that in too many 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.070
 time will be so the pokemon now 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.980
 more 3d and more camera rides now 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.540
 but I think the same way 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.799
 a little that you go back the pace 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.910
 and again this bird's eye view 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.380
 3d render in comic flatland 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.120
 if you are even at all 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.579
 somehow understands what I mean 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.850
 However, it should be said that I am in 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.010
 Hope that the fight animation 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.920
 will look even more mature than 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.620
 that of xy just not just the static 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.840
 camera position and now and then one 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.350
 swivel left and right depending on 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.700
 this murder cool sneak preview trailer 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.410
 I really hope that that 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.209
 maybe even more action 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.400
 is designed based 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.200
 Of course I thought that was pretty cool 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.079
 I would be interested too 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.120
 how far the pokémon generation is there 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.950
 whether it is really only from the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.410
 go first to third generation 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.940
 will or will we 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.830
 take care of the generations afterwards 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.280
 also see in these editions 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.430
 become 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.840
 and I have to say that honestly and that 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.650
 will now give me a lot of money 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.530
 bring 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.750
 the third generation of pokemon was 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.430
 Actually, that's how the generation does me 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.390
 so far I have played 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.300
 Yeah, I know the least 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.020
 people but i can explain it i can 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.030
 explain it 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.860
 I just find the storyline of 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.010
 any of this whole generation 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.820
 bit viscous feels when 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.050
 it's just tough to play 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.940
 stretches to length 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.040
 and I do not know why I know 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.160
 really not why but I found it 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.030
 sapphire and ruby unbelievable 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.500
 to play cumbersome 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.300
 I do not know if anyone is there 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.190
 understands out there now and if he does that 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.570
 but I can understand somehow 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.130
 I think it was a bit too 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.420
 that 3d development in these 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.090
 just do not really play that way yet 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.920
 has matured and something 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.120
 I had this game where I thought so 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.640
 so that completely 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.690
 it seems a bit lengthy before 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.560
 a little bit does not know exactly 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.960
 to explain 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.880
 and I really hope for alpha 4 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.680
 and omega rubin that it with these 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.560
 edition will not be like that but that 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.480
 they through dynamic gameplay and 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.750
 nice fight animations and stuff like that 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.880
 it just feels livelier lively 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.350
 liveliness that was the problem i did 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.470
 believe sapphire and mobile was one to me 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.450
 little too to death to 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.360
 I do not know how to explain it 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.750
 shit on the names of the edition so 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.730
 alpha sapphire and ruby omega I find 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.850
 All right, I think it's a bit 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.419
 long-winded alpha sapphire and bonn mega 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.070
 rubin would have been completely honest to me i was mine 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.660
 pretty sure the iphone omega in the 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.980
 pokémon editions names in any case 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.260
 occur 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.900
 but just stand alone pokémon 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.980
 alpha and pokemon omega from one find 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.530
 I now a pity that it 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.690
 For it is almost already verpulvert so completely 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.590
 I understand the naming simply 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.960
 not quite so 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.280
 but of course we generally know too 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.270
 not too much about the games yet 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.500
 so you can do that now 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.150
 probably already at all 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.370
 do not say otherwise I have to be honest 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.260
 say I'm looking forward to alta 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.180
 sapphire and omega ruby i think so 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.540
 I will buy alpha sapphire because I 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.460
 rubies and I'm smart 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.910
 Somehow I had that blue 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.700
 more beautiful 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.950
 so be with me this time 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.140
 probably alpha saphir otherwise 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.900
 but we have nothing else left 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.720
 left as wait and hope that the 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.540
 time as fast as we can 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.800
 than 40 euro as you finally get into the 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.220
 hands 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:04.350
 and in the meantime I would be mine 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.100
 also a bit more fluent 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.630
 illustrative material but want that 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.490
 will think come anyway it is yes 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.850
 a little time back years 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.460
 you already have friends of alpha saphir 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.410
 and omega rubin you're upset 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.990
 this edition or do you think 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.970
 So slowly this whole pokémon reaches 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.740
 but then also something in your 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.660
 personal expectations and wishes 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.970
 these two games and you think that 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.040
 after alpha sapphire and omega rubies 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.730
 something like delta emerald or something 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.770
 will come 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.930
 opinions views and comments like 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.370
 always down in the comment box on the 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.260
 Of course you will get there like that 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.710
 always synonymous with my video description 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.230
 past 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.480
 There you will find all the links as well 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.730
 for example the link to the pokemon trader 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.070
 my facebook page I love you very much 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.110
 ans heart lay because her since everything always up 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.000
 to date is about me and if 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.710
 something should be like I have no 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.060
 internet or something then you know too 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.070
 why two weeks again 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.630
 no videos come as well 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.910
 You can also find twitter page there and 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.510
 my mailbox address where you do me 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.840
 You can send letters about care 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.060
 stamped envelopes for autographs 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.470
 an info video about the autographs 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.440
 Incidentally, you can also find it below in the 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.000
 video description so it is for everyone 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.949
 something is definitely worth it 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.690
 to have a look 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:20.460
 that was it from me again 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.990
 This time I was a bit shorter 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.650
 hope nevertheless that we down in the 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.590
 comments to 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.510
 some wish wishes utterances 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.250
 get together and maybe one 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.800
 nice discussion round states can 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.850
 editions about the two new that was 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.620
 I'll see you in the next one 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.620
 video haut rein to people
