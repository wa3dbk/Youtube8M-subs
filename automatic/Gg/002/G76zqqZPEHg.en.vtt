that's<00:02:03.260> attached<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.860> cartridge<00:02:04.280> sort<00:02:05.150> of

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
that's attached to the cartridge sort of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.700 
that's attached to the cartridge sort of
determines<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.900> placement<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.530> ball

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
determines the placement of the ball

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.830 
determines the placement of the ball
before<00:02:06.979> your<00:02:07.280> throat<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.030> as<00:02:08.149> I'm<00:02:08.300> spinning

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
before your throat so as I'm spinning

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.749 
before your throat so as I'm spinning
you<00:02:08.959> know<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.800> see<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.100> ball<00:02:10.280> move<00:02:10.550> on

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
you know that you see the ball move on

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.070 
you know that you see the ball move on
the<00:02:10.850> screen<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:12.740> know<00:02:12.910> start<00:02:13.910> over<00:02:14.120> here<00:02:14.300> if

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the screen you know start over here if

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.510 
the screen you know start over here if
you're<00:02:15.230> lucky<00:02:15.440> you'll<00:02:15.830> pick<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.250> pick<00:02:16.400> you

where you want it I guess that's where
you<00:02:19.910> try<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.330> throw<00:02:23.380> Wow

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
of a disconnect between okay here's

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.229 
of a disconnect between okay here's
where<00:02:43.800> I'm<00:02:43.890> gonna<00:02:44.040> start<00:02:44.340> my<00:02:44.550> release

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
where I'm gonna start my release

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.870 
where I'm gonna start my release
but<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.810> when<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.020> go<00:02:46.230> back<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:47.340> my<00:02:47.580> release

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
but then when I go back now my release

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.550 
but then when I go back now my release
point<00:02:48.150> suddenly<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> gutter<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.380> is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
point suddenly in the gutter so this is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.210 
point suddenly in the gutter so this is
boy<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:51.000> good<00:02:53.630> there<00:02:54.630> we<00:02:54.810> go<00:02:55.220> all

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
boy this is not good there we go all

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.850 
boy this is not good there we go all
right<00:02:56.430> now<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.700> got<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> hang<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.860> all

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
right now we got the hang of it all

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.650 
right now we got the hang of it all
right<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.489> first<00:02:59.730> game<00:02:59.970> didn't<00:03:00.300> go<00:03:00.420> very

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
right so the first game didn't go very

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.440 
right so the first game didn't go very
well<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.830> Avex<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.849> floor<00:03:03.180> now

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
well I have this Avex on the floor now

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.990 
well I have this Avex on the floor now
we're<00:03:04.050> gonna<00:03:04.140> try<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.739> play<00:03:05.340> with<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.730> on<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
we're gonna try and play with it on the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.930 
we're gonna try and play with it on the
floor<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:07.080> camera<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.530> tilted<00:03:07.769> upward<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.640> you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
floor the camera is tilted upward so you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.620 
floor the camera is tilted upward so you
know<00:03:09.030> maybe<00:03:09.239> that'll<00:03:09.600> make<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.959> difference<00:03:11.630> but

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
know maybe that'll make a difference but

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.530 
know maybe that'll make a difference but
it<00:03:12.750> still<00:03:13.049> seems<00:03:13.290> jumpy<00:03:13.830> as<00:03:13.920> ever<00:03:14.130> though<00:03:14.370> I

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.150 

think<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:18.750> not<00:03:18.989> that's<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.440> registering

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
think that's not that's not registering

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.080 
think that's not that's not registering
at<00:03:20.310> all

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.140 

well<00:03:25.900> guys<00:03:26.050> I'm<00:03:26.739> sort<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.280> speechless<00:03:27.430> about

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
well guys I'm sort of speechless about

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
this one and me being speechless that

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.600 
this one and me being speechless that
doesn't<00:03:31.080> doesn't<00:03:32.080> happen<00:03:32.319> very<00:03:32.500> often<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.280> mean

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
doesn't doesn't happen very often I mean

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.710 
doesn't doesn't happen very often I mean
you<00:03:33.670> would<00:03:33.790> think<00:03:33.819> when<00:03:34.209> you're<00:03:34.300> holding<00:03:34.480> a

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
you would think when you're holding a

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.860 
you would think when you're holding a
like<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.080> ball<00:03:35.440> like<00:03:35.830> this<00:03:36.099> that<00:03:37.060> while<00:03:37.599> there's

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
know a little mechanical hamster that's

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.309 
know a little mechanical hamster that's
running<00:03:45.610> in<00:03:45.849> circles<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.510> here<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:47.140> is

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
running in circles in here that is

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.530 
running in circles in here that is
creating<00:03:47.890> some<00:03:48.160> sort<00:03:48.340> of<00:03:48.540> electromagnetic

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
creating some sort of electromagnetic

case what this is is a piece of plastic

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.009 
case what this is is a piece of plastic
that<00:04:00.400> may<00:04:00.640> or<00:04:00.790> may<00:04:00.880> not<00:04:00.910> actually<00:04:01.299> do<00:04:01.750> anything
