kind of to the similar area in that

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.090 
kind of to the similar area in that
joint

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
joint

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.820 
joint
kind<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.640> were<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.060> where<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> cage<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.680> that

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
kind of were the where the cage to that

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.980 
kind of were the where the cage to that
the<00:00:20.279> last<00:00:20.609> star<00:00:20.910> was<00:00:21.150> kind<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.720> little<00:00:21.869> bit

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the last star was kind of a little bit

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.140 
the last star was kind of a little bit
further<00:00:22.289> up<00:00:22.529> than<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.890> believe<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
further up than that I believe and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.700 
further up than that I believe and
basically<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.689> can<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.260> probably

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
basically as you can see here probably

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.140 
basically as you can see here probably
as<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.949> may<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.160> already<00:00:26.250> guessed<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.939> have

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
as you may have already guessed I have

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.140 
as you may have already guessed I have
the<00:00:27.269> time<00:00:27.510> stop<00:00:27.840> begin<00:00:28.880> again<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:29.970> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the time stop begin again this is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.669 
the time stop begin again this is
probably<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> matter<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> preference

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
probably kind of a matter of preference

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.410 
probably kind of a matter of preference
it's<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.160> necessarily<00:00:32.669> Harmison<00:00:33.059> necessary

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it's not necessarily Harmison necessary

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.120 
it's not necessarily Harmison necessary
there<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.750> another<00:00:34.230> star<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:34.980> after

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
there is another star with going after

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.479 
there is another star with going after
layer<00:00:35.430> there<00:00:36.920> which<00:00:37.920> shouldn't<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.309> too<00:00:38.460> hard

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
layer there which shouldn't be too hard

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.959 
layer there which shouldn't be too hard
to<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.350> actually<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.010> might<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
to get to and actually that might be the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.940 
to get to and actually that might be the
next<00:00:42.270> star<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> don't<00:00:42.809> remember<00:00:42.989> off<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> top

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
next star I don't remember off the top

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.510 
next star I don't remember off the top
my<00:00:44.190> head<00:00:45.649> anyways<00:00:46.649> though<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.370> are<00:00:49.100> going<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
my head anyways though we are going to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.130 
my head anyways though we are going to
obviously<00:00:50.730> there's<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> last<00:00:51.480> star<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.989> we're

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
obviously there's the last star so we're

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:02.270 
obviously there's the last star so we're
getting<00:00:52.230> pretty<00:00:52.410> close<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.100> point<00:00:53.160> way

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.560 

that<00:01:03.280> guy<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.670> would<00:01:03.820> get<00:01:03.910> shocked<00:01:04.300> this

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
that guy so I would get shocked this

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.550 
that guy so I would get shocked this
time<00:01:05.909> other<00:01:06.909> than<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.600> we<00:01:08.409> should<00:01:08.770> have

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
time other than that we should have

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.290 
time other than that we should have
right<00:01:11.560> there<00:01:11.770> okay<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.340> was<00:01:12.760> like<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:12.970> was<00:01:13.119> like

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
right there okay I was like I was like

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.820 
right there okay I was like I was like

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
forever it was somewhere around here

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.830 
forever it was somewhere around here

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
kind of don't want that guy to be in my

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.530 
kind of don't want that guy to be in my
way<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:21.550> I'm<00:01:21.850> trying<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.150> remember<00:01:22.300> actually

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
way and I'm trying to remember actually

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.080 
way and I'm trying to remember actually
where<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.900> even<00:01:24.930> comes<00:01:25.930> out<00:01:26.110> at<00:01:26.320> oh<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.700> see<00:01:28.000> it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
where it even comes out at oh I see it

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.999 
where it even comes out at oh I see it
now<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.500> over<00:01:29.619> there

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
now it's over there

now it's over there
all<00:01:30.759> right<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.210> might<00:01:31.960> be<00:01:32.170> kind<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.440> tricky

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
all right so might be kind of tricky

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.880 
all right so might be kind of tricky
really<00:01:33.670> isn't<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.630> bad<00:01:35.320> is<00:01:35.740> terribly<00:01:37.890> I'm

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
really isn't that bad is terribly I'm

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.060 
really isn't that bad is terribly I'm
also<00:01:39.039> using<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.460> Ouija<00:01:39.580> which<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.920> guess<00:01:41.920> it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
also using the Ouija which I guess it's

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.680 
also using the Ouija which I guess it's
a<00:01:42.130> matter<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.399> preference<00:01:42.700> but<00:01:43.090> I've<00:01:43.479> always

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
a matter of preference but I've always

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.120 
a matter of preference but I've always
preferred<00:01:44.259> his<00:01:44.649> jumping<00:01:44.920> abilities<00:01:45.429> over<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
preferred his jumping abilities over the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.340 
preferred his jumping abilities over the
other<00:01:48.250> characters<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.090> Dane<00:01:49.630> where<00:01:50.170> did<00:01:50.289> that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
likewise really hate those stupid things

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.150 
likewise really hate those stupid things
they're<00:02:10.869> useful<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.500> wet-dry<00:02:11.920> world

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
they're useful in the wet-dry world

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.100 
they're useful in the wet-dry world
level<00:02:12.400> but<00:02:12.550> other<00:02:13.180> than<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.450> they<00:02:13.900> are

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
level but other than that they are

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.000 
level but other than that they are
basically<00:02:15.099> not<00:02:15.310> useful<00:02:15.459> at<00:02:15.730> all<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:17.770> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
basically not useful at all and in the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.160 
basically not useful at all and in the
meantime<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.640> guy<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:18.880> back<00:02:19.330> alive<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
meantime that guy is back alive and so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.479 
meantime that guy is back alive and so
yeah<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.410> would<00:02:23.590> recommend<00:02:24.069> using<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.370> Ouija

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
yeah I would recommend using the Ouija

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.550 
yeah I would recommend using the Ouija
for<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.390> cause<00:02:25.599> like<00:02:25.630> it's<00:02:25.989> slightly

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
for that just cause like it's slightly

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.220 
for that just cause like it's slightly
better<00:02:26.830> jumping<00:02:27.280> ability<00:02:27.810> not<00:02:28.810> necessary

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
better jumping ability not necessary

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.930 
better jumping ability not necessary
same<00:02:29.500> thing<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:29.980> probably<00:02:30.280> do<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.819> with

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
same thing you can probably do it with

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.670 
same thing you can probably do it with
actually<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.930> would<00:02:32.110> strongly<00:02:32.530> recommend

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
actually I would strongly recommend

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.610 
actually I would strongly recommend
probably<00:02:33.370> out<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.640> all<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.270> stars<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.989> this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
probably out of all of the stars in this

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.130 
probably out of all of the stars in this
level<00:02:36.420> that's<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.660> one<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:37.989> would

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
level that's the one that I would

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.440 
level that's the one that I would
probably<00:02:38.260> recommend<00:02:38.890> most<00:02:39.430> going<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.239> with

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
probably recommend most going in with

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.100 
probably recommend most going in with
everything<00:02:40.930> stopped<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.989> know

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
everything stopped just because you know

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.020 
everything stopped just because you know
I<00:02:44.379> don't<00:02:44.620> know<00:02:44.680> focusing<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.459> time<00:02:45.670> limit

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
I don't know focusing on the time limit

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.850 
I don't know focusing on the time limit
and<00:02:46.209> having<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> focus<00:02:46.900> on<00:02:47.140> where<00:02:47.500> all<00:02:47.739> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
and having to focus on where all the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.830 
and having to focus on where all the
pendulums<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.430> stuff<00:02:48.640> are<00:02:48.760> moving<00:02:49.030> can<00:02:49.720> be

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
pendulums and stuff are moving can be

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.830 
pendulums and stuff are moving can be
kind<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.140> annoying<00:02:50.379> so<00:02:51.420> nonetheless<00:02:52.420> though

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
kind of annoying so nonetheless though

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.510 
kind of annoying so nonetheless though
that's<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:53.620> my<00:02:53.770> method<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.190> guess<00:02:54.340> like<00:02:54.489> I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
that's just my method I guess like I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.890 
that's just my method I guess like I
said<00:02:54.640> there's<00:02:54.790> multiple<00:02:55.300> ways<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.540> doing<00:02:55.660> it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900
