00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.120
 let's see now 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.420
 how to touch the bathroom 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.380
 the air is the second saucer in importance 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.730
 if we catalog them taking as criterion how frequent the doctor Carlos 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.539
 to this 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.359
 against the setback that again only two parts are touched 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.910
 envelope of the upper face or on the spine and on the edge 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.699
 we can touch it in three different areas 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.009
 in fact some will say until when 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.900
 the first one was obvious you are 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.970
 in the part 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.970
 the center the upper face or in two parts 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.190
 6 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.620
 the other is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.860
 in the camera 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.220
 it's this part of here 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.570
 most drummers when they use the bell 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.660
 and the summer 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.260
 new account 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 the cheekbone 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.940
 or with the flight of the sidewalk 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 not with the tip 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.239
 hitting it with the tip would generate a sound 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.239
 too bright 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.920
 normally what is sought is a sound more 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.940
 they are enough for precisely 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.980
 then we will use 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.720
 the part that immediately preceding the sec 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 Something more or less 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.730
 I can do it for the outside face 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.730
 although it would be basically 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.190
 Of course 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.060
 although it is not usual 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 the ravens can be played like chaos 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.860
 and we can hit them directly in the same order 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.140
 we obviously did not want like the bench is very big one more sound 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.100
 pulling to a goal 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.620
 they watch well as I did not hit him with the waist again they hit him 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 with the neck of the sidewalk 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.689
 and finally 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.999
 we can mold you into the mere written 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.259
 this is the fourth sound that some say can be removed 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.419
 if we compare it with 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.419
 when we vote for 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.410
 we noticed that the sound is 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.319
 brighter 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.439
 some are accustomed when they are keeping pace with the lightning toggle 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.300
 between 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.429
 the body and then forgiveness 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.589
 and the bell 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.589
 something more or less like that 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.359
 and of course the combinations that we want 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.229
 they only remember 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:13.259
 on the back 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.999
 olive 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.999
 the bell sticks 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.780
 let's go now to conclude 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.959
 with the glasses 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.879
 two faults and generally 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.139
 only accepted field are hit 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.089
 at the mere edge 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:33.309
 i also 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.089
 that beating is done 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:37.029
 with the support of the barqueta 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.839
 not with the tip 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:43.129
 doing it with the tip would give us a sound too bright 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.719
 and less strength of course 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.369
 However 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:10.249
 it is important that I always recommend with the bumps expose them at an angle 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.400
 how low or how high 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.269
 Well, that depends 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.530
 d the attack that we have with the angle of attack that we 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.819
 it is generally what should be allocated this angle 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.979
 in which it is placed 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.210
 be complementary 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.460
 article in which they 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.460
 that's the reason why they never took off and 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.479
 because we're not going to achieve the sound we want 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:43.889
 will benefit us in the world retired 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.849
 since the sidewalk can break, we can even 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.379
 break the saucer 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.559
 another thing that never 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.300
 is to leave the sidewalk kiir 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.509
 beyond what is necessary 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.020
 I must make contact with the saucer with a firm and dry blow 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.610
 I do not have to apply too much force 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.490
 a case the terms are designed to reason with the minimum cost idea 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.300
 go throw the racket 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.590
 or when a lot 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.889
 leave it in the place of origin 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.889
 something more or less like that 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.490
 The hit 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.490
 and they continue to push the saucer even over the saucer with the 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.490
 sidewalk 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.159
 they do not benefit at all 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.689
 maybe as a show it looks great but in reality we're 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:44.379
 harming because we are letting go of the arm beyond what is necessary and 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:45.389
 apart 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.389
 we are even holding back the sound to the plan 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:54.440
 the cut deserves 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.369
 the safest 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.289
 finally I would like to make a clarification 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.289
 the saucers contrary to what 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.689
 must debug 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.129
 if you want pozoblanco a saucer 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:11.210
 in one year 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.970
 obviously we are talking about cymbals 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.050
 a decent level of a brand 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.439
 known orrego 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.430
 it means that you are hitting too hard 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.150
 although they are hitting badly 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.639
 a real saucer 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.990
 many years 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.509
 inclusive sometimes 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.779
 of what one would expect 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.180
 my recommendation as always is 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.629
 take care of your dishes take care of your equipment in general 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.309
 and I hope that this award 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:42.779
 I have served you 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:43.569
 we go to the
