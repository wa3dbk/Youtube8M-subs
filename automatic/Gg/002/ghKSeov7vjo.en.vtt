table they do ask that you put it on a
flat<00:01:33.240> surface<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.750> we'll<00:01:34.080> see<00:01:34.260> if<00:01:34.350> it'll<00:01:34.470> work

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
flat surface but we'll see if it'll work

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.840 
flat surface but we'll see if it'll work
this<00:01:34.800> way<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.160> right<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:37.280> J<00:01:38.330> jellyfish<00:01:39.330> oh

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
this way all right so J jellyfish oh

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.320 
this way all right so J jellyfish oh
okay<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:46.280> okay<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:48.030> I'm

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
okay now you see that that okay so I'm

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.580 
okay now you see that that okay so I'm
gonna<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.630> ahead<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.900> try<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> flat

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
gonna go ahead and try it on a flat

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.000 
gonna go ahead and try it on a flat
surface

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
surface

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.760 
surface
um<00:01:50.960> because<00:01:51.960> it'll<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.230> easier<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> show<00:01:52.710> you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
um because it'll be easier to show you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.790 
um because it'll be easier to show you
that<00:01:52.980> way<00:01:53.840> okay<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:55.080> now<00:01:55.260> have<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.530> mount<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
that way okay so I now have a mount a

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.130 
that way okay so I now have a mount a
flat<00:01:55.980> surface<00:01:56.280> let's<00:01:57.150> start<00:01:57.390> with<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.720> one

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.140 

so<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.320> frog<00:02:04.580> see<00:02:05.580> if<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.730> can<00:02:05.880> get<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
so that's frog see if I can get it to

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.009 
so that's frog see if I can get it to
come<00:02:06.180> back

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:24.170 

okay

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.500 

okay<00:02:25.180> I've<00:02:25.299> found<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.930> flatter<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
okay I've found that the flatter the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.250 
okay I've found that the flatter the
flashcards<00:02:28.510> are<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.900> better<00:02:29.049> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
flashcards are the better the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.800 
flashcards are the better the
application<00:02:29.829> works<00:02:30.069> as<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.969> can<00:02:31.120> see<00:02:31.359> as<00:02:31.599> we
