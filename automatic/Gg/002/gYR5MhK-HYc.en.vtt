00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270 

ready<00:00:00.240> to<00:00:00.390> do<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.570> final<00:00:00.780> example<00:00:01.230> so<00:00:01.589> iron

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
ready to do the final example so iron

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.120 
ready to do the final example so iron
melts<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.120> little<00:00:03.149> bit<00:00:03.780> after<00:00:03.990> 1,500<00:00:04.710> degrees

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
melts a little bit after 1,500 degrees

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.130 
melts a little bit after 1,500 degrees
Celsius<00:00:05.910> start<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.450> go<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> little<00:00:06.750> bit<00:00:06.930> past

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
Celsius start to go a little bit past

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.900 
Celsius start to go a little bit past
that<00:00:07.259> iono<00:00:07.680> start<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.010> break<00:00:08.160> down<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.639> melt

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
that iono start to break down and melt

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.850 
that iono start to break down and melt
into<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.179> liquid<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:10.110> if<00:00:10.170> we've<00:00:10.290> got<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> car

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
into a liquid so if we've got a car

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.759 
into a liquid so if we've got a car
engine<00:00:11.219> made<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.670> iron<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.719> absolute<00:00:13.410> hottest

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
engine made of iron the absolute hottest

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.400 
engine made of iron the absolute hottest
we<00:00:14.099> could<00:00:14.250> run<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.700> engine<00:00:15.210> would<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.630> 1,500

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
we could run that engine would be 1,500

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.200 
we could run that engine would be 1,500
degrees<00:00:16.470> Celsius<00:00:17.070> right<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.789> don't<00:00:17.910> that

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
degrees Celsius right we don't that

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
degrees Celsius right we don't that
would<00:00:18.270> rather<00:00:18.449> be<00:00:18.630> well<00:00:19.080> okay<00:00:19.350> first<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.710> all

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
would rather be well okay first of all

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.500 
would rather be well okay first of all
in<00:00:19.890> real<00:00:20.070> life<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.340> would<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.730> magical

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
in real life that would be magical

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.179 
in real life that would be magical
because<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.900> oil<00:00:21.930> that's<00:00:22.529> used<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:23.039> lubricate

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
because the oil that's used to lubricate

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.830 
because the oil that's used to lubricate
the<00:00:23.609> engine<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> make<00:00:24.090> sure<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.300> runs<00:00:24.330> smoothly

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the engine to make sure it runs smoothly

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.900 
the engine to make sure it runs smoothly
would<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.260> burned<00:00:25.590> off<00:00:25.890> completely<00:00:26.460> gone<00:00:26.730> by

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
would be burned off completely gone by

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.210 
would be burned off completely gone by
that<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.510> gas<00:00:27.720> gets<00:00:28.019> involved<00:00:28.289> charred<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that the gas gets involved charred the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.650 
that the gas gets involved charred the
engine<00:00:29.580> would<00:00:29.699> just<00:00:29.910> completely<00:00:30.330> stopped

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
engine would just completely stopped

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.470 
engine would just completely stopped
working<00:00:31.019> way<00:00:31.500> before<00:00:31.800> 1500<00:00:32.250> CLS<00:00:32.790> 59<00:00:33.300> degrees

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
working way before 1500 CLS 59 degrees

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.000 
working way before 1500 CLS 59 degrees
Celsius<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.559> definitely<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
Celsius but we can definitely see the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.680 
Celsius but we can definitely see the
but<00:00:35.610> it'd<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.790> hard<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> figure<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
but it'd be hard to figure out what the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.510 
but it'd be hard to figure out what the
precise<00:00:37.050> top<00:00:37.410> level<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.399> can

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
precise top level would be but we can

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.400 
precise top level would be but we can
definitely<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.210> good<00:00:39.420> place<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.899> say

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
definitely see one good place to say

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.290 
definitely see one good place to say
that<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> absolute<00:00:41.010> top<00:00:41.430> value<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> when<00:00:42.090> your

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that the absolute top value is when your

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.690 
that the absolute top value is when your
when<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:42.899> engine<00:00:43.320> turns<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> molten<00:00:44.309> slag

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
when your engine turns to a molten slag

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.959 
when your engine turns to a molten slag
of<00:00:45.270> iron<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:45.989> when<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.260> turns<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.969> liquid

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of iron right when it turns just liquid

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.540 
of iron right when it turns just liquid
iron<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.750> no<00:00:48.960> good<00:00:48.989> anymore<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.309> say

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
iron it's no good anymore so we can say

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
iron it's no good anymore so we can say
that<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.820> top<00:00:51.210> operating<00:00:51.870> heat<00:00:52.320> would<00:00:52.680> be

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
that the top operating heat would be

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.700 
that the top operating heat would be
1,500<00:00:53.489> degrees<00:00:53.550> Celsius<00:00:54.180> absolute<00:00:54.930> top<00:00:55.289> level

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
1,500 degrees Celsius absolute top level

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
1,500 degrees Celsius absolute top level
for<00:00:55.860> an<00:00:55.920> engine<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.820> that's<00:00:57.270> still<00:00:57.480> higher

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
for an engine so that's still higher

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.209 
for an engine so that's still higher
than<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.109> could<00:00:58.230> possibly<00:00:58.260> get<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.949> real<00:00:59.070> life

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
than we could possibly get in real life

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.770 
than we could possibly get in real life
but<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.489> absolute<00:00:59.879> highest<00:01:00.120> temperature<00:01:00.690> we

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
but the absolute highest temperature we

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.420 
but the absolute highest temperature we
could<00:01:00.899> operate<00:01:01.199> an<00:01:01.320> engine<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> 51<00:01:02.219> degrees

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
could operate an engine at is 51 degrees

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.240 
could operate an engine at is 51 degrees
Celsius<00:01:02.910> okay<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.080> car<00:01:04.379> engine<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> running

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
Celsius okay that car engine is running

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.460 
Celsius okay that car engine is running
on<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> 20<00:01:05.939> degrees<00:01:06.240> Celsius<00:01:06.270> day<00:01:06.960> what's<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
on a 20 degrees Celsius day what's the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.200 
on a 20 degrees Celsius day what's the
maximum<00:01:07.920> efficiency<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
maximum efficiency we can get out of it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.120 
maximum efficiency we can get out of it
so<00:01:09.600> remember<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:11.310> maximum<00:01:11.939> efficiency<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
so remember the maximum efficiency is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.469 
so remember the maximum efficiency is
equal<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.250> 0<00:01:14.280> by<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> way<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.090> guy<00:01:15.270> right

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
equal to 0 by the way this guy right

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.340 
equal to 0 by the way this guy right
here<00:01:16.580> he's<00:01:17.580> called<00:01:17.850> epsilon<00:01:18.090> once<00:01:18.780> again<00:01:19.080> yet

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
here he's called epsilon once again yet

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.289 
here he's called epsilon once again yet
another<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.890> our<00:01:20.009> friendly<00:01:20.460> Greek<00:01:20.850> letters

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
another of our friendly Greek letters

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.899 
another of our friendly Greek letters
he's<00:01:21.630> epsilon<00:01:22.409> didn't<00:01:22.770> say<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> earlier<00:01:23.100> but

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
he's epsilon didn't say that earlier but

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.520 
he's epsilon didn't say that earlier but
all<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.270> our<00:01:24.390> efficiency<00:01:24.869> has<00:01:24.900> been<00:01:25.170> using<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
all of our efficiency has been using the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
all of our efficiency has been using the
letter<00:01:25.710> epsilon<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.640> our<00:01:26.850> maximum<00:01:27.540> efficiency

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
letter epsilon so our maximum efficiency

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.010 
letter epsilon so our maximum efficiency
is<00:01:28.409> 1<00:01:29.100> minus<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> temperature<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> cold

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
is 1 minus the temperature of the cold

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.969 
is 1 minus the temperature of the cold
sink<00:01:31.950> /<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.150> temperature<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> hot<00:01:34.259> input

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
sink / the temperature of the hot input

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.100 
sink / the temperature of the hot input
so<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.729> manage<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> run<00:01:36.420> our<00:01:36.540> engine<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:36.990> its

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so if we manage to run our engine at its

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.890 
so if we manage to run our engine at its
absolute<00:01:37.259> highest<00:01:38.250> temperature<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.329> 59

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
absolute highest temperature which is 59

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.620 
absolute highest temperature which is 59
degrees<00:01:40.079> Celsius<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> sort<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.250> a

degrees Celsius in a sort of a
ridiculously<00:01:42.630> high<00:01:42.899> temperature<00:01:43.500> higher

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
ridiculously high temperature higher

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.050 
ridiculously high temperature higher
than<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:44.040> could<00:01:44.159> ever<00:01:44.250> achieve<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.729> real<00:01:44.850> life

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
than we could ever achieve in real life

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.539 
than we could ever achieve in real life
but<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> absolute<00:01:46.350> top<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.040> pull<00:01:47.220> off<00:01:47.250> is

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
but the absolute top we can pull off is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.789 
but the absolute top we can pull off is
1,500<00:01:48.149> degrees<00:01:48.240> celsius<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.560> going

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
1,500 degrees celsius then that's going

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.440 
1,500 degrees celsius then that's going
to<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.220> absolute<00:01:50.369> best<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.240> could<00:01:51.299> have

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
to be the absolute best we could have

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.030 
to be the absolute best we could have
because<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> bigger<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> denominator<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
because the bigger the denominator the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
because the bigger the denominator the
better<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> efficiency<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.270> right

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
better the efficiency we can get right

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.990 
better the efficiency we can get right
if<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.619> number<00:01:55.950> equal<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.610> 0

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
if we can get this number equal to 0

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
if we can get this number equal to 0
we've<00:01:57.329> got<00:01:57.509> perfect<00:01:58.049> efficiency<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.860> want

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
we've got perfect efficiency so we want

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.889 
we've got perfect efficiency so we want
to<00:01:59.070> make<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> giant<00:01:59.700> denominator<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.630> tiny

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899

do would be the temperature around us in

the atmosphere right we're not able to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
interesting idea but

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.839 
interesting idea but
in<00:02:13.709> real<00:02:13.950> life<00:02:13.980> we're<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.519> have<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.700> deal

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
in real life we're going to have to deal

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.130 
in real life we're going to have to deal
with<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> bunch<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.360> other<00:02:15.510> things<00:02:15.780> we've<00:02:16.019> got

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
with a bunch of other things we've got

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.710 
with a bunch of other things we've got
like<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.500> 10<00:02:16.799> fact<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.250> part<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.940> sink

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
like the 10 fact that part of the sink

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.330 
like the 10 fact that part of the sink
is<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.709> engine<00:02:20.159> compartment

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
is going to be the engine compartment

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.860 
is going to be the engine compartment
around<00:02:21.060> us<00:02:21.269> we've<00:02:21.450> got<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.720> engine

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
around us we've got the engine

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.509 
around us we've got the engine
compartment<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.650> that's<00:02:22.980> definitely<00:02:23.400> not

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
compartment and that's definitely not

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.670 
compartment and that's definitely not
going<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.819> be<00:02:23.909> fully<00:02:24.330> room<00:02:24.720> temperature<00:02:25.230> so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
going to be fully room temperature so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.860 
going to be fully room temperature so
we're<00:02:26.190> going<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.580> at<00:02:26.790> best<00:02:27.209> be<00:02:27.510> able<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:27.720> pull

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
we're going to at best be able to pull

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.500 
we're going to at best be able to pull
off<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.019> 20<00:02:28.620> degrees<00:02:28.920> Celsius<00:02:28.950> cold<00:02:29.730> sink<00:02:30.030> so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
off that 20 degrees Celsius cold sink so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.050 
off that 20 degrees Celsius cold sink so
remember<00:02:30.989> we<00:02:31.140> can't<00:02:31.470> use<00:02:31.799> Celsius<00:02:32.400> though<00:02:32.909> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
remember we can't use Celsius though and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.160 
remember we can't use Celsius though and
we're<00:02:33.180> dealing<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.569> because<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.110> be

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
we're dealing this because it be

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.539 
we're dealing this because it be
possible<00:02:34.379> to<00:02:34.620> drop<00:02:34.829> celsius<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
possible to drop celsius and the

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.710 
possible to drop celsius and the
negatives<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.120> then<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.360> whole<00:02:36.450> formula

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
negatives and then this whole formula

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.390 
negatives and then this whole formula
get<00:02:36.989> screwed<00:02:37.260> up<00:02:37.319> we<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:37.950> working<00:02:38.310> in

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
get screwed up we have to be working in

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.970 
get screwed up we have to be working in
Kelvin<00:02:38.819> since<00:02:39.180> Calvin's<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.690> SI<00:02:39.989> unit<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:40.829> if

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
Kelvin since Calvin's the SI unit so if

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.410 
Kelvin since Calvin's the SI unit so if
we<00:02:41.010> want<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.250> make<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.489> into<00:02:41.700> Kelvin<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.239> take

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
we want to make this into Kelvin we take

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.920 
we want to make this into Kelvin we take
each<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.690> these<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:42.959> add<00:02:43.110> 273.15<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.660> cold

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
each of these we add 273.15 so the cold

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.050 
each of these we add 273.15 so the cold
is<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.069> be<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.849> 93.1<00:02:48.810> 5<00:02:49.170> Kelvin<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.060> the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.589

both of those in an hour maximum

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.780 
both of those in an hour maximum

we<00:03:29.669> could<00:03:29.760> get<00:03:29.879> a<00:03:29.970> real<00:03:30.239> life<00:03:30.480> engine<00:03:30.930> to

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
we could get a real life engine to

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.240 
we could get a real life engine to
operate<00:03:31.079> those<00:03:31.650> kinds<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.040> temperatures

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
operate those kinds of temperatures

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.369 
operate those kinds of temperatures
right<00:03:32.579> we<00:03:32.940> tried<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.359> get<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.510> real<00:03:33.750> life<00:03:33.989> engine

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
right we tried to get a real life engine

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.479 
right we tried to get a real life engine
to<00:03:34.470> operate<00:03:34.500> those<00:03:34.950> kinds<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.280> temperatures

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
to operate those kinds of temperatures

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.339 
to operate those kinds of temperatures
kaput<00:03:36.299> there's<00:03:36.569> no<00:03:36.750> way<00:03:37.019> we're<00:03:37.200> going<00:03:37.290> to

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
kaput there's no way we're going to

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.270 
kaput there's no way we're going to
actually<00:03:37.470> be<00:03:37.650> able<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.829> pull<00:03:37.950> off<00:03:37.980> without

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
actually be able to pull off without

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.550 
actually be able to pull off without
completely<00:03:38.879> destroying<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:39.930> ruining

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
completely destroying and just ruining

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.159 
completely destroying and just ruining
our<00:03:40.739> car's<00:03:41.010> engine<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.970> real<00:03:42.449> life<00:03:42.690> we<00:03:42.930> can't

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
our car's engine so real life we can't

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.559 
our car's engine so real life we can't
get<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.769> kind<00:03:44.129> of<00:03:44.370> temperatures<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.090> kind

get that kind of temperatures that kind

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
of temperature in the engine is just

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.949 
of temperature in the engine is just
ridiculous<00:03:47.849> we're<00:03:48.299> not<00:03:48.449> dealing<00:03:48.599> with<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
ridiculous we're not dealing with the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.180 
ridiculous we're not dealing with the
best<00:03:49.169> temperature<00:03:49.500> we<00:03:49.650> could<00:03:49.769> have<00:03:49.889> you<00:03:50.069> know

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
best temperature we could have you know

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.830 
best temperature we could have you know
it<00:03:50.400> clearly<00:03:50.699> be<00:03:50.910> better<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.329> way<00:03:51.449> this<00:03:51.599> works

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
it clearly be better the way this works

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.659 
it clearly be better the way this works
for<00:03:51.989> us<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.230> be<00:03:52.319> driving<00:03:52.799> around<00:03:52.919> in<00:03:53.400> the

for us to be driving around in the

degrees<00:03:55.859> Celsius<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.340> something<00:03:56.549> we<00:03:56.639> can

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
degrees Celsius is something we can

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.129 
degrees Celsius is something we can
definitely<00:03:56.849> pull<00:03:57.180> off<00:03:57.269> but<00:03:57.750> we're<00:03:57.900> not<00:03:58.019> going

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
definitely pull off but we're not going

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
to do way better we can't drop more than

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.390 
to do way better we can't drop more than
like<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.329> know<00:04:00.870> we<00:04:01.590> were<00:04:01.680> managed<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.099> drop<00:04:02.250> to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
like you know we were managed to drop to

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.949 
like you know we were managed to drop to
negative<00:04:02.730> 80<00:04:02.879> Celsius<00:04:03.419> that'd<00:04:03.540> be<00:04:03.660> colder

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
negative 80 Celsius that'd be colder

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.539 
negative 80 Celsius that'd be colder

then<00:04:06.239> be<00:04:06.359> only<00:04:06.510> dropping<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.049> by<00:04:07.169> a<00:04:07.199> hundred

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
then be only dropping it by a hundred

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.020 
then be only dropping it by a hundred
the<00:04:07.859> efficiencies<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:08.549> not<00:04:08.669> going<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.879> bump

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
the efficiencies just not going to bump

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.170 
the efficiencies just not going to bump
up<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.540> much<00:04:09.840> more<00:04:10.199> so<00:04:10.680> 83.5<00:04:11.669> when<00:04:12.030> we're

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
up that much more so 83.5 when we're

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.360 
up that much more so 83.5 when we're
dealing<00:04:12.269> with<00:04:12.449> this<00:04:12.690> magical<00:04:13.049> super<00:04:13.919> engine

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
dealing with this magical super engine

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.210 
dealing with this magical super engine
is<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:15.720> best<00:04:15.900> we<00:04:16.019> can<00:04:16.109> do<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.799> me<00:04:16.919> at<00:04:17.099> least

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
is the best we can do and to me at least

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.550 
is the best we can do and to me at least
83.5<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.959> doesn't<00:04:19.169> sound<00:04:19.289> that<00:04:19.380> great

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
83.5 that doesn't sound that great

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.620 
83.5 that doesn't sound that great
that's<00:04:19.859> getting<00:04:20.160> pretty<00:04:20.190> close<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.789> b-minus

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
that's getting pretty close to a b-minus

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.870 
that's getting pretty close to a b-minus
if<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:21.930> were<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.109> test<00:04:22.409> right<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:23.219> think<00:04:23.789> about

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
if this were a test right so think about

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.580 
if this were a test right so think about
this<00:04:24.120> efficiency<00:04:24.900> is<00:04:24.930> actually<00:04:25.320> really

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
this efficiency is actually really

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.180 
this efficiency is actually really
really<00:04:26.010> hard<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.640> come<00:04:26.820> by

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
really hard to come by

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.790 
really hard to come by
real<00:04:27.340> life<00:04:27.580> 83.5<00:04:28.480> percent<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.140> best<00:04:29.410> this

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
real life 83.5 percent is the best this

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.830 
real life 83.5 percent is the best this
magical<00:04:30.550> engine<00:04:30.940> can<00:04:31.120> do<00:04:31.270> that's<00:04:31.510> able<00:04:31.660> to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
magical engine can do that's able to

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.660 
magical engine can do that's able to
withstand<00:04:32.020> these<00:04:32.470> crazy<00:04:33.040> internal

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
withstand these crazy internal

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.910 
withstand these crazy internal
temperatures<00:04:34.120> if<00:04:35.020> that's<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.530> best<00:04:35.680> we<00:04:35.890> can

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
temperatures if that's the best we can

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.520 
temperatures if that's the best we can
do<00:04:36.190> for<00:04:36.220> our<00:04:36.460> engine<00:04:37.000> that's<00:04:37.690> magical<00:04:38.290> and

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
do for our engine that's magical and

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.020 
do for our engine that's magical and
then<00:04:38.560> remember<00:04:38.890> this<00:04:39.160> is<00:04:39.310> not<00:04:39.430> even<00:04:39.580> including

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.790 
then remember this is not even including

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
already magical engine so if we were to

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.220 
already magical engine so if we were to
introduce<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.480> little<00:04:49.720> bit<00:04:49.840> of<00:04:49.930> real<00:04:50.080> life

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
introduce a little bit of real life

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.510 
introduce a little bit of real life
those<00:04:50.530> numbers<00:04:50.860> are<00:04:50.950> going<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.190> start<00:04:51.370> to

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
those numbers are going to start to

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.150 
those numbers are going to start to
plummet<00:04:51.880> in<00:04:52.000> real<00:04:52.570> life<00:04:52.870> for<00:04:53.170> an<00:04:53.260> actual<00:04:53.680> car

plummet in real life for an actual car

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.220 
plummet in real life for an actual car
engine<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.940> theoretical<00:04:55.720> amount<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:56.140> they

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
engine the theoretical amount that they

engine the theoretical amount that they
can<00:04:56.350> put<00:04:56.530> out<00:04:56.620> so<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.920> theoretical<00:04:57.670> for<00:04:58.000> a

can put out so the theoretical for a
real<00:04:58.510> car<00:04:58.840> engine<00:04:59.140> operating<00:04:59.560> in<00:04:59.770> real

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
real car engine operating in real

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.580 
real car engine operating in real
temperatures<00:05:00.640> so<00:05:01.330> theoretical<00:05:01.960> car<00:05:02.200> engine

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
temperatures so theoretical car engine

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.510 
temperatures so theoretical car engine
is<00:05:02.970> able<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.060> pull<00:05:04.240> off<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.600> round<00:05:05.050> in

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
is able to pull off a round in

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.980 
is able to pull off a round in
efficiency<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.580> around<00:05:06.880> like<00:05:07.120> fifty<00:05:07.690> five

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
efficiency of around like fifty five

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.590 
efficiency of around like fifty five
percent<00:05:08.020> or<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:08.980> so<00:05:09.670> that's<00:05:09.850> that's<00:05:10.420> pretty

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
percent or so so that's that's pretty

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.690 
percent or so so that's that's pretty
great<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.080> in<00:05:11.410> actual<00:05:11.710> car<00:05:12.250> inch<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.580> once

efficiency<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:29.230> really<00:05:29.710> really<00:05:29.920> hard<00:05:30.250> to<00:05:30.430> come

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
if we were able to manage to just double

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.140 
if we were able to manage to just double
this<00:05:41.680> we'd<00:05:42.160> be<00:05:42.280> able<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.490> do<00:05:42.610> great<00:05:43.090> things

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
this we'd be able to do great things

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.720 
this we'd be able to do great things

with the amount of energy we have so one

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.250 
with the amount of energy we have so one

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
of the best things that we could do to

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
get more energies to be able to just

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.030 
get more energies to be able to just
increase<00:05:49.360> our<00:05:49.570> efficiency<00:05:49.660> but<00:05:50.530> there's<00:05:50.890> this

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
increase our efficiency but there's this

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.040 
increase our efficiency but there's this
like<00:05:51.280> hard<00:05:51.760> limit<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.480> best<00:05:52.720> efficiency

like hard limit to the best efficiency

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.710 
like hard limit to the best efficiency
we<00:05:53.530> can<00:05:53.710> get<00:05:53.919> and<00:05:54.130> that's<00:05:54.490> based<00:05:54.700> on<00:05:54.880> our<00:05:55.180> hot

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
we can get and that's based on our hot

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.480 
we can get and that's based on our hot
temperature<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:56.500> our<00:05:56.620> cold<00:05:56.860> temperature<00:05:57.340> and

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
temperature and our cold temperature and

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.950 
temperature and our cold temperature and
unless<00:05:57.940> we're<00:05:58.120> able<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.360> get<00:05:58.480> those<00:05:58.660> really

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
unless we're able to get those really

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.659 
unless we're able to get those really
far<00:05:59.140> indifferent<00:05:59.590> more<00:06:00.040> importantly<00:06:00.490> get<00:06:00.640> a

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
far indifferent more importantly get a

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.780 
far indifferent more importantly get a
really<00:06:00.970> nice<00:06:01.150> cold<00:06:01.660> sink<00:06:02.080> temperature<00:06:02.790> you

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
really nice cold sink temperature you

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.790 
really nice cold sink temperature you
just<00:06:04.000> can't<00:06:04.210> get<00:06:04.450> that<00:06:04.510> great<00:06:05.110> in<00:06:05.260> efficiency

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
just can't get that great in efficiency

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.400 
just can't get that great in efficiency
because<00:06:06.430> of<00:06:06.640> our<00:06:06.820> car<00:06:07.419> no<00:06:07.600> maximum<00:06:08.169> efficiency

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
because of our car no maximum efficiency

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.460 
because of our car no maximum efficiency
so<00:06:09.220> in<00:06:09.610> real<00:06:10.030> life<00:06:10.300> efficiency<00:06:11.140> is<00:06:11.169> really

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
so in real life efficiency is really

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.710 
so in real life efficiency is really
hard<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.770> come<00:06:12.070> by<00:06:12.220> so<00:06:12.490> an<00:06:12.669> actual<00:06:13.120> car<00:06:13.330> is<00:06:13.510> able

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
hard to come by so an actual car is able

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.120 
hard to come by so an actual car is able
to<00:06:13.780> pull<00:06:13.930> off<00:06:14.020> around<00:06:14.230> twenty-five<00:06:14.890> percent

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
to pull off around twenty-five percent

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.880 
to pull off around twenty-five percent
so<00:06:15.940> most<00:06:16.810> of<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:16.990> gasoline<00:06:17.470> you<00:06:17.590> wind<00:06:17.770> up

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
so most of the gasoline you wind up

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.440 
so most of the gasoline you wind up
doing<00:06:18.010> wind<00:06:18.520> up<00:06:18.669> burning<00:06:19.000> in<00:06:19.090> your<00:06:19.120> car

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
doing wind up burning in your car

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.030 
doing wind up burning in your car
actually<00:06:20.050> just<00:06:20.140> goes<00:06:20.350> to<00:06:20.530> heating<00:06:20.680> up<00:06:20.890> the<00:06:20.919> air

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
actually just goes to heating up the air

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.580 
actually just goes to heating up the air
around<00:06:21.340> you<00:06:21.669> kind<00:06:22.330> of<00:06:22.390> disappointing<00:06:22.590> but

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
around you kind of disappointing but

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.990 
around you kind of disappointing but
certainly<00:06:24.190> really<00:06:24.400> interesting<00:06:24.700> and<00:06:24.880> that's

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
certainly really interesting and that's

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.550 
certainly really interesting and that's
the<00:06:25.090> nature<00:06:25.240> of<00:06:25.360> thermodynamics<00:06:25.660> a<00:06:26.260> lot<00:06:26.440> of

that's how things are going to go with

that's how things are going to go with
