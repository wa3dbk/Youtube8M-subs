00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.599
 Start by cutting a rectangle 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.599
 wood do it very carefully 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.890
 now mark a point in the middle of 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.040
 wooden box and makes a hole 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.800
 elongated catches a binding clip and 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.750
 pass it a paper clip now take the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.240
 bind and insert what 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.140
 inside the hole of the wood look 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.140
 how we do 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.590
 go back to making a hole in the wood 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.989
 in front of the one that is already done and passes 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.000
 a binding clip checks that the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.489
 clip can play the 2 binders 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.379
 at the same time if it is not like that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.949
 you will have to make the nearest holes 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.949
 among them 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.780
 place a crocodile clip at each 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.310
 pole of the pile one of the clamps should 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.410
 go from the pole of the pile to one of the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.930
 binding clips placed on the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.880
 wood hooks another crocodile clip 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.130
 to the wood so that it touches one of 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.710
 the binding clips and the other clip 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.600
 stay free connect now the clamp that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.150
 you get loose from the pile with one of 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.890
 the speaker spokesman cables still you 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.380
 there is a clamp that you must join also 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.090
 to the remaining cable of the spokesman villas and 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.860
 now it's just you need to move the clip 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.860
 to see when the bulb goes on
