progressive<00:00:02.460> sidestep<00:00:03.030> let's<00:00:03.780> demonstrate

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
progressive sidestep let's demonstrate

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.660 
progressive sidestep let's demonstrate
it<00:00:04.500> with<00:00:04.980> two<00:00:05.130> different<00:00:05.279> timings<00:00:07.340> the<00:00:08.340> normal

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
it with two different timings the normal

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.580 
it with two different timings the normal
timing<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.090> progressive<00:00:09.570> sidestep<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.200> quick

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
timing to progressive sidestep is quick

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.759 
timing to progressive sidestep is quick
quick<00:00:10.620> but<00:00:11.550> we've<00:00:11.700> chosen<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.690> slow<00:00:13.049> slow

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
quick but we've chosen to do slow slow

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:26.980 
quick but we've chosen to do slow slow
and<00:00:18.560> slow<00:00:19.640> slow<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.890> from<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.980> different<00:00:23.160> angle

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:36.069 

and<00:00:29.779> one<00:00:30.779> two<00:00:31.349> three<00:00:31.700> four

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.220 

progressive<00:00:37.079> sidestep<00:00:37.559> leaders<00:00:38.399> technique

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
progressive sidestep leaders technique

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
progressive sidestep leaders technique
in<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.530> progressive<00:00:41.010> sidestep<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:42.120> very

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
in the progressive sidestep it's very

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
in the progressive sidestep it's very
similar<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.230> two<00:00:43.410> walks<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.309> first<00:00:44.610> step

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
similar to the two walks the first step

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.479 
similar to the two walks the first step
again<00:00:45.570> begins<00:00:46.200> forward<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> left<00:00:47.250> foot

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
again begins forward on the left foot

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.779 
again begins forward on the left foot
with<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> slight<00:00:48.510> curve<00:00:48.750> from<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.469> leg

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
with a slight curve from the right leg

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.950 
with a slight curve from the right leg
so<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:52.129> slow<00:00:53.180> now<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> difference<00:00:54.719> comes

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
so we have slow now the difference comes

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.910 
so we have slow now the difference comes
in<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.530> next<00:00:56.520> step<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.210> two<00:00:57.989> walks<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.530> will

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
in on the next step in two walks I will

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.010 
in on the next step in two walks I will
continue<00:00:59.190> along<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.550> curve<00:00:59.940> however<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
continue along that curve however on the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
continue along that curve however on the
progressive<00:01:01.469> side<00:01:01.500> step<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> use

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
progressive side step I'm going to use

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160 
progressive side step I'm going to use
the<00:01:02.879> inside<00:01:03.239> edge<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:03.840> foot<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the inside edge of my right foot and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.780 
the inside edge of my right foot and
step<00:01:04.739> diagonally<00:01:05.519> forward<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> lady<00:01:07.790> okay

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
step diagonally forward to the lady okay

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.330 
step diagonally forward to the lady okay
one<00:01:09.240> more<00:01:09.390> time<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.630> slow<00:01:13.909> slow<00:01:16.340> even

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
one more time so I have slow slow even

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.530 
one more time so I have slow slow even
though<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> name<00:01:17.729> says<00:01:18.000> progressive

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
though the name says progressive

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.380 
though the name says progressive
sidestep<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.740> actually<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.390> sideways

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
sidestep I'm not actually going sideways

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.870 
sidestep I'm not actually going sideways
I'm<00:01:21.900> moving<00:01:22.650> diagonally<00:01:22.860> forward<00:01:23.369> towards<00:01:23.759> my

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
I'm moving diagonally forward towards my

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.450 
I'm moving diagonally forward towards my
lady<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.780> she<00:01:24.869> knows<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.950> progressive

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
lady so she knows that it's progressive

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
lady so she knows that it's progressive
sidestep<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> from<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.350> different<00:01:28.530> angle<00:01:30.290> we

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
sidestep so from a different angle we

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.609 
sidestep so from a different angle we
have<00:01:31.640> slow<00:01:33.079> slow<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:35.390> as<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.780> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
have slow slow and as you can see that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.550 
have slow slow and as you can see that
when<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> take<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.340> right<00:01:38.549> foot<00:01:38.850> slow<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:40.259> going

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
when I take my right foot slow I'm going

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.100 
when I take my right foot slow I'm going
to<00:01:40.710> place<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> inside<00:01:41.490> edge<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> my<00:01:41.939> foot<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
to place the inside edge of my foot and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.480 
to place the inside edge of my foot and
then<00:01:43.229> transfer<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> weight<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.280> very

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
then transfer the weight it's very

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.800 
then transfer the weight it's very
important<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> place<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> inside<00:01:45.600> edge<00:01:45.720> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
important to place the inside edge of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.319 
important to place the inside edge of
that<00:01:45.960> foot<00:01:46.140> first<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:47.340> flatter<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.119> foot

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that foot first and not flatter the foot

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.670 
that foot first and not flatter the foot
because<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.930> very<00:01:49.140> difficult<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
because it will be very difficult to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.670 
because it will be very difficult to
stop<00:01:49.920> yourself<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.689> time<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:53.509> slow

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
stop yourself so one more time and slow

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.960 
stop yourself so one more time and slow
slow

progessive sidestep followers technique
just<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.690> two<00:02:04.080> walks<00:02:04.320> we're<00:02:04.920> starting<00:02:05.580> with

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
just as two walks we're starting with

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.040 
just as two walks we're starting with
the<00:02:06.150> right<00:02:06.300> foot<00:02:06.360> moving<00:02:07.200> backwards<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:09.050> slow

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the right foot moving backwards and slow

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.040 
the right foot moving backwards and slow
and<00:02:10.350> we<00:02:11.130> are<00:02:11.220> releasing<00:02:11.550> our<00:02:11.910> left<00:02:12.240> heel<00:02:12.510> left

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and we are releasing our left heel left

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.770 
and we are releasing our left heel left
toe<00:02:13.350> now<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.370> are<00:02:14.730> doing<00:02:15.000> step<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> side

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780

step open technique so as I take my lady
into<00:02:48.000> position<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.500> progressive<00:02:49.980> side<00:02:50.010> step

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
into position the progressive side step

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.340 
into position the progressive side step
first<00:02:52.290> steps<00:02:52.590> forward<00:02:53.070> towards<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> lady<00:02:54.350> the

first steps forward towards the lady the
second<00:02:55.800> one<00:02:55.950> moves<00:02:56.610> diagonally<00:02:56.790> towards<00:02:57.360> her

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
second one moves diagonally towards her

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.300 
second one moves diagonally towards her
as<00:02:58.519> a<00:02:59.519> basic<00:03:00.030> figure<00:03:00.300> there<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.510> no<00:03:00.780> shape

as a basic figure there is no shape
however<00:03:02.510> we're<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.720> choose<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.410> it

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
however we're going to choose to do it

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.800 
however we're going to choose to do it
slower<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.850> with<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.570> little<00:03:06.810> bit<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.110> shape<00:03:08.810> to

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
slower and with a little bit of shape to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.390 
slower and with a little bit of shape to
make<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.110> basic<00:03:10.470> figure<00:03:10.650> progressive

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
make the basic figure progressive

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.720 
make the basic figure progressive
sidestep<00:03:11.790> more<00:03:12.000> impressive<00:03:12.709> slow<00:03:14.150> slow<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:17.640> as

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
sidestep more impressive slow slow so as

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.670 
sidestep more impressive slow slow so as
you<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:18.030> see<00:03:18.090> what<00:03:18.480> I've<00:03:18.600> done<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:19.049> I've

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
you can see what I've done is I've

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.280 
you can see what I've done is I've
tilted<00:03:20.100> my<00:03:20.250> body<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:21.510> allow<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.260> open

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
tilted my body to allow on it to open

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.120 
tilted my body to allow on it to open
our<00:03:22.590> head<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:23.790> creates<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.500> more<00:03:25.500> open<00:03:25.860> shape

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
our head this creates a more open shape

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.060 
our head this creates a more open shape
and<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.760> dramatic<00:03:27.209> look<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.650> from<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:28.920> different

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
and a dramatic look so from a different

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:39.680 
and a dramatic look so from a different
angle<00:03:32.450> we<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:34.100> slow<00:03:35.420> slow<00:03:38.150> it's<00:03:39.150> important

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
angle we have slow slow it's important

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.720 
angle we have slow slow it's important
when<00:03:39.900> doing<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.190> give<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.549> lady

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
when doing this that you give the lady

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.060 
when doing this that you give the lady
the<00:03:41.910> signal<00:03:42.329> not<00:03:43.110> only<00:03:43.380> through<00:03:43.560> direction

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
the signal not only through direction

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.390 
the signal not only through direction
but<00:03:44.610> also<00:03:45.120> through<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.570> body<00:03:45.780> action<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:47.130> as<00:03:47.250> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
but also through a body action so as I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.000 
but also through a body action so as I
mentioned<00:03:47.820> in<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.060> leaders<00:03:48.630> technique<00:03:49.049> my

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
mentioned in the leaders technique my

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.220 
mentioned in the leaders technique my
second<00:03:50.430> step<00:03:50.640> must<00:03:50.940> move<00:03:51.150> diagonally<00:03:51.900> forward

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
second step must move diagonally forward

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.300 
second step must move diagonally forward
towards<00:03:53.010> my<00:03:53.130> partner<00:03:54.470> slow<00:03:55.470> now<00:03:55.980> I'm<00:03:56.130> not

towards my partner slow now I'm not

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.100 
towards my partner slow now I'm not
going<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.519> move<00:03:56.610> sideways<00:03:56.970> because<00:03:57.480> then<00:03:57.900> she

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
going to move sideways because then she

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.690 
going to move sideways because then she
can't<00:03:58.320> follow<00:03:58.560> I'm<00:03:59.040> going<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.549> move

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
can't follow I'm going to move

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.390 
can't follow I'm going to move

will put my body on her so that she can

will put my body on her so that she can
feel<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.310> change<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:07.139> angle<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> my<00:04:07.560> body

your direction make sure that you follow
exactly<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:29.030> amount<00:04:29.389> of<00:04:29.630> movement<00:04:29.870> he<00:04:30.650> is

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
exactly the amount of movement he is

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.870 
exactly the amount of movement he is
producing<00:04:31.880> yes<00:04:32.870> don't<00:04:33.410> consider<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:34.040> as<00:04:34.310> your

producing yes don't consider it as your

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.659 
producing yes don't consider it as your
independent<00:04:35.840> step<00:04:36.110> diagonally<00:04:37.070> back<00:04:37.310> because

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
independent step diagonally back because

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.400 
independent step diagonally back because
