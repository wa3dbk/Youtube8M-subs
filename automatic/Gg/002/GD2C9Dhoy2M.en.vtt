00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
cure the problem so let's have a look

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.579 
cure the problem so let's have a look
and<00:00:27.280> see<00:00:27.460> if<00:00:27.490> it<00:00:27.640> has<00:00:27.820> Q<00:00:28.030> with<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.210> problem

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:45.979 

what<00:00:32.589> iPod<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:36.309> connector<00:00:41.370> iPod<00:00:42.370> connected

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:59.340 

ignition<00:00:46.989> on

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.299 

and<00:01:00.350> as<00:01:00.500> of<00:01:00.620> yet<00:01:00.770> it<00:01:00.950> hasn't<00:01:01.550> recognized<00:01:03.309> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
and as of yet it hasn't recognized the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:18.180 
and as of yet it hasn't recognized the
USB<00:01:04.640> device<00:01:05.110> let's<00:01:06.110> give<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.290> another<00:01:06.380> shot

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.210 

connecting<00:01:19.190> now<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:21.020> not<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.590> great<00:01:21.920> deal<00:01:22.130> of

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
connecting now so not a great deal of

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:33.540 
connecting now so not a great deal of
success<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:22.759> far<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:25.070> have<00:01:25.250> your<00:01:25.420> iPod

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.469 

obviously<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.640> speed<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.940> connection<00:01:35.300> hasn't

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
obviously the speed of connection hasn't

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.760 
obviously the speed of connection hasn't
improved<00:01:35.869> any<00:01:41.170> one<00:01:42.170> thing<00:01:42.289> I<00:01:42.410> have<00:01:42.560> noticed

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
improved any one thing I have noticed

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.400 
improved any one thing I have noticed
straight<00:01:43.610> away<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:44.000> that<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.899> has<00:01:45.050> actually

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
straight away is that it has actually

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.310 
straight away is that it has actually
started<00:01:45.649> playing<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.490> last<00:01:46.729> song<00:01:47.179> that<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.170> was

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
started playing the last song that I was

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.260 
started playing the last song that I was
playing<00:01:48.619> on<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.860> system<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:50.600> there's<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:50.929> bonus

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
playing on the system so there's a bonus

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.300 
playing on the system so there's a bonus
so<00:01:53.270> let's<00:01:53.479> have<00:01:53.539> a<00:01:53.600> look<00:01:53.830> what<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.860> functions

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
so let's have a look what the functions

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.910 
so let's have a look what the functions
have<00:01:55.399> improved<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:57.380> thing<00:01:57.530> I<00:01:57.590> have<00:01:57.710> noticed

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
have improved one thing I have noticed

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.920 
have improved one thing I have noticed
straight<00:01:58.220> away<00:01:59.050> same<00:02:00.050> one-stroke<00:02:00.710> one<00:02:01.930> that

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
straight away same one-stroke one that

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.340 
straight away same one-stroke one that
means<00:02:03.110> it's<00:02:03.290> only<00:02:03.409> recognizing<00:02:04.009> one<00:02:04.220> song

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
means it's only recognizing one song

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.169 
means it's only recognizing one song
what<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.470> song<00:02:06.649> list<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.549> actually<00:02:07.729> nothing

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
what the song list is actually nothing

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.350 
what the song list is actually nothing
