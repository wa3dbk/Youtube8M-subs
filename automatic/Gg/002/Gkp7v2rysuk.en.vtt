00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.380
 Good day to everyone, I want to take another one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.170
 video about your stove 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:16.340
 the stove has not changed this pipe 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:20.990
 219 means this is a control cabinet to which 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.910
 us fan could power supply 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:29.099
 here adjusting resistors are taken out 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.170
 out and additionally another voltmeter 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.980
 here we bring it out for control 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.290
 oil stress us fall 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.880
 what has changed in the stove but 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.120
 oil is made as 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.910
 my understanding is it should look like this 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:58.330
 200 liter and his barrel is omitted 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:58.330
 Circuit oil pump on the barrel there 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.079
 drain tap 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.640
 and bath to drain water 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.630
 so here we get 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.630
 guard opening 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.230
 good clean oil is sweated 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.790
 water no water he just in case 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.560
 means 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.140
 what else is installed funnel 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.120
 for oil filling if oil is clean 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.240
 accordingly just fill in if 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.950
 dirty oil then pour through 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.979
 colander 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.280
 are you there that in oil maybe this in 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.790
 mostly sawdust trash dirt 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.210
 any nonsense . 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.830
 level indicator installed 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.140
 here you go 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.460
 the level we have here it is worth 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.590
 now about there 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.570
 two thirds barrels of oil 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.350
 but visually you can control there is not 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.910
 poppies and all kinds of sticks to watch 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.660
 how is it how does it do us to refuel 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.080
 it means the oil is filled with good now 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.960
 consumption of about a liter per hour is 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.310
 voltage on the motor 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.820
 somewhere around 6 volts about six 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.820
 as says 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.640
 work stove already 7 and 8 hours 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.660
 24 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.730
 the most optimal 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.120
 the most optimal time period is about 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.270
 12 hours then cleaning is enough 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.280
 easy and still there is no sueza 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.340
 burns 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.000
 that's what happens after 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.319
 such 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.740
 Slag yellow gray black 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.790
 and it is easily removed with the mushroom 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.790
 mushroom fun 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.130
 means 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.130
 just in case we measure the temperature of the stove 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.209
 what pyrometer simon sensor 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.209
 up to 1400 grams 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.140
 change the temperature well that is 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.980
 hot surface temperature somewhere 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.319
 500 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.269
 530 five hundred forty degrees the hottest 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:47.909
 place but the metal does not fade on the stove 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.739
 painted with heat resistant paint with 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.470
 aluminum powder here is the bottom 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.860
 it can be seen that aluminum has already penetrated 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.489
 metal pipe and nu-metal no way 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.769
 changing that is, this stove is already working 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.049
 third year and not done at all 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.019
 internally outside the central tube she 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:10.350
 too black 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:14.770
 no dyeing works either. 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.860
 but the exhaust of a flexible corrugation is worth 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.489
 and exhaust large chimney 150 chimney 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.590
 stainless steel 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.990
 but this site is still 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.770
 additional heat source 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.460
 premises stove heats in common 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.930
 complexity is somewhere 80 square and 78 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.849
 that is, we are now in the basement 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.770
 basement area 27 top 27 more and there 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:47.380
 still near god 20 more 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:54.820
 only 78 square at 78 rubles 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:58.290
 it turns out 8181 square in general here 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:02.760
 how should look perfect oil tank 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.760
 to supply oil to the oven 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.110
 Thank you all for your kind attention
