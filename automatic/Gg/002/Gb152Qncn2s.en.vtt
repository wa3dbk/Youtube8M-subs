in<00:00:03.300> this<00:00:03.540> tutorial<00:00:03.810> I'll<00:00:04.350> show<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.650> how<00:00:04.770> to

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
in this tutorial I'll show you how to

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.089 
in this tutorial I'll show you how to
create<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.759> edit<00:00:06.000> actions<00:00:06.870> which<00:00:07.440> are<00:00:07.649> stored

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
create and edit actions which are stored

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.240 
create and edit actions which are stored
animations<00:00:09.019> which<00:00:10.019> can<00:00:10.290> be<00:00:10.410> reused<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:11.070> make

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
animations which can be reused to make

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.490 
animations which can be reused to make
longer<00:00:11.490> animations<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.540> used<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.259> games<00:00:18.500> open

the<00:00:19.590> spot<00:00:19.859> file<00:00:22.160> change<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> layout<00:00:23.460> from

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the spot file change the layout from

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.320 
the spot file change the layout from
default<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.840> animation<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> animation

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
default to animation and the animation

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
default to animation and the animation
layer<00:00:27.510> has<00:00:27.810> lots<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.230> windows<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
layer has lots of windows this is a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.400 
layer has lots of windows this is a
graph<00:00:29.460> editor<00:00:29.640> window<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.449> won't<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.929> using<00:00:31.140> it

graph editor window I won't be using it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290 
graph editor window I won't be using it
so<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:31.980> dragging<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> diagonal<00:00:33.059> lines

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
so I'm dragging on the diagonal lines

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.889 
so I'm dragging on the diagonal lines
from<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> window<00:00:34.649> above<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.219> rid<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> it

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
from the window above to get rid of it

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.500 
from the window above to get rid of it
