what I want to show you right now and

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.010 
what I want to show you right now and
this<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.819> important<00:00:06.359> before<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.690> put<00:00:06.870> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
this is important before you put the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.730 
this is important before you put the
crank<00:00:07.350> case<00:00:07.410> back<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:08.150> this<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.740> oil

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
crank case back on this is the oil

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.820 
crank case back on this is the oil
slinger<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:12.049> stirs<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> oil<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:13.590> around

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
slinger that stirs the oil up around

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.230 
slinger that stirs the oil up around
inside<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> crank<00:00:14.400> case<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.820> make<00:00:14.910> sure<00:00:15.030> that

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
inside the crank case and make sure that

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.400 
inside the crank case and make sure that
everything<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.780> lubricated<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:18.020> on<00:00:19.020> this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
everything is lubricated and on this

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.880 
everything is lubricated and on this
side<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.039> oil<00:00:20.660> slinger<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:22.230> beveled<00:00:22.560> in

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
side of the oil slinger it's beveled in

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.519 
side of the oil slinger it's beveled in
and<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.670> side<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> flat<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.230> put<00:00:25.439> this

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
and this side is flat when we put this

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.589 
and this side is flat when we put this
back<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.980> place<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.910> important<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
back in place it's important that the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.169 
back in place it's important that the
bevel<00:00:27.960> side<00:00:28.140> goes<00:00:28.949> against<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> camshaft

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
bevel side goes against the camshaft

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.970 
bevel side goes against the camshaft
like<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:32.300> also<00:00:33.300> another<00:00:33.540> thing<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.680> crank

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
like so also another thing on the crank

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.260 
like so also another thing on the crank
cover<00:00:35.790> itself<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:37.170> part<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> crank<00:00:37.829> case

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
cover itself this part of the crank case

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.110 
cover itself this part of the crank case
actually<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.960> where<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> ball<00:00:40.590> end<00:00:41.120> this

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
actually that's where the ball end this

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.779 
actually that's where the ball end this
end<00:00:42.450> here<00:00:43.850> will<00:00:44.850> sit<00:00:45.120> inside<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
end here will sit inside that and it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.840 
end here will sit inside that and it
will<00:00:47.910> move<00:00:48.000> back<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.300> forth<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.039> when

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
will move back and forth like so when

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.650 
will move back and forth like so when
the<00:00:51.000> engines<00:00:51.329> running<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the engines running so that is the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.029 
the engines running so that is the
proper<00:00:55.050> way<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.199> install<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> oil<00:00:58.230> slinger

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.120 

all<00:01:03.910> right<00:01:04.059> now<00:01:04.210> we're<00:01:04.420> ready<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.830> next

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
all right now we're ready to the next

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.030 
all right now we're ready to the next
step<00:01:06.659> which<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:07.689> going<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.439> be<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.740> put<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
step which is going to be to put the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.530 
step which is going to be to put the
gasket<00:01:09.280> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:11.080> gasket<00:01:11.320> for<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.770> crankcase

00:01:37.020 --> 00:02:38.949 

it<00:01:37.530> doesn't<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.250> much

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.660 

and<00:02:39.560> we're<00:02:39.709> going<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:39.980> set<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.579> in<00:02:40.819> place

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.440 

put<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> little<00:03:05.440> grease

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:21.850 

and<00:03:11.450> our<00:03:11.599> oil<00:03:11.629> slinger<00:03:12.260> here

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.380 

we<00:03:22.280> also<00:03:22.430> want<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.760> put<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.970> little<00:03:23.090> grease

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
we also want to put a little grease

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:45.820 
we also want to put a little grease
around<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.480> crankshaft

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.150 

and<00:03:46.130> then<00:03:46.520> now<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.820> tricky<00:03:47.270> part<00:03:47.830> is<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:49.040> get

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
and then now the tricky part is to get

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.970 
and then now the tricky part is to get
the<00:03:49.280> crank<00:03:49.520> cover<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:51.640> these<00:03:52.640> knobs<00:03:52.940> here<00:03:53.980> are

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
the crank cover and these knobs here are

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.570 
the crank cover and these knobs here are
going<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.250> fit<00:03:55.460> in<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.790> couple<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.420> holes<00:03:56.630> here

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
going to fit in a couple of holes here

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.250 
going to fit in a couple of holes here
we<00:03:58.580> got<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.790> make<00:03:58.880> sure<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.330> oil<00:03:59.540> slinger

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
we got to make sure that the oil slinger

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.400 
we got to make sure that the oil slinger
the<00:04:00.470> ball<00:04:00.680> in<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:00.950> end<00:04:01.100> fits<00:04:01.850> in<00:04:01.970> there<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.790> a

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
the ball in the end fits in there so a

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:22.700 
the ball in the end fits in there so a
lot<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.560> things<00:04:06.710> have<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:06.890> line<00:04:07.160> up<00:04:07.190> here

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.820 

and<00:04:23.710> there<00:04:24.070> we<00:04:24.190> go

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
and there we go

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.100 
and there we go
crankcase<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:27.010> put<00:04:27.190> on<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:28.660> now<00:04:28.810> we'll<00:04:28.960> bolt

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
crankcase is put on and now we'll bolt

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.380 
crankcase is put on and now we'll bolt
it<00:04:29.260> up
