wish it snowed here in New Zealand in
the<00:01:44.070> winter<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:44.939> gonna<00:01:45.149> put<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.689> onto<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the winter I'm gonna put that onto the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
the winter I'm gonna put that onto the
like<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.890> swing<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.610> side<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
like that to swing down that side and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.850 
like that to swing down that side and
then<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> get<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> little<00:01:49.680> bit

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
then I'm just going to get a little bit

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.560 
then I'm just going to get a little bit
of<00:01:49.950> wine<00:01:50.220> I'm<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> put<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.360> down

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
of wine I'm just going to put that down

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.859 
of wine I'm just going to put that down
there

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
there

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
there
now<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:52.560> wonder<00:01:52.920> worrying<00:01:53.430> about<00:01:53.549> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
now I'm not wonder worrying about that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.399 
now I'm not wonder worrying about that
sticking<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> side<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
sticking out the side like that but I

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
sticking out the side like that but I
think<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.009> sort<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.729> looks<00:01:56.969> like

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
think that that sort of like looks like

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
think that that sort of like looks like
maybe<00:01:57.810> she's<00:01:58.079> got<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> broken<00:01:58.530> wing<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.219> one

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
maybe she's got a broken wing this one

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.980 
maybe she's got a broken wing this one
but<00:01:59.700> never<00:01:59.820> mind<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.270> will<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.509> fine<00:02:00.750> down

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
but never mind that will be fine down

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.899 
but never mind that will be fine down
there<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:02.159> I'm<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> bring

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
there and then I'm going to bring

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.899 
there and then I'm going to bring
another<00:02:03.420> piece<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
another piece of that up like that and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.310 
another piece of that up like that and
I'm<00:02:06.000> gonna<00:02:06.119> put<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.960> now<00:02:07.259> she

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
I'm gonna put that there and now she

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.859 
I'm gonna put that there and now she
looks<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.890> she's<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.160> come<00:02:08.700> through<00:02:08.869> from

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
looks like she's just come through from

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.889 
looks like she's just come through from
the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.289 
the
anxious<00:02:11.290> okay<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.370> then<00:02:12.579> just<00:02:12.610> hold<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.209> in

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
anxious okay and then just hold that in

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.360 
anxious okay and then just hold that in
place<00:02:13.510> if<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.170> was<00:02:14.439> just<00:02:14.470> going<00:02:14.829> to<00:02:14.950> sit<00:02:15.159> on

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
place if this was just going to sit on

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.979 
place if this was just going to sit on
you<00:02:16.000> know<00:02:16.090> you're<00:02:16.269> doing<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.569> for<00:02:16.720> your<00:02:16.780> dining

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
you know you're doing it for your dining

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.720 
you know you're doing it for your dining
table<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.620> weren't<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.459> moving

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
table and you weren't going to be moving

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.550 
table and you weren't going to be moving
you<00:02:19.209> don't<00:02:19.390> actually<00:02:19.569> have<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.959> do<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.409> but

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
you don't actually have to do that but

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.530 
you don't actually have to do that but
sometimes<00:02:20.799> it's<00:02:21.220> easy<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.640> do<00:02:21.819> that<00:02:22.060> now<00:02:22.299> and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
sometimes it's easy to do that now and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.589 
sometimes it's easy to do that now and
get<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.049> up<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.349> road<00:02:23.610> now<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:25.090> next<00:02:25.269> thing<00:02:25.480> I

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
get it up the road now the next thing I

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.800 
get it up the road now the next thing I
want<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> put<00:02:26.019> in<00:02:26.110> here<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.430> love<00:02:27.879> this<00:02:28.090> cut

want to put in here is I love this cut
here<00:02:29.200> with<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.470> theories<00:02:29.859> and<00:02:30.069> I'm<00:02:30.400> just

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
here with the theories and I'm just

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.809 
here with the theories and I'm just
going<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.909> just<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:31.359> manipulate<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:33.040> I

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
going to just like manipulate that and I

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.599 
going to just like manipulate that and I
thought<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.569> would<00:02:34.780> bring<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.409> and<00:02:35.799> over<00:02:36.459> to

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
thought I would bring that and over to

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.610 
thought I would bring that and over to
that<00:02:36.790> side<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.359> that<00:02:37.569> now<00:02:38.049> this<00:02:38.260> would<00:02:38.470> look

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
that side like that now this would look

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.190 
that side like that now this would look
just<00:02:38.950> beautiful<00:02:39.189> editor's<00:02:40.120> on<00:02:40.390> its<00:02:40.659> own<00:02:40.900> if

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
just beautiful editor's on its own if

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.140 
just beautiful editor's on its own if
you<00:02:41.319> wanted<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.859> put<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.189> a<00:02:42.340> little<00:02:42.819> bit<00:02:43.120> of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
you wanted to put on a little bit of

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.180 
you wanted to put on a little bit of
foliage<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.139> could<00:02:44.500> perhaps<00:02:44.680> put<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
foliage you could perhaps put the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.759 
foliage you could perhaps put the
foliage<00:02:45.609> into<00:02:46.000> here<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.930> come<00:02:47.170> out<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.500> side

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
foliage into here to come out the side

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
and a bit out there and then I thought

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.490 
and a bit out there and then I thought
that<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.549> little<00:02:52.000> bit<00:02:52.180> out<00:02:52.359> that<00:02:52.720> side<00:02:53.079> would<00:02:53.290> be

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
that a little bit out that side would be

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.589 
that a little bit out that side would be
quite<00:02:53.950> nice<00:02:54.159> says<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.549> I've<00:02:54.639> got<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.909> evenly

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
quite nice says that I've got it evenly

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.319 
quite nice says that I've got it evenly
balanced<00:02:56.170> from<00:02:56.680> via<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.370> now<00:02:57.579> time<00:02:57.639> to<00:02:57.939> put
