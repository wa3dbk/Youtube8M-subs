00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.750 
controls are compared to the original
but<00:02:45.820> it's<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:46.930> going<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.110> be<00:02:47.550> one<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:48.640> those

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
but it's just going to be one of those

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.320 
but it's just going to be one of those
things<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.710> deal<00:02:51.070> with<00:02:51.400> if<00:02:52.120> I'm

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
things that you have to deal with if I'm

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.390 
things that you have to deal with if I'm
playing<00:02:52.510> arcade<00:02:53.110> games<00:02:53.410> which<00:02:54.100> I'm<00:02:54.220> probably

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
playing arcade games which I'm probably

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.080 
playing arcade games which I'm probably
not<00:02:54.580> going<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.760> end<00:02:54.910> up<00:02:54.970> playing<00:02:55.210> very<00:02:55.480> many

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
not going to end up playing very many

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.770 
not going to end up playing very many
simply<00:02:58.090> because<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.780> fact<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.780> these

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
simply because of that fact so these

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.750 
simply because of that fact so these
landing<00:03:02.230> areas<00:03:02.590> start<00:03:02.890> getting<00:03:02.950> smaller<00:03:03.489> and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
landing areas start getting smaller and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.070 
landing areas start getting smaller and
smaller<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:06.000> these<00:03:07.000> mazes<00:03:07.239> start<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.900> get

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
smaller and these mazes start to get

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.870 
smaller and these mazes start to get
very<00:03:09.150> complex<00:03:13.860> see<00:03:14.860> now<00:03:15.010> here<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.370> have<00:03:15.520> to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
very complex see now here you have to

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.570 
very complex see now here you have to
jump<00:03:16.480> at<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.810> right<00:03:16.959> time<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.470> then<00:03:17.590> move

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
jump at the right time and then move

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:27.559 
jump at the right time and then move
over<00:03:18.790> very<00:03:19.650> quickly<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.860> hit<00:03:24.040> my<00:03:24.190> head

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.119 

nope<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:30.670> just<00:03:31.080> again<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.379> word<00:03:32.650> i<00:03:32.800> was<00:03:32.950> using

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
nope you just again the word i was using

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.540 
nope you just again the word i was using
with<00:03:33.340> crystal<00:03:33.730> castles<00:03:34.209> was<00:03:34.750> finesse<00:03:35.550> and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
with crystal castles was finesse and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.880 
with crystal castles was finesse and
with<00:03:37.360> this<00:03:37.569> game<00:03:37.870> it's<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.650> same<00:03:38.860> thing

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
with this game it's the same thing

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.430 
with this game it's the same thing
crystal<00:03:39.700> castles<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.450> was<00:03:40.629> trackball<00:03:41.200> with

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
crystal castles it was trackball with

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.400 
crystal castles it was trackball with
this<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.890> was<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> spinner<00:03:42.430> control<00:03:43.349> well<00:03:44.349> at

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
this it was a spinner control well at

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.670 
this it was a spinner control well at
least<00:03:44.500> he's<00:03:44.709> out<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:44.890> my<00:03:45.040> way<00:03:45.190> now<00:03:45.400> but<00:03:46.680> you

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
least he's out of my way now but you

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.650 
least he's out of my way now but you
just<00:03:47.920> don't<00:03:48.129> have<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.610> finesse<00:03:48.819> of<00:03:49.150> controls

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
just don't have the finesse of controls

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.910 
just don't have the finesse of controls
that<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:50.049> need<00:03:52.830> bad<00:03:53.830> timing<00:03:54.129> anyway<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.930> order

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
that you need bad timing anyway in order

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
that you need bad timing anyway in order
to<00:03:56.980> get<00:03:57.190> through<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.459> game<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:59.730> yeah<00:04:00.730> that's

there's something out there that does a

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.450 
there's something out there that does a
better<00:04:37.539> job<00:04:37.630> at<00:04:37.990> emulating<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.800> spinner

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
better job at emulating the spinner

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.980 
better job at emulating the spinner
controls<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.419> crack<00:04:41.320> balls<00:04:42.780> that'd<00:04:43.780> be

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
controls the crack balls that'd be

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.089 
controls the crack balls that'd be
awesome<00:04:45.780> because<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:47.080> don't<00:04:47.289> know<00:04:47.470> what<00:04:47.770> what

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
awesome because I don't know what what

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.260 
awesome because I don't know what what
they<00:04:48.250> are<00:04:48.370> if<00:04:48.550> there's<00:04:48.760> anything<00:04:48.970> out<00:04:49.210> there

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
they are if there's anything out there

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.270 
they are if there's anything out there
so<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:51.729> unless<00:04:52.720> that<00:04:53.139> happens<00:04:53.169> unless<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:54.039> find

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
so and unless that happens unless I find

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.100 
so and unless that happens unless I find
a<00:04:54.460> good<00:04:54.610> controller<00:04:56.160> for<00:04:57.160> those<00:04:57.340> two<00:04:57.610> devices

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
a good controller for those two devices

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.690 
a good controller for those two devices
those<00:04:59.110> kind<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.500> controls<00:05:00.060> then<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:02.400> I'm<00:05:03.400> not

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
those kind of controls then I I'm not

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.960 
those kind of controls then I I'm not
going<00:05:03.849> to<00:05:03.970> try<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:05.070> learn<00:05:06.070> how<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.430> play<00:05:06.669> with

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.390 
the mouse or the joypad these kind of
games<00:05:11.820> because<00:05:12.820> I<00:05:12.970> know<00:05:13.030> how<00:05:13.389> to<00:05:13.450> play<00:05:13.720> them

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
games because I know how to play them

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.850 
games because I know how to play them
with<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.880> original<00:05:16.090> controls<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:17.530> know<00:05:17.680> and

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
with the original controls you know and

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.090 
with the original controls you know and
that's

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
that's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.980 
that's
okay<00:05:19.970> I'm<00:05:20.060> not<00:05:20.210> going<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.420> get<00:05:20.510> into<00:05:20.690> all<00:05:20.870> the

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
okay I'm not going to get into all the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.570 
okay I'm not going to get into all the
muscle<00:05:21.350> memory<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:21.950> all<00:05:22.070> that<00:05:22.250> kind<00:05:22.490> of<00:05:22.520> stuff
