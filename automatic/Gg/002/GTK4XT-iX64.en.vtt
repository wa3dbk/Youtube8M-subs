00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello dear friends today with us 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.049
 There will be a review on him and there a card 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.080
 Myroslava Klose Yes, I know that she somehow 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.210
 differently called but I did not understand how 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.530
 In general, the review on the card which 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 says that he was the best 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.420
 scorer on the world championships and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.670
 having looked at her i just finished 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.279
 look at these stats they just 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 divine and of course I could not 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.090
 check whether everything is really so 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.160
 they tell us electronics art 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 actually go you should start with 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.930
 that this guy is 115 million coins this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.880
 not the amount that affects every fifa 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.100
 so that we can only play 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.590
 the more favorites to buy it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.969
 it is necessary to sweat so well, as with 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.280
 the moment it appears on the market 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.100
 not a minute goes by right away 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.649
 buys but thanks to my subscriber I 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.440
 still managed to buy it out so let's say from the hands well 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.199
 let's now August so in order 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.430
 speed up he sharp quick accelerates 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.739
 great, but I wouldn't say it's straight 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.460
 790 doesn't smell i played from sturridge we 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.070
 this 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.220
 and other fast football players who 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.830
 speed of 90 and I have something to compare 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.659
 I think there is a problem in his balance 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 only 79 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.520
 and growth big meter eighty four and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.680
 everything in total is how you don't allow 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.390
 accelerate to the full but in any case 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.140
 I think here somewhere around 86 87 belts 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.630
 present his blows oh yes it's just 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.079
 fiction almost every punch in 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.100
 target 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.329
 this goal without the jokes is probably the most 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.450
 final player fifu which i 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.030
 ever played he scores absolutely 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.310
 everything absolutely everything at the touch of a button in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.220
 twisting she's just cheating yes not 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.880
 I canâ€™t look at it 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.720
 choose 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.149
 a good moment pinch rp and will goal 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 also worth noting its excellent work 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.619
 reid &amp; high medium for his position 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.140
 it opens up just fine 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.240
 even the most inconvenient bounces it puts 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 somehow a gate dick worth noting 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.580
 also his weak leg 4 stars 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.550
 That is 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.230
 a giant plus in general you understand that 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.480
 with beats from backing she doesn't have 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.400
 absolutely no problems but that's what 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.770
 concerns long shot of it already 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.990
 sad story of pumping writing then 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.730
 long range hit he just sit down 9 i 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.020
 I can not disagree with them 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.900
 really frankly 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.780
 it turns out he is not very it if you beat 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.180
 just a direct blow but if you clamp 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.720
 spin button then everything gets on 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.670
 their places of power in this guy in 87 so 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.590
 what to push off any defender 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.140
 run away from him does not amount to much 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.690
 labor further on the list here treblinka 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.580
 I have a double impression on one side 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.920
 if you stand still and clamp 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.740
 ball control button is lb button 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.530
 on the xbox 360 gamepad then you're on the sheet 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.780
 be able to circle at least half a team but one 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.340
 of the biggest cons for me on 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.130
 this card is all you need two stars 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.190
 special tricks and i'm used to that dribbling and 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.780
 Feints are one thing for me and when 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.810
 i go into the stroke i used to use 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.150
 some different tricks and with that 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.010
 I have sometimes had big problems 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.410
 even a banal false swing from him 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.320
 it becomes a clumsy spoil impression 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.480
 steep treblinka even two tenga 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.489
 central defender three stars special 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.570
 tricks how is it that goats 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.940
 only 2 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.459
 i don't understand so i have to somehow 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.560
 wriggle drag gods and the button l b 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.450
 still at speed he's pretty 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.480
 cumbersome but you can put up with it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.360
 basically nothing catastrophic about this 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.920
 no if you slow down in time about the game 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.420
 head will not speak for long as 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.940
 Here's the effect you can score with your head 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.680
 absolutely anyone even Giovinco meter 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.260
 fifty but still they play and 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.170
 amazing after all for checking so 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.360
 let's say I scored twice from overhang and all 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.730
 flew the first time and let's 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.530
 let's summarize the world klo for his plus 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.170
 excellent strike with almost any 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.450
 positions within a radius of 20 25 meters 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.640
 lovely about open to the opposition 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.860
 impact force that leaves no chance 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.019
 any keeper has excellent control 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.850
 dribble powerful body + excellent 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.250
 speed and with which you can 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.200
 butting with all the defenders come off 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 from them and just great game 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.930
 head minuses are his long shots and 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.270
 two stars special tricks whether this 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.919
 a player of their money if you consider that 15 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.710
 million on while in money now worth 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.780
 not particularly expensive then definitely yes it 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.310
 one of the best attacking effect 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.020
 I've ever played 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.750
 I definitely liked this card 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.640
 more monsters like ibrahimovic and 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.020
 Leo Messi 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.599
 summary statistics miroslav klose y 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.120
 me at the moment it's 10 matches 17 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.729
 goals and three assists plus he to me 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.860
 again once somewhere hit the crossbar and 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.349
 the rods also played all matches in the first 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.840
 division in cups and lost everything only 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.390
 once a penalty shootout my score 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.550
 class nine out of ten practically 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.800
 perfect hitters with fantastic 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.210
 Completion and with you was a panda function 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.950
