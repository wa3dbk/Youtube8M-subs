and more time so starting to feel good
for<00:01:39.159> me<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.869> last<00:01:41.079> fight<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.289> was<00:01:41.469> rocked

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
for me so that last fight I was rocked

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.170

in<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:41.890> first<00:01:42.100> round<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.520> wasn't<00:01:42.909> very<00:01:42.939> smart

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
in the first round I wasn't very smart

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.609 
in the first round I wasn't very smart
by<00:01:43.539> not<00:01:43.719> trying<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.049> take<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.469> ground
