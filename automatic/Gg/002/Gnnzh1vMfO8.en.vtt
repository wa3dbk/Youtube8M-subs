00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
it on let's not do that anymore and

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.490 
it on let's not do that anymore and
let's<00:02:11.520> do<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.660> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.020> basically

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
let's do this you're going to basically

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.010 
let's do this you're going to basically
just<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> windshield<00:02:14.550> wiper<00:02:14.790> motion<00:02:15.660> in

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
just do a windshield wiper motion in

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.830 
just do a windshield wiper motion in
your<00:02:16.650> eye<00:02:16.980> creased<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.820> actually<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.600> your

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
your eye creased and actually on your

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.740 
your eye creased and actually on your
app<00:02:19.020> your<00:02:19.380> lid<00:02:19.650> also<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.730> your<00:02:21.090> face<00:02:21.570> is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750
