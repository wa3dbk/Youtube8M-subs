00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
meat from the shells especially if

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
meat from the shells especially if
they're<00:01:15.780> hard<00:01:16.020> shell<00:01:16.320> lobsters<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:16.920> are

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you really need these babies to make it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.240 
you really need these babies to make it
work<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.619> once<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> crack<00:01:25.920> them<00:01:26.159> open

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
