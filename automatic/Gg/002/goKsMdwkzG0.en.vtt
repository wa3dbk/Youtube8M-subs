00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
believe that Savior gestured them from

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and did a brilliant drop that was

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
and did a brilliant drop that was
absolutely<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.680> worst<00:00:55.890> timing<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.579> Savior

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
absolutely the worst timing for Savior

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.900 
absolutely the worst timing for Savior
air<00:00:57.539> ever<00:00:57.920> these<00:00:58.920> four<00:00:59.160> overlords<00:00:59.640> kind<00:00:59.820> of

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
air ever these four overlords kind of

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.670 
air ever these four overlords kind of
i'm<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.180> sure<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.289> any<00:01:01.469> actual

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
i'm not sure if they have any actual

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.170 
i'm not sure if they have any actual
units<00:01:02.039> at<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.879> units

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
units at them if they do have units

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
units at them if they do have units
that's<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> disappointing<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:04.589> Savior

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that's kind of disappointing for Savior

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.500 
that's kind of disappointing for Savior
let's<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.580> he<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:05.790> hydralisk<00:01:06.240> sin

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
let's see if he has hydralisk sin

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.149 
let's see if he has hydralisk sin
they're<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.439> Ling's<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> looks<00:01:08.010> like

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
they're just Ling's it looks like

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.670 
they're just Ling's it looks like
actually<00:01:09.140> unfortunately<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.290> he's<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.560> gonna

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
actually unfortunately so he's not gonna

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.810 
actually unfortunately so he's not gonna
be<00:01:10.799> able<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> fight<00:01:11.130> off<00:01:11.159> these<00:01:11.369> rays<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.760> are

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
be able to fight off these rays that are

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.039 
be able to fight off these rays that are
incoming<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.330> raids<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.810> able<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
incoming these raids going to be able to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.109 
incoming these raids going to be able to
eat<00:01:13.260> those<00:01:13.470> overlords<00:01:14.460> alive<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> can

see mind just has a huge a huge force I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.429 
see mind just has a huge a huge force I
don't<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:18.570> Savior<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.080> even<00:01:19.290> produce

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
don't think Savior can even produce

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.719 
don't think Savior can even produce
units<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.430> he<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
units right here I think he got the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
units right here I think he got the
defiling<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.090> dad<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.600> he<00:01:21.689> lost<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.140> don't

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
defiling my dad I think he lost I don't

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.990 
defiling my dad I think he lost I don't
even<00:01:22.770> remember<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.310> lost<00:01:23.430> his<00:01:23.640> spawning

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
even remember if he lost his spawning

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.510 
even remember if he lost his spawning
pool<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> don't<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.979> don't<00:01:26.070> think

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
natural expansion which I'm not sure is

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.130 
natural expansion which I'm not sure is
the<00:01:55.799> case<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.670> single<00:01:57.420> zergling<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:57.930> that's

the case a single zergling out that's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.179 
the case a single zergling out that's
not<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.590> anything<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.950> lot<00:01:59.100> of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
not going to do anything a lot of

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.609 
not going to do anything a lot of
zerglings<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.420> things<00:02:01.049> flooding

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
zerglings and and things flooding

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.050 
zerglings and and things flooding
through<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.189> dark<00:02:02.399> swarm<00:02:02.670> down<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.000> he

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
through now and a dark swarm down but he

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.780 
through now and a dark swarm down but he
lost<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.420> hatchery<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:05.579> was

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
lost that hatchery and I think there was

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.160 
lost that hatchery and I think there was
a<00:02:05.820> death<00:02:06.060> note<00:02:06.270> before<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.840> definitely

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
a death note before but I definitely

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.690 
a death note before but I definitely
feel<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.979> dead<00:02:08.129> mount<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
feel like that's a dead mount now and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.999 
feel like that's a dead mount now and
now<00:02:08.819> raised<00:02:09.179> all<00:02:09.750> over<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.379> natural

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
now raised all over that natural

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.740 
now raised all over that natural
expansion<00:02:11.340> taking<00:02:11.849> care<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.209> all<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.599> drones

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
expansion taking care of all the drones

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.820

Savior<00:02:13.200> is

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
Savior is

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.950 
Savior is
has<00:02:13.980> absolutely<00:02:14.640> no<00:02:15.030> resources<00:02:15.600> at<00:02:15.810> this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
has absolutely no resources at this

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.470 
has absolutely no resources at this
point<00:02:16.460> he<00:02:17.460> does<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.760> those<00:02:17.970> de<00:02:18.120> filers

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
point he does have those de filers

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.700 
point he does have those de filers
amazingly<00:02:18.990> he's<00:02:19.350> going<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.560> lose<00:02:19.680> that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
amazingly he's going to lose that

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.230 
amazingly he's going to lose that
Defiler<00:02:20.190> right<00:02:20.370> there<00:02:20.520> probably<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.120> those

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
Defiler right there probably to those

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.200 
Defiler right there probably to those

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.060 
opinion for mine at this point mine has
the<00:02:51.060> resources<00:02:51.360> he<00:02:51.690> has<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:52.050> economy<00:02:52.500> he

he has all the components the question

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.820 
he has all the components the question
is<00:02:56.880> can<00:02:57.180> he<00:02:57.240> gather<00:02:57.420> do<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.080> think<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.740> you
