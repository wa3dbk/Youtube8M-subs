into a bit of a tiff we got into

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.350 
into a bit of a tiff we got into
actually<00:01:23.100> very<00:01:23.310> extraordinary<00:01:23.610> tip<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> like

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
actually very extraordinary tip and like

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
actually very extraordinary tip and like
it<00:01:24.810> ended<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.500> being<00:01:25.680> grounded<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.679 
it ended with me being grounded for a
month<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> guess<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.210> give<00:01:27.390> me<00:01:27.509> some
