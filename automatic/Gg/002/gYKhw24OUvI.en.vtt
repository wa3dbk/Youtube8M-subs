I'm<00:00:55.920> always<00:00:56.129> interested<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.989> finding<00:00:58.910> ways<00:00:59.910> to

I'm always interested in finding ways to
question<00:01:01.699> our<00:01:02.960> ordinary<00:01:03.960> war<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.979> 45

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
question our ordinary war it's a 45

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.230 
question our ordinary war it's a 45
degree<00:01:05.670> angle<00:01:05.909> that's<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.750> produces<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
degree angle that's what produces the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
degree angle that's what produces the
reflection<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.420> slightly<00:01:09.720> wrong<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
reflection bit slightly wrong the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.429 
reflection bit slightly wrong the
illusion<00:01:11.340> does<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.659> angle<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
illusion does well if the angle is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.530 
illusion does well if the angle is
slightly<00:01:13.830> wrong<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> building<00:01:15.390> will

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
slightly wrong then the building will

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.810 
slightly wrong then the building will
look<00:01:15.750> slightly<00:01:16.310> off
