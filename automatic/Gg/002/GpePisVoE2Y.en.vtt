they're<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:43.110> even<00:00:43.469> maybe<00:00:44.300> one<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> them

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
pretty pricey there thirty dollars the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.359 
pretty pricey there thirty dollars the
next<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.110> switch<00:01:04.439> easy<00:01:04.890> colors

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the reason is so special mainly I think

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.039 
the reason is so special mainly I think
it's<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.729> button<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.240> looks

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it's because of the button it looks

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's because of the button it looks
reminds<00:01:16.530> me<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> an<00:01:16.860> imminent<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:18.000> she

entertained<00:01:20.520> me<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.939> pressing<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.479> for

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
entertained me just pressing it for

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
entertained me just pressing it for
hours<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> hours<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:24.060> next<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.450> would

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
them there the otter boxes there they're

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.800 
them there the otter boxes there they're
kind<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.790> square<00:02:27.090> shaped<00:02:27.360> cases<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> ipod

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
kind of square shaped cases for the ipod

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.199 
kind of square shaped cases for the ipod
you<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:30.989> can<00:02:31.170> tell<00:02:31.530> from<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.430> top<00:02:32.640> black<00:02:32.910> one

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
you can can tell from the top black one

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.390 
you can can tell from the top black one
kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.590> can't<00:02:34.769> look<00:02:34.890> like<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.040> square

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
kind of I just can't look like a square

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.640 
kind of I just can't look like a square
and<00:02:37.099> okay<00:02:38.720> they<00:02:39.720> provide<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.500> most

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and okay they provide the most

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.680 
and okay they provide the most
protection<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.430> belief<00:02:41.849> or<00:02:42.090> cases<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.660> think

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
protection the I belief or cases I think

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.110 
protection the I belief or cases I think
that<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.950> they're<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.160> little<00:02:44.370> more<00:02:44.489> bulkier

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that so they're a little more bulkier

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.890 
that so they're a little more bulkier
but<00:02:45.959> they're<00:02:46.530> still<00:02:46.650> kind<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.750> style<00:02:48.750> of

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
but they're still kind of style of

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
but they're still kind of style of
 I<00:02:49.410> guess<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.430> next<00:02:50.580> one<00:02:50.849> would<00:02:50.970> be

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
 I guess the next one would be

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.130 
 I guess the next one would be
that<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.480> frogs<00:02:51.900> looks<00:02:53.030> it's<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.269> snap<00:02:54.569> on<00:02:54.750> case

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
that I frogs looks it's a snap on case

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.990 
that I frogs looks it's a snap on case
kind<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.799> has<00:02:55.950> two<00:02:56.130> pieces<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.819> kind

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
kind of it has two pieces you just kind

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.360 
kind of it has two pieces you just kind
of<00:02:57.060> put<00:02:57.569> them<00:02:57.660> together<00:02:57.810> as<00:02:58.230> i<00:02:58.709> click<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.069> three

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
of put them together as i click on three

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.330 
of put them together as i click on three
telling<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.680> next<00:03:02.010> one<00:03:02.220> would<00:03:02.489> be<00:03:02.549> the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
telling the next one would be the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.940 
telling the next one would be the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
top 10 next one would be the mophie

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.690 
top 10 next one would be the mophie

protection<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.900> last<00:03:43.260> one<00:03:43.620> would<00:03:43.799> be<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.069> I

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
protection the last one would be the I

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.680 
protection the last one would be the I
see<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.799> just<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.549> crystal<00:03:47.910> class<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.480> I

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
see it it's just a crystal class but I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.559 
see it it's just a crystal class but I
think<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.350> looks<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.680> best<00:03:49.859> on<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.430> think<00:03:51.420> it's

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
think it looks the best on I think it's

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.860 
think it looks the best on I think it's
my<00:03:51.840> favorite<00:03:52.549> crystal<00:03:53.549> case<00:03:53.910> even<00:03:54.690> though<00:03:54.780> I

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
my favorite crystal case even though I

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.830 
my favorite crystal case even though I
don't<00:03:54.959> have<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:56.099> looks<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.519> best<00:03:56.840> so

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
don't have it and it looks the best so

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.539 
don't have it and it looks the best so
that's<00:03:58.019> about<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.319> with<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.709> cases<00:03:59.130> or<00:03:59.400> that

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
that's about it with the cases or that

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.120 
that's about it with the cases or that
is<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.940> with<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.180> cases<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:00.920> next<00:04:01.920> would<00:04:02.099> be

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
is it with the cases and next would be

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.280 
is it with the cases and next would be
some<00:04:03.120> apple<00:04:03.690> news<00:04:03.900> um<00:04:04.489> I'm<00:04:05.540> sure<00:04:06.540> everybody
