my development in knife funding has been
a<00:00:28.260> real<00:00:28.529> process<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.460> been<00:00:29.820> constant

you<00:00:32.160> know<00:00:32.279> failures<00:00:32.850> flattop<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:34.110> think

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you know failures flattop I think

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.290 
you know failures flattop I think
because<00:00:34.739> timing<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.129> never-ending<00:00:35.400> you<00:00:36.180> can

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
because timing is never-ending you can

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.260 
because timing is never-ending you can
always<00:00:36.450> improve<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.860> love<00:00:38.370> how<00:00:38.580> deep<00:00:39.120> the

always improve and I love how deep the

femoris BC Canada I've always been into
a<00:00:44.610> lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.970> sports<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.629> there's<00:00:46.020> something

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
a lot of sports but there's something

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.290 
a lot of sports but there's something
about<00:00:46.320> climbing<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.040> general<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.790> just<00:00:48.120> took

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
about climbing in general that just took

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.850 
about climbing in general that just took
me<00:00:48.420> away<00:00:48.480> from<00:00:48.720> everything<00:00:48.899> else<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
me away from everything else it was the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
me away from everything else it was the
challenge<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> mental<00:00:50.640> state<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.480> put

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
challenge the mental state that have put

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.930 
challenge the mental state that have put
me<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.500> pushes<00:00:52.920> me<00:00:53.040> further<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> harder

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
me in it pushes me further and harder

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.670 
me in it pushes me further and harder
than<00:00:54.120> anything<00:00:54.660> else<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> would<00:00:55.200> tried<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
than anything else that I would tried to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.530 
than anything else that I would tried to
do<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.160> never<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:56.940> expected<00:00:57.300> would<00:00:57.420> have

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
do I never would expected would have

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.990 
do I never would expected would have
gone<00:00:57.630> this<00:00:57.899> far<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.309> always<00:00:59.550> felt<00:00:59.940> that

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
gone this far but I always felt that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.709 
gone this far but I always felt that
there's<00:01:00.210> something<00:01:00.329> different<00:01:00.510> about

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
there's something different about

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.750 
there's something different about
climbing<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.410> okay<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.219> drew<00:01:02.399> me<00:01:02.520> closer

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
climbing it okay so they drew me closer

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.490 
climbing it okay so they drew me closer
to<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.090> versus<00:01:03.450> okay<00:01:08.930> life<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.110> really<00:01:10.320> busy

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
to that versus okay life is really busy

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980 
to that versus okay life is really busy
but<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.190> guess<00:01:11.399> it<00:01:11.550> comes<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:12.540> bad<00:01:12.840> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
but I guess it comes down to how bad you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.749 
but I guess it comes down to how bad you
want<00:01:13.229> something<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.399> put<00:01:14.640> into

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
want something and what you put into

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.730 
want something and what you put into
that<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.660> try<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.899> balance<00:01:16.649> everything

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that I just try to balance everything

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.700 
that I just try to balance everything
and<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.580> only<00:01:17.729> individual<00:01:18.600> way<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.229> train

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

here's<00:02:08.780> how<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.930> ice<00:02:09.080> climb<00:02:09.350> has<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.680> was<00:02:09.770> swing

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
here's how to ice climb has I was swing

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.020 
here's how to ice climb has I was swing
and<00:02:10.040> ice<00:02:10.130> tool<00:02:10.369> here's<00:02:10.610> how<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.729> kick<00:02:10.940> your

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
and ice tool here's how to kick your

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.480 
and ice tool here's how to kick your
foot<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.800> competing<00:02:12.800> in<00:02:12.920> his<00:02:13.070> dry<00:02:13.250> tooling

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
foot to competing in his dry tooling

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.850 
foot to competing in his dry tooling
comps<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.210> doing<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.510> World<00:02:14.690> Cup<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.200> yeah<00:02:15.650> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
comps and doing the World Cup and yeah I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.560 
comps and doing the World Cup and yeah I
think<00:02:16.070> that's<00:02:16.280> uh<00:02:16.370> he's<00:02:16.820> put<00:02:17.030> his<00:02:17.120> time<00:02:17.360> then

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
think that's uh he's put his time then

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.330 
think that's uh he's put his time then
he's<00:02:17.690> gotten<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.990> lot<00:02:18.140> better<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:19.130> that's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
he's gotten a lot better and that's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.040 
he's gotten a lot better and that's
great<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.700> see<00:02:19.880> somebody<00:02:20.060> progress<00:02:20.570> like<00:02:20.840> that

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
great to see somebody progress like that

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.110 
great to see somebody progress like that
you<00:02:21.710> know<00:02:21.830> when<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.100> try<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.580> hard<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.850> train

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
you know when you try so hard and train

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.970 
you know when you try so hard and train
a<00:02:23.150> lot<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.600> put<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> lot<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.320> effort<00:02:24.680> time<00:02:24.920> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
a lot and put a lot of effort time and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.010 
a lot and put a lot of effort time and
money<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.580> sacrifice<00:02:26.000> since<00:02:26.150> then<00:02:26.360> when<00:02:26.930> you

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
money and sacrifice since then when you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.690 
money and sacrifice since then when you
don't<00:02:27.320> see<00:02:27.560> results<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:28.130> can<00:02:28.250> be<00:02:28.459> pretty

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
don't see results it can be pretty

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.340 
don't see results it can be pretty
discouraging<00:02:29.270> but<00:02:29.570> then<00:02:29.690> when<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.320> have

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
discouraging but then when you you have

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.350 
discouraging but then when you you have
a<00:02:30.500> breakthrough<00:02:30.830> it's<00:02:31.670> like<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.120> little

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
a breakthrough it's like that little

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.850 
a breakthrough it's like that little
glimmer<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.810> hope<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.110> you're<00:02:33.470> on<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> right

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
glimmer of hope that you're on the right

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.160 
glimmer of hope that you're on the right
track<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.910> last<00:02:35.090> year<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.510> had<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.930> little

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
track and so last year I had that little

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.930 
track and so last year I had that little
breakthrough<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> sort<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.580> tells<00:02:37.760> me

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
breakthrough and this sort of tells me

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.820 
breakthrough and this sort of tells me
that<00:02:38.090> things<00:02:38.300> are<00:02:38.540> finding<00:02:38.900> work

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.050 

finding<00:02:44.830> new<00:02:44.950> places<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.370> developing<00:02:45.880> new

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
finding new places in developing new

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.880 
finding new places in developing new
climbs<00:02:46.330> has<00:02:46.569> always<00:02:46.690> certainly<00:02:47.110> been<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.590> big

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
climbs has always certainly been a big

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.070 
climbs has always certainly been a big
part<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.280> why<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.700> love<00:02:48.970> climbing<00:02:49.209> there's<00:02:49.959> so

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
part of why I love climbing there's so

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.210 
part of why I love climbing there's so
many<00:02:50.140> things<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.440> I'm<00:02:50.680> out<00:02:50.800> there<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.130> when

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
many things that I'm out there but when

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.980 
many things that I'm out there but when
you<00:02:51.280> find<00:02:51.610> something<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.540> develop<00:02:52.690> it

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
you find something and get to develop it

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.110 
you find something and get to develop it
yourself<00:02:53.080> it's<00:02:53.920> come<00:02:54.130> like<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.520> imprint<00:02:54.970> in

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
yourself it's come like your imprint in

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.690 
yourself it's come like your imprint in
finding<00:02:55.420> world<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:56.319> bull<00:02:56.500> river<00:02:56.740> it's<00:02:57.160> 45

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
finding world the bull river it's 45

minutes<00:02:57.760> from<00:02:58.090> my<00:02:58.180> house<00:02:58.420> I've<00:02:58.630> spent<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.959> lot

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
minutes from my house I've spent a lot

that I've been able to understand and

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.420 
that I've been able to understand and
see<00:03:04.780> what<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.170> do<00:03:05.320> with<00:03:05.530> certain<00:03:05.830> lines<00:03:06.070> a

couple<00:03:06.820> years<00:03:07.090> ago<00:03:07.209> beyond<00:03:07.630> Matador<00:03:08.140> it's

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
couple years ago beyond Matador it's

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.100 
couple years ago beyond Matador it's
staring<00:03:09.459> at<00:03:09.610> me<00:03:09.790> right<00:03:09.820> in<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.120> face<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:11.050> I

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
staring at me right in the face but I

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.990 
staring at me right in the face but I
didn't<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.770> know-how<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.580> how<00:03:12.940> to

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
didn't have the know-how of how to

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.970 
didn't have the know-how of how to
develop<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.290> know<00:03:14.380> but<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> couple<00:03:14.590> years

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
develop that you know but a couple years

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.800 
develop that you know but a couple years
ago<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.459> had<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> better<00:03:16.180> understanding<00:03:16.239> and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
ago I had a better understanding and

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.740 
ago I had a better understanding and
what<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.110> do<00:03:17.290> with<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.620> line<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:19.150> became

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
what to do with that line and it became

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.640 
what to do with that line and it became
like<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.200> most<00:03:20.380> magical<00:03:21.220> line<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.519> life
