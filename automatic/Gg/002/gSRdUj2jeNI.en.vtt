to work with and of course it's a try
and<00:00:14.200> what<00:00:15.010> it<00:00:15.100> is<00:00:15.220> is<00:00:15.460> triad<00:00:15.940> chord<00:00:16.360> voicing<00:00:16.840> a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
and what it is is triad chord voicing a

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.280 
and what it is is triad chord voicing a
one<00:00:17.140> five<00:00:17.440> ten<00:00:17.860> voicing<00:00:21.720> now<00:00:22.720> one<00:00:22.869> gets<00:00:23.050> hard

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
one five ten voicing now one gets hard

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.769 
one five ten voicing now one gets hard
the<00:00:23.560> ten<00:00:23.920> is<00:00:24.189> actually<00:00:24.610> the<00:00:24.759> third<00:00:25.060> an<00:00:25.420> octave

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
the ten is actually the third an octave

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.470 
the ten is actually the third an octave
higher<00:00:26.020> so<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.919> roots<00:00:27.130> on<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.460> bottom<00:00:27.820> the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
higher so the roots on the bottom the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.330 
higher so the roots on the bottom the
fifth<00:00:28.779> is<00:00:28.960> on<00:00:29.080> the<00:00:29.230> fifth<00:00:29.590> string<00:00:29.680> there<00:00:30.099> and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
fifth is on the fifth string there and

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.159 
fifth is on the fifth string there and
the<00:00:30.700> third<00:00:30.939> is<00:00:31.180> up<00:00:31.360> there<00:00:31.599> on<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.989> third

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
the third is up there on the third

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.110 
the third is up there on the third
string<00:00:32.500> have<00:00:32.800> that<00:00:32.950> lovely<00:00:33.340> little<00:00:33.579> spread

string have that lovely little spread
sound<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.780> can<00:00:38.020> be<00:00:38.110> used<00:00:38.320> as<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:38.649> rhythm

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
sound this can be used as a rhythm

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.370 
sound this can be used as a rhythm
guitar<00:00:39.880> thing<00:00:40.120> you<00:00:40.660> can<00:00:40.840> just<00:00:40.870> move<00:00:41.200> that

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
guitar thing you can just move that

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.639 
guitar thing you can just move that
voicing<00:00:41.860> around<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:47.079> it's<00:00:47.199> really<00:00:47.410> cool

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
voicing around and it's really cool

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.560 
voicing around and it's really cool
because<00:00:47.710> it<00:00:48.129> has<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.460> very<00:00:48.699> full<00:00:49.089> sound<00:00:49.390> of

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
because it has the very full sound of

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.270 
because it has the very full sound of
the<00:00:49.660> fifth<00:00:49.929> on<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.230> bottom<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:50.769> then<00:00:51.039> the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
the fifth on the bottom and then the

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.110 
the fifth on the bottom and then the
defining<00:00:51.999> tone<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.600> third<00:00:52.839> up<00:00:53.649> there<00:00:54.129> spread

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
defining tone the third up there spread

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.270 
defining tone the third up there spread
out<00:00:55.269> this<00:00:56.230> shape<00:00:56.499> on<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.859> next<00:00:57.100> set<00:00:57.249> of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
out this shape on the next set of

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.069 
out this shape on the next set of
strings<00:00:57.609> is<00:00:57.850> also<00:00:58.149> really<00:00:58.359> useful<00:00:58.809> on<00:00:58.929> the

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
strings is also really useful on the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.099 
strings is also really useful on the
five<00:00:59.350> or<00:00:59.739> two<00:01:00.100> strings<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.600> that<00:01:01.780> kind<00:01:02.050> of

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
five or two strings with that kind of

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.350 
five or two strings with that kind of
fingering<00:01:02.530> one<00:01:02.980> three<00:01:03.309> four<00:01:03.609> fingering<00:01:04.150> and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
fingering one three four fingering and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.870 
fingering one three four fingering and
then<00:01:04.930> on<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.199> four<00:01:05.500> three<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.890> one<00:01:06.130> strings<00:01:06.550> it

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
then on the four three in one strings it

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.720 
then on the four three in one strings it
says<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.750> same<00:01:07.930> finger<00:01:08.350> one<00:01:08.620> three<00:01:08.950> four<00:01:09.280> like

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
says the same finger one three four like

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.370 
says the same finger one three four like
that<00:01:11.940> so<00:01:12.940> now<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.150> can<00:01:13.390> change<00:01:13.630> string<00:01:14.050> sets

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
that so now you can change string sets

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:24.010 
that so now you can change string sets
and<00:01:14.560> play<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:14.890> same<00:01:15.130> sound

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.510 

as<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> really<00:01:25.440> cool<00:01:25.470> sound<00:01:25.860> again<00:01:26.190> it's<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
as a really cool sound again it's really

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
as a really cool sound again it's really
full<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.120> still<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.510> that<00:01:27.660> tone<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.110> top

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
full but you still have that tone up top

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.160 
full but you still have that tone up top
so<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.360> GCM<00:01:32.510> you<00:01:33.510> can<00:01:33.660> actually<00:01:33.810> use

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so that is GCM you can actually use

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:47.660 
so that is GCM you can actually use
those<00:01:34.410> over<00:01:34.830> AG<00:01:35.340> pedal<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.240> want<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> what

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
those over AG pedal if you want so what

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.700 
those over AG pedal if you want so what
I<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.120> arrow<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.510> I<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> Triads<00:01:49.500> of

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
I did with arrow is I have the Triads of

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.530 
I did with arrow is I have the Triads of
G<00:01:49.980> C<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.490> F<00:01:50.730> G<00:01:51.480> C<00:01:51.720> F<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.670> whole-step<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.300> G

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
G C and F G C F up a whole-step for G

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
G C and F G C F up a whole-step for G
and<00:01:54.780> over<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.160> can<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.610> whole

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and over here you can go down a whole

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.290 
and over here you can go down a whole
step<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.150> catch<00:01:57.450> F<00:01:57.690> there<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> also<00:02:00.000> do

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
step to catch F there you can also do

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.270 
step to catch F there you can also do
this<00:02:00.450> high<00:02:00.690> on<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.050> neck<00:02:01.080> up<00:02:01.470> here<00:02:01.950> here's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
this high on the neck up here here's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
this high on the neck up here here's
your<00:02:02.340> G<00:02:03.800> down<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.860> whole<00:02:05.130> step<00:02:05.250> F<00:02:06.680> on<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.890> sixth

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
your G down a whole step F on the sixth

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.280 
your G down a whole step F on the sixth
string<00:02:08.369> C<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:12.060> up<00:02:12.209> here<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.020> fourth

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
string C and then up here on the fourth

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.800 
string C and then up here on the fourth
string<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.610> C<00:02:14.820> one<00:02:15.000> also<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.750> can

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
string with the C one also so you can

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:30.860 
string with the C one also so you can
play<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.230> low<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.620> high<00:02:19.740> if<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:19.980> wish

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
it really cool sound because you got the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.100 
it really cool sound because you got the
fullness<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.330> low<00:02:34.450> end<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.840> chord<00:02:35.050> and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
fullness on the low end of the chord and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.110 
fullness on the low end of the chord and
you<00:02:35.230> got<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.470> defining<00:02:35.980> note<00:02:36.160> up<00:02:36.340> top<00:02:36.550> by<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
you got that defining note up top by the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.000 
you got that defining note up top by the
way<00:02:37.300> these<00:02:37.569> things<00:02:37.900> don't<00:02:38.140> have<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.620> just

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
way these things don't have to be just

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.940 
way these things don't have to be just
for<00:02:39.099> rhythm<00:02:39.370> guitar<00:02:40.260> I'm<00:02:41.260> gonna<00:02:41.440> do<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> exact

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
for rhythm guitar I'm gonna do the exact

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.000 
for rhythm guitar I'm gonna do the exact
same<00:02:41.980> triads<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.940> play<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.330> as<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:44.050> lead<00:02:44.769> line

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
same triads and play it as a lead line

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.140 
same triads and play it as a lead line
it's<00:02:45.250> gonna<00:02:45.340> sound<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.670> little<00:02:45.700> bit<00:02:45.940> Eric

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
it's gonna sound a little bit Eric

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.970 
it's gonna sound a little bit Eric
Johnson

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:59.630 

I<00:02:57.110> added<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.260> little<00:02:58.379> been<00:02:58.739> there<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.430> kind

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
I added a little been there just to kind

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.460 
I added a little been there just to kind
of<00:02:59.730> give<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.269> flavor<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.170> these<00:03:01.319> things

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
of give it that flavor but these things

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.559 
of give it that flavor but these things
are<00:03:01.680> great<00:03:01.830> for<00:03:02.190> single<00:03:02.549> notes<00:03:02.730> also<00:03:03.150> although

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
are great for single notes also although

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.210 
are great for single notes also although
you're<00:03:03.870> all<00:03:03.959> jumping<00:03:04.379> across<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.830> strings<00:03:05.129> a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
you're all jumping across the strings a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.430 
you're all jumping across the strings a
little<00:03:05.400> bit<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.180> be<00:03:06.299> tricky<00:03:06.569> notice

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
little bit and it can be tricky notice

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.460 
little bit and it can be tricky notice
down<00:03:07.590> here<00:03:07.650> with<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.580> G<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.959> right-hand

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
down here with this G on the right-hand

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.910 
down here with this G on the right-hand
six<00:03:10.920> string<00:03:11.220> all<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.209> way<00:03:12.450> up<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> third

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
six string all the way up to the third

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.559 
six string all the way up to the third
so<00:03:13.920> that's<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.250> little<00:03:14.370> bit<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.819> obstacle

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
so that's a little bit of a obstacle

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.759 
so that's a little bit of a obstacle
that<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.049> get<00:03:16.170> used<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.440> but<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.680> has

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
that you have to get used to but it has

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.860 
that you have to get used to but it has
a<00:03:16.799> really<00:03:17.190> really<00:03:17.519> cool<00:03:17.700> jumping<00:03:18.209> sound<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.690> it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
a really really cool jumping sound to it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.960 
a really really cool jumping sound to it
now<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.739> other<00:03:19.980> thing<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.640> do<00:03:20.819> with

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
now the other thing that you can do with

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.380 
now the other thing that you can do with
these<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.569> add<00:03:22.200> some<00:03:22.530> tones<00:03:22.799> real<00:03:23.610> easy<00:03:23.910> one<00:03:24.209> to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
these is add some tones real easy one to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.229 
these is add some tones real easy one to
do<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.810> add<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.200> us<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.970> was<00:03:27.090> gonna

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
do is to add this us so that was gonna

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.119 
do is to add this us so that was gonna
be<00:03:27.420> right<00:03:27.660> above<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.079> third<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.859> do<00:03:31.950> that

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
be right above the third you can do that

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.170 
be right above the third you can do that
in<00:03:32.250> each<00:03:32.400> one<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.609> those<00:03:32.760> shapes<00:03:34.970> really<00:03:35.970> easy

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
in each one of those shapes really easy

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.490 
in each one of those shapes really easy
in<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.510> shape<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.930> could<00:03:37.079> just<00:03:37.230> move<00:03:37.379> your

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
in that shape you could just move your

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.250 
in that shape you could just move your
pinky<00:03:37.890> up<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.190> back

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
pinky up and back

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.940 
pinky up and back
the<00:03:41.190> f1

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.679 

now<00:03:44.950> these<00:03:45.189> have<00:03:45.489> when<00:03:45.909> you<00:03:46.000> add<00:03:46.180> these<00:03:46.390> notes

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
now these have when you add these notes

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.569 
now these have when you add these notes
that<00:03:46.930> have<00:03:47.049> implications<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.159> key<00:03:48.370> that

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
that have implications in the key that

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.280 
that have implications in the key that
you're<00:03:48.819> playing<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.269> but<00:03:49.810> for<00:03:49.959> right<00:03:50.049> now<00:03:50.110> you

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
you're playing in but for right now you

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.839 
you're playing in but for right now you
can<00:03:50.560> just<00:03:50.709> be<00:03:50.829> creative<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.400> kind<00:03:51.549> of<00:03:51.670> play

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
can just be creative and kind of play

00:03:51.849 --> 00:04:05.759 
can just be creative and kind of play
around<00:03:52.000> with<00:03:52.269> it<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:05.200> yeah<00:04:05.379> some<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.650> the

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
around with it and yeah some of the

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.470 
around with it and yeah some of the
greatest<00:04:06.099> things<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.430> have<00:04:06.909> come<00:04:07.209> up<00:04:07.239> have

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
greatest things that have come up have

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.240 
greatest things that have come up have
broken<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.900> rules<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.260> lot<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:08.980> can<00:04:09.099> play

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
broken the rules a lot so you can play

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.069 
broken the rules a lot so you can play
around<00:04:09.370> with<00:04:09.609> that<00:04:09.819> shape<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.689> other<00:04:10.840> thing

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
around with that shape the other thing

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.569 
around with that shape the other thing
that<00:04:11.109> you<00:04:11.349> want<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.650> do<00:04:11.769> is<00:04:12.010> turn<00:04:12.310> them<00:04:12.430> into

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
that you want to do is turn them into

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.000 
that you want to do is turn them into
minor<00:04:12.939> so<00:04:13.689> you<00:04:13.750> want<00:04:13.989> to<00:04:14.079> lower<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.530> third<00:04:14.799> on

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
minor so you want to lower the third on

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.599 
minor so you want to lower the third on
this<00:04:15.220> one

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
this one

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.710 
this one
here's<00:04:16.120> back<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.539> our<00:04:16.630> G<00:04:16.900> major<00:04:18.510> now<00:04:19.510> there's

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
here's back to our G major now there's

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.000 
here's back to our G major now there's
the<00:04:19.870> note<00:04:20.019> that<00:04:20.139> we're<00:04:20.289> gonna<00:04:20.380> lower<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.979> a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
the note that we're gonna lower to a

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.129 
the note that we're gonna lower to a
b-flat<00:04:21.519> to<00:04:21.820> make<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.150> minor<00:04:22.449> triad<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:25.900> the

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
b-flat to make it a minor triad on the

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:36.920 
b-flat to make it a minor triad on the
other<00:04:26.289> shapes<00:04:26.650> is<00:04:26.889> easier<00:04:28.560> C<00:04:29.560> minor<00:04:29.830> F<00:04:30.310> minor

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.150 

starting<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.990> sound<00:04:38.169> familiar<00:04:38.380> probably<00:04:38.919> is

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
starting to sound familiar probably is

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.469 
starting to sound familiar probably is
starting<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.520> sound<00:04:39.699> familiar<00:04:39.910> might<00:04:40.360> have

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
starting to sound familiar might have

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.909 
starting to sound familiar might have
heard<00:04:40.599> some<00:04:40.780> things<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:41.199> really<00:04:41.349> use<00:04:41.650> that

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
heard some things that really use that

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.909 
heard some things that really use that
I'm<00:04:42.520> gonna<00:04:42.729> go<00:04:42.940> ahead<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.330> play<00:04:43.449> a<00:04:43.479> G<00:04:43.930> minor<00:04:44.199> F

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
I'm gonna go ahead and play a G minor F

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.270 
I'm gonna go ahead and play a G minor F
E<00:04:45.490> flat<00:04:46.289> progression<00:04:47.289> but<00:04:47.919> with<00:04:48.099> these

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
E flat progression but with these

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.760 
E flat progression but with these
voicings<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.120> notice<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.110> cool<00:04:50.320> sound<00:04:50.620> that

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
voicings and notice the cool sound that

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.150 
voicings and notice the cool sound that
you<00:04:50.860> get<00:04:51.010> when<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.220> do<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.520> G<00:04:52.120> minor<00:04:52.360> F<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.620> E

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
you get when you do it G minor F and E

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:08.090 
you get when you do it G minor F and E
flat<00:04:54.340> G<00:04:54.729> minor

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.590 

really<00:05:09.100> nice<00:05:09.340> sound<00:05:09.580> sounds<00:05:10.090> very<00:05:10.180> much<00:05:10.419> like

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
really nice sound sounds very much like
