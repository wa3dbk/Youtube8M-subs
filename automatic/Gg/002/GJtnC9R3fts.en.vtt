okay the QuietComfort 20 first things
first<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.790> how<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.059> look<00:00:15.240> when<00:00:15.450> you

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
so the QC 20 is a very interesting pair

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.200

canceling so that is definitely

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.250 
canceling so that is definitely

euros for as cheap as $20 the bose qc25

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.850 
euros for as cheap as $20 the bose qc25
out<00:00:50.090> $300<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> serious

out $300 so it's going to be a serious
investment<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.050> worth<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.100> think<00:00:57.000> so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
investment but is it worth it I think so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.590 
investment but is it worth it I think so
because<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:59.280> these<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.579> by<00:01:00.149> far<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> best

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
because really these are by far the best

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.549

in<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.079> type<00:01:01.260> F<00:01:01.410> ones<00:01:01.620> I've<00:01:01.800> heard<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.989> far<00:01:04.019> at

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
is the average version that you get over

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 
is the average version that you get over
here<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.409> also<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> QC<00:01:14.220> 20

here you also get the QC 20
the<00:01:15.509> iPhone<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.500> iOS<00:01:16.710> version<00:01:17.490> which<00:01:18.390> works

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the iPhone and iOS version which works

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.980 
the iPhone and iOS version which works
with<00:01:19.439> iOS<00:01:19.890> devices<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.689> normal

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
with iOS devices actually the normal

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.510 
with iOS devices actually the normal
version<00:01:22.200> works<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.560> fine<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.950> iOS<00:01:23.250> devices

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
version works just fine with iOS devices

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.590 
version works just fine with iOS devices
just<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.530> QC<00:01:25.640> 20s<00:01:26.640> an<00:01:26.909> extra<00:01:27.270> remote

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
just that the QC 20s an extra remote

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
just that the QC 20s an extra remote
this<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.619> normal<00:01:29.490> remote<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:29.909> gave

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this is the normal remote that they gave

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
this is the normal remote that they gave
the<00:01:30.090> normal<00:01:30.509> version<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.840> works<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.170> fine

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the normal version it works just fine

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.969 
the normal version it works just fine
between<00:01:31.680> those<00:01:31.979> phones<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.520> Android<00:01:33.860> can<00:01:34.860> be

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
between those phones and Android can be

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
between those phones and Android can be
a<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.280> moody<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:35.880> Android<00:01:36.210> phones

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
a little moody with some Android phones

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.190 
a little moody with some Android phones
though<00:01:37.369> but<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.700> works<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.000> fine

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
though but it works just fine

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.030 
though but it works just fine
so<00:01:40.799> both<00:01:41.280> versions<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.930> new<00:01:43.500> aware

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so both versions do have this new aware

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.969 
so both versions do have this new aware
mode<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> show<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.479> sec

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
mode that I'm going to show you in a sec

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.490 
mode that I'm going to show you in a sec
be<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> switch<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
be just so you know you switch it on and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.249 
be just so you know you switch it on and
switch<00:01:49.560> off<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.869> plug<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:52.049> over

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
switch off with this plug right over

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.550 
switch off with this plug right over
here<00:01:52.490> it's<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.610> large<00:01:53.880> module<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.810> I'm<00:01:55.170> not<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
here it's a large module that I'm not a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.520 
here it's a large module that I'm not a
big<00:01:55.799> fan<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> does<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.380> nice

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
big fan of but it does for the nice

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.499 
big fan of but it does for the nice
canceling<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.189> guess<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.700> necessary

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
canceling so I guess it's a necessary

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.370 
canceling so I guess it's a necessary

isn't<00:03:47.720> too<00:03:47.959> bad<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.410> can<00:03:48.560> wear<00:03:49.340> these<00:03:49.489> over<00:03:49.850> a

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
isn't too bad you can wear these over a

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.090 
isn't too bad you can wear these over a
pretty<00:03:50.269> long<00:03:50.510> flight<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.989> they<00:03:51.109> should<00:03:51.380> last

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
pretty long flight and they should last

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.970 
pretty long flight and they should last
you<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:53.810> find<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.260> takes<00:03:54.440> about<00:03:54.590> two<00:03:54.950> hours

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
you just find it takes about two hours

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.250 
you just find it takes about two hours
to<00:03:55.430> fully<00:03:55.579> charge<00:03:55.790> though<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:56.660> like<00:03:57.079> I<00:03:57.200> said

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
to fully charge though and like I said

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.349 
to fully charge though and like I said
you<00:03:57.530> can<00:03:57.709> use<00:03:57.980> them<00:03:58.310> just<00:03:58.519> fine<00:03:58.910> without<00:03:59.150> the

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
you can use them just fine without the

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.960 
you can use them just fine without the
battery<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:01.100> won't<00:04:01.280> get<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> nice<00:04:01.549> cancelling

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
battery you won't get a nice cancelling

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.330 
battery you won't get a nice cancelling
of<00:04:02.090> course<00:04:02.299> but<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.109> QC<00:04:03.590> twenties<00:04:03.890> work

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
of course but it the QC twenties work

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.440 
of course but it the QC twenties work
like<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.549> normal<00:04:04.609> pair<00:04:04.940> of<00:04:05.000> headphones<00:04:05.150> without

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
like a normal pair of headphones without

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.220 
like a normal pair of headphones without
the<00:04:06.160> nice<00:04:07.160> canceling<00:04:07.579> or<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.090> battery<00:04:08.359> so<00:04:09.260> the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
the nice canceling or the battery so the

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.610 
the nice canceling or the battery so the
the<00:04:12.230> battery<00:04:13.069> model<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.579> definitely

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
the battery model is definitely

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.670 
the battery model is definitely
something<00:04:15.620> that's<00:04:16.010> necessary<00:04:16.669> in<00:04:17.180> this<00:04:17.299> case

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
something that's necessary in this case

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.840 
something that's necessary in this case
but<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.769> noise<00:04:18.889> cancelling<00:04:19.340> really<00:04:19.729> is

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
but the noise cancelling really is

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.039 
but the noise cancelling really is
fantastic

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
fantastic

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.740 
fantastic
when<00:04:21.409> you<00:04:21.500> switch<00:04:21.680> on<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:21.890> QC<00:04:22.400> 20s<00:04:22.760> right

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
when you switch on the QC 20s right

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.839 
when you switch on the QC 20s right
there<00:04:24.080> it's<00:04:24.260> like<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:25.340> like<00:04:25.460> you're<00:04:25.729> in<00:04:25.789> a

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
there it's like it's like you're in a

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.470 
there it's like it's like you're in a
room<00:04:26.090> and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
room and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.570 
room and
all<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.020> noise<00:04:27.170> gets<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.920> little<00:04:28.130> room<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.490> is

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
all the noise gets a little room it is

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.050 
all the noise gets a little room it is
really<00:04:29.390> amazing<00:04:30.140> these<00:04:31.040> are<00:04:31.100> by<00:04:31.370> far<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.880> best

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
really amazing these are by far the best

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.480 
really amazing these are by far the best
noise<00:04:32.360> cancelling<00:04:32.780> I've<00:04:32.900> heard<00:04:33.080> on<00:04:33.290> in<00:04:34.220> your

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
noise cancelling I've heard on in your

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.470 
noise cancelling I've heard on in your
pair<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.760> headphones<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:36.760> really<00:04:37.760> it's<00:04:38.000> it's

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
pair of headphones and really it's it's

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.720 
pair of headphones and really it's it's
quite<00:04:39.020> amazing<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.770> Bose<00:04:40.430> has<00:04:40.550> also

quite amazing that Bose has also

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.460 
quite amazing that Bose has also

introduced a very cool thing called

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.470 
introduced a very cool thing called
another<00:04:42.860> vert<00:04:43.130> mode<00:04:43.370> now<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.670> aware<00:04:44.090> mode<00:04:44.300> is

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
another vert mode now the aware mode is

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.880 
another vert mode now the aware mode is
very<00:04:44.510> cool<00:04:44.870> because<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.290> just<00:04:45.440> tap<00:04:45.680> this

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
very cool because you just tap this

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
mode allows you to use a nice canceling

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.010 
mode allows you to use a nice canceling
and<00:04:58.280> cancel<00:04:58.820> all<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.150> ambient<00:04:59.660> annoying

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
and cancel all the ambient annoying

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.020 
and cancel all the ambient annoying
background<00:05:00.710> noise<00:05:00.860> around<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.340> but<00:05:01.850> it'll

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
background noise around you but it'll

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.170 
background noise around you but it'll
filter<00:05:02.270> out<00:05:02.450> loud<00:05:02.810> noises<00:05:03.350> through<00:05:03.860> like

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
filter out loud noises through like

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.000 
filter out loud noises through like
voice<00:05:05.180> noises<00:05:05.660> that<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:05.990> for<00:05:06.560> example<00:05:06.680> if<00:05:06.920> you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
voice noises that is for example if you

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.100 
voice noises that is for example if you
are<00:05:07.130> in<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.430> airport<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.300> you<00:05:08.540> are<00:05:08.690> listening

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
are in a airport and you are listening

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.040 
are in a airport and you are listening
for<00:05:09.350> your<00:05:09.530> paging<00:05:10.160> announcement<00:05:10.840> this<00:05:11.840> will

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
for your paging announcement this will

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.600 
for your paging announcement this will
allow<00:05:12.740> you<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:13.420> hear<00:05:14.420> that<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:15.920> does<00:05:16.160> dial

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
allow you to hear that so it does dial

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.400 
allow you to hear that so it does dial
down<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:16.970> ice<00:05:17.030> cancelling<00:05:17.450> in<00:05:17.600> this<00:05:17.750> sort<00:05:18.290> of

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
down and ice cancelling in this sort of

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.050 
down and ice cancelling in this sort of
way<00:05:18.650> but<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:20.330> still<00:05:21.170> would<00:05:21.590> just<00:05:21.860> take<00:05:22.130> one<00:05:22.970> of

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
way but I still would just take one of

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.250 
way but I still would just take one of
the<00:05:23.150> headphones<00:05:23.480> out<00:05:23.570> of<00:05:23.660> my<00:05:23.720> ear<00:05:23.960> to<00:05:24.170> listen

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
the headphones out of my ear to listen

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.980 
the headphones out of my ear to listen
to<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.530> because<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:24.830> really<00:05:25.180> as<00:05:26.180> nice<00:05:26.750> as<00:05:26.960> a

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
to it because it really as nice as a

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.850 
to it because it really as nice as a
wormwood<00:05:27.380> is<00:05:27.590> I<00:05:27.770> don't<00:05:28.340> really<00:05:28.490> trust<00:05:28.700> it<00:05:29.260> so<00:05:30.260> a

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
wormwood is I don't really trust it so a

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.160 
wormwood is I don't really trust it so a
very<00:05:31.580> mod<00:05:31.700> is<00:05:31.820> definitely<00:05:32.240> nice<00:05:32.390> if<00:05:32.630> you<00:05:32.840> are

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
very mod is definitely nice if you are

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.100 
very mod is definitely nice if you are
into<00:05:33.500> that<00:05:33.530> sort<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:33.890> thing<00:05:34.720> but<00:05:35.720> seriously

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
into that sort of thing but seriously

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.440 
into that sort of thing but seriously
the<00:05:36.230> noise<00:05:36.380> canceling<00:05:36.830> is<00:05:37.010> fantastic<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.150> talk

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
the noise canceling is fantastic to talk

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.270 
the noise canceling is fantastic to talk
about<00:05:38.690> sound<00:05:39.170> quality<00:05:39.320> because<00:05:39.860> that's<00:05:40.160> the

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
about sound quality because that's the

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.490 
about sound quality because that's the
most<00:05:40.430> important<00:05:40.820> part<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.990> get<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.230> same

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
most important part you get the same

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.740 
most important part you get the same
high<00:05:42.740> quality<00:05:42.970> audio<00:05:43.970> that<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:44.330> can<00:05:44.480> expect

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
high quality audio that you can expect
