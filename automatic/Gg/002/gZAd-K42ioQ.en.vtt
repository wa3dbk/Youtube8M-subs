00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the reason that I got this one is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
the reason that I got this one is
because<00:02:03.060> perfume<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> really<00:02:04.619> slight

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
because perfume is a really slight

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.700 
because perfume is a really slight
personal<00:02:05.490> specific<00:02:06.450> thing<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> thought<00:02:07.560> if

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
personal specific thing so I thought if

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.469 
personal specific thing so I thought if
I<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> little<00:02:08.280> bottle<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.970> winner<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
I get a little bottle for the winner and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.119 
I get a little bottle for the winner and
if<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.140> don't<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.440> how<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> doesn't<00:02:10.979> work

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
if they don't like how it doesn't work
