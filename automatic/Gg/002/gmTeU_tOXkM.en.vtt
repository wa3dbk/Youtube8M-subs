 it did not fit in a hospital bed but 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.110
 these inconveniences were the least 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.960
 joel with about 800 pounds of weight 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.050

 people with this weight do not usually 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.879
 they surpass the 40 years they die before 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.879
 due to various complications 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.290

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.909
 several years of life 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.410
 the 2006 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.730
 not very used, a 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.910
 depth 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.900
 that makes it impossible for me to walk 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.180
 dependent on an oxygen 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.190
 I lacked a lot of air of no black 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 of the dream 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.070
 I could not more like how life could not anymore 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.259
 through a newspaper that came out in the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.130
 2010 a report on the operation 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.259
 bariatric bariatric surgeries 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.780
 I decided to look for the doctor in all the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.579
 Antonio Cortez felt before moving on to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.649
 calixto clinical-surgical hospital 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.090
 I garcía the income for four 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.179
 months at the institute of endocrinology 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.609
 to undergo various tests and treat 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.259
 of reducing your body weight for the sake of 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.719
 get to the operation with the least 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.030
 amount of possible risks was not 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.069
 easy for this Matanzas to move to 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.020
 the capital was a challenge also for the 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.569
 health personnel to testing 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.750
 corresponding to a man who 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.099
 tripled the weight of a normal person 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.620
 long while since I also went in 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.690
 portal was the one called 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.880
 the people are amazed and I am very good 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.220
 they take my flight but 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.320
 and when I'm going to get into the truck with 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.270
 the help of admitted and they will say a friend 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.270
 which was with which I could get to me 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.190
 I remain working in the putting in the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.980
 sunset where should I enter 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.210
 and then people imagine all the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.930
 world laughed others cried 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.190
 and he passed a funny bicycle and says 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.500
 to grade what slip because it is 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.440
 I was really stuck 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.040
 and now I could barely get out of there 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.959
 recording and I sat in my armchair 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.240
 So they decided to look at the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.040
 Van 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.050
 look at the truck through the door 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.640
 back open some compound that has 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.670
 out there with a homemade winche or them 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.330
 they make rope and some bricks in 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.790
 songs managed to climb me 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.290
 when I went up town among everything 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.310
 they were gathered and they started to 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.310
 applaud and many cried 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.500
 I went out the window and said I'm leaving 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.500
 to do tomorrow go back running 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.350
 already in the hospital after lowering almost 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.160
 100 kilos joel was ready for the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.210
 bariatric 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.790
 for the magnitude of the case 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.860
 he has the technique number 4 which is the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.650
 mixed media but that has a 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.220
 component also 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.730
 malabsorptive is the only way that 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.180
 we can this young Cuban can all 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.840
 a year and take it to its normal weight with 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.120
 this technique we hope you can lose 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.150
 about 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.000
 a kilo and a half to two kilos per day 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.069
 especially the first month for it he 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.019
 they had to make a special bed 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.780
 because the currents could not stand their 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.180
 weight the operation lasted just over five 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.730
 hours five hours in which surgeons 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.980
 anesthesiologists and nurses made a 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.980
 meticulous work and not a little exhausting 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.020
 joel comes to his first consultation in the 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.230
 Political ramp with many 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.210
 stories to tell evolving 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.420
 correctly the diet making it 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.940
 rigorous what I need a little bit is 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.370
 more walking but I'm walking something 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.930
 a long time ago I did not walk and when 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.689
 easier way a little bit but I'm 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.599
 achieving the walk quite 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.550
 I feel good singing and it seems that the 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.960
 studio stuck 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:54.740
 in the house when I arrived 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:56.240
 the dresses that I came here for I'm 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.289
 saying we're not for almost like 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.289

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.410
 shortly I will be able to do what 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.850
 more you want in life to run 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.540
