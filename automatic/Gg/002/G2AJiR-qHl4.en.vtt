00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.729
 Hello people and rulers comes to another video of me incomparable 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:07.490
 makes imagine in individual scenes so far the whole 2 is on the iPad 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.519
 however, it's a universal app so Sievert is on all devices and here 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.969
 He wants to be the first different choices 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.210
 we can hand over our high scores and also award said 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.060
 to compare 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.490
 and so will the setting since there is really a lot to set that up 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.810
 You can logically adapt everything you should on the negotiation 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 has made 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.910
 including a player and a multiplayer 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.190
 This easy synonymous except that you just stop in the multiplayer 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.980
 so that he can play with his friends 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.170
 as Heike Schülein again in the course, it percent of the corresponding 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.970
 exactly the same aggressive opponents are says differently 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.589
 and yes we now have four different worlds to introduce the internet 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.620
 But we will come from the holidays that I definitely want 

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.559
 really good and now world champion once so far from the guests 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.630
 I'm not at all yet 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.370
 that has the first rank 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.820
 in Lahde which one also to the action that is quite cool to Kamil 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.620
 led to bridge 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.920
 and he already knows the world and two silver pieces of legislation 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.949
 characters 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.559
 and this opportunity to get around with these controls was everywhere 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.759
 but always liked better and outside one could jump off and 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:08.550
 shoot 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.880
 their Wetziker thus steam so Jan Boddaert Ali Cakici she goes 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.829
 graduate are when I die 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.660
 I get experience points for that 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.000
 These experience points need in your safe, the CEO 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.939
 already lost 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.280
 Wrabetz got those two experience points the city got 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.190
 if this bar has filled up completely with the experience points 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.370
 then I climb up a level again 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.950
 I'm supposed to start summer nine years and then it always went important of this show 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 still with the then still go well with this official is easy 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.910
 mainly I am now so lonely have you seen this one 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.430
 Characters has changed 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.990
 These are considered an attack of the problem last year. Unity prevailed 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.810
 burn again here 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.870
 yes still every mission 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.150
 Jakobi so if the opponents and of which one does not get any points loses 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.210
 but not always like that 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.070
 Milan Attack is now considering something and then the opponents are buying 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.900
 Here's what they shoot at Heinze for Google 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.930
 could throw me off for students in the fire 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.470
 so do not be permanently index and now comes his defender the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.000
 known a bit more 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.680
 Warburg we did not need anymore but some top titles like 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.799
 possible different bring depending on 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.099
 how big the tires are, how strong they are to keep us from trickling on sale 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.359
 defeat 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.319
 Such names are not all about making these together 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.329
 has always got close characters 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.569
 At the end of a level, you do not get all that weaponing again 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.259
 It also determines that it's the same because they already have it 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.779
 There are many characters 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.149
 I have not played all free yet 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.149
 the Mangfall broken jumping was and thus that from Rees 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:43.729
 Owners of the new highscore that the number at 0 62 and now money again 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.939
 Not even twelve left and to unlock this new character 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.289
 with those depicted with the still drawn is the alpha John 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:55.029
 Texas just gets stupid that according to our characters still April so 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.699
 to do better, so to speak 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.279
 especially since we can now say minutes and asterisks to this acquittal 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.919
 do poets what comes new then so there you can do better what it is 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:04.559
 is 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.439
 the role was two points for me »had only one and this Cooper gets 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.279
 you just in the game itself 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.720
 so that 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.520
 regrettable that points anyway 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.040
 All of this there you have to and the players can not upgrade the dwarves any more 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.389
 Fire spit something like that 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.389
 and yes, there are different levels 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.239
 which is when the last one is still open what is the difference 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.299
 and although he sees here she is completely different so that percent 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.039
 Levels completely changed it is harder because methadone has been here and 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.799
 There are also other opponents that are difficult to defeat 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.439
 they are still a bit more knowledgeable about this I have that 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.379
 feeling 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.519
 Business consultant like that 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.490
 and so on 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.989
 and that's what it's about all the time wearing 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.499
 so characters free to climb this up and then 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:55.129
 they are better so it's not just about doing the same thing 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.869
 So it is, of course, the work of the Association has always something new 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.499
 that is not us 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.989
 and therefore I am the people are really quite good at the bar thousand 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.809
 last game in between, therefore, can not recommend lying and 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.379
 what one is again formed to see the protest
