 despite the Spanish gas progeny 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.820
 to use their four-stroke bikes 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.050
 Japanese propellers from the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.050
 motorcycles and love 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.829
 gas gas does not escape the rule and 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.879
 with equipment such as suspension and brakes 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.129
 first line 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.710
 we can expect nothing but 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.180
 fantastic performance even on tracks 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.180
 so punished by rain 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.180
 from electrical is essential and 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.420
 despite being fueled by carburetor 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.580
 the engine performance is consistent with 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.870
 that more experienced pilots can 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.870
 wait for a brave bull

 with marzocchi and mono-finer bunches 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.409
 orders 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.130
 both fully adjustable to find the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.810
 suspension set-up is an easy task 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.770
 regardless of their weight and size 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.659
 physicist 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.090
 speaking in weight this is the key point 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:31.720
 to efficiently pilot this 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:34.149

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.890
 chrome mobily dÃªnio the motorcycle does not 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.789
 is among the lightest of its 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.920
 category 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.940

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.039
 negative 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.319
 Just a few laps to get the hang of it. 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.740
 and take from it all your income 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.289
 expected to gaza in 2013 promises to bring

 250 cylinder and has displacements 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.500
 in gas-fired four-stroke gas today is 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.420
 250 f shows zÃ© and the 450 season is this 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.520
 model that is here but this is not the
