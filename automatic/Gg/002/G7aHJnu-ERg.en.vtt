00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and after convergence number zero I was

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.140 
and after convergence number zero I was
very<00:00:23.070> worried<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.609> they<00:00:23.699> were<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.000> going

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
very worried that they were just going

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.970 
very worried that they were just going

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.259 
did they try and do that no not at all
in<00:00:28.920> fact<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.429> couldn't<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.760> farther<00:00:29.939> away<00:00:30.150> from

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
in fact it couldn't be farther away from

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
number zero in that respect it's like

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.790 
number zero in that respect it's like
they<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.450> much<00:00:39.840> story<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.620> want

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
they don't have much story but they want

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.920 
they don't have much story but they want
to<00:00:40.890> spread<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.430> over<00:00:41.489> eight<00:00:42.030> issues<00:00:42.540> when

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
to spread it out over eight issues when

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.540 
to spread it out over eight issues when
an<00:00:43.050> actual<00:00:43.379> fact<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.860> could<00:00:43.980> probably<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.370> done

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
an actual fact it could probably be done

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.569 
an actual fact it could probably be done
in<00:00:44.850> about<00:00:44.969> five<00:00:45.480> issues<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.469> that's<00:00:46.890> never<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
in about five issues and that's never a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.520 
in about five issues and that's never a
good<00:00:47.730> thing<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.020> always<00:00:49.200> makes

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
good thing to do because it always makes

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
good thing to do because it always makes
the<00:00:49.739> story<00:00:49.980> seemed<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> lot<00:00:50.670> worse<00:00:50.969> than<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the story seemed a lot worse than it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.080 
the story seemed a lot worse than it
actually<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.620> did<00:00:52.980> love<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> focus<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.879> earth

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
actually is I did love to focus on earth

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.119 
actually is I did love to focus on earth
two<00:00:54.329> characters<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.469> did<00:00:55.620> love<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.039> we

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
two characters and it did love that we

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.830 
two characters and it did love that we
didn't<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.399> focus<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:57.180> character<00:00:57.690> from

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
didn't just focus on one character from

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
didn't just focus on one character from
the<00:00:57.960> cast<00:00:58.199> more<00:00:58.500> than<00:00:58.710> anyone<00:00:59.129> else<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.820> was

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the cast more than anyone else it was

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.599 
the cast more than anyone else it was
very<00:01:00.059> evenly<00:01:00.989> spread<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.100> not

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
very evenly spread out and that's not

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.429 
very evenly spread out and that's not
something<00:01:02.879> that's<00:01:03.270> easy<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
something that's easy to do and in the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
something that's easy to do and in the
new<00:01:04.559> 52<00:01:04.710> they've<00:01:05.159> been<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:05.580> very<00:01:05.760> guilty<00:01:06.090> of

new 52 they've been very very guilty of
doing<00:01:06.450> teen<00:01:06.869> books<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.040> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
doing teen books but it's really this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
doing teen books but it's really this
character<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> rest<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.930> those<00:01:10.049> guys

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.800 
character and the rest of those guys
this<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.520> very<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:12.119> spread<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.600> between

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
this was very well spread out between

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
this was very well spread out between
the<00:01:13.110> entire<00:01:13.500> cast<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.400> loved<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.119> also

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the entire cast and I loved it I also

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
the entire cast and I loved it I also
loved<00:01:15.720> looking<00:01:15.869> at<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> injustice<00:01:16.590> universe

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
loved looking at the injustice universe

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.710 
loved looking at the injustice universe
at<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> beginning<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.090> book<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
at the beginning of this book the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.810 
at the beginning of this book the
injustice<00:01:19.020> universe<00:01:19.590> isn't<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> play

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
injustice universe isn't going to play

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
injustice universe isn't going to play
too<00:01:21.210> much<00:01:21.390> into<00:01:21.689> convergence<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:22.500> think

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
too much into convergence I don't think

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.960 
too much into convergence I don't think
I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.159> mostly<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.790> about

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I think it's mostly going to be about

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
I think it's mostly going to be about
the<00:01:24.210> earth<00:01:24.390> two<00:01:24.750> characters<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the earth two characters but the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
the earth two characters but the
injustice<00:01:26.130> characters<00:01:26.820> are<00:01:27.119> still<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.930> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
injustice characters are still kind of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
injustice characters are still kind of
interesting<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> very<00:01:28.979> interesting<00:01:29.700> take

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
interesting is a very interesting take

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.580 
interesting is a very interesting take
on<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.360> well<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.810> reminds<00:01:31.079> me<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
on that well it reminds me a bit of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
on that well it reminds me a bit of
kingdom<00:01:32.040> come<00:01:32.250> from<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.790> honest<00:01:33.090> but

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
kingdom come from going to be honest but

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
kingdom come from going to be honest but
