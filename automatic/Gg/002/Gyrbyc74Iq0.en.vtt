00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
what do slobs have to do with laundry I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.240 
what do slobs have to do with laundry I
mean<00:00:56.780> think<00:00:56.990> about<00:00:57.080> it<00:00:57.230> Slavs<00:00:57.650> have<00:00:58.070> been

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
mean think about it Slavs have been

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.430 
mean think about it Slavs have been
through<00:00:58.460> everything<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.210> Ice<00:00:59.390> Age<00:00:59.690> global

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
through everything the Ice Age global

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.190 
through everything the Ice Age global
warming<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:04.600> so<00:01:05.600> how<00:01:05.780> do<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:05.960> think<00:01:06.050> that

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
warming so so how do you think that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.660 
warming so so how do you think that
those<00:01:06.380> creatures<00:01:06.560> have<00:01:06.890> survived<00:01:07.280> through<00:01:07.490> at

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
those creatures have survived through at

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.910 
those creatures have survived through at
all<00:01:07.790> they're<00:01:08.510> not<00:01:08.630> predators<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.470> there's<00:01:09.680> no

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
all they're not predators and there's no

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.520 
all they're not predators and there's no
way<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.400> they<00:01:10.610> place<00:01:11.390> anywhere<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.320> food

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
way that they place anywhere on the food

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.460 
way that they place anywhere on the food
chain<00:01:12.800> for<00:01:13.040> sure<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.540> sloths<00:01:14.930> why<00:01:15.170> are<00:01:15.230> they

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
chain for sure so sloths why are they

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.430 
chain for sure so sloths why are they
still<00:01:16.130> here<00:01:17.170> that's<00:01:18.170> something<00:01:18.410> I<00:01:18.950> don't<00:01:19.700> know

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
still here that's something I don't know

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.670 
still here that's something I don't know
no<00:01:21.440> one<00:01:21.650> does<00:01:23.200> why<00:01:24.200> are<00:01:24.260> they<00:01:24.350> still<00:01:24.619> here

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
no one does why are they still here

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.090 
no one does why are they still here
that's<00:01:25.040> crazy<00:01:25.340> my<00:01:26.270> theory<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.100> they

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
that's crazy my theory is that they

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.490 
that's crazy my theory is that they
exist<00:01:28.550> for<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.910> very<00:01:29.300> specific<00:01:29.630> reason<00:01:30.050> think

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
exist for a very specific reason think

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.810 
exist for a very specific reason think
they<00:01:30.650> would<00:01:30.800> have<00:01:30.830> gone<00:01:31.009> extinct<00:01:31.550> or<00:01:31.670> if<00:01:31.729> they

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
they would have gone extinct or if they

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.490 
they would have gone extinct or if they
would<00:01:31.970> have<00:01:32.000> never<00:01:32.210> existed<00:01:32.570> at<00:01:33.080> all<00:01:33.200> perhaps

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
would have never existed at all perhaps

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.010 
would have never existed at all perhaps
the<00:01:34.490> world<00:01:34.729> would<00:01:34.820> be<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.060> totally<00:01:35.660> different

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
the world would be a totally different

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.640 
the world would be a totally different
place<00:01:37.030> but<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:40.220> if<00:01:40.729> sloths<00:01:41.479> didn't<00:01:42.200> exist<00:01:42.560> I

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
place but so if sloths didn't exist I

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.490 
place but so if sloths didn't exist I
mean<00:01:42.800> why<00:01:42.920> would<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.160> change<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.550> world

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
mean why would that change the world

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.130 
mean why would that change the world
who's<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:46.070> mean<00:01:46.310> they<00:01:46.940> could<00:01:46.970> be<00:01:47.270> like<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.900> big

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
who's I mean they could be like the big

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.350 
who's I mean they could be like the big
bang<00:01:48.380> theory<00:01:48.890> or<00:01:49.130> something<00:01:49.550> if<00:01:49.729> Schloss<00:01:50.060> had

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
bang theory or something if Schloss had

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.510 
bang theory or something if Schloss had
never<00:01:50.570> existed<00:01:52.720> humans<00:01:53.720> could<00:01:54.140> be<00:01:54.320> walking<00:01:55.130> on

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
never existed humans could be walking on

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.859 
never existed humans could be walking on
four<00:01:55.880> legs<00:01:56.060> still<00:01:58.149> so<00:01:59.149> what<00:01:59.210> you're<00:01:59.390> saying<00:01:59.660> is

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
four legs still so what you're saying is

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.380 
four legs still so what you're saying is
if<00:02:00.649> sloths<00:02:01.009> didn't<00:02:01.550> exist<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.090> might<00:02:02.270> not

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
if sloths didn't exist you might not

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.279 
if sloths didn't exist you might not
have<00:02:02.509> bumped<00:02:02.899> into<00:02:03.050> me<00:02:05.530> yeah<00:02:06.729> yeah<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.360> you

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
have bumped into me yeah yeah and you

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.410 
have bumped into me yeah yeah and you
might<00:02:09.770> not<00:02:09.800> wanted<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.460> cannot<00:02:10.729> Eminem's<00:02:11.210> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
might not wanted the cannot Eminem's and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.580 
might not wanted the cannot Eminem's and
you<00:02:11.569> wouldn't<00:02:11.810> have<00:02:11.930> come<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.230> here<00:02:12.410> we
