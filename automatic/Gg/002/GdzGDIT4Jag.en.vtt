little bit on the bench I think the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.990 
little bit on the bench I think the
biggest<00:02:07.170> thing<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.500> Mirza<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.849> knew<00:02:08.970> to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
biggest thing with Mirza is we knew to

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.080 
player I think that benefits the team as
well<00:02:24.069> as<00:02:24.220> him<00:02:24.340> because<00:02:24.610> if<00:02:24.700> he<00:02:24.730> just<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:25.000> there

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090

the<00:03:08.260> Nets<00:03:08.440> have<00:03:08.590> struggled<00:03:08.950> because<00:03:09.040> they

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the Nets have struggled because they

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.860 
the Nets have struggled because they
don't<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.459> all<00:03:09.700> their<00:03:09.849> pieces<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:10.450> but

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
don't have all their pieces but but

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.300 
don't have all their pieces but but
Joe's<00:03:11.080> not<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.440> reason<00:03:11.590> for<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:11.860> struggle

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
Joe's not the reason for that struggle

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.949 
Joe's not the reason for that struggle
right<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:12.880> got<00:03:13.090> like<00:03:13.299> he's<00:03:13.450> ever<00:03:13.690> saying

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
right I got like he's ever saying

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.110 
right I got like he's ever saying
basically<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.500> think<00:03:14.739> Joe<00:03:15.069> has<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.610> be<00:03:15.760> able<00:03:15.849> to

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
basically I think Joe has to be able to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.210 
basically I think Joe has to be able to
be<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.780> focal<00:03:17.109> point<00:03:17.140> on<00:03:17.380> offense<00:03:17.769> at<00:03:17.950> times

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
be the focal point on offense at times

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.599 
be the focal point on offense at times
no<00:03:18.609> own<00:03:18.760> time<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:19.450> with<00:03:19.600> Gus<00:03:19.840> Darren<00:03:20.380> out

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
no own time but with Gus Darren out

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.670 
no own time but with Gus Darren out
Brooke<00:03:21.609> out<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.600> have<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.810> consistent<00:03:23.320> option

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
Brooke out to have a consistent option

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.009 
Brooke out to have a consistent option
on<00:03:23.829> offense<00:03:24.310> we<00:03:24.489> go<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.790> boil<00:03:25.030> for<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.299> guy<00:03:25.420> say

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
on offense we go to boil for the guy say

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.620 
on offense we go to boil for the guy say
here<00:03:26.260> make<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:26.980> move<00:03:27.100> for<00:03:27.280> me<00:03:27.400> make<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.030> play<00:03:28.329> and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
here make it move for me make a play and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.479 
here make it move for me make a play and
we<00:03:29.109> take<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.290> from<00:03:29.380> there<00:03:29.620> they<00:03:30.130> need<00:03:30.340> that

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
we take it from there they need that

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.640 
we take it from there they need that
because<00:03:30.880> with<00:03:31.239> Joe<00:03:31.600> give<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.290> mismatch

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
because with Joe give the mismatch

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.780 
because with Joe give the mismatch
almost<00:03:33.010> every<00:03:33.220> time<00:03:33.400> he's<00:03:33.489> on<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.670> floor

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
almost every time he's on the floor

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.640 
almost every time he's on the floor
there's<00:03:34.180> very<00:03:34.510> few<00:03:34.600> two<00:03:34.989> guards<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.350> illegal

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.080 
there's very few two guards in illegal
actually<00:03:35.799> can<00:03:36.040> guard<00:03:36.250> him<00:03:36.310> one<00:03:36.940> on<00:03:36.970> one

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
actually can guard him one on one

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.910 
actually can guard him one on one
without<00:03:37.239> getting<00:03:37.600> some<00:03:37.720> help<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.380> they<00:03:38.650> go<00:03:38.859> to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
without getting some help so they go to

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.920 
without getting some help so they go to

Pierce and Joe Johnson will eventually

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.520 
Pierce and Joe Johnson will eventually
work<00:03:57.220> their<00:03:57.790> games<00:03:58.180> seem<00:03:58.600> too<00:03:58.870> similar<00:03:59.170> I

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
work their games seem too similar I

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.960 
work their games seem too similar I
absolutely<00:04:00.220> think<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.549> they<00:04:00.670> can<00:04:00.730> work

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
absolutely think that they can work

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.920 
absolutely think that they can work
because<00:04:01.299> I<00:04:01.329> mean<00:04:01.510> if<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:01.660> look<00:04:01.780> at<00:04:01.870> the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
because I mean if you look at the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.629 
because I mean if you look at the
beginning<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.380> season<00:04:02.620> Pierce<00:04:03.459> was

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.309 
beginning of the season Pierce was
actually<00:04:04.180> shooting<00:04:04.420> quite<00:04:04.720> well<00:04:04.900> he<00:04:05.200> was

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
actually shooting quite well he was

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.080 
actually shooting quite well he was
hitting<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.620> lot<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.859> shots<00:04:06.040> he<00:04:06.730> was<00:04:06.850> playing

hitting a lot of shots he was playing

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.449 
hitting a lot of shots he was playing
very<00:04:07.269> easily<00:04:07.630> within<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.230> offense<00:04:08.650> then<00:04:09.370> he

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
very easily within the offense then he

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.680 
very easily within the offense then he
started<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.790> struggle<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.120> little<00:04:10.209> bit<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:10.600> now

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
started to struggle a little bit and now

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.360 
started to struggle a little bit and now
he's<00:04:10.840> got<00:04:10.989> this<00:04:11.109> hand<00:04:11.350> injury<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.769> actually

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
he's got this hand injury that actually

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.379 
he's got this hand injury that actually
might<00:04:12.430> give<00:04:12.609> him<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.730> little<00:04:12.880> bit<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.030> rest<00:04:13.209> for

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
might give him a little bit of rest for

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:14.789 
might give him a little bit of rest for
the<00:04:13.420> next<00:04:13.569> two<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.870> four<00:04:14.049> weeks<00:04:14.079> but

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
the next two to four weeks but

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:15.780 
the next two to four weeks but
absolutely<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.250> think<00:04:15.310> they<00:04:15.519> can<00:04:15.639> play

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
absolutely I think they can play

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.190 
absolutely I think they can play
together<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:16.150> think<00:04:16.269> Johnson<00:04:16.630> is<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.900> talented

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
together I think Johnson is a talented

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.750 
together I think Johnson is a talented
enough<00:04:17.440> score<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:17.950> spot<00:04:18.160> up<00:04:18.280> shooter<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.669> he

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
enough score and spot up shooter that he

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.279 
enough score and spot up shooter that he
can<00:04:18.910> spot<00:04:19.120> up<00:04:19.239> around<00:04:19.510> Pierce<00:04:19.870> when<00:04:20.049> Pierce

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
can spot up around Pierce when Pierce

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.140 
can spot up around Pierce when Pierce
wants<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.620> facilitate<00:04:21.099> and<00:04:21.250> Pierce<00:04:21.789> is<00:04:21.940> one<00:04:22.060> of

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
wants to facilitate and Pierce is one of

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.310 
wants to facilitate and Pierce is one of
the<00:04:22.210> league's<00:04:22.390> best<00:04:22.630> shooters<00:04:22.960> from<00:04:23.050> above

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
the league's best shooters from above

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.960 
the league's best shooters from above
the<00:04:23.440> break<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.770> three-pointers<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.460> cream

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
the break in three-pointers and cream

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.140 
the break in three-pointers and cream
can<00:04:25.419> create<00:04:25.659> his<00:04:25.750> own<00:04:25.810> shot

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
can create his own shot

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.670 
can create his own shot
most<00:04:26.330> any<00:04:26.449> defender<00:04:26.900> so<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.229> think<00:04:27.350> when<00:04:27.590> you

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
most any defender so I think when you

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.740 
most any defender so I think when you
have<00:04:27.800> two<00:04:27.979> guys<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.669> talented<00:04:29.240> you

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
have two guys that is that talented you

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.939 
have two guys that is that talented you
know<00:04:29.780> their<00:04:29.990> games<00:04:30.169> might<00:04:30.350> be<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.500> little<00:04:30.710> bit

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
know their games might be a little bit

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.100 
know their games might be a little bit
similar<00:04:31.160> but<00:04:31.460> they<00:04:31.580> still<00:04:31.790> have<00:04:31.940> very<00:04:32.180> very

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
similar but they still have very very

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.749 
similar but they still have very very
specific<00:04:33.650> skills<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.280> they<00:04:34.400> can<00:04:34.550> bring<00:04:34.729> to

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
specific skills that they can bring to

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.100 
specific skills that they can bring to
the<00:04:34.880> table<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.330> can<00:04:35.419> complement<00:04:35.870> each<00:04:35.900> other

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
the table that can complement each other

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.499 
the table that can complement each other
well<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.500> think<00:04:36.800> like<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:37.639> said<00:04:37.850> they're<00:04:38.300> both

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
well I think like you said they're both

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.960 
well I think like you said they're both
similar<00:04:38.900> players<00:04:39.289> and<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:40.039> believe<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:40.610> they

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
similar players and I believe that they

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.390 
similar players and I believe that they
can<00:04:41.000> work<00:04:41.780> together<00:04:42.020> but<00:04:42.770> also<00:04:42.979> believe<00:04:43.250> that

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
can work together but also believe that

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.340 
can work together but also believe that
eventually<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.419> imperious<00:04:44.750> comes<00:04:44.900> back<00:04:45.139> if

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
eventually the imperious comes back if

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.050 
eventually the imperious comes back if
it<00:04:45.470> doesn't<00:04:45.800> kind<00:04:45.979> of<00:04:46.070> coexist<00:04:46.639> with<00:04:46.789> him<00:04:46.910> and

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
it doesn't kind of coexist with him and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.730 
it doesn't kind of coexist with him and
Joan<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.300> court<00:04:47.509> kiss<00:04:48.169> you<00:04:48.289> probably<00:04:48.560> could

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
Joan the court kiss you probably could

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.350 
Joan the court kiss you probably could
maybe<00:04:48.830> bring<00:04:49.009> it<00:04:49.190> Pierce<00:04:49.340> off<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> bench<00:04:49.789> you

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
maybe bring it Pierce off the bench you

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.850 
maybe bring it Pierce off the bench you
know<00:04:50.449> maybe<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.720> seventh<00:04:51.169> man<00:04:51.410> something<00:04:51.770> like

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
know maybe a seventh man something like

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.159 
know maybe a seventh man something like
that<00:04:52.100> six<00:04:52.669> man<00:04:52.880> because<00:04:53.240> I<00:04:53.360> feel<00:04:53.570> like<00:04:53.690> at

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
that six man because I feel like at

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.189 
that six man because I feel like at
times<00:04:54.410> during<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.919> game<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.600> need<00:04:56.600> just

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
times during the game you need just

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.080 
times during the game you need just
different<00:04:57.620> looks<00:04:57.860> out<00:04:58.039> there<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.520> Pierce<00:04:58.910> at

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
different looks out there and Pierce at

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.760 
different looks out there and Pierce at
times<00:04:59.330> is<00:04:59.539> kind<00:04:59.750> of<00:04:59.810> floating<00:05:00.139> on<00:05:00.229> offense<00:05:00.620> and

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
times is kind of floating on offense and

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.250 
times is kind of floating on offense and
with<00:05:01.130> Joe<00:05:01.430> we<00:05:01.610> know<00:05:01.760> what<00:05:01.910> he's<00:05:02.030> getting

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
with Joe we know what he's getting

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
with Joe we know what he's getting
pacifically<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.500> if<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.650> take<00:05:03.979> them<00:05:04.039> out<00:05:04.220> and

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
pacifically and if you take them out and

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.860 
pacifically and if you take them out and
sub<00:05:04.610> them<00:05:04.729> and<00:05:04.940> put<00:05:05.270> pierced<00:05:05.479> in<00:05:05.570> this<00:05:05.660> place

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
sub them and put pierced in this place

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.600 
sub them and put pierced in this place
to<00:05:06.410> me<00:05:06.590> it's<00:05:06.710> probably<00:05:06.919> a<00:05:06.979> better<00:05:07.130> option<00:05:07.370> at

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
to me it's probably a better option at

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.950 
to me it's probably a better option at
times<00:05:07.789> during<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.180> certain<00:05:08.360> parts<00:05:08.690> of<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.780> game

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
times during a certain parts of the game

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.450 
times during a certain parts of the game
really<00:05:09.229> quick<00:05:09.530> just<00:05:09.560> let<00:05:09.860> me<00:05:09.949> follow<00:05:10.160> up<00:05:10.280> with

really quick just let me follow up with
your<00:05:10.580> do<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:11.419> think<00:05:11.750> Pierce<00:05:12.500> would<00:05:12.710> be

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
your do you think Pierce would be

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.320 
your do you think Pierce would be
willing<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.400> do<00:05:13.580> that<00:05:13.610> that's<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.180> good

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
willing to do that that's a good

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.930 
willing to do that that's a good
question<00:05:14.479> I'm<00:05:14.750> not<00:05:14.900> sure<00:05:14.960> because<00:05:15.740> as<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.190> proud

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
question I'm not sure because as a proud

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.550 
question I'm not sure because as a proud
veteran<00:05:17.599> started<00:05:17.960> pretty<00:05:18.139> much<00:05:18.320> his<00:05:18.440> entire

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
veteran started pretty much his entire

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.469 
veteran started pretty much his entire
career<00:05:18.949> that's<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.789> big<00:05:19.940> step<00:05:20.150> from<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.389> say

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
career that's the big step from and say

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.270 
career that's the big step from and say
you<00:05:20.539> know<00:05:20.690> what<00:05:20.720> you<00:05:21.020> came<00:05:21.139> to<00:05:21.199> this<00:05:21.380> team<00:05:21.620> not

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
you know what you came to this team not

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.700 
you know what you came to this team not
come<00:05:22.430> off<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.610> bench<00:05:22.760> for<00:05:22.910> us<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.840> might<00:05:24.620> be

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
come off the bench for us it might be

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.230 
come off the bench for us it might be
tough<00:05:24.889> to<00:05:25.009> frame<00:05:25.190> to<00:05:25.280> do<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.550> first<00:05:25.789> but<00:05:26.210> I

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
tough to frame to do that first but I

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.060 
tough to frame to do that first but I
believe<00:05:26.300> if<00:05:26.840> he's<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.050> real<00:05:27.259> professional<00:05:27.380> and

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
believe if he's a real professional and

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.650 
believe if he's a real professional and
talks<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.430> kid<00:05:28.580> about<00:05:28.699> it<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.270> he<00:05:29.419> will<00:05:29.570> do

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
talks a kid about it that he will do

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.800 
talks a kid about it that he will do
something<00:05:29.810> my<00:05:29.990> dad<00:05:30.169> they<00:05:30.320> asked<00:05:30.560> me<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.680> do<00:05:30.770> it
