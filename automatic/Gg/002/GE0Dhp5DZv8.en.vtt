fifty it effectively cuts the wastewater
in<00:00:30.570> half<00:00:30.749> by<00:00:30.990> adding<00:00:31.259> a<00:00:31.320> second<00:00:31.859> membrane<00:00:32.279> what

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
in half by adding a second membrane what

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.890 
in half by adding a second membrane what
we're<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.450> connect<00:00:33.690> them<00:00:33.810> in

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
we're going to do is connect them in

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.299 
we're going to do is connect them in
series<00:00:33.930> which<00:00:34.559> means<00:00:34.590> we're<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.129> feed

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
series which means we're going to feed

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.279 
series which means we're going to feed
one<00:00:35.579> membrane<00:00:36.059> off<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> other<00:00:36.600> using<00:00:37.199> a

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
one membrane off the other using a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
method known as wastewater staging which

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
method known as wastewater staging which
is<00:00:39.539> super<00:00:40.020> popular<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> wide<00:00:40.949> variety<00:00:41.309> of

is super popular in a wide variety of
reverse<00:00:41.910> osmosis<00:00:42.359> applications<00:00:43.230> all<00:00:43.530> we're

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
reverse osmosis applications all we're

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.500 
reverse osmosis applications all we're
doing<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.100> feeding<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.550> second<00:00:44.969> membrane<00:00:45.300> off

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
doing is feeding the second membrane off

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
doing is feeding the second membrane off
the<00:00:45.660> waste<00:00:45.899> water<00:00:46.260> from<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.430> TDS

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the waste water from the first the TDS

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.610 
the waste water from the first the TDS
coming<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.359> the<00:00:48.480> second<00:00:48.870> membrane<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.440> be

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
coming from the second membrane will be

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.170 
coming from the second membrane will be
slightly<00:00:49.949> higher<00:00:50.100> once<00:00:50.670> blended<00:00:51.059> together

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
slightly higher once blended together

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.990 
slightly higher once blended together
but<00:00:51.840> still<00:00:51.960> zero<00:00:52.410> after<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> DI<00:00:53.160> stage<00:00:53.670> then

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
but still zero after the DI stage then

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.369 
but still zero after the DI stage then
that<00:00:54.120> quality<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> water<00:00:54.870> doesn't<00:00:55.170> get

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that quality of the water doesn't get

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
that quality of the water doesn't get
impacted<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.760> give<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> an

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
impacted at all just to give you an

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
impacted at all just to give you an
example<00:00:57.329> what's<00:00:57.719> happening<00:00:58.170> here

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
example what's happening here

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
example what's happening here
let's<00:00:58.800> say<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.039> started<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.519> 100<00:00:59.699> TDS<00:01:00.449> water

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
let's say we started with 100 TDS water

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.509 
let's say we started with 100 TDS water
we're<00:01:01.109> running<00:01:01.440> our<00:01:01.559> system<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> four<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
we're running our system on a four to

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.369 
we're running our system on a four to
one<00:01:02.550> waste<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.179> product<00:01:03.510> water<00:01:03.690> ratio<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
one waste of product water ratio with a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.070 
one waste of product water ratio with a
98%<00:01:05.129> rejection<00:01:05.910> which<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.240> pretty<00:01:06.450> common

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
98% rejection which is pretty common

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.660 
98% rejection which is pretty common
the<00:01:07.380> first<00:01:07.650> membrane<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.220> probably

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the first membrane would probably

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.240 
the first membrane would probably
produce<00:01:09.000> around<00:01:09.270> 2<00:01:09.600> TDS<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.740> second<00:01:11.130> one

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
produce around 2 TDS and the second one

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
produce around 2 TDS and the second one
might<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.460> 2<00:01:11.760> point<00:01:12.030> 4<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.870> blended<00:01:13.260> together

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
might be 2 point 4 but blended together

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
might be 2 point 4 but blended together
would<00:01:13.890> average<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> 2<00:01:14.640> point<00:01:14.910> 2<00:01:15.090> which<00:01:15.300> is<00:01:15.480> not

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
would average the 2 point 2 which is not

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
would average the 2 point 2 which is not
something<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> TDS<00:01:16.500> meter<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.920> even<00:01:17.130> read<00:01:17.370> so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
something a TDS meter can even read so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.000 
something a TDS meter can even read so
would<00:01:17.820> likely<00:01:18.090> still<00:01:18.300> say<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.650> impact

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
would likely still say to the impact

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.710 
would likely still say to the impact
will<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.160> more<00:01:20.430> significant<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.300> dirtier

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
will be more significant with dirtier

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
will be more significant with dirtier
water<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.470> don't<00:01:22.650> recommend<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.370> you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
water so we don't recommend it if you

water so we don't recommend it if you
have<00:01:23.490> particularly<00:01:24.360> dirty<00:01:24.540> water<00:01:24.870> like<00:01:25.020> 300

TDS<00:01:26.160> or<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.210> still<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
TDS or more you can still do it but you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810 
TDS or more you can still do it but you
might<00:01:28.290> start<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> consume<00:01:28.890> DI<00:01:29.130> resin<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.700> bit

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
might start to consume DI resin a bit

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.860 
might start to consume DI resin a bit
faster<00:01:30.240> than<00:01:30.270> normal

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
faster than normal

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.630 
faster than normal

do<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.410> grab<00:01:34.620> your<00:01:34.830> membrane<00:01:35.310> locate<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
do is just grab your membrane locate the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
do is just grab your membrane locate the
seal<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.780> make<00:01:37.050> sure<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> outside

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
seal and make sure it's on the outside

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.470 
seal and make sure it's on the outside
screw<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.210> cap<00:01:40.910> then<00:01:41.910> take<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> two

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
screw on your cap then take the two

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.270 
screw on your cap then take the two
clips<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.410> here<00:01:43.710> which<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.100> are

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
clips that we have here which we are

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.220 
clips that we have here which we are
going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.520> use<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.880> attach<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.720> two<00:01:45.870> membranes

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
going to use to attach the two membranes

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.760 
going to use to attach the two membranes
together<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:51.750> remember<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.320> said<00:01:52.590> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
together and now remember I said that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190 
together and now remember I said that
we're<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> feed<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.390> second<00:01:54.780> membrane

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
we're going to feed the second membrane

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
we're going to feed the second membrane
with<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.620> waste<00:01:55.830> water<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.520> I'm<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
with the waste water so I'm going to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.720 
with the waste water so I'm going to
remove<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.540> waste<00:01:57.750> water<00:01:57.990> tube<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.860> now

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
remove the waste water tube here and now

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.340 
remove the waste water tube here and now
I'm<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> take<00:02:00.300> a<00:02:00.330> new<00:02:00.720> piece<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:00.990> tube

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I'm going to take a new piece of tube

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.160 
I'm going to take a new piece of tube
and<00:02:02.040> insert<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.030> into<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.300> waste<00:02:03.510> water<00:02:03.750> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and insert it into the waste water and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.530 
and insert it into the waste water and
feed<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.980> second<00:02:05.400> membrane<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.120> this<00:02:06.330> piece

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
feed the second membrane with this piece

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
feed the second membrane with this piece
of<00:02:06.570> tubing<00:02:07.080> now<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.800> need<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.280> take

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
of tubing now what we need to do is take

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
of tubing now what we need to do is take
the<00:02:08.550> old<00:02:08.729> waste<00:02:09.090> water<00:02:09.390> line<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.989> had<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the old waste water line that had the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.530 
the old waste water line that had the
flow<00:02:10.469> restrictor<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.579> insert<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.359> into

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
flow restrictor on it and insert it into

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.539 
flow restrictor on it and insert it into
the<00:02:12.719> outside<00:02:13.230> fitting<00:02:13.739> which<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.310> waste

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
the outside fitting which is the waste

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.530 
the outside fitting which is the waste
water<00:02:14.760> line

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
water line

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.720 
water line
now<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.110> flow<00:02:16.379> restrictor<00:02:16.920> will<00:02:17.159> serve<00:02:17.400> as

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
now this flow restrictor will serve as

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.569 
now this flow restrictor will serve as
the<00:02:17.760> flow<00:02:18.269> restrictor<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:19.019> both<00:02:19.319> units<00:02:19.769> now

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
the flow restrictor for both units now

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.190 
the flow restrictor for both units now
the<00:02:20.640> only<00:02:20.849> thing<00:02:21.090> left<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.360> do<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.780> connect<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the only thing left to do is connect the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.080 
the only thing left to do is connect the
two<00:02:22.409> product<00:02:22.950> water<00:02:23.129> lines<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:23.760> they<00:02:23.879> blend

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
two product water lines so they blend

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.229 
two product water lines so they blend
together<00:02:24.329> so<00:02:25.140> remove<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.069> original<00:02:26.819> product

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
together so remove the original product

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.180 
together so remove the original product
water<00:02:27.390> line

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.190 

cut<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> couple<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.850> pieces<00:02:31.090> here<00:02:31.330> but<00:02:32.080> we'll

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
cut a couple of pieces here but we'll

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.770 
cut a couple of pieces here but we'll
just<00:02:32.350> connect<00:02:32.650> them<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:32.950> this

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.750 

so<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.440> can<00:02:37.680> see<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.100> we<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.400> both<00:02:38.730> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
so now you can see that we have both of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.600 
so now you can see that we have both of
the<00:02:39.360> product<00:02:39.810> water<00:02:39.960> lines<00:02:40.380> combined<00:02:41.130> here

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the product water lines combined here

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.760 
the product water lines combined here
and<00:02:41.820> blended<00:02:42.360> going<00:02:42.690> into<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.140> auto<00:02:43.320> shutoff

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
and blended going into the auto shutoff

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.310 
and blended going into the auto shutoff
so<00:02:44.520> we'll<00:02:44.640> have<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.970> functionally<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.750> 75

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
so we'll have to functionally in 75

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.930 
so we'll have to functionally in 75
gallon<00:02:46.680> per<00:02:46.800> day<00:02:46.830> membrane<00:02:46.980> which<00:02:47.730> means

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
gallon per day membrane which means

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.360 
gallon per day membrane which means
we'll<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.120> 150<00:02:49.020> gallons<00:02:49.380> per<00:02:49.530> day<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.980> we

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
we'll have 150 gallons per day and we

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.250 
we'll have 150 gallons per day and we
only<00:02:50.550> have<00:02:50.730> one<00:02:51.030> wastewater<00:02:51.660> line<00:02:51.990> which

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
only have one wastewater line which

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.200 
only have one wastewater line which
means<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.620> cut<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.040> wastewater<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.730> half

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
means we cut the wastewater in half

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.120 
means we cut the wastewater in half
one<00:02:54.660> other<00:02:54.780> note<00:02:54.990> on<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.260> kid<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.800> ideal

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
one other note on this kid is this ideal

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.920 
one other note on this kid is this ideal
for<00:02:56.400> people<00:02:56.730> at<00:02:56.850> chloramines<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.570> their<00:02:57.720> water

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
for people at chloramines in their water

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.080 
for people at chloramines in their water
because<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.530> pre-filter<00:02:58.950> chloramine<00:02:59.700> carbon

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
because the pre-filter chloramine carbon

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.850 
because the pre-filter chloramine carbon
blocks<00:03:00.300> are<00:03:00.540> more<00:03:00.750> expensive<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.380> don't<00:03:01.590> last

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860
