Peterson<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.829> probably<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> most

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
Peterson which is probably the most

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.760

now<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.800> grind<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.280> sit<00:03:17.430> there

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
now it's just that grind to sit there

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.040 
now it's just that grind to sit there
and<00:03:17.700> write<00:03:17.850> down<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.209> numbers<00:03:18.540> how<00:03:18.750> much<00:03:18.900> they

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
and write down the numbers how much they

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.680 
and write down the numbers how much they
go<00:03:19.200> for<00:03:19.530> always<00:03:20.010> putting<00:03:20.190> them<00:03:20.370> up<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:21.180> I'll

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
go for always putting them up so I'll

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.840 
go for always putting them up so I'll
probably<00:03:21.870> do<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.459> I'll<00:03:23.459> probably<00:03:23.610> have<00:03:23.820> a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
probably do it and I'll probably have a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.730 
probably do it and I'll probably have a
lot<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.030> money<00:03:24.240> in<00:03:24.390> my<00:03:24.450> next<00:03:24.630> video<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.260> I'm<00:03:25.500> not

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
lot of money in my next video so I'm not

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.390 
lot of money in my next video so I'm not
even<00:03:25.920> really<00:03:26.130> too<00:03:26.340> worried<00:03:26.580> about<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:28.400> one

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
even really too worried about it but one

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.560 
even really too worried about it but one
big<00:03:30.000> thing<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:31.080> almost<00:03:31.320> forgot<00:03:31.680> about<00:03:31.740> is

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
big thing that I almost forgot about is

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
round team so that is pretty sick what

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.180 
round team so that is pretty sick what
they're<00:03:59.820> talking<00:04:00.150> about<00:04:00.240> is<00:04:01.100> for<00:04:02.100> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
wild-card teams or I don't know if it's

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.600 
wild-card teams or I don't know if it's
the<00:04:04.350> full<00:04:04.590> playoff<00:04:04.950> teams<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.280> would<00:04:05.400> assume

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the full playoff teams I would assume

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.600 
the full playoff teams I would assume
just<00:04:05.910> wildcard<00:04:06.390> they<00:04:07.050> will<00:04:07.290> be<00:04:07.440> dropping<00:04:07.709> one

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
just wildcard they will be dropping one

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.479 
just wildcard they will be dropping one
offensive<00:04:09.480> card<00:04:09.870> one<00:04:10.440> defensive<00:04:10.950> card<00:04:11.220> and

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
offensive card one defensive card and

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.840 
offensive card one defensive card and
that<00:04:12.390> equals<00:04:12.840> out<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:12.959> be<00:04:13.260> be<00:04:13.950> sixteen<00:04:14.520> and

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
that equals out to be be sixteen and

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.640 
that equals out to be be sixteen and
it's<00:04:15.030> going<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.270> be<00:04:15.360> pretty<00:04:15.810> sweet<00:04:16.049> because

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
it's going to be pretty sweet because

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.729 
it's going to be pretty sweet because
you're<00:04:17.280> gonna<00:04:17.370> be<00:04:17.580> seeing<00:04:17.820> cards<00:04:18.299> like<00:04:18.739> Arian

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.750 
you're gonna be seeing cards like Arian

Bryan Iraq Poe maybe I don't know

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.560 
Bryan Iraq Poe maybe I don't know
it<00:04:27.160> all<00:04:27.280> depends<00:04:27.670> on<00:04:27.730> what<00:04:27.910> they<00:04:28.000> decide<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.330> do

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
it all depends on what they decide to do

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.200 
it all depends on what they decide to do
with<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.710> hopefully<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.880> cards<00:04:31.120> are

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
with that and hopefully the cards are

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.910 
with that and hopefully the cards are
really<00:04:31.480> good<00:04:31.660> playoff<00:04:31.900> cards<00:04:32.290> last<00:04:32.470> year<00:04:32.770> or

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
really good playoff cards last year or

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.910 
really good playoff cards last year or
pretty<00:04:33.400> sick<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:33.940> must<00:04:34.270> say<00:04:34.510> most<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.620> them<00:04:35.800> were

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
pretty sick I must say most of them were

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.530 
pretty sick I must say most of them were
like<00:04:36.100> ninety<00:04:36.370> nine<00:04:36.520> overall<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.180> really

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
like ninety nine overall and really

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.480 
like ninety nine overall and really
really<00:04:37.810> good<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.230> usable<00:04:38.680> cards<00:04:39.190> so

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
really good and usable cards so

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.040 
really good and usable cards so
hopefully<00:04:40.210> we<00:04:40.330> get<00:04:40.420> some<00:04:40.570> good<00:04:40.840> out<00:04:41.020> of

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
hopefully we get some good out of

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.830 
hopefully we get some good out of
that<00:04:41.220> Ray<00:04:42.220> Lewis<00:04:42.460> might<00:04:42.820> be<00:04:43.000> in<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.450> Ravens

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
that Ray Lewis might be in the Ravens

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.050 
that Ray Lewis might be in the Ravens
card<00:04:44.110> for<00:04:44.500> defense<00:04:44.920> so<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.640> could<00:04:45.820> be<00:04:45.850> his<00:04:46.030> last

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
card for defense so it could be his last

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.880 
card for defense so it could be his last
