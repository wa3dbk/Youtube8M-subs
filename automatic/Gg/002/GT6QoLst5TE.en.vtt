was different because they work out
everybody<00:00:27.529> had<00:00:27.680> to<00:00:27.710> be<00:00:27.919> there<00:00:28.099> but<00:00:28.970> you<00:00:29.720> know

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
everybody had to be there but you know

with either one or two picks a year
changes<00:00:37.579> completely<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.420> way<00:00:38.450> these<00:00:39.350> people

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
changes completely the way these people

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.240 
changes completely the way these people
put<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.340> races<00:00:40.670> together<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.570> in<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.809> 80s<00:00:42.250> we

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
put the races together so in the 80s we

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.280 
put the races together so in the 80s we
say<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.579> races<00:00:43.910> were<00:00:44.090> most<00:00:44.570> of<00:00:44.780> your<00:00:44.899> training

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
say the races were most of your training

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.350 
say the races were most of your training
you<00:00:45.649> just<00:00:45.890> have<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.070> be<00:00:46.370> fit<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.640> start<00:00:47.120> then

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
you just have to be fit to start then

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.849 
you just have to be fit to start then
the<00:00:47.480> reason<00:00:47.780> we're<00:00:47.989> bringing<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:48.410> up<00:00:48.620> here

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
the reason we're bringing you up here

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.000 
the reason we're bringing you up here
now<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.820> opposite<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.870> build<00:00:51.199> as<00:00:51.440> strong

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
now is the opposite you build as strong

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.389 
now is the opposite you build as strong
as<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:52.339> can<00:00:52.609> before<00:00:53.679> tailoring<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:54.980> training

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
as you can before tailoring the training

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.579 
as you can before tailoring the training
on<00:00:55.550> your<00:00:55.760> characteristic<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.749> you'll<00:00:57.379> now

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
on your characteristic and you'll now

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.590 
on your characteristic and you'll now
training<00:00:57.949> is<00:00:58.159> not<00:00:58.399> just<00:00:58.670> what<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.059> doona<00:00:59.449> by

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
training is not just what you doona by

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.930 
training is not just what you doona by
training<00:01:00.379> now<00:01:00.620> is<00:01:00.800> what<00:01:01.039> you<00:01:01.219> do<00:01:01.339> after<00:01:01.519> by<00:01:01.879> two

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
training now is what you do after by two

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.329 
training now is what you do after by two
so<00:01:02.510> you<00:01:02.569> know<00:01:02.870> we<00:01:03.050> know<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.379> trading<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.070> same

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
so you know we know the trading the same

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.590 
so you know we know the trading the same
kind<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.640> training<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.089> same<00:01:05.300> schedule

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
kind of training the same schedule

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.950 
kind of training the same schedule
training<00:01:06.110> does<00:01:06.830> not<00:01:07.190> regulate<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.210> gene<00:01:08.810> in

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
training does not regulate the gene in

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.590 
training does not regulate the gene in
the<00:01:09.080> same<00:01:09.290> way<00:01:09.470> with<00:01:10.190> two<00:01:10.250> different<00:01:10.580> guys<00:01:10.909> so

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
the same way with two different guys so

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.810 
the same way with two different guys so
this<00:01:11.810> training<00:01:12.229> was<00:01:12.409> with<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:12.800> diet<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:13.670> know

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
this training was with this diet we know

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.310 
this training was with this diet we know
that<00:01:13.850> they<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.450> signal<00:01:14.900> in<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.140> biological

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
that they the signal in the biological

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.790 
that they the signal in the biological
signaling<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> multi-level<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:18.590> know

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
signaling it is a multi-level you know

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.060 
signaling it is a multi-level you know
the<00:01:19.340> brain<00:01:20.030> could<00:01:20.719> be<00:01:20.869> to<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.170> hormones

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
the brain could be to the hormones

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.620 
the brain could be to the hormones
heartlands<00:01:23.030> muscle<00:01:23.590> genes<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.700> interaction

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
heartlands muscle genes the interaction

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.039 
heartlands muscle genes the interaction
between<00:01:26.770> diet<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.950> training<00:01:28.750> we<00:01:29.750> didn't<00:01:29.990> even

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
between diet and training we didn't even

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.139 
between diet and training we didn't even
think<00:01:30.229> about<00:01:30.530> at<00:01:31.399> that<00:01:31.460> kind<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.939> only

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
think about at that kind the only

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.639 
think about at that kind the only
problem<00:01:32.479> where<00:01:32.630> would<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:32.990> be<00:01:33.200> sure<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.500> they

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
problem where would I be sure that they

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.100 
problem where would I be sure that they
were<00:01:33.770> started<00:01:34.130> racing<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.700> right<00:01:34.880> way<00:01:35.119> so

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
were started racing in the right way so

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.810 
were started racing in the right way so
we<00:01:36.289> had<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:36.560> rule<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.189> three<00:01:37.369> percent

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
we had this rule of the three percent

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.539 
we had this rule of the three percent
you<00:01:38.060> stop<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:38.570> season<00:01:39.100> whatever<00:01:40.100> weight<00:01:40.369> you

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
you stop this season whatever weight you

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.459 
you stop this season whatever weight you
have<00:01:40.610> at<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.969> end<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.329> season<00:01:41.479> sparty

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
have at the end of the season sparty

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.340 
have at the end of the season sparty
didn't<00:01:42.710> have<00:01:42.799> an<00:01:42.890> injury<00:01:43.219> that<00:01:43.869> plus<00:01:44.869> three<00:01:45.170> to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
didn't have an injury that plus three to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.130 
didn't have an injury that plus three to
five<00:01:45.530> percent<00:01:45.950> gain<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:46.789> large<00:01:47.090> winter<00:01:47.420> you

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
five percent gain is a large winter you

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.020 
five percent gain is a large winter you
need<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.469> restart<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.859> season<00:01:49.310> below<00:01:49.820> three

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
need to restart the season below three

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.899 
need to restart the season below three
percent<00:01:50.560> there<00:01:51.560> was<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.799> simple<00:01:52.399> as<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:52.579> means

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
percent there was a simple as a means

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.209 
percent there was a simple as a means
for<00:01:52.969> a<00:01:53.090> 70<00:01:53.600> kilo<00:01:53.899> guy<00:01:54.079> you<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.469> get<00:01:54.619> into<00:01:54.740> 25

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
for a 70 kilo guy you can get into 25

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.069 
for a 70 kilo guy you can get into 25
kilos<00:01:55.579> make<00:01:56.299> sure<00:01:56.329> that<00:01:56.600> when<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.840> stir<00:01:57.049> a

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
kilos make sure that when you stir a

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.840 
kilos make sure that when you stir a
scene<00:01:57.380> you're<00:01:57.770> more<00:01:58.039> two<00:01:58.399> kilos<00:01:58.759> overweight

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
scene you're more two kilos overweight

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.490 
scene you're more two kilos overweight
and<00:01:59.390> then<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.590> buy<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.859> giro<00:02:01.340> you'll<00:02:01.549> be<00:02:01.729> fine

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
and then you buy the giro you'll be fine

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.289 
and then you buy the giro you'll be fine
that<00:02:03.500> was<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.799> year<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:04.250> we<00:02:04.880> don't<00:02:05.149> even

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
that was the year now and we don't even

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.139 
that was the year now and we don't even
look<00:02:05.659> at<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.109> at<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.549> number<00:02:07.549> than<00:02:07.729> mice<00:02:07.909> now

first of all it does you were looking at

way because you know we need to know the
way<00:02:39.250> for<00:02:39.700> example<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.270> spec<00:02:40.510> stage<00:02:40.900> races<00:02:41.170> to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
way for example for spec stage races to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.770 
way for example for spec stage races to
monitor<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.340> fluctuation<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.090> weight<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.570> day

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
monitor the fluctuation of weight on day

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.500 
monitor the fluctuation of weight on day
by<00:02:43.960> day<00:02:44.020> for<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.220> know<00:02:45.310> dehydration<00:02:46.120> versus

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
by day for you know dehydration versus

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.290 
by day for you know dehydration versus
glycogen<00:02:46.900> depletion<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:48.520> now<00:02:48.670> what<00:02:48.880> we<00:02:49.090> look

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
glycogen depletion so now what we look

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.390 
glycogen depletion so now what we look
at<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.600> way<00:02:49.750> they<00:02:49.960> say<00:02:50.230> now<00:02:50.410> last<00:02:50.770> year<00:02:51.040> look

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
at the way they say now last year look

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.430 
at the way they say now last year look
like<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.730> know<00:02:52.390> be<00:02:52.570> able<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.930> data<00:02:53.110> from<00:02:53.350> the

like you know be able the data from the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.990 
like you know be able the data from the

it's<00:03:01.210> like<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.540> know<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.230> best<00:03:02.470> six

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
it's like you know that the best six

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.160 
it's like you know that the best six
weeks<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.280> last<00:03:03.550> year<00:03:03.790> only<00:03:04.090> for<00:03:04.510> your<00:03:04.690> weight

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
weeks of last year only for your weight

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.510 
weeks of last year only for your weight
was<00:03:05.440> between<00:03:05.680> 71<00:03:06.430> 72.3<00:03:07.390> kiosk<00:03:08.200> when<00:03:09.010> you're<00:03:09.160> 20

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
was between 71 72.3 kiosk when you're 20

was between 71 72.3 kiosk when you're 20
minutes<00:03:09.550> power<00:03:10.030> or<00:03:10.480> your<00:03:10.690> five<00:03:10.870> minutes<00:03:11.140> power

minutes power or your five minutes power

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.160 
minutes power or your five minutes power
are<00:03:11.770> in<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.070> proportion<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.630> we<00:03:13.870> know

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
are in this proportion and so we know

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.050 
are in this proportion and so we know
what<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> model<00:03:14.830> when<00:03:15.370> these<00:03:15.580> after<00:03:15.970> is

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
what the model when these after is

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.000 
what the model when these after is
performed<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.630> with<00:03:16.810> Taylor<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.500> training<00:03:17.830> to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
performed so with Taylor the training to

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.400 
performed so with Taylor the training to
that<00:03:18.190> point<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:19.450> first<00:03:19.750> year<00:03:19.930> when<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.200> don't

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
that point the first year when you don't

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.170 
that point the first year when you don't
have<00:03:20.530> previous<00:03:21.130> data<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.730> little<00:03:22.060> more

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
have previous data is a little more

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.240 
have previous data is a little more
challenge<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.720> use<00:03:22.900> experience<00:03:23.470> by<00:03:23.980> talk

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250

two riders and actually pro riders are

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.800 
two riders and actually pro riders are
the<00:03:27.520> easiest<00:03:27.910> because<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.600> lot<00:03:28.780> of

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
the easiest because you have a lot of

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.320 
the easiest because you have a lot of

three<00:04:10.540> weeks<00:04:10.720> before<00:04:10.840> 20<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:12.250> let's<00:04:12.459> start<00:04:12.640> ft

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
three weeks before 20 so let's start ft

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.640 
three weeks before 20 so let's start ft
long<00:04:13.180> month<00:04:13.420> later<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:13.900> have<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.410> peak

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
long month later so you have that peak

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.140 
long month later so you have that peak
at<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.920> beginning<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.400> year<00:04:15.550> forget<00:04:15.970> even
