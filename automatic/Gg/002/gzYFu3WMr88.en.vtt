the molecular and cellular biology
department<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.480> last<00:00:15.660> 10<00:00:15.990> years<00:00:16.340> 11<00:00:17.340> years

department the last 10 years 11 years
now<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:18.029> first<00:00:18.840> came<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.830> University<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.900> had

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
now I first came to the University I had

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.810 
now I first came to the University I had
to<00:00:22.230> include<00:00:22.470> undergraduates<00:00:23.010> which<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.550> wasn't

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
to include undergraduates which I wasn't

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.160 
to include undergraduates which I wasn't
getting<00:00:23.880> graduate<00:00:24.330> students<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:24.720> postdocs

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
getting graduate students for postdocs

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.000 
getting graduate students for postdocs
so<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.130> wasn't<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> necessity<00:00:26.820> more<00:00:27.599> than<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
so it wasn't a necessity more than a

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.320 
so it wasn't a necessity more than a
something<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.070> wanted<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.550> when<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.090> first

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
something I wanted to do when I first

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.030 
something I wanted to do when I first
started<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.810> wanted<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.470> postdocs<00:00:31.949> and

started I wanted to have postdocs and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.229 
started I wanted to have postdocs and
grad<00:00:32.250> students<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.969> normal

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
grad students this is a normal

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
grad students this is a normal
progression<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> university<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
progression in the university like this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.639 
progression in the university like this
as<00:00:35.640> time<00:00:36.090> went<00:00:36.120> by<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.480> realized<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.230> loved<00:00:37.530> it

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the way I've got my lab is other

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.900 
the way I've got my lab is other
students<00:03:18.359> help<00:03:18.750> each<00:03:18.900> other<00:03:19.609> so<00:03:20.609> there's<00:03:20.850> a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
students help each other so there's a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.460 
students help each other so there's a
communal<00:03:21.390> feel<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.840> we're<00:03:22.019> all<00:03:22.170> going<00:03:22.410> to

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
communal feel that we're all going to

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
very satisfying to faculty if they are

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.940 
very satisfying to faculty if they are
open<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:32.519> very<00:03:32.640> satisfying<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.209> me<00:03:33.239> I
