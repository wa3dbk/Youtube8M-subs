 is to wear nice clothes then always 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.629

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.000
 fitness things while I change today 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.530
 I'm looking at blog and latex that is a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.270
 of the traditional youtube is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.399
 obsessed with those little books that are 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.989
 colors buy them choice and I also 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.519
 they make them up like this on the wrist and you see 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.750
 super cute like all meals 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.700
 of colors rainbow type 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.350
 I am super simple to make myself 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.180
 hairstyles for the gym and I do not 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.800
 complicated for nothing I just do 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.690
 a tall pigtail and that 's it 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.220
 If I get inspired, I make a braid or something 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.200
 well but it's almost always an angry 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.420
 another way that I find to motivate me 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.430
 instagram I say food accounts for 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.110
 outfits exercises of people who 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.000
 they have such super-cool bodies 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.470
 they dispatch fitness so I never get bored 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.570

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.610
 I can be super creative with my meals 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.229
 and my exercises 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.180
 another super important point if you want 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.250
 start taking care of your body is that you take 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.259

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.090
 the skin you wear everything beautiful and also 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.770
 You can carry healthy food with you 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.880
 for when you leave home you are in the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.710
 university or at your job 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.360
 I do not really do much for 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.940

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.360
 exercise 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.310
 I like to start by stretching my legs 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.350
 to avoid cramping and warm up a little 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.210
 and talking about heating I also like 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.690
 jog in place to raise the pace 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.690
