00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
look very closely at this tool pass when

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.399 
look very closely at this tool pass when
we<00:01:01.850> did<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.120> lead<00:01:02.300> ins<00:01:02.479> and<00:01:02.690> lead<00:01:02.809> at<00:01:02.960> you'll

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
we did the lead ins and lead at you'll

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.259 
we did the lead ins and lead at you'll
see<00:01:03.620> that<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.949> tools<00:01:04.190> actually<00:01:04.729> came<00:01:04.970> in<00:01:05.000> at

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
see that the tools actually came in at

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.990 
see that the tools actually came in at
an<00:01:05.330> angle<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:06.070> left<00:01:07.070> at<00:01:07.250> an<00:01:07.370> angle<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:07.820> did

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
an angle and left at an angle we did

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.819 
an angle and left at an angle we did
that<00:01:08.150> on<00:01:08.299> purpose<00:01:08.329> that's<00:01:08.960> not<00:01:09.140> that's<00:01:09.380> not<00:01:09.560> by

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
accident by coming into the slob angle

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.499 
accident by coming into the slob angle
it<00:01:12.829> keeps<00:01:13.189> it<00:01:13.399> from<00:01:13.549> chipping<00:01:13.939> that<00:01:14.090> melamine

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
it keeps it from chipping that melamine

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.300 
it keeps it from chipping that melamine
if<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.869> look<00:01:15.079> at<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.290> edge<00:01:15.439> finishes<00:01:16.040> all<00:01:16.189> the

are<00:01:42.950> cut<00:01:43.159> for<00:01:43.369> clearance<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.560> that

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
are cut for clearance so that that

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.999 
are cut for clearance so that that
process<00:01:46.430> gives<00:01:47.000> us<00:01:47.179> positive<00:01:47.420> stops<00:01:48.049> for<00:01:48.799> this

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
process gives us positive stops for this

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.130 
process gives us positive stops for this
edge<00:01:49.250> this<00:01:49.549> edge<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.090> edge<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:50.990> when

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
edge this edge and this edge so when

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.630 
edge this edge and this edge so when
they<00:01:51.259> fit<00:01:51.469> together<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.920> part<00:01:52.219> really<00:01:52.490> only

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
they fit together a part really only

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.700 
they fit together a part really only
fits<00:01:52.939> one<00:01:53.030> way<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.170> that's<00:01:54.289> called<00:01:54.619> a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
fits one way that so that's called a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.160 
fits one way that so that's called a
qualified<00:01:55.250> pin<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:55.729> blind<00:01:56.000> 80<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.630> that's

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
qualified pin and blind 80 and that's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.929 
qualified pin and blind 80 and that's
become<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.560> very<00:01:57.829> very<00:01:57.890> popular<00:01:58.250> joint<00:01:58.759> in

for<00:02:41.560> myself<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.690> was<00:02:43.690> surprised<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.590> was<00:02:44.739> a

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
for myself and I was surprised it was a

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.890 
for myself and I was surprised it was a
lot<00:02:45.040> easier<00:02:45.069> i'm<00:02:45.640> not<00:02:45.910> really<00:02:46.239> from<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
lot easier i'm not really from the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.520 
lot easier i'm not really from the
computer<00:02:47.409> age<00:02:47.440> i'm<00:02:47.920> too<00:02:48.640> old<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.290> have

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
computer age i'm too old but you have

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.650 
computer age i'm too old but you have
been<00:02:50.739> doing<00:02:50.890> this<00:02:51.190> for<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.549> long<00:02:51.819> time<00:02:51.879> and<00:02:52.540> you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
been doing this for a long time and you

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.490 
been doing this for a long time and you
have<00:02:52.900> made<00:02:53.110> all<00:02:53.410> kinds<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.760> customers<00:02:55.500> watch

very<00:03:10.690> difficult<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.379> teach<00:03:11.620> yourself<00:03:11.769> this

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
very difficult to teach yourself this

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.680 
very difficult to teach yourself this
stuff<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.579> can<00:03:12.790> do<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.269> takes<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.540> lot

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
stuff you can do it but it takes a lot

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.660 
stuff you can do it but it takes a lot
of<00:03:13.720> time<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.590> what<00:03:14.829> we<00:03:15.010> do<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:15.459> whole

the machine the software training
they're<00:03:21.220> making<00:03:21.549> parts<00:03:21.879> before<00:03:22.359> we<00:03:22.630> leave<00:03:22.840> so

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
they're making parts before we leave so

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.640 
they're making parts before we leave so
that<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.519> learning<00:03:24.910> curve<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.660> what<00:03:26.470> you

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
that the learning curve is the what you

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.490 
that the learning curve is the what you
find<00:03:26.889> normally<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.609> once<00:03:27.940> people<00:03:28.380> master<00:03:29.380> this

computer and taking it out to the

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.700 
computer and taking it out to the
Machine<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.770> calling<00:04:42.220> from<00:04:42.370> there<00:04:42.580> right<00:04:43.000> and

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
Machine and calling from there right and

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.800 
Machine and calling from there right and
we<00:04:44.710> can<00:04:44.889> do<00:04:45.009> both<00:04:45.190> rock<00:04:45.849> that<00:04:46.120> that's<00:04:46.629> the
