moved<00:01:50.430> around<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.790> bit<00:01:50.820> though<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.420> seem<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> get

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
moved around a bit though I seem to get

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.770 
moved around a bit though I seem to get
a<00:01:52.259> lot<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.440> traffic<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.300> i'm<00:01:54.300> not<00:01:54.509> i

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
a lot of traffic there but i'm not i

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.290 
a lot of traffic there but i'm not i
don't<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:56.570> live<00:01:57.570> com<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.050> be<00:01:58.170> too<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.800> I

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
don't think the live com to be too if I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.700 
don't think the live com to be too if I
just<00:02:00.300> can't<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.020> butt<00:02:01.229> off<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.420> don't<00:02:03.420> know

that'll<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> good<00:02:06.420> good<00:02:07.170> way<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.410> do<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:10.310> so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that'll be a good good way to do it so

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.830 
that'll be a good good way to do it so
