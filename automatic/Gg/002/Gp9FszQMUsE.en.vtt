00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.300
 hi my little team we end up 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.340
 in this video to talk about the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.340
 vision for those who have seen the last 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.839
 trailer of avengers age of ultron 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.570
 really all in the end we see something 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.390
 open your eyes and well this thing is the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.189
 vision the only catch for me is that I 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.990
 do not know yet how they are going 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.490
 adapt it in the movie but I can 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.560
 still tell you his true 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.760
 origins in the comics the first 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 vision was created by the talented 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.340
 joe simon and kirby jack in 1940 he gets 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.500
 named Arcus who was guardian of the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.620
 peace and came from a named dimension 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.969
 smoke world but all that we do not care 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 which interests us is the vision of 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.250
 at marvel comics was published in october 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.649
 1968 in the famous Avengers number 57 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.899
 it is created to reinterpret if you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.780
 prefer in comics thanks to eric 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.789
 thomas and john kucera at the cinema this will be 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
 paul bettany who will embody the role of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.859
 vision but he also did the voice 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.879
 jarvis since iron man and there is strong 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.460
 to bet that this intelligence 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.340
 artificial computer end up 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.960
 by becoming our robot the vision to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.540
 the origin in comics vision is a 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.920
 santoso id in other words an android done 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 synthetic human organs 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 it was created by the ultra robot 5 in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 the goal of destroying the avengers his 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.710
 body was created from a copy of the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.020
 body of the first human torch 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.430
 jim fines that appeared for the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 first time in the marvel comics 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.770
 number one in 1939 and that therefore has nothing to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 see with the torch of 4 fantastic 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.750
 which appeared in 1961 the one of which I 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.880
 talk is an android that catches fire at 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.560
 air contact what was not the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.439
 basic project of its creator the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.780
 professor horton ultre we kidnapped this 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.610
 scientist by compelling him to build 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.979
 the vision on the basis of his first 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.049
 creation and schedule it for them 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.600
 think autonomously with the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.700
 brain diagram of wonder man who 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.409
 seemed to be dead at that time from 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.570
 people stay dead for a very long time 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.570
 in marvel besides among the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.729
 cars plus its main power is to 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.530
 manipulate its own density in the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.539
 diminishing it can cross any 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.830
 what solid material and uses it for 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.319
 get into the heads of his opponents 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.930
 and by increasing it it can 2 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.249
 yesterday even stronger than she to frost 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.079
 100 francs is also out of the dunes 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.719
 stone soler that allows him to absorb 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.389
 and release the solar energy which 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.099
 allows him to self-feed the vision 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.780
 was born and he tron hastens to ride 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.400
 a diabolical plan against the avengers 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.939
 to destroy them with the help of his 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.099
 creation 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.049
 but the new android feels 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.510
 human emotions through the scheme 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.790
 brain of the hero gone there the simone 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.919
 williams he does not hesitate to rebel 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.419
 against its creator as ultra had it 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.599
 previously done against his the 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:47.639
 doctor hank pym small parenthesis ultre 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.099
 we were created by mpeg alias 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.620
 Antoine created in comics in 1962 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.260
 in the next movie avengers it will be 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.419
 created by tony stark aka iron man and the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.540
 missing man movie that will be released in August 2015 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.519
 will not be focused on hank pym same 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.909
 if he's in the movie but scott 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.500
 languages 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:09.030
 the other antoine rey him in 1979 and I do not 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.430
 do not think we 'll hear about ultra 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.469
 but we will have two men 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.599
 ants in return sees the 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.560
 closed parenthesis after rebelling 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599
 against its creator 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.669
 the vision integrates the team of avengers 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.799
 his human feelings appeared at 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.620
 over time until falling in love with 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.509
 Wendat Maximov aka Red Witch 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.669
 they are trying to find out if these feelings 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:32.310
 come from him or schemas 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.769
 mental of wonder-man until 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.239
 jarvis the butler succeed to the 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.859
 convince him that he was as human 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.479
 than another and that there was no 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.009
 reason for that does not work 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.989
 too disgusting 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:45.000
 during a war between shouting and 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.699
 skrulls the vision is put out of order 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.979
 and hank pym does not hesitate to shrink to 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.659
 the size of an ant to get into 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.000
 its internal systems to fix it 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.199
 that's when he discovers that the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.120
 vision systems are good 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.370
 prior to the date of its first 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.079
 appearance in the hands of the trunk 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.299
 which greatly affects the android on its 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.979
 origins but that does not prevent it from 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.959
 save her beloved from the clutches of 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.189
 Skrulls 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.329
 he feels better in his sneakers of 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.609
 robots when they get married to the 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.799
 red witch but the reappearance of 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.759
 wonder man from the dead will leave 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.400
 hover a doubt about his real 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:19.019
 feeling because the risen ayrault has 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.440
 also feelings for the mutant 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.120
 aaa but after a while they get 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.420
 are more considered brothers 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.330
 with each 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.770
 an individuality to himself the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.780
 two lovebirds will have two beautiful 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.400
 children created in the spirit of his crazy 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.510
 crazy women that I already explained 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.060
 in the chronicle about the red witch 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.130
 and they'll move into new jersey to 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.410
 cause of an anti-mutant manifestation that hurts 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.270
 shot to finally join the team 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.830
 avengers from the west coast 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.080
 the vision also helped the avengers 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.600
 to fight friends they had and he was 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.090
 seriously injured star fox tried to 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.890
 heal by connecting it to isaac a 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.920
 huge central computer that controls 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.350
 the saturune moon named titan he arched 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.420
 to tap into a control crystal 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.920
 leave in the vision by hull tron and 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.100
 used it to change the way 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.350
 to think of the android when it was 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.000
 elected leader of the avengers he decided 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.770
 to create a new golden age in 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.140
 taking control of all 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.480
 computers of the world but the others 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.160
 members of his team managed to 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.280
 convince to abandon his project 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.480
 ambitious think we could no longer 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.190
 have confidence in him 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.980
 the government then kidnapped the 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.360
 vision and the assemblies of course he 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.610
 was rescued by the avengers of the 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.450
 west coast and rebuilt by the ping dr 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.160
 and the black panther 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.620
 but he had lost all trace 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.260
 emotionally and could no longer make his 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.700
 love to the red witch or their 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.100
 marriage finally ended 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.380
 divorce without android rope was then 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.210
 destroyed when wanda went crazy and 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.430
 to exterminate the team that formed the 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.620
 avengers a version of the vision was 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.870
 recently reactivated when his program 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.390
 to integrate the neuro-kinetic armor of the 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.950
 young avengers iron ladd indeed 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.350
 parts of his body had been kept 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.880
 by iron man and it seems like the vision 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.370
 had planned a backup program 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.840
 in case of glitch i hope this 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.250
 chronicle will have you a little enlightened on 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.230
 the robotic character who is the 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.550
 vision because I do not know yet what 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.780
 that they will do in the next 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.120
 adaptation of adventures 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.080
 but this film promises in any case 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.699
 to be damn strong 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.110
 but we're not there yet by then 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.389
 read a lot of stories about the Avengers 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.590
 good reading and see you next for a 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.590
 new chronicle and
