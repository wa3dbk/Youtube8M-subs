00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.190 
in heels so I just wore these flats that
I<00:02:19.130> honestly<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:20.240> this<00:02:20.510> would<00:02:20.690> look<00:02:20.720> cuter

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.140 
I honestly think this would look cuter
with<00:02:21.380> some<00:02:21.650> heels<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.280> let<00:02:22.490> me<00:02:22.580> just<00:02:22.820> fit<00:02:23.000> on

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
what it would look like okay so here are

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.760 
what it would look like okay so here are
some<00:02:27.590> options<00:02:28.580> um<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.570> think<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.560> would<00:02:30.680> have

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.640 
some options um I think I would have
gone<00:02:30.920> with<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.820> sandals<00:02:32.390> instead<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:33.700> booty

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
gone with the sandals instead the booty

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.360 
gone with the sandals instead the booty
