00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.539
 the energy in the form of heat from the sun is the machine that controls our climate 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 the heat not only brings us warm weather 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.969
 it also brings tornadoes 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 snowfall 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.329
 it sounds impossible 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.800
 just think of the sun 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 releases electromagnetic energy in all directions 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.340
 emits heat waves that travel through space 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
 and they come to the surface of the earth 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.910
 the earth absorbs the sun's energy and converts it into heat 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.520
 as the earth is tilted the sunlight does not arrive with the same intensity 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 everywhere at any given moment some places on earth get hotter 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 What others 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.950
 these differences are what make up the climate 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.860
 when warming the surface of the earth the air that is in China is heated 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.840
 as in these women 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.470
 the air becomes lighter and less dense 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.860
 so it rises 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 and fresh air takes its place 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.420
 this movement of heat through the air is called conviction 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.400
 areas of high and low pressure produced by our customers are produced 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080
 including tornadoes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.350
 we can imagine the atmosphere as 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.890
 having been constant 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.890
 full of swirling currents and winds 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.799
 together with the water the air helps to distribute the heat throughout the planet 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.159
 Water is also a key factor in the formation of climate 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.499
 because they retain leads the heat energy of the sun 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.250
 the oceans keep the heat and bring the cold and hot water around the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.889
 world 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.699
 the different temperatures between land and sea affect the local climate 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.249
 When observing a puddle we can better understand how water carries the heat 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.750
 when the sun heats the puddle the water evaporates that takes away the energy 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.749
 calorific 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.870
 the water has become the steam that adds moisture to the ain 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.799
 uu the steam rises until it cools and condensed forming the 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.279
 clouds that bring us rain and snow and wind 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:54.879
 the heat energy that has been stored is released and sometimes 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.879
 produces a thunderstorm 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.189
 the energy released during a thunderstorm is overwhelming 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.619
 would be enough to meet the energy needs of the day 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.799
 giorgi for two months and we could control it and 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.199
 there is the saying 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.379
 If you do not like the weather I wait a minute and it will change 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.889
 thanks to the heat of the sun this is definitely the case
