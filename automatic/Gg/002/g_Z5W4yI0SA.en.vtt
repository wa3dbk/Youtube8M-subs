00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.939 
questions of a gas to the battery life
or<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> think<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> screen<00:00:30.779> technology<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.529> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
or I think the screen technology is it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.760 
or I think the screen technology is it
fast<00:00:32.250> does<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.640> overheat<00:00:33.140> etc<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.620> going

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
fast does it overheat etc and then going

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.139 
fast does it overheat etc and then going
to<00:00:34.920> put<00:00:35.070> them<00:00:35.160> into<00:00:35.250> individual<00:00:35.820> videos

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to put them into individual videos

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.060 
to put them into individual videos
because<00:00:36.450> people<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> know<00:00:37.320> individual
