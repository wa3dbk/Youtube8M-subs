00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.380
 5500 rondo cappuccino one 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.580
 coffee machines short the technical 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.059
 data that greta 1350 watt power 15 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.059
 score pressure and 17 liters in front 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:41.000
 Water tank the size of the device 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:43.850
 is 44 x 28 x 38 cm and the weight 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.780
 is eleven kilograms in the upper range 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 is a container for coffee beans 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.700
 next to it a container for normal 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.950
 coffee powder also this feature is 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.000
 happy and then here on the left 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.870
 side a plate to warm the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.820
 buttons in the front we have the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.830
 I'm getting closer to that 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.050
 will go in if we get that 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.130
 have turned on 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.709
 down here is a flap in the device 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.849
 is the collection container for 

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:21.950
 The coffee guests then whisper here 

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:27.619
 cone times work easily with one 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.599
 take a hand and here is the under 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:35.149
 collection container for rest liquid 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:41.030
 I stop the machine now and 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.989
 then we go to the button just like that 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.759
 I have the machine now 

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:45.979
 it takes some time to turn it on 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.770
 seconds since she has to warm up and 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:56.119
 also the lines with a warm 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:58.009
 water jet once through leaves on 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.140
 and bough is up here on the left 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.700
 including a program button for 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.410
 different functions like for example 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.080
 the descale program 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.170
 and then we have this once 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.680
 game program for the line up here 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.489
 the removal for a cup of coffee 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.730
 including two coffee cups and here 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.599
 located below 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.310
 The hot water buttons function over it 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.599
 Then, for example, for tea water 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.890
 are taken here underneath the 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:33.540
 automatic cappuccino button the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.610
 pre-programmed cappuccino brings in 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.799
 the middle of this ring ultimately in the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.390
 Press center 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.980
 this allows the aroma to be adjusted 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.870
 of very strong aroma over the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.069
 buffering very mild aroma and 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.110
 then slight gradations 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.870
 when i turn this button i have 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.379
 different keys strengthen quantities 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.709
 here a programmable amount then 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:12.180
 I have a medium espresso here 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:14.700
 Taste up to a very big cup yes 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.040
 as you would say we just let 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.769
 run an espresso and look 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:26.760
 We turn the cream on for me 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:27.870
 Now on espresso, start the one 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.940
 Machine is probably listening now 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.590
 louder than she really is 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.590
 I am very satisfied with that 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:47.299
 the test magazine has this machine in the 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:49.980
 year 2003 2010, each with a good rating 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.540
 I myself have this machine for three 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.930
 years in use and I am very happy with it 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.930
 satisfied 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.440
 I hope you can see that for a while 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.880
 a nice chandler where also the sugar 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.049
 a bit stuck that is yes 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.049
 actually always important for espresso 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.200
 yes as I said I have this machine 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.890
 for three years in use 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.810
 there were never any defects de'longhi gives up 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.480
 This machine is warranty for three years 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.120
 you register them and I can 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.230
 just say price 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.430
 top performance what else 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.810
 did not mention this milk can 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.520
 Of course, these are different for now 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.450
 the different coffee variations 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.919
 connect here and through this nozzle the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.870
 I'm going to milk in one 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.550
 another video on it again 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.490
 Thank you very much
