over<00:00:27.510> walls<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.140> things<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
over walls and things like that so the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
over walls and things like that so the
first<00:00:29.189> step<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.060> need<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> pick<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
first step is we need to pick out the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.179 
first step is we need to pick out the
kind<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> hardware<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.560> want<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> reproduce

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
kind of hardware we want to reproduce

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
kind of hardware we want to reproduce
and<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> use<00:00:33.600> some<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and here we're going to use some of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.900 
and here we're going to use some of
these<00:00:33.930> self<00:00:34.559> tapping<00:00:34.800> sheet<00:00:35.309> metal<00:00:35.579> screws

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
these self tapping sheet metal screws

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.080 
these self tapping sheet metal screws
here<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.989> built<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> foam<00:00:38.040> core<00:00:38.309> box<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
here and we built a foam core box and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
here and we built a foam core box and
those<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.079> followed<00:00:40.290> our<00:00:40.559> videos

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
those of you have followed our videos

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
those of you have followed our videos
have<00:00:41.250> seen<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.640> technique<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> lot<00:00:42.300> before<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
have seen this technique a lot before so

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.779 
have seen this technique a lot before so
we're<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> cover<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.100> depth

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
we're not going to cover that in depth

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.850 
we're not going to cover that in depth
here<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:45.930> information<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.500> check<00:00:46.770> out

some of our other videos on mold making

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
some of our other videos on mold making
but<00:00:49.140> we've<00:00:49.289> hot<00:00:49.530> glue<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.250> foam<00:00:50.700> core

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
but we've hot glue that little foam core

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.970 
but we've hot glue that little foam core
box<00:00:51.270> together<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.320> we're<00:00:52.500> pressing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
box together and now we're pressing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.250 
box together and now we're pressing
those<00:00:53.129> screws<00:00:53.640> through<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.300> foam<00:00:54.600> core<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
those screws through that foam core and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.340 
those screws through that foam core and
all<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> way<00:00:56.399> through<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:56.879> there's<00:00:57.780> all<00:00:58.140> our

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
all the way through now there's all our

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
all the way through now there's all our
screws<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.129> now<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.430> need<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.820> seal<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
screws and now we need to seal the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.439 
screws and now we need to seal the
bottom<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.109> those<00:01:01.260> screws<00:01:02.059> now<00:01:03.059> when<00:01:03.300> we're

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
bottom of those screws now when we're

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.830 
bottom of those screws now when we're
creating<00:01:03.619> rusted<00:01:04.619> props<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.600> effects<00:01:06.600> on

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
creating rusted props and effects on

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.350 
creating rusted props and effects on
walls<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:08.070> need<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> screw<00:01:08.820> head<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
walls we just need the screw head or a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
walls we just need the screw head or a
bolt<00:01:09.689> head<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.320> create<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> effect<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.610> by

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
bolt head to create the effect so by

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
bolt head to create the effect so by
pushing<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.540> screw<00:01:12.900> through<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> foam<00:01:13.590> core

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
pushing the screw through the foam core

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240 
pushing the screw through the foam core
it<00:01:14.250> leaves<00:01:14.549> us<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.540> exposed<00:01:16.250> screw

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it leaves us with just an exposed screw

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.820 
it leaves us with just an exposed screw
head<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.759> bolt<00:01:18.000> head<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.049> other<00:01:19.200> side<00:01:19.530> that

head or bolt head on the other side that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
head or bolt head on the other side that
will<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.130> capturing<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.850> our<00:01:21.000> mold<00:01:21.299> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
will be capturing with our mold in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.170 
will be capturing with our mold in
silicone<00:01:22.259> now<00:01:23.009> once<00:01:23.340> I've<00:01:23.490> tacked<00:01:23.759> those<00:01:24.000> all

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
silicone now once I've tacked those all

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.810 
silicone now once I've tacked those all
in<00:01:24.420> place<00:01:24.689> using<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.710> hot<00:01:26.070> glue<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.670> hot

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
in place using the hot glue and the hot
glue<00:01:27.030> we'll<00:01:27.240> seal<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.479> pretty<00:01:27.780> well<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.530> go

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
glue we'll seal it pretty well but I go

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.370 
glue we'll seal it pretty well but I go
and<00:01:29.009> reinforce<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.880> seal<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.750> some<00:01:30.960> protal

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and reinforce that seal with some protal

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
and reinforce that seal with some protal

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a sulfur free modeling clay it's a good

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.179 
a sulfur free modeling clay it's a good
sculpting<00:01:36.930> medium<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.500> more<00:01:37.710> importantly

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
sculpting medium but more importantly

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
sculpting medium but more importantly
it's<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.520> good<00:01:38.759> cheap<00:01:39.150> utility<00:01:39.840> clay<00:01:40.110> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's a good cheap utility clay that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.370 
it's a good cheap utility clay that
works<00:01:40.799> great<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.250> sealing<00:01:42.000> places<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.079> this

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
works great for sealing places like this

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.950 
works great for sealing places like this
mold<00:01:43.950> boxes<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.240> kinds<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.600> things<00:01:45.659> like

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
mold boxes and all kinds of things like

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.710 
mold boxes and all kinds of things like
that<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:47.280> soft<00:01:47.579> enough<00:01:47.729> even<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> firm

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
silicon and 7320 silicone is a great

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.210 
silicon and 7320 silicone is a great

choice for a lot of prop making
applications<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.420> because<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.350> one

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
applications like this because for one

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.320 
applications like this because for one
thing<00:02:55.530> it's<00:02:55.830> one<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.400> mix<00:02:56.640> ratio<00:02:57.090> by

thing it's one to one mix ratio by

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.270 
thing it's one to one mix ratio by
weight<00:02:57.360> or<00:02:57.870> volume<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.740> it's<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.980> very<00:02:59.220> easy

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
weight or volume so it's a very easy

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.650 
weight or volume so it's a very easy
very<00:03:00.180> user-friendly<00:03:00.660> silicone<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.090> also

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
very user-friendly silicone but it also

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.370 
very user-friendly silicone but it also

components<00:03:43.890> look<00:03:44.370> identical<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.720> good

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
components look identical it's a good

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.720 
components look identical it's a good
idea<00:03:45.960> to<00:03:46.170> add<00:03:46.350> just<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.770> tiny<00:03:47.100> little<00:03:47.460> bit<00:03:47.700> of

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
idea to add just a tiny little bit of

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.360 
idea to add just a tiny little bit of
silicone<00:03:48.120> pigment<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.350> mix<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.220> help

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
silicone pigment to the mix just to help

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.330 
silicone pigment to the mix just to help
you<00:03:50.610> see<00:03:51.120> when<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.380> two<00:03:52.620> components<00:03:53.280> are

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
you see when the two components are

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.370 
you see when the two components are
evenly<00:03:53.760> mixed<00:03:54.360> when<00:03:54.840> there's<00:03:54.990> no<00:03:55.140> little

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
evenly mixed when there's no little

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.140 
evenly mixed when there's no little
color<00:03:55.650> striations<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.610> good<00:03:56.760> indicator

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
color striations that's a good indicator

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.180 
color striations that's a good indicator
that<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.660> good<00:03:57.870> positive<00:03:58.080> mix<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
that you have a good positive mix and

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.050 
that you have a good positive mix and
I'm<00:03:59.280> going<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.490> show<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.670> here<00:03:59.880> in<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.030> minute

you're done mixing silicone now again
this<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.430> low<00:04:05.670> viscosity<00:04:06.060> there's<00:04:06.540> no<00:04:06.870> need

what's left in the mixing Cup and if
that<00:04:20.820> all<00:04:21.090> comes<00:04:21.450> out<00:04:21.570> cleanly<00:04:22.169> that<00:04:22.740> means

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
that all comes out cleanly that means

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.060 
that all comes out cleanly that means
you<00:04:23.070> did<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.280> great<00:04:23.520> job<00:04:23.669> of<00:04:24.180> mixing<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.070> also

you did a great job of mixing and also

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.180 
you did a great job of mixing and also
if<00:04:26.340> what's<00:04:26.640> cure

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
if what's cure

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.190 
if what's cure
in<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.430> mixing<00:04:27.850> cup<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:28.330> completely<00:04:28.930> cured

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
in the mixing cup is completely cured

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.320 
in the mixing cup is completely cured
then<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.740> definitely<00:04:30.220> know<00:04:30.670> you're<00:04:30.940> ready<00:04:31.120> to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
then you definitely know you're ready to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.600 
then you definitely know you're ready to
deem<00:04:31.510> old<00:04:31.720> your<00:04:31.900> part<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.410> that's<00:04:33.160> also<00:04:33.400> a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
deem old your part and that's also a

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.020 
deem old your part and that's also a
good<00:04:34.270> tip<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:35.320> remember<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:36.070> always<00:04:36.370> hold<00:04:36.850> on

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
good tip to remember is always hold on

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.940 
good tip to remember is always hold on
to<00:04:37.270> what's<00:04:37.510> left<00:04:37.840> over<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.200> that<00:04:38.320> mixing<00:04:38.740> cup

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
to what's left over in that mixing cup

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.830 
to what's left over in that mixing cup
because<00:04:39.430> that'll<00:04:39.880> be<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:40.000> good<00:04:40.210> indicator<00:04:40.630> if

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
because that'll be a good indicator if

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.230 
because that'll be a good indicator if
you<00:04:40.960> do<00:04:41.230> ever<00:04:41.500> have<00:04:41.620> mold<00:04:42.130> issues<00:04:42.610> that'll

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
you do ever have mold issues that'll

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.750 
you do ever have mold issues that'll
give<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.450> a<00:04:43.510> good<00:04:43.660> idea<00:04:43.930> if<00:04:44.140> what<00:04:44.590> was<00:04:44.980> if<00:04:45.580> it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
give you a good idea if what was if it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.820 
give you a good idea if what was if it
was<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.910> contaminant<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.170> pattern<00:04:47.620> or

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
was a contaminant in the pattern or

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.450 
was a contaminant in the pattern or
contaminant<00:04:48.730> in<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.150> silicon<00:04:50.160> now<00:04:51.160> here's

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
contaminant in the silicon now here's

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.790 
contaminant in the silicon now here's
our<00:04:51.610> finished<00:04:52.090> mold<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:53.020> all<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.320> bolt<00:04:53.530> heads

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
our finished mold of all the bolt heads

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.700 
our finished mold of all the bolt heads
and<00:04:54.100> you'll<00:04:54.280> see<00:04:54.490> we<00:04:55.090> just<00:04:55.900> need<00:04:56.110> about<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.410> half

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
and you'll see we just need about a half

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.650 
and you'll see we just need about a half
inch<00:04:57.010> of<00:04:57.280> silicone<00:04:57.910> doesn't<00:04:58.180> need<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.510> be<00:04:58.630> very

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
inch of silicone doesn't need to be very

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.810 
inch of silicone doesn't need to be very
thick<00:04:59.140> because<00:04:59.800> this<00:04:59.980> is<00:05:00.100> just<00:05:00.220> going<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.430> sit

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
thick because this is just going to sit

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.970 
thick because this is just going to sit
flat<00:05:01.150> on<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.570> table<00:05:01.960> when<00:05:02.110> we're<00:05:02.260> casting<00:05:02.770> and

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
flat on the table when we're casting and

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.160 
flat on the table when we're casting and
this<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.640> kind<00:05:03.820> of<00:05:03.850> a<00:05:03.970> messy<00:05:04.210> casting<00:05:04.780> process

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
this is kind of a messy casting process

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.900 
this is kind of a messy casting process
when<00:05:05.320> you're<00:05:05.410> molding<00:05:05.650> little<00:05:06.370> screw<00:05:06.700> heads

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
when you're molding little screw heads

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.420 
when you're molding little screw heads
that<00:05:07.090> are<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.570> small<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.410> gets<00:05:09.160> really

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
that are this small it gets really

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.700 
that are this small it gets really
tricky<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:09.910> pour<00:05:10.270> those<00:05:10.480> by<00:05:10.840> hand<00:05:11.140> so<00:05:11.620> what

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
tricky to pour those by hand so what

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.140 
tricky to pour those by hand so what
we're<00:05:11.830> going<00:05:11.920> to<00:05:11.980> do<00:05:12.100> is<00:05:12.220> pour<00:05:12.460> that<00:05:12.610> resin<00:05:13.000> in

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
we're going to do is pour that resin in

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.630 
we're going to do is pour that resin in
and<00:05:13.330> just<00:05:13.600> scrape<00:05:14.110> off<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.560> excess<00:05:15.010> which

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
and just scrape off the excess which

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.800 
and just scrape off the excess which
means<00:05:15.910> we're<00:05:16.060> going<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.210> have<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.360> little<00:05:16.630> bit

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
means we're going to have a little bit

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.290 
means we're going to have a little bit
of<00:05:16.870> waste<00:05:17.280> but<00:05:18.280> that's<00:05:18.430> okay<00:05:18.760> these<00:05:18.940> are<00:05:19.120> such

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
of waste but that's okay these are such

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.410 
of waste but that's okay these are such
small<00:05:19.570> parts<00:05:20.200> by<00:05:20.710> mixing<00:05:21.190> up<00:05:21.430> a<00:05:21.580> couple<00:05:22.270> of

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
thickest part is going to cure first so

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.010 
thickest part is going to cure first so
you'll<00:05:42.100> notice<00:05:42.310> when<00:05:42.669> that<00:05:42.850> puddle<00:05:43.390> of<00:05:43.510> resins

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
you'll notice when that puddle of resins

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.500 
you'll notice when that puddle of resins
surrounding<00:05:44.530> our<00:05:44.650> mold<00:05:44.919> once<00:05:45.640> that<00:05:45.880> has<00:05:46.090> cured

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
surrounding our mold once that has cured

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.050 
surrounding our mold once that has cured
and<00:05:46.720> changed<00:05:47.200> color<00:05:47.470> ready<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.400> D<00:05:48.610> mold<00:05:48.880> our

and changed color ready to D mold our
parts<00:05:49.510> but<00:05:50.140> just<00:05:50.440> keep<00:05:50.590> in<00:05:50.740> mind<00:05:50.770> it<00:05:51.130> cures<00:05:51.400> the

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
parts but just keep in mind it cures the

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.540 
parts but just keep in mind it cures the
inverse<00:05:52.270> of<00:05:52.570> an<00:05:52.960> air<00:05:53.169> drying<00:05:53.500> material<00:05:54.040> so<00:05:54.400> the

inverse of an air drying material so the

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.580 
inverse of an air drying material so the
thickest<00:05:55.060> section<00:05:55.450> will<00:05:55.630> cure<00:05:55.930> first<00:05:56.290> and

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
thickest section will cure first and

there you have the little screw heads

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.810 
there you have the little screw heads
and<00:06:07.570> you<00:06:08.380> can<00:06:08.530> start<00:06:08.800> collecting<00:06:08.950> those<00:06:09.490> and

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
and you can start collecting those and

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.190 
and you can start collecting those and

aside for your next prop making project

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.440 
aside for your next prop making project
now<00:06:15.070> when<00:06:15.340> you're<00:06:15.460> casting<00:06:15.730> these<00:06:16.150> little

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
now when you're casting these little

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.200 
now when you're casting these little
screw<00:06:16.810> heads<00:06:17.080> it's<00:06:17.919> a<00:06:18.010> good<00:06:18.160> idea<00:06:18.250> to<00:06:18.460> not<00:06:18.880> use

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
screw heads it's a good idea to not use

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.570 
screw heads it's a good idea to not use
any<00:06:19.480> mold<00:06:19.870> release<00:06:20.169> and<00:06:20.470> that<00:06:21.280> will<00:06:21.430> help

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
any mold release and that will help

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.790 
any mold release and that will help
facilitate<00:06:21.730> painting<00:06:22.690> later<00:06:22.870> on<00:06:23.140> you<00:06:23.620> don't

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
facilitate painting later on you don't

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.200 
facilitate painting later on you don't
want<00:06:23.950> to<00:06:24.010> introduce<00:06:24.220> anything<00:06:24.760> into<00:06:25.120> the

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
want to introduce anything into the

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.120 
want to introduce anything into the
process<00:06:25.750> that<00:06:26.260> will<00:06:26.410> keep<00:06:26.560> paint<00:06:26.919> from

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
process that will keep paint from

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.370 
process that will keep paint from
sticking<00:06:27.430> later<00:06:27.760> on<00:06:28.000> so<00:06:28.570> make<00:06:28.780> sure<00:06:29.050> you<00:06:29.230> don't

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
sticking later on so make sure you don't

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.350 
sticking later on so make sure you don't
use<00:06:29.590> any<00:06:29.860> mold<00:06:30.220> release<00:06:30.520> when<00:06:30.760> you're<00:06:30.880> casting

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
use any mold release when you're casting

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.180 
use any mold release when you're casting
these<00:06:31.450> little<00:06:31.720> screw<00:06:32.050> heads<00:06:32.290> and<00:06:32.560> that<00:06:32.950> will
