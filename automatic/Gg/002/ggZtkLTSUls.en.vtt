00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.290
 everybody I'm fast horny up there 

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:08.870
 make a new mouthpiece of the 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.940
 I 've been on the shelf. 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.799
 spent on sebum and also won two 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.349
 customers in my father and you will me 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.970
 swore a lot by choosing swan psp 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.460
 which are divided into which everyone already 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.949
 Read only that I had I will not tell 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.380
 prejudice but I did not have much 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.769
 will to read then most are 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.689
 beginning of sagas of an end I go 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.849
 I probably will not even make reviews of 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.980
 It's because everyone already knows the 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.480
 The most that I'm going to do is say the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.280
 My opinion on the books 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.410
 The important thing now is to start the law. 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.290
 I'll be able to discuss with everyone about 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.850
 these books the first that is not beginning 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.360
 of a wise but is of an author who 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.880
 also famous there I chose fandel eu 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.480
 I'm reading at the moment I 've done two 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.300
 markings in here and I'm on page 200 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.950
 second big and I'm really fine 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.040
 disappointed I do not know if I put 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.780
 much expectation in this book but until the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.140
 page 150 did not happen at all 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.240
 Nothing interesting, nothing, I was. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.850
 almost abandoning book but I went more 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.980
 some of it reveals the second book 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.440
 my father's present customer that the 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.630
 environment and this pride for the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.630
 county and prejudice of jane austen 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.120
 ah I want to buy all of her with this 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.010
 cover model of this collection I'm 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.930
 very anxious for this book when you 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.700
 on facebook I bought a lot of people 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.610
 Tell me that I super bowl gild 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.610
 so I very much lei that sprouted it is a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.760
 writer and this is already a motive. 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.010
 too big for her because I love it. 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.440
 English writers and then that's it 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.070
 when I would do you good here in the channel 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.750
 Dad is now recording these two 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 here is something as soon as we go 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.120
 have many people swears'm already seeing but I 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.010
 never read harry potter and I passed the 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.610
 always decide against the first two 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.220
 they are children 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.810
 I'm going to stop quickly because we do not 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.850
 I know it's a kind of story that I know 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.550
 I'll love it but I do not know ever 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.920
 always leave it later to read so it's 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.929
 That's when I finish milk. 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.760
 probably a roll of three at a time 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.110
 records and three times neither lyricist draws 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.760
 And then I say that I found it but I have it 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.980
 I'm sure I'll love it because it's 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.459
 exactly the kind that our fantasy and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.980
 I love fantasy so I already have you 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.590
 seeing something that little voice I do not know 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.880
 if the person is cheaper for this 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.070
 because it fulfills in the sebum 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.900
 but the second is that of the secret camera 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.750
 the flowers are white 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.070
 I do not know if all the members of the stone 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.640
 philosopher is yellowish then it is normal but 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.690
 patience 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.450
 no no no i never had fun 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.070
 including that once was mine I sold 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.560
 I realize I bought them again because it is 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:03.180
 there I saw the movies I loved the movies 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:06.450
 So I liked the movie but anyway I will 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.280
 also make reviews 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.410
 I found in a book about videos about 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.799
 the three hope books I bought 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.930
 because this box here that I showed did not 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.750
 It's mine and it's also not ever borrowed. 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.739
 of voracious games and then I bought 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.720
 because he was the only one who had 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:32.070
 a sebo last book the war of thrones 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.920
 Guys, this book is too big. 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.950
 My God, this business has almost 600 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.049
 pages and I bought a 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.470
 marking the way so it is giving to 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.750
 see that the person even does 251 knowing that 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.620
 It is half separate here but it has no 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.480
 problem with your father $ 30 in it and there they are 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.160
 very very very very very anxious 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.630
 They already told me not to get me. 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.019
 no character is going to die 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.160
 everybody dies and I do not know how it goes 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.540
 to function 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.950
 I played people doing 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.629
 pressure reading every 200 pages 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.920
 More or less what you think I'm thinking. 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.110
 in doing this then stop myself the 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.660
 comments if you prefer that I 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.849
 I make the whole book or dial 100 or 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.739
 Two hundred pages because wanting or 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.720
 not 100 pages is too much because 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.100
 Look at the size of this letter and type neither 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.650
 margin of duty 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.270
 so that's it there rely on these books 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.040
 the month contacts 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.310
 I'm keeping this rhythm from buying 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.110
 more or less of that amount per month 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.740
 I have to make a decrease too. 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.840
 because the people my worst type is 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.820
 Huge I have a lot of political book 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.650
 lots of book but I love it must have 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.919
 a variety where I can reach the 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.660
 stefan today I want is this until then 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.210
 that I do not care about this 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.680
 so if you want to talk to me all 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.110
 My social networks are in the bank. 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.300
 information and do not forget to enjoy the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.460
 a record page on Facebook because 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.050
 I bet a lot of cool things on the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.930
 blog I'm betting on only one subject 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.450
 also legal and in instagram every day I 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.220
 I thing both personally not 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.590
 I can do so much, but not me. 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:21.810
 I can always remember then until the next 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:27.630
 video was our lady who says 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.630
 the problem was
