00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
detail work but it does work now we had

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.839 
detail work but it does work now we had
to<00:00:23.910> fabricate<00:00:24.230> some<00:00:25.230> corks<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.830> took<00:00:25.890> larger

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
to fabricate some corks so I took larger

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.050 
to fabricate some corks so I took larger
corks<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:28.109> trim<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.039> down<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.609> fit<00:00:29.880> in

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
corks and I trim them down to fit in

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.930 
corks and I trim them down to fit in
this<00:00:30.210> gun<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.720> they<00:00:30.840> work<00:00:31.050> properly<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.940> two

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
this gun so they work properly so two

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940 
this gun so they work properly so two
corks<00:00:33.510> now<00:00:34.230> there's<00:00:34.440> some<00:00:34.590> spring

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
corks now there's some spring

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.350 
corks now there's some spring
adjustments<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.730> corks<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.149> little

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
adjustments so this corks a little

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.600 
adjustments so this corks a little
longer<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> still<00:00:37.290> shoots<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.829> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
longer so that it still shoots out so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430 
longer so that it still shoots out so
once<00:00:38.820> they're<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.180> there<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.840> push<00:00:40.110> them<00:00:40.260> in

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
once they're in there just push them in

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
once they're in there just push them in
now<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.340> double<00:00:41.790> barrel<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.750> you're<00:00:42.899> going

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
now it is double barrel so you're going

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.529 
now it is double barrel so you're going
to<00:00:43.110> shoot<00:00:43.460> both<00:00:44.460> triggers<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> pull<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
to shoot both triggers so you pull the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.330 
to shoot both triggers so you pull the
first<00:00:45.750> trigger<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.559> shoot<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
first trigger it's going to shoot and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
first trigger it's going to shoot and
then<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> second<00:00:48.390> trigger<00:00:48.570> did<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.200> hear

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
then the second trigger did you hear

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.590 
then the second trigger did you hear
that<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.340> shooting<00:00:50.820> huh<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> then

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that pretty good shooting huh and then

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.439

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the reset it you're going to just pull

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.290 
the reset it you're going to just pull
this<00:00:54.600> back<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.469> lock<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> you're<00:00:57.000> good<00:00:57.180> to

Stoppers<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.000> one's<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.360> further

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
Stoppers now this one's a little further

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.179 
Stoppers now this one's a little further
back<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.680> why<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> had<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
back in this one so that's why I had to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.429 
back in this one so that's why I had to
make<00:01:21.150> these<00:01:21.360> two<00:01:21.540> corks<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.170> different

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
make these two corks a little different

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.840 
make these two corks a little different
haven't<00:01:22.799> gotten<00:01:22.920> into<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> gun<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.549> see<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.759> we

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
haven't gotten into the gun to see if we

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.390 
haven't gotten into the gun to see if we
can<00:01:24.000> adjust<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.380> again<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.159> pull

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
can adjust that so then again you pull

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.260 
can adjust that so then again you pull
this<00:01:26.610> down<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:29.009> now<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.850> put<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> two

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
this down and now we can put the two

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.640 
this down and now we can put the two
corks<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.780> Shh

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
corks in Shh

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.280 
corks in Shh
I<00:01:31.680> forgot<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.880> dinosaurs<00:01:33.509> feeding<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
I forgot the dinosaurs feeding in the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
I forgot the dinosaurs feeding in the
background<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:35.670> our<00:01:35.700> gun<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.360> loaded

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
background so now our gun is loaded

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560 
background so now our gun is loaded
let's<00:01:37.380> come<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.070> let's<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.299> could

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
let's come in and let's see if we could
