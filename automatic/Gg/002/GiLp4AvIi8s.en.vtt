00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi friends here big welcome to 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.029
 this short video of world of tanks bis 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.560
 today I said little why 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.040
 because in fact we're not going to leave on the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.530
 battlefield 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.269
 I'm just going to leave on the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.040
 clan that's it finally I'm doing my little 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.199
 special video compared to the current there 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.359
 there are many who asked me bible 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.820
 or almost Turkish rugby chasm when is 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.890
 what can I be part of your clan 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 bigou please so here is in fact 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.510
 I thought this weekend to be able to 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.039
 how to say find criteria of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.750
 selection it is not necessarily obvious 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.399
 you 're still over 1200 on my 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.780
 chain still big big dedication to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.210
 butt all big big up to you all thank you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.829
 to continue to share the icc and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.410
 to follow me that's great fun 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.270
 and so this weekend I thought yes that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 happens to me anyway I can think 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 like that does happen and I actually found 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.510
 two criteria to make my selection 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.440
 for you to be part of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.090
 my clan since it's true that it's 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.770
 not necessarily obvious you know that a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 clan can accommodate a maximum of 50 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.030
 people here so there will inevitably be 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.620
 raging there will be people that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.690
 it will annoy everything that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'm sorry I can not so I have 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.439
 reflected on two selection criteria 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.320
 my first criterion is going to be the number of 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.720
 battles total it will not be necessary that he the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.880
 be less than 4000 agree if you 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.180
 have less than 4000 battle I do not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.920
 would not like monday which I blocked a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.460
 little bit but it's good it was 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.350
 unlocked 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.240
 I could not accept you if you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.360
 are less than 4000 battle and 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.189
 then if you have the number 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.780
 of battles that is allowed to re who 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.700
 to be able to benefit from getting into 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.799
 my clan there is the second criterion of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.299
 selection which is the percentage of 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.340
 victories ah yes because inevitably who 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.530
 said battle also says victory and that he 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.299
 must not be less than 50% 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.090
 so here are my two criteria 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.590
 of selection for you to do 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 part of my clan I will not get there 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.399
 correctly this word here are my two 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.810
 selection criteria for power 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.250
 enter into my plan what I had 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.140
 asked a lot baby gulfer what are 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.430
 your criteria and basel and that's so I 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.689
 tell you criteria simply to 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.310
 selection to be part of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.750
 my plan 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.700
 the first battle total not 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.120
 less than 4000 agree it be 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.560
 4000 your superiors 4000 and 6 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.240
 however you have more than 4000 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.160
 battle this second criterion that will 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.750
 selected by me will be the 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.120
 winning percentage that needs to be 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.970
 super equal to or greater than 50% 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.530
 here I hope friends down that 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.670
 this little video will please you from the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.450
 father announces that we did not like him 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.280
 on the battlefield one this is 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.470

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.520
 special clan recruitment recession no 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.530

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.880
 correctly once here we are not going 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.750

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.040
