00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.810 
second part of this story is alright I
felt<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.709> first<00:02:30.860> part<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.310> story<00:02:31.579> was<00:02:31.790> a

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
felt the first part of the story was a

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.939 
felt the first part of the story was a
bit<00:02:32.000> stronger<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.750> like<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.410> riding<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:33.859> the

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:33.949 
bit stronger I like the riding in the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.280 
bit stronger I like the riding in the
beginning<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.570> second<00:02:35.930> part<00:02:35.959> was<00:02:36.260> a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
beginning but the second part was a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.840 
beginning but the second part was a
little<00:02:36.440> bit<00:02:36.650> confusing

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
little bit confusing

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.070 
little bit confusing
with<00:02:38.390> everything<00:02:38.660> going<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:39.200> with<00:02:39.260> Ram<00:02:41.080> horse

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
with everything going on with Ram horse

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.420 
with everything going on with Ram horse
shows<00:02:42.380> son<00:02:42.830> horse<00:02:43.580> show<00:02:44.000> traceable<00:02:44.810> bullets

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
shows son horse show traceable bullets

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.380 
shows son horse show traceable bullets
plus<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.610> art<00:02:46.820> looks<00:02:47.150> like<00:02:48.760> horror<00:02:49.760> show<00:02:50.090> is

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
plus the art looks like horror show is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.450 
plus the art looks like horror show is
the<00:02:51.080> one<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.410> looks<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.770> he<00:02:51.950> shows<00:02:52.190> up<00:02:52.340> in

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
the one that looks like he shows up in

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.190 
the one that looks like he shows up in
the<00:02:52.550> bathroom<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.600> guess<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:53.990> supposed

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
the bathroom but I guess it's supposed

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.120 
the bathroom but I guess it's supposed
to<00:02:54.260> be<00:02:54.380> rammed<00:02:54.650> because<00:02:54.860> that's<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> only

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
to be rammed because that's the only

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.940 
to be rammed because that's the only
thing<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.610> makes<00:02:55.760> sense<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:56.960> hopefully<00:02:57.860> it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
thing that makes sense so hopefully it

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.700 
thing that makes sense so hopefully it
is<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.790> second<00:02:59.150> store<00:02:59.360> in<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.630> book<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.140> a
