00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.400
 ok how about good friends this time 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.400
 I bring you a video tutorial of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.610
 electronic or anything like what 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.660
 I bring is a video that has gone viral 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.750
 lately about the battery of the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.610
 samsung phones this this people are 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 saying that samsung batteries 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.360
 extra in a secret chip in the part of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.390
 inside that is to copy your 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.250
 information or copy your data good 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.480
 only of imedes irle that is 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.640
 totally false 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.309
 although I have a samsung phone that 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.800
 is a samsung galaxy core that is a 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.410
 version that came out for mexico I use it 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.620
 in my work to communicate with people 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.680
 from mexico 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.079
 does not have that technology that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.440
 other phones than those that are 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.470
 speaking they tell you it's called on etsy or 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.950
 near field communication that in Spanish 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.100
 it would be near field communication what 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.310
 what these devices do is bring 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.860
 they bring that chip installed to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.259
 communicate with devices that count 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.380
 with the same technology in the case of my 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.110
 phone that is a galaxy I could say 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.590
 of the cheap injury does not have that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.920
 technology therefore does not have the chip 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.039
 that so many people are talking about me 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.820
 I would say do not destroy your phones 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.149
 just before doing any 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.149
 thing 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 should read or investigate because in one 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.020
 of these cases they could even tell us 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.570
 lies and we could even harm the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.330
 and I think phone companies 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.240
 like Samsung or even the government itself 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.910
 does not need a chip hidden in the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.510
 battery have enough information 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.400
 inside our sim card or the phone 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.369
 if the phone's electronics could 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.679
 do such a thing without having to give us 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.869
 realizing it would be so obvious to put a 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.930
 chip that people could realize 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.910
 but I do not think they do not do it 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.730
 do it yes it is true that they do so 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.450
 I think it would be otherwise 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.540
 good 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.989
 What I 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.579
 I recommend you find out first 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.010
 get informed before doing any other 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.049
 thing and can get to harm your phone 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.180
 thanks as always thanks for watching 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:41.079
 our video invite you to see our 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.230
 blog atom ojete dotcom and until the 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.230
 next
