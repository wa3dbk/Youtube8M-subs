00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
campus for design right now we have

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.039 
campus for design right now we have
students<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> three<00:01:16.950> different<00:01:17.400> buildings

when there's 15 inches of snow on the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280 
when there's 15 inches of snow on the
ground<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.299> walk<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> quarter<00:01:22.049> mile

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
ground you have to walk a quarter mile

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.399 
ground you have to walk a quarter mile
you<00:01:22.619> don't<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.000> fourth-year

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
you don't do it so the fourth-year

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.050 
you don't do it so the fourth-year
architecture<00:01:25.409> students<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.640> second

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
architecture students and the second

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
architecture students and the second
year<00:01:27.240> interior<00:01:28.200> design<00:01:28.590> students<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.490> not

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
year interior design students and do not

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.660 
year interior design students and do not
meet<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.600> did<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.320> separate<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
meet they did it's just separate it I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.340 
meet they did it's just separate it I
think<00:01:33.240> by<00:01:33.360> putting<00:01:33.689> everybody<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.170> one

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
think by putting everybody in one

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
think by putting everybody in one
building<00:01:34.829> there's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.100> collaborative<00:01:35.970> spirit

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
building there's a collaborative spirit

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
building there's a collaborative spirit
there's<00:01:37.200> an<00:01:37.409> understanding<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.579> ask

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
there's an understanding that I can ask

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.249 
there's an understanding that I can ask
somebody<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.570> sitting<00:01:39.960> 40<00:01:40.799> feet<00:01:41.009> away

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
somebody that's sitting 40 feet away

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.050 
somebody that's sitting 40 feet away
it'll<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.460> incorporate<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> great<00:01:44.820> deal<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it'll just incorporate a great deal of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.590 
it'll just incorporate a great deal of
things<00:01:45.450> from<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.140> design<00:01:46.470> standpoint<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:48.210> we

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
things from a design standpoint we we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.050 
things from a design standpoint we we
were<00:01:48.720> looking<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.140> something<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.439> really

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
were looking for something that really

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.639 
were looking for something that really

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
knits the campus and the community

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
knits the campus and the community
together<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.790> such<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> prominent

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
together because it is such a prominent

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.510 
together because it is such a prominent
building<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.750> has<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.500> has<00:01:55.680> an<00:01:55.860> iconic<00:01:56.399> image

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
