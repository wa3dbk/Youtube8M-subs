00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.490
 the glands are cellular groupings 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.250
 that secrete substances that can be seen 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.820
 abroad exocrine or directly to 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.009
 the endocrine blood for example the breast 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.710
 produces milk and is an exocrine gland 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.410
 and the lacrimal salivary glands and 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.869
 sweat glands are also the glands 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.809
 thyroid pancreas in part pituitary gland 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.820
 they are endocrine glands whose secretion 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:37.000
 the hormones go directly to the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.739
 blood the gland is thus an organ that 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.540
 Its characteristic is to produce 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.940
 very special substances called 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.190
 hormones hormones are messengers 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.590
 silent they tell the organs 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.780
 who are in charge of their functions 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.610
 Thyroid gland is an organ located 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.670
 in the neck below the apple of 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.440
 Adam and above the bone sternum 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.570
 It has a butterfly shape with two lobes 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.850
 lateral joined by a medium or isthmus 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.680
 normally weighs between 20 and 25 grams and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.040
 is responsible for producing the hormones 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.590
 thyroid t3 and t4 that circulate through the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 blood to the whole body the lobes 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.630
 they measure in ultrasound approximately 55 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.080
 millimeters in longitudinal diameter and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.360
 about 15 millimeters thick thyroid 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.130
 produces some hormonal compounds that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.050
 they have a unique feature in the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.930
 organism and is that in its composition 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.580
 enter iodine and this is a very 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.860
 important because if the body does not 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.900
 has iodine the thyroid can not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 produce hormones if you do not have 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.830
 enough thyroid hormones can 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.290
 cause problems that go from a 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.570
 small hyperplasia or goiter not very 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.760
 important to a severe situation 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.230
 growth retardation and mental deficit 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.900
 known as endemic cretinism 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.670
 thyroid hormones are essential 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.800
 for the proper functioning of everything 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.080
 the body tells the various 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.950
 organs the speed with which they must occur 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.950
 the metabolic processes 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.070
 bitch 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.969
 two 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.660
 Kisses 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.870
 maybe
