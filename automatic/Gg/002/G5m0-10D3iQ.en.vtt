00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530 

we<00:00:00.240> will<00:00:00.480> start<00:00:00.960> and<00:00:01.650> with<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.280> 2.2<00:00:02.850> diesel<00:00:03.149> in

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
we will start and with the 2.2 diesel in

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.140 
we will start and with the 2.2 diesel in
January<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:05.160> will<00:00:05.310> be<00:00:05.430> followed<00:00:05.640> really

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
January and that will be followed really

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.530 
January and that will be followed really
in<00:00:06.299> February<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.259> 1.4<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.460> 1.8<00:00:09.120> petrol

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
in February with the 1.4 and 1.8 petrol

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.140 
in February with the 1.4 and 1.8 petrol
engines<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.429> suppose<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> most<00:00:11.700> significant

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
engines I suppose the most significant

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.209 
engines I suppose the most significant
thing<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.480> diesel<00:00:12.840> engine<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:14.070> we

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
thing with the diesel engine is that we

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.700 
thing with the diesel engine is that we
now<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> tax<00:00:14.910> band<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.299> car<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:15.960> that's<00:00:16.139> 110

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
now have a tax band a car so that's 110

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.730 
now have a tax band a car so that's 110
grams<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.490> absolutely<00:00:18.000> terrific<00:00:18.740> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
grams which is absolutely terrific and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.620 
grams which is absolutely terrific and
that's<00:00:19.920> had<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> major<00:00:20.310> impact<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> pricing

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
that's had a major impact on the pricing

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.300 
that's had a major impact on the pricing
because<00:00:21.779> obviously<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.439> VRT<00:00:22.859> rates<00:00:23.130> are

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
because obviously the VRT rates are

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.519 
because obviously the VRT rates are
considerably<00:00:23.820> lower<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> tax<00:00:24.750> band<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.140> car

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
considerably lower for a tax band a car

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.460 
considerably lower for a tax band a car

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
care of this particular quality more

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.600

airbags<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.479> shake<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> stick<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:02.159> again<00:02:02.579> I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
airbags to shake a stick at and again I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.980 
airbags to shake a stick at and again I
suppose<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.270> technical<00:02:03.600> point<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> view

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
suppose from a technical point of view

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.480 
suppose from a technical point of view
it's<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> ability<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> character

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
it's just the ability of the character

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.930 
it's just the ability of the character
handle<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.000> well<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.580> actually

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
handle so well and I think that actually

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.839 
handle so well and I think that actually
it<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.569> supports<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:11.160> safety<00:02:11.520> measures

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
it really supports the safety measures

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.640 
it really supports the safety measures
that<00:02:11.970> are<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.180> place

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
that are in place

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.320 
that are in place
but<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:14.010> an<00:02:14.130> extremely<00:02:14.640> important<00:02:15.180> car

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
but this is an extremely important car

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.670 
but this is an extremely important car
for<00:02:15.360> universal<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> Irish<00:02:17.340> market

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
for universal and in the Irish market

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.640 
for universal and in the Irish market
you've<00:02:19.680> ambitious<00:02:20.580> plans<00:02:20.820> perhaps<00:02:21.530> 750<00:02:22.530> units

you've ambitious plans perhaps 750 units
next<00:02:23.280> year<00:02:23.520> around<00:02:23.760> 750<00:02:24.750> doesn't<00:02:25.050> sound<00:02:25.230> like

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
next year around 750 doesn't sound like

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.190 
next year around 750 doesn't sound like
a<00:02:25.410> huge<00:02:25.710> number<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> car<00:02:26.490> like<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.940> but

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
a huge number for a car like this but

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.510 
a huge number for a car like this but
the<00:02:28.200> estimates<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.860> market<00:02:29.220> next<00:02:29.340> year

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
the estimates for the market next year

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.270 
the estimates for the market next year
somewhere<00:02:30.090> around<00:02:30.440> 75,000<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:32.160> know

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
somewhere around 75,000 so that you know

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
somewhere around 75,000 so that you know
what<00:02:32.400> give<00:02:32.610> us<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:33.210> percent<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.960> market

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
what give us one percent of that market

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.470 
what give us one percent of that market
with<00:02:34.560> Civic<00:02:34.860> alone<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:36.800> 2013<00:02:38.360> honda<00:02:39.360> will

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
with Civic alone in 2013 honda will

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.420 
with Civic alone in 2013 honda will
introduce<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:40.080> smaller<00:02:40.530> diesel<00:02:41.010> engine<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
introduce a smaller diesel engine and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.370 
introduce a smaller diesel engine and
we're<00:02:41.880> not<00:02:42.030> sure<00:02:42.270> what<00:02:42.540> size<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.020> engine<00:02:43.290> is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
we're not sure what size that engine is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.910 
we're not sure what size that engine is
it<00:02:43.560> hasn't<00:02:43.710> been<00:02:43.920> qualified<00:02:44.820> just<00:02:45.240> yet<00:02:45.920> but

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it hasn't been qualified just yet but

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.530 
it hasn't been qualified just yet but
that<00:02:46.980> will<00:02:47.220> actually<00:02:47.550> allow<00:02:47.790> us<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.180> grow<00:02:48.210> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
that will actually allow us to grow the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.020 
that will actually allow us to grow the
volume<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.960> civic<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.350> 2013<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.340> we're

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
volume of civic in 2013 and we're

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.400 
volume of civic in 2013 and we're
obviously<00:02:51.180> hoping<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.960> market<00:02:52.290> will

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
obviously hoping that the market will

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.260 
obviously hoping that the market will
come<00:02:52.590> back<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.920> 2014<00:02:53.370> at<00:02:53.760> least<00:02:53.940> make<00:02:54.090> some

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
come back in 2014 at least make some

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.450 
come back in 2014 at least make some
recovery<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.720> 2014<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.950> will<00:02:56.070> allow<00:02:56.280> us<00:02:56.310> to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
recovery in 2014 that will allow us to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.550 
recovery in 2014 that will allow us to
get<00:02:56.670> up<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.910> around<00:02:57.090> 1,400<00:02:57.900> service<00:02:58.200> or<00:02:58.320> Civic

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
get up to around 1,400 service or Civic

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.940 
get up to around 1,400 service or Civic
so<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.340> Ireland<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.940> c-segment<00:03:00.470> accounts<00:03:01.470> but

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
so in Ireland the c-segment accounts but

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.010 
so in Ireland the c-segment accounts but
probably<00:03:02.250> about<00:03:02.430> 75%<00:03:03.000> diesel<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> rest

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
probably about 75% diesel and the rest

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.430 
probably about 75% diesel and the rest
natural<00:03:04.410> yeah<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.400> correct<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:07.200> I

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
natural yeah that is correct and I

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.840 
natural yeah that is correct and I
suppose<00:03:07.710> an<00:03:07.860> arranged<00:03:08.130> like<00:03:08.310> Honda<00:03:08.670> we're

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
suppose an arranged like Honda we're

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.400 
suppose an arranged like Honda we're
actually<00:03:09.030> very<00:03:09.210> fortunate<00:03:09.930> because<00:03:09.960> we've

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
actually very fortunate because we've

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.650 
actually very fortunate because we've
got<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.590> very<00:03:10.890> efficient<00:03:11.610> petrol<00:03:12.240> engine<00:03:12.540> and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
got a very efficient petrol engine and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.140 
got a very efficient petrol engine and
we've<00:03:13.500> got<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> terrifically<00:03:14.190> loyal<00:03:14.550> ownership

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
we've got a terrifically loyal ownership

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.470 
we've got a terrifically loyal ownership
out<00:03:15.660> there<00:03:16.130> we<00:03:17.130> manage<00:03:17.460> I<00:03:17.610> supposed<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.090> swim

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
out there we manage I supposed to swim

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.820 
out there we manage I supposed to swim
against<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.870> tide<00:03:18.990> without<00:03:19.290> me<00:03:19.560> because

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
against the tide without me because

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.590 
against the tide without me because
we're<00:03:20.010> always<00:03:20.160> hugely<00:03:20.820> successful<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.570> our

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
we're always hugely successful with our

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.110 
we're always hugely successful with our
petrol<00:03:21.990> engines<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:23.340> we<00:03:23.520> would<00:03:23.730> expect<00:03:24.000> that

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
petrol engines and we would expect that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.450 
petrol engines and we would expect that
that<00:03:24.300> will<00:03:24.360> continue<00:03:24.510> what<00:03:25.470> has<00:03:25.710> helped<00:03:26.370> us

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
that will continue what has helped us

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.300 
that will continue what has helped us
and<00:03:26.760> certainly<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:28.260> segment<00:03:28.710> totally

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
and certainly in a segment totally

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.030 
and certainly in a segment totally
dominated<00:03:29.850> by<00:03:29.940> diesel<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:31.410> pricing<00:03:31.890> of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
dominated by diesel is the pricing of

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.100 
dominated by diesel is the pricing of
our<00:03:32.190> 2.2<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.180> fact<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.660> no<00:03:33.780> tax

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
our 2.2 and the fact that it's no tax

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.200 
our 2.2 and the fact that it's no tax
band<00:03:34.350> acre<00:03:34.710> and<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.980> think<00:03:35.160> as<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.910> know<00:03:36.090> I've

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
band acre and I think as you know I've

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.880 
band acre and I think as you know I've
said<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.570> earlier<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:37.110> mean<00:03:37.440> Honda<00:03:37.770> have

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
said to you earlier I mean Honda have

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.880 
said to you earlier I mean Honda have
only<00:03:38.040> introduced<00:03:38.520> Jesus<00:03:38.910> since<00:03:39.090> 2004<00:03:39.960> so<00:03:40.380> you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
only introduced Jesus since 2004 so you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.350 
only introduced Jesus since 2004 so you
know<00:03:41.040> we're<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.460> at<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.820> start<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.240> a

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
know we're really at the start of a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.790 
know we're really at the start of a
growth<00:03:42.540> journey<00:03:42.720> four<00:03:43.050> hundred<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.410> diesel

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
growth journey four hundred and diesel

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.470 
growth journey four hundred and diesel
and<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.340> know<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.460> think<00:03:44.610> you'll<00:03:44.880> see<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> lot<00:03:45.420> of

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
and you know I think you'll see a lot of
