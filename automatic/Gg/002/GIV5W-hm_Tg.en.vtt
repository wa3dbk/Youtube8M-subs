people<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.000> various<00:01:09.510> different<00:01:09.900> pipes<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
people with various different pipes you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.350 
people with various different pipes you
notice<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.700> use<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
notice that they can use it and then you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.260 
notice that they can use it and then you
have<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> simple<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:13.140> look<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.030> turn

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
have a simple little look and you turn

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.140 
have a simple little look and you turn
here<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> let<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> down<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.790> other<00:01:17.939> thing

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
here to let it down and the other thing

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
here to let it down and the other thing
it's<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.509> steel<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.380> because<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.220> weighs

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's all steel so because this weighs

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.690 
it's all steel so because this weighs
about<00:01:20.520> 180<00:01:21.450> pounds<00:01:22.110> even<00:01:22.740> though<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.490> doesn't

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
about 180 pounds even though it doesn't

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
about 180 pounds even though it doesn't
take<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.150> much<00:01:24.299> room<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:25.049> less<00:01:25.259> than<00:01:25.439> it's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
take up much room it's less than it's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
take up much room it's less than it's
about<00:01:25.950> 3<00:01:26.280> feet<00:01:26.490> from<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.509> then

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
about 3 feet from here to here but then

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
about 3 feet from here to here but then
you<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> extension<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.490> you're

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you get the extension of this and you're

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.969 
you get the extension of this and you're
crushing<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.780> less<00:01:31.049> than<00:01:31.079> 2<00:01:31.439> feet<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
crushing and it's less than 2 feet this

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.460 
crushing and it's less than 2 feet this
way<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.540> big<00:01:33.840> doesn't<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:34.320> up

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
way so it's not that big doesn't take up

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.560 
way so it's not that big doesn't take up
much<00:01:34.650> room<00:01:35.240> then<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> show<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> the

much room then also like to show you the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
much room then also like to show you the

just to go over here for a moment here

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.130 
just to go over here for a moment here
you<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.679> five<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.119> will<00:02:03.840> crush

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you have a five down and that will crush

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
you have a five down and that will crush
in<00:02:04.319> a<00:02:04.380> few<00:02:04.560> minutes<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.039> unit<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
in a few minutes in this unit here and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.910 
in a few minutes in this unit here and
that's<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.569> size<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.710> then<00:02:07.829> we

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that's the size of the can and then we

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.529 
that's the size of the can and then we
are<00:02:08.069> all<00:02:08.250> set<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.550> done<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.030> about<00:02:09.269> intention

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
are all set and done is about intention

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.820 
are all set and done is about intention
I'd<00:02:10.229> say<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.679> recursions<00:02:11.550> thick<00:02:12.800> then<00:02:13.800> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I'd say have recursions thick then you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.070 
I'd say have recursions thick then you
have<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.130> number<00:02:14.610> ten<00:02:15.060> or<00:02:15.299> gallon<00:02:15.780> can

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
have a number ten or gallon can

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.199 
have a number ten or gallon can
depending<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.680> your<00:02:16.830> Crudup<00:02:17.340> what<00:02:17.970> kind<00:02:18.180> of

depending on your Crudup what kind of
business<00:02:18.750> you're<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.130> what<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
business you're in and this is what it

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.100 
business you're in and this is what it
ends<00:02:20.519> up<00:02:20.730> being<00:02:20.970> predictive<00:02:21.630> scan<00:02:21.810> your<00:02:21.930> old

ends up being predictive scan your old

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.910 
ends up being predictive scan your old
gone<00:02:22.319> about<00:02:22.650> oh<00:02:22.980> I've<00:02:23.730> got<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> half<00:02:24.120> inch<00:02:24.150> dick

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
gone about oh I've got a half inch dick

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.800 
gone about oh I've got a half inch dick
then<00:02:25.920> if<00:02:26.040> you're<00:02:26.160> crushing<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.790> sodas<00:02:27.660> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
then if you're crushing the sodas and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.500 
then if you're crushing the sodas and
beer<00:02:28.049> cans<00:02:31.130> these<00:02:32.130> are<00:02:32.310> 16<00:02:32.730> ounce<00:02:32.910> by<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.269> way

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
beer cans these are 16 ounce by the way

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.809 
beer cans these are 16 ounce by the way
and<00:02:33.959> they're<00:02:34.650> down<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.130> about<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.310> half<00:02:35.519> inch

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
and they're down to about a half inch

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.809 
and they're down to about a half inch
thickness<00:02:36.569> when<00:02:36.930> you're<00:02:37.049> all<00:02:37.170> said<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.620> done

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
thickness when you're all said and done

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.420 
thickness when you're all said and done
so<00:02:38.819> who<00:02:39.150> would<00:02:39.329> use<00:02:39.510> these<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:40.739> crushers<00:02:41.220> when

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
so who would use these can crushers when

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.640 
so who would use these can crushers when
you<00:02:41.519> think<00:02:41.760> about<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:42.120> well<00:02:42.329> like<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.230> said<00:02:43.290> you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
you think about it well like I said you

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.520 
you think about it well like I said you
use<00:02:43.890> them<00:02:44.099> bond<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.819> dining<00:02:45.239> facilities<00:02:45.840> but
