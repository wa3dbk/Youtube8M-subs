us here well today we're getting into
some<00:00:37.520> of<00:00:37.550> our<00:00:37.699> beaded<00:00:38.059> face<00:00:38.300> frame<00:00:38.600> system<00:00:38.809> we

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
some of our beaded face frame system we

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.020 
some of our beaded face frame system we
added<00:00:39.590> new<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.129> show<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.640> beat<00:00:40.760> of<00:00:40.880> face

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
added new to the show the beat of face

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.550 
added new to the show the beat of face
frame<00:00:41.270> is<00:00:41.420> something<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:41.810> a<00:00:41.899> lot<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:42.170> lot<00:00:42.380> of

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
frame is something that a lot a lot of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.380 
frame is something that a lot a lot of
woodworkers<00:00:42.860> do<00:00:43.250> they<00:00:43.640> don't<00:00:43.820> do<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.120> because

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
woodworkers do they don't do it because

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.729 
woodworkers do they don't do it because
it's<00:00:44.570> difficult<00:00:44.840> typically<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:45.649> to

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
it's difficult typically you have to

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.889 
it's difficult typically you have to
make<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.520> face<00:00:46.730> frame<00:00:47.059> then<00:00:47.300> make<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.690> bead

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
make the face frame then make the bead

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.750 
make the face frame then make the bead
and<00:00:48.230> glue<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.680> on<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.130> try<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:49.489> miter<00:00:49.670> the

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
and glue it on and try and miter the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.160 
and glue it on and try and miter the
corners<00:00:49.910> we've<00:00:50.390> got<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.600> system<00:00:50.989> now<00:00:51.140> that

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
corners we've got a system now that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.530 
corners we've got a system now that
mounts<00:00:51.590> onto<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:51.890> standard<00:00:52.280> router<00:00:52.520> table<00:00:52.969> that

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
mounts onto a standard router table that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.240 
mounts onto a standard router table that
anybody<00:00:54.110> can<00:00:54.410> make<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.620> beaded<00:00:54.920> face<00:00:55.070> right

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
anybody can make a beaded face right

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.250 
anybody can make a beaded face right
right<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.239> let<00:00:56.329> me<00:00:56.360> show<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:56.570> how<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:56.780> works

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
right so let me show you how this works

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.080 
right so let me show you how this works
you've<00:00:57.770> got<00:00:58.010> your<00:00:58.160> cutter<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:58.790> this<00:00:58.880> cutter

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
you've got your cutter and this cutter

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.400 
you've got your cutter and this cutter
here<00:00:59.329> is<00:00:59.420> an<00:00:59.510> inch<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.840> a<00:00:59.870> half<00:00:59.899> in<00:01:00.200> diameter

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
here is an inch and a half in diameter

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.959 
here is an inch and a half in diameter
so<00:01:00.860> when<00:01:01.160> you're<00:01:01.280> using<00:01:01.309> inch<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> half

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
so when you're using inch and a half

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.660 
so when you're using inch and a half
wide<00:01:02.390> stalk<00:01:02.870> it's<00:01:03.590> very<00:01:03.920> simple<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.309> do<00:01:04.399> it<00:01:04.489> all

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
wide stalk it's very simple to do it all

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.880 
wide stalk it's very simple to do it all
in<00:01:04.699> one<00:01:05.030> pass<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.140> top<00:01:06.350> part<00:01:06.619> though<00:01:06.770> we

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
in one pass for the top part though we

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.040 
in one pass for the top part though we
need<00:01:07.009> to<00:01:07.160> have<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.640> nice<00:01:08.090> little<00:01:08.390> notch<00:01:08.720> out

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
need to have a nice little notch out

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.330 
need to have a nice little notch out
there<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:09.320> I'm<00:01:09.410> gonna<00:01:09.530> do<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.800> in<00:01:09.979> two<00:01:10.130> passes

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
there so I'm gonna do that in two passes

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.940 
there so I'm gonna do that in two passes
just<00:01:10.759> so<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:10.910> have<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.090> square<00:01:11.479> top<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:12.619> set<00:01:12.799> this

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
just so I have a square top to set this

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.260 
just so I have a square top to set this
up<00:01:13.159> you're<00:01:13.369> going<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.520> slide<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:13.970> onto<00:01:14.180> your

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
up you're going to slide this onto your

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.210 
up you're going to slide this onto your
router<00:01:14.720> table<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.260> comes<00:01:15.470> with<00:01:15.619> an<00:01:15.770> aligning

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
router table it comes with an aligning

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.649 
router table it comes with an aligning
pin<00:01:16.400> that<00:01:16.549> helps<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.880> set<00:01:17.060> it<00:01:17.180> up<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.479> comes

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
pin that helps you set it up it comes

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.149 
pin that helps you set it up it comes
with<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.900> set<00:01:18.290> up<00:01:18.380> bar<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.740> can<00:01:18.920> set<00:01:19.070> up

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
with the set up bar so you can set up

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.310 
with the set up bar so you can set up
the<00:01:19.250> height<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.549> your<00:01:19.700> cutter<00:01:19.909> too<00:01:20.320> once

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
the height of your cutter too once

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.760 
the height of your cutter too once
everything's<00:01:21.680> squared<00:01:22.040> away<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:23.570> stop<00:01:23.900> just

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
everything's squared away the stop just

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.679 
everything's squared away the stop just
allows<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:25.850> hold<00:01:26.060> everything<00:01:26.330> nice<00:01:26.659> and

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
allows you to hold everything nice and

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.510 
allows you to hold everything nice and
tight<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.350> clamp<00:01:27.680> it<00:01:27.830> into<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.100> system<00:01:28.490> so

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
tight and clamp it into the system so

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.460 
tight and clamp it into the system so
we'll<00:01:28.760> do<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.000> first<00:01:29.030> cut<00:01:29.479> here<00:01:29.750> everything's

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
we'll do the first cut here everything's

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.899 
we'll do the first cut here everything's
going<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.619> feed<00:01:30.950> into<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.430> cutter<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:31.850> you

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
going to feed into the cutter so you

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.429 
going to feed into the cutter so you
can't<00:01:32.210> just<00:01:32.420> buy<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.689> bits<00:01:33.080> all<00:01:33.260> by

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
can't just buy the bits all by

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.020 
can't just buy the bits all by
themselves<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:33.950> need<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.220> buy<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.400> system<00:01:34.909> so

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
themselves you need to buy the system so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.399 
themselves you need to buy the system so
you<00:01:35.060> can<00:01:35.150> move<00:01:35.390> things<00:01:35.689> into<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.110> cutter<00:01:36.290> you

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
you can move things into the cutter you

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.469 
you can move things into the cutter you
can't<00:01:36.560> just<00:01:36.740> slide<00:01:36.979> across<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.549> normal<00:01:38.270> router

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
can't just slide across a normal router

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.570 
can't just slide across a normal router
table<00:01:39.020> read

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
notch on the side now we just have to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.850 
notch on the side now we just have to
move<00:01:49.160> over<00:01:49.520> our<00:01:49.700> bar<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.840> stop<00:01:51.140> system<00:01:51.440> here

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
measuring for the width of your drawer

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.550 
measuring for the width of your drawer
if<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.420> had<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> five<00:02:16.780> inch<00:02:16.989> drawer<00:02:17.230> would<00:02:17.410> be

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
if you had a five inch drawer would be

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.860 
if you had a five inch drawer would be
the<00:02:17.739> five<00:02:18.010> inches<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.640> space<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.599> drawer

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
the five inches of space for the drawer

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.420 
the five inches of space for the drawer
and<00:02:20.230> because<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.709> cutter<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.069> going<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.250> take

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
and because the cutter is going to take

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.860 
and because the cutter is going to take
it<00:02:21.550> all<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.700> one<00:02:21.940> pass<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.450> makes<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.720> very

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
it all in one pass it makes it very

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.550 
it all in one pass it makes it very
simple<00:02:23.200> clamp<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.830> into<00:02:24.069> place

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.100 

and<00:02:30.010> now<00:02:30.160> you've<00:02:30.280> got<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.490> perfect<00:02:30.970> notch<00:02:31.150> for

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
and now you've got a perfect notch for

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.990 
and now you've got a perfect notch for
that<00:02:32.350> inch<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.680> half<00:02:32.740> wide<00:02:32.830> stock<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.910> now

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.460 
that inch and a half wide stock so now
we<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.270> have<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.540> make<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> styles<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.380> the

we just have to make the styles and the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.780 
we just have to make the styles and the
rails<00:02:35.710> fit<00:02:36.010> together<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.520> I'm<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.700> gonna

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
rails fit together so I'm just gonna

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.730 
rails fit together so I'm just gonna
slide<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.360> stop<00:02:37.630> back<00:02:37.870> over<00:02:38.140> here<00:02:38.290> now<00:02:38.350> lock

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
that into place right there and this is

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.420 
that into place right there and this is
going<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.380> take<00:02:41.560> off<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:41.920> quarter-inch

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.890 

so<00:02:48.800> now<00:02:48.950> there's<00:02:49.190> our<00:02:49.400> not<00:02:49.580> right<00:02:49.879> here<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.510> if

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
so now there's our not right here and if

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.880 
so now there's our not right here and if
you<00:02:51.020> look<00:02:51.140> at<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.290> way<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.500> goes<00:02:51.680> together

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
you look at the way it goes together

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.619 
you look at the way it goes together
that's<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.489> sweet<00:02:52.790> part<00:02:53.030> that's<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.390> part

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
that's the sweet part that's the part

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.449 
that's the sweet part that's the part
that<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.900> slides<00:02:54.140> right<00:02:54.290> into<00:02:54.620> place<00:02:54.830> and

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
that just slides right into place and

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.490 
that just slides right into place and
fits<00:02:55.760> perfect<00:02:56.269> we're<00:02:56.720> gonna<00:02:56.810> do<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.019> double<00:02:57.379> one

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
fits perfect we're gonna do a double one

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.930 
fits perfect we're gonna do a double one
in<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.739> side<00:02:57.920> here<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:58.129> we<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:58.519> fit<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.790> into

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
in this side here so we can fit it into

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.900 
in this side here so we can fit it into
that<00:02:59.120> section<00:02:59.540> to<00:03:00.370> slip<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.519> into<00:03:01.700> there

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
that section to slip that into there

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.870 
that section to slip that into there
lock<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.300> into<00:03:02.480> place

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.850 

now<00:03:07.240> typically<00:03:07.630> you'd<00:03:07.780> have<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.020> top<00:03:08.290> rail<00:03:08.590> you

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
now typically you'd have a top rail you

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.110 
now typically you'd have a top rail you
have<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> bottom<00:03:09.430> rail<00:03:09.580> you'd<00:03:09.820> have<00:03:10.000> your

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
have a bottom rail you'd have your

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.850 
have a bottom rail you'd have your
center<00:03:10.480> rails<00:03:10.690> for<00:03:10.990> your<00:03:11.110> drawers<00:03:11.410> with<00:03:11.680> that

center rails for your drawers with that

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.310 
center rails for your drawers with that
all<00:03:12.040> knocks<00:03:12.310> into<00:03:12.580> there<00:03:12.910> it's<00:03:13.570> perfect<00:03:14.230> on

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
all knocks into there it's perfect on

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.110 
all knocks into there it's perfect on
the<00:03:14.410> first<00:03:14.440> try<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.460> now<00:03:15.670> we<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:15.880> have<00:03:16.060> to

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
the first try and now we just have to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.790 
the first try and now we just have to
put<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.360> bead<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.570> we<00:03:17.140> don't<00:03:17.290> have<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.590> make<00:03:17.770> a

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
put the bead on we don't have to make a

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.070 
put the bead on we don't have to make a
separate<00:03:18.460> bead<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.970> then<00:03:19.300> pin<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.870> and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
separate bead and then pin it on and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.060 
separate bead and then pin it on and
glue<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.290> on<00:03:20.350> we're<00:03:20.500> gonna<00:03:20.620> go<00:03:20.800> over<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.040> our

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
glue it on we're gonna go over to our

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.160 
glue it on we're gonna go over to our
router<00:03:21.490> table<00:03:21.820> here<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.510> other<00:03:22.630> router<00:03:22.870> table

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
router table here the other router table

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.780 
router table here the other router table
already<00:03:23.440> has<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.830> router<00:03:24.040> bit<00:03:24.220> set<00:03:24.490> up<00:03:24.610> it's

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
already has the router bit set up it's

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.730 
already has the router bit set up it's
got<00:03:24.910> my<00:03:25.060> beading<00:03:25.420> bit<00:03:25.570> on<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.320> just<00:03:26.500> have<00:03:26.620> to

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
got my beading bit on it so just have to

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.680 
got my beading bit on it so just have to
raise<00:03:27.010> up<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.340> height<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> bit<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.510> that

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
raise up the height of the bit so that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.210 
raise up the height of the bit so that
it<00:03:28.780> just<00:03:28.930> touches<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.380> underside<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:29.950> the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
it just touches the underside of the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.990 
it just touches the underside of the
stop<00:03:30.460> shirt

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
stop shirt

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.850 
stop shirt
so<00:03:31.540> now<00:03:31.690> we'll<00:03:31.840> turn<00:03:32.020> this<00:03:32.170> router<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:32.650> let's

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
so now we'll turn this router on let's

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.470 
so now we'll turn this router on let's
run<00:03:33.010> these<00:03:33.160> through

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:50.309 

so<00:03:37.720> there's<00:03:37.930> your<00:03:38.110> bead<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.560> one<00:03:38.709> side

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.990 

and<00:03:50.709> there's<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.099> beads<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.549> other<00:03:51.700> side

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and there's the beads on the other side

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.440 
and there's the beads on the other side
and<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:52.890> will<00:03:53.890> fit<00:03:54.220> right<00:03:54.489> into<00:03:55.209> there
