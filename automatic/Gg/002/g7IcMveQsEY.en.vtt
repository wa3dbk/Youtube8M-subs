small and it drives really well then
I've<00:00:48.719> got<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.020> adder<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> really

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
I've got the adder which is a really

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.150 
I've got the adder which is a really
clever<00:00:50.579> car<00:00:50.910> than<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> zentorno<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
clever car than the zentorno which is a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
sticks to the ground living so you can't

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590 
sticks to the ground living so you can't
get<00:01:22.920> over<00:01:23.130> curbs<00:01:23.369> which<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.030> still<00:01:24.180> good<00:01:24.390> car
