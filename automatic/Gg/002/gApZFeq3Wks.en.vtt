00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:11.389
 Hello ahead is the former channel e th 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:17.250
 This time I want to write a picture using masking tape in the wind of my son's room 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:19.270
 Before that I want to show off my masking tape collection 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.840
 Why is this 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:28.970
 Solid color masking 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.680
 Because it looks like a display of miscellaneous goods if put tomorrow in a bottle and decorate it in a random manner, so cute 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.340
 It is recommended 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.370
 Just because the number will not fit in 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.090
 I think that Gallery Pokuzu pre 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.090
 It was of the prepared 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:53.160
 This is the acrylic case of Zeal and good 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:01:01.460
 It is very favorite now because it is both cute with storage and interior 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.460
 And is set for a recommendation to other countries is here in masking tape collection 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:14.410
 Horaguchikayo masking tape and pig masking tape cutter 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.410
 For now, it's ornamental rather than using 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.520
 Then it would have been the main subject 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.909
 We will show you the wall of the son of the room Now 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.909
 1 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.140
 Then 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.350
 This wall is 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.120

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.020
 Hey What Would you like to write 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.950

 I got permission , so I want to put my hand on the wall 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.510
 A photo of the wall takes one to knead the idea 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.970
 It is directly below 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.700

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.260

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.090
 Naa Oh 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.140
 I also want to decorate photos 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.190
 So for example 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.330
 Make a lot of cool frames 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.040
 Make a picture frame with masking tape and decorate the picture inside 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.350
 The picture after furring strips 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.270

 I want to be able to decorate the photos together 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.090
 Then the rough design was decided 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.460
 it's here 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.460
