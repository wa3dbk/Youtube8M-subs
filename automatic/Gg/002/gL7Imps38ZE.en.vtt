00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
so far most the things that that that

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.200 
so far most the things that that that
Ray<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.170> great<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.619> are<00:00:19.859> things<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.400> his

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
Ray was great at are things that are his

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.929 
Ray was great at are things that are his
natural<00:00:21.810> view<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.949> field<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.430> way<00:00:23.519> he<00:00:23.550> has

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
natural view of the field the way he has

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.820 
natural view of the field the way he has
his<00:00:24.210> vision<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.720> field<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.230> second<00:00:25.740> to

his vision of the field was second to
none<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.269> that's<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.869> thing<00:00:28.080> that's

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
none so I think that's one thing that's

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
none so I think that's one thing that's
really<00:00:28.590> big<00:00:28.859> trying<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.340> mock<00:00:29.490> trying<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> not

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
really big trying to mock trying to not

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.630 
really big trying to mock trying to not

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that ray did was he was smooth and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.810 
that ray did was he was smooth and
everything<00:00:34.530> he<00:00:34.620> did<00:00:34.800> whether<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.730> not

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
everything he did whether or not

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
everything he did whether or not
something<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.809> he<00:00:37.140> ran<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.980> right

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
something was right he ran to the right

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.619 
something was right he ran to the right
spot<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> field<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> he<00:00:39.210> found<00:00:39.420> open

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
spot in the field and he found open

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.880 
spot in the field and he found open
grass<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> that's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.440> lot<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.860> our

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
grass and that's a lot of what our

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.190 
grass and that's a lot of what our
office<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.309> about<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.850> that's<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.989> guess

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
office is about so that's a I guess

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
office is about so that's a I guess
that's<00:00:43.410> probably<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> biggest<00:00:44.100> aspect<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.940> i

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that's probably the biggest aspect I i

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.510
