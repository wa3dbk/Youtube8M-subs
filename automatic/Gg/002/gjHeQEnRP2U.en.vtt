 croissants a tomato in small cubes 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.550
 just like a pumpkin in cubes 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.210
 small mushrooms to taste rolled 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.430
 and the seafood are prawns 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.379
 taste here is amounts to your liking 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.600
 we have fish fillet that in 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 this time is a steak just for 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.230
 the taste clean shrimp whether oatmeal 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.850
 and without shell oysters 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.680
 already pre-cooked salt and the touch of oil 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.770
 let's start in a hot pot we're going to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.070
 add a little olive oil there 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.310
 it's more than enough 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.659
 and let's do our bass we're going to 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.160
 give him about one more minute 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.080
 past the necessary time we are going to 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.930
 add our carrot to start 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.180
 soften because of the vegetables that 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.080
 let's get here this is the hardest 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.509
 about a minute is enough 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.509
 and we are going to add our celery 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.520
 already softened a little our vegetables 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.460
 we will add the tomato in Cuba and 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.890
 let's give us two minutes to be 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.229
 start softening a little more two others 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.000
 knock down the flavor and begin to mix 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.679
 the aromas and the flavors and we continue as 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.679
 you can realize our languages â€‹â€‹and 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.509
 is losing shape is the ideal time 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.819
 to add the necessary amount of 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.190
 water for our case that is going to be 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.470
 about half of our pot 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.160
 here what happens is that the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.470
 cooking so the water is cold but 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.170
 they do not rot we are going to make a boil 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.950
 little quicker let's add the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.720
 little touch of salt here let's see 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.060
 the water and up to the temperature that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.750
 we want 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.260
 so we're going to start spicing up 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:44.370
 our broth with these prawns 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.530
 they were presented as tiny lobsters 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.299
 I do not know if they have tried them but here I 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.360
 Meto maybe they can see how to make them 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:57.430
 in tomato sauce and here they will be in broth 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.400
 we introduce the first 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.870
 adding our prawns too 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.239
 it is the moment that we are going to add 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.069
 our octopus although it is already pre 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.860
 cooked you have to give it a touch of 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.910
 softness more to our octopus 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.400
 where are we going to put it together with these 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.770
 prawns and that the reproduction we are going 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.620
 to wait for about 5 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.260
 minutes let's see how it goes 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.440
 people like grabbing little color 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.590
 our prawns and take a color 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.200
 already swimming our body still look 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:34.040
 after these five minutes that you 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:37.159
 let's add our shrimp 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.099
 see how we do not need flavorings 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.989
 artificial everything is going to be natural all 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.989
 humanists will give you the seasoning to 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.150
 our call let's wait for them 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.120
 like 2 to 3 minutes already after the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.989
 necessary time let's see how they are going 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.689
 is grabbing little color see this is a 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.060
 moment in which I will add notice 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.060
 all right 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.470
 the issues 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.230
 and just like that and the pumpkin because 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.470
 we are entering what lasts the cooking 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.260
 of each ingredient and the pumpkin is a 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.900
 little hard not much if that amen but it's 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.500
 the perfect time to add it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.990
 here they are very well we started to move and 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.419
 we are going to give him another three minutes leaves 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.270
 ready I finished it our channel 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.700
 seafood 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.750
 let's see how 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.420
 there goes now yes finally we are going to 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.880
 add 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.730
 fish 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.030
 and the mushrooms because because the 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.680
 fish is very easy to cook 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.890
 delicate and if we put it before and you 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.870
 we give one more cooking is destroyed and 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.910
 the mushrooms are like little sponges 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.370
 to absorb all the flavors that is 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.670
 jumping our seafood 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.600
 and there will be a delicious result 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.370
 let's wait a minute and go to 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.850
 rectify one minute has passed 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.110
 approximately we are going to rectify as 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.420
 to our broth 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.920
 we are going to give a product here this forum 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.630
 site of the teachers that giving me 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.630
 I love I'm going to try it 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.400
 perfect we go to a touch of salt 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.750
 and it 's very good 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.409
 so you can make the flavors and a touch 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.169
 of base or cilantro 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.669
 we cover again 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.189
 and that our broth was finished 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.040
 approximately 3 to 5 minutes more and 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:44.290
 let's see how it is 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.720
 there are the scents that are 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.840
 detaching this stew they do not know and 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.500
 they have to do it boys 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.630
 how do you see the purpose of the prawns 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.940
 the shrimps the mushrooms already 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:02.200
 softened and absorbed the juices 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.139
 How about we have shrimp question 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.050
 the octopus must walk 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.780
 what we are going to do is turn off 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:16.539
 and we have our caldito ready 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:19.180
 seafood we will serve what they 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.479
 It seemed very simple to do in house 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.150
 Seafood charge was fixed that nothing 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.629
 absolutely nothing complicated to do 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.620
 this do questions doubts 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.139
 comments on social media I 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.919
 found on twitter facebook there is 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.530
 crosses leaves dismissal not without first trying 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.710
 like that from caldito these visited from 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:46.970
