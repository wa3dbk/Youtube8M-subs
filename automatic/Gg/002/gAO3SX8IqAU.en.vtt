what we need to do is we really need to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.170 
what we need to do is we really need to
add<00:00:23.900> some<00:00:23.930> specific<00:00:24.800> targeted<00:00:25.310> overload<00:00:25.820> sets

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
add some specific targeted overload sets

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.049 
add some specific targeted overload sets
to<00:00:26.360> what<00:00:26.570> often<00:00:27.050> people<00:00:27.079> train<00:00:27.800> with<00:00:28.610> too<00:00:28.880> many

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
great overload as well that the weight

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.260 
great overload as well that the weight
that<00:00:39.710> they<00:00:39.829> handle<00:00:40.309> is<00:00:40.399> probably<00:00:40.700> too<00:00:40.940> heavy

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.849 
to get really good maximum quality

manual and in the demonstration that

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.819 
manual and in the demonstration that
they<00:00:55.039> would<00:00:55.300> be<00:00:56.300> able<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.629> handle<00:00:56.809> more<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.530> a

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
they would be able to handle more in a

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.069 
they would be able to handle more in a
specific<00:00:58.100> target<00:00:58.550> load<00:00:58.879> overload<00:00:59.510> exercise

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
specific target load overload exercise

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.169 
specific target load overload exercise
and<00:01:00.319> still<00:01:00.710> hit<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:00.920> muscle<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:01.789> a<00:01:01.850> greater

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
and still hit the muscle with a greater

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.660 
and still hit the muscle with a greater
weight<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:02.929> a<00:01:02.960> lot<00:01:03.319> of<00:01:03.350> people<00:01:03.620> train<00:01:04.100> with<00:01:04.640> a

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
weight so a lot of people train with a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.460 
weight so a lot of people train with a
weight<00:01:04.940> that's<00:01:04.970> in<00:01:05.390> between<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:06.260> neither

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
weight that's in between that neither

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.190 
weight that's in between that neither
does<00:01:06.909> overload<00:01:07.909> or<00:01:08.120> includes<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.810> muscle

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
does overload or includes the muscle

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.760 
does overload or includes the muscle
gets<00:01:09.530> them<00:01:09.799> pretty<00:01:10.310> average<00:01:10.490> results<00:01:11.120> and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
gets them pretty average results and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.140 
gets them pretty average results and
they<00:01:12.770> end<00:01:12.950> up<00:01:13.070> spinning<00:01:13.370> their<00:01:13.580> wheels<00:01:13.610> for

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
they end up spinning their wheels for

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.030 
they end up spinning their wheels for
quite<00:01:14.510> some<00:01:14.750> time<00:01:14.780> because<00:01:15.229> it's<00:01:15.770> neither

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
quite some time because it's neither

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.030 
quite some time because it's neither
here<00:01:16.190> nor<00:01:16.400> there<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.060> key<00:01:17.270> again<00:01:17.630> is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
here nor there so the key again is

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.770 
here nor there so the key again is
specificity<00:01:19.040> with<00:01:19.310> our<00:01:19.580> exercises<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.570> the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
specific targeted overload in is to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.840 
specific targeted overload in is to
learn<00:01:32.750> how<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.140> do<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.560> barbell<00:01:34.010> bicep<00:01:34.580> curl

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
learn how to do the barbell bicep curl

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.000 
learn how to do the barbell bicep curl
effectively<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:35.930> turn<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.500> into<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.770> real

strength<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.790> power<00:01:38.090> movement<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.080> you've

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
strength and power movement so you've

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.560 
strength and power movement so you've
got<00:01:39.260> a<00:01:39.620> really<00:01:39.890> rock-solid<00:01:40.570> specific

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
got a really rock-solid specific

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.160 
got a really rock-solid specific
targeted<00:01:42.140> overload<00:01:42.710> base<00:01:43.370> and<00:01:43.730> then<00:01:44.570> we<00:01:45.020> can

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
targeted overload base and then we can

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.870 
targeted overload base and then we can
add<00:01:45.350> some<00:01:45.530> maximum<00:01:45.860> occlusion<00:01:46.430> set<00:01:46.670> with

on occasion to finish it's very
important<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.160> realize<00:01:52.580> that<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.150> biceps<00:01:53.330> are

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
important to realize that the biceps are

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.840 
important to realize that the biceps are

effectively is the squat for your biceps
that's<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.459> major<00:02:10.759> exercise<00:02:11.390> that's<00:02:12.319> going

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
that's the major exercise that's going

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.149 
that's the major exercise that's going
to<00:02:12.680> give<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.519> most<00:02:13.550> growth<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:15.159> strength

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
to give you the most growth and strength

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.729 
to give you the most growth and strength
and<00:02:16.370> power<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.000> then<00:02:17.959> just<00:02:18.200> finish<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.620> off

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
and power and then just finish it off

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.380 
and power and then just finish it off
with<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.980> little<00:02:19.040> bit<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.430> maximum<00:02:19.880> occlusion

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
with a little bit of maximum occlusion

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.360 
with a little bit of maximum occlusion
making<00:02:21.110> sure<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.560> we<00:02:21.650> focus<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
making sure that we focus on the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.190 
making sure that we focus on the
occlusion<00:02:22.880> not<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.510> weight<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:23.990> it's<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
occlusion not the weight so it's the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.550 
occlusion not the weight so it's the
quality<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.980> movement

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
quality of the movement

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.620 
quality of the movement
feeling<00:02:25.980> every<00:02:26.459> fiber<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.150> bicep

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
feeling every fiber of the bicep

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.170 
feeling every fiber of the bicep
throughout<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.590> entire<00:02:28.950> stretch<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.880> then

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
throughout the entire stretch and then

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.510 
throughout the entire stretch and then
the<00:02:30.390> final<00:02:30.630> peak<00:02:31.020> contraction<00:02:31.290> that's<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
the final peak contraction that's the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.730 
the final peak contraction that's the
key
