I'll get to in a little bit but another

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.949 
I'll get to in a little bit but another

way you can do it is by just using

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.580 
way you can do it is by just using
eyeshadow<00:04:21.880> depending<00:04:22.880> on<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.510> color<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.290> your
