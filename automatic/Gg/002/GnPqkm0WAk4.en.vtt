is if you have a development tool

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.670 
is if you have a development tool

installation this driver is not

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
installed correctly so let's see what

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.660

happens<00:02:08.420> when<00:02:08.600> when<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.380> case

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
happens when when this is the case

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.720 
happens when when this is the case
well<00:02:11.120> we<00:02:11.600> open<00:02:12.049> we<00:02:12.350> can<00:02:12.380> open<00:02:12.709> our<00:02:13.070> device

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
well we open we can open our device

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.460 
well we open we can open our device
manager<00:02:14.390> and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
manager and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.630 
manager and
and<00:02:15.760> install<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.810> driver<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.950> simulate<00:02:19.190> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
and install this driver to simulate the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.510 
and install this driver to simulate the
driver<00:02:19.940> not<00:02:20.210> being<00:02:20.450> installed<00:02:20.750> properly<00:02:21.520> okay

driver not being installed properly okay

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.950 
driver not being installed properly okay
so<00:02:23.000> when<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.570> driver<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:24.230> uninstalled<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.960> we

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
so when the driver is uninstalled and we

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.320 
so when the driver is uninstalled and we
click<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.410> device<00:02:27.710> manager<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.460> then
