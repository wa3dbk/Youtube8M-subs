00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.660
 one 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.110
 yes 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 hello very good everyone I'm sp 26 and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.149
 Welcome to this new tutorial 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.430
 so I want to teach how to know 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.800
 when our pc has been turned on when 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.260
 has been turned off and how long have you been 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.090
 on it's up I think it's a 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.710
 pretty simple tutorial and that we 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.320
 It provides a lot of information 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 valuable is this tutorial the truth that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.519
 is designed for those parents 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.170
 those mothers of the neighborhood that 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.470
 they have their children and good 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.420
 find a little bit how long 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.159
 dedicate their child to the computer itself is worth it 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.770
 this tutorial is more thought so that 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.930
 people 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.460
 so saying that we are going to proceed with 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.930
 the tutorial and the first thing we're going to 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.460
 to do will be to go to this page in the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.620
 which download does not always the description 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.670
 of the video and nothing like you can be 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.710
 watching on screen 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.200
 the software is called tour netcom times 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.120
 bill and good as you can see then this one 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 would be the graphical interface obviously the 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.820
 program and nothing simply people 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.670
 we go here and we download it flattered to 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.490
 your fan times view vale there will be download 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.640
 the software and as I always say then the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.920
 Eros 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.960
 all this is valid if you want to translate it to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.180
 Spanish and so on for good to have a 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.119
 little more information about this 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.380
 program is worth as I said then this 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.210
 page will be in the description of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.880
 video so you can go with more 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.850
 ease once here because nothing you give 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.040
 to oad's guide and it would download once 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.440
 downloaded is going to open good you go to 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.050
 download this file a track is worth the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.090
 which you can extract and if you did not want it 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.619
 extract then simply a abrÃ­s and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.659
 well as you can see we have here the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.729
 application and how it is portable because no 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.910
 you need to install it or anything because of that 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.700
 I say that it is not necessary to extract it worth 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.709
 you do not want to 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.420
 a precise moment because it is not necessary 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.879
 extract it then let's double 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.739
 click on it and it automatically starts 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.780
 as obviously exportable, 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.400
 it is necessary to install the argumentation 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.430
 let's make a tad bigger because 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.730
 Here is a little more information 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.430
 and good 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.170
 we are going to circulate in the middle as you can 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.880
 to be seeing gives us information that 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.130
 when the computer has been paid 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.570
 and I wanted to have turned off in this case the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.720
 19 the 12 of 2013 the duration that now 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.490
 has been paid and this is basically the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.740
 information that this software gives us 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.080
 such the processes that we would have or 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.550
 because where the money has been paid from 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.130
 equipment is worth or because it has been paid 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.860
 I would be here in your stand process vale 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.110
 and then it's in sultan time that we have 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.270
 is turned off or has been chosen 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.180
 law in this case because for example this 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.030
 day has failed a system has failed and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.670
 the team has restarted vale we will see 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.590
 good there are different cases in the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.450
 the computer restarts 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.980
 in this more specifically it has 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.590
 restarted by this application that 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.269
 I really do not know which one is 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.560
 and has said that a software of 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.900
 for installation 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.939
 has asked for it to start 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.799
 and then we have here for your for example 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.890
 then another application to period of 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.450
 start in this case the avg antivirus and 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.810
 good as you see, it gives quite 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.400
 information about what after 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.230
 the restarts and the shutdowns of 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.530
 mobile computer also you put the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.840
 duration is worth it because I say that this is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.790
 simply important valuable 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.250
 important for those mothers and fathers 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.230
 that they have in their children because 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.819
 control a little bit how much time is 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 dedicating your child to the computer or to 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.019
 videogames and so on by then you know 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.109
 a little bit the exact time that is 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.700
 your son or daughter with the computer 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.549
 It's worth as you can see in 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.440
 screen appears this little yellow button 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.980
 and that obviously means that I'm 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.849
 right now with the computer on 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.439
 normally I the truth that from the 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.539
 computer on I do not know why it's a 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.539
 very silly mania that I have and should 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.610
 pay for when I leave home but 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.130
 I do not know I do not usually leave on it's a 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.780
 silly and good mania simply also 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.099
 he left it open with skype and various 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.349
 things that are working so 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.880
 basically that's why it's worth it in 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.010
 many times there 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.940
 14 hours are 16 hours what are the 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.790
 won on power 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.440
 but hey that is irrelevant nothing 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.120
 I just hope that this little 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.700
 information that I am giving you in this 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.950
 small software 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.750
 I'm inviting you, it's worth not 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.390
 facilitating but yes that transmitting 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.490
 that exists and how it works so I hope 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.740
 that you like it and nothing 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.720
 we can also simply save all 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.690
 this information is valid as far as notes 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.060
 you do not know we give a day to six save 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.980
 and it 's work already worth it would be saved 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.230
 to leave because obviously we give 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.960
 actions I just close in the 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.550
 closing tab is worth as you see a 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.280
 pretty fast pretty tutorial 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.500
 simple but that does not stop being the most 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.450
 interesting and above all curious 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.000
