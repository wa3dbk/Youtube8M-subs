let's take a look at a group of chords
which<00:00:06.480> are<00:00:06.660> called<00:00:06.899> open<00:00:07.410> position<00:00:07.980> 7th

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
which are called open position 7th

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.030 
which are called open position 7th
chords<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.840> got<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> little<00:00:10.230> more<00:00:10.530> complex

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
chords it's got a little more complex

let's<00:00:59.730> take<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.000> closer<00:01:00.360> look<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> D<00:01:01.170> minor

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.729 
let's take a closer look at the D minor
7<00:01:02.010> chord<00:01:02.239> because<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.570> uses<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.930> technique<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
7 chord because it uses a technique that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.890 
7 chord because it uses a technique that
the<00:01:05.129> other<00:01:05.280> ones<00:01:05.610> don't<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.330> that's<00:01:06.450> called

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the other ones don't and that's called

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.040 
the other ones don't and that's called
barring<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.729> bar<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.690> or<00:01:09.869> more

barring now when you bar two or more
strings<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.340> need<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> form<00:01:12.210> those<00:01:12.420> notes

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
strings you need to form those notes

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170

I'm going to keep that one on because
let's<00:01:59.700> talk<00:01:59.970> once<00:02:00.390> more<00:02:00.690> about<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> bar<00:02:01.760> we

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
let's talk once more about the bar we

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.610 
let's talk once more about the bar we
talked<00:02:03.030> about<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.450> bar<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.660> minute<00:02:04.080> ago<00:02:04.200> but

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
talked about the bar a minute ago but

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.370 
talked about the bar a minute ago but
this<00:02:05.070> time<00:02:05.400> we're<00:02:05.700> using<00:02:05.730> a<00:02:06.150> bar<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:07.020> three

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
this time we're using a bar for three

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.280 
this time we're using a bar for three
strings<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.790> actually<00:02:09.000> use<00:02:09.210> a<00:02:09.360> bar<00:02:09.750> for

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
strings you can actually use a bar for

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.160 
strings you can actually use a bar for
as<00:02:10.440> many<00:02:10.650> as<00:02:11.040> all<00:02:11.460> six<00:02:11.520> strings<00:02:12.210> in<00:02:12.630> some<00:02:12.930> more

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
as many as all six strings in some more

as many as all six strings in some more
complex<00:02:13.830> chords<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:16.290> example<00:02:16.800> we

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
complex chords but in this example we

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.760 
complex chords but in this example we
are<00:02:17.520> using<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.090> bar<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.110> first<00:02:19.350> three

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
are using the bar for the first three

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.670 
are using the bar for the first three
strings<00:02:20.190> for<00:02:20.700> our<00:02:20.820> D<00:02:21.030> major<00:02:21.060> seven<00:02:21.870> chord

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.900 

sometimes<00:02:25.680> when<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.010> move<00:02:26.250> between<00:02:26.460> two

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
sometimes when you move between two

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.480 
sometimes when you move between two
chords<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.570> can<00:02:27.660> figure<00:02:28.050> out<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.320> way<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
chords you can figure out a way for the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.270 
chords you can figure out a way for the
fingers<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.330> move<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.620> smoothest<00:02:32.160> way

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
fingers to move in the smoothest way

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.660 
fingers to move in the smoothest way
these<00:02:33.090> two<00:02:33.480> fingers<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.350> move<00:02:34.740> from<00:02:35.460> one

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
these two fingers just move from one

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.750 
these two fingers just move from one
pair<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.180> strings<00:02:36.540> over<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> different<00:02:38.580> pair

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
pair of strings over to a different pair

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.350 
pair of strings over to a different pair
of<00:02:38.850> strings<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.380> first<00:02:40.800> finger<00:02:41.360> changes

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
of strings and the first finger changes

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.400 
of strings and the first finger changes
from<00:02:42.800> being<00:02:43.800> ready<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.880> be<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.240> its<00:02:45.450> fret<00:02:45.780> to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
from being ready to be on its fret to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.460 
from being ready to be on its fret to
actually<00:02:46.890> being<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.370> its<00:02:47.550> Fred<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.510> C<00:02:48.840> major<00:02:49.080> 7

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
actually being on its Fred so C major 7

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.460 
actually being on its Fred so C major 7
is<00:02:49.740> like<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.270> when<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.360> move<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.600> F<00:02:51.840> major<00:02:52.050> 7

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
is like this when you move to F major 7

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.490 
is like this when you move to F major 7
these<00:02:53.160> two<00:02:53.430> fingers<00:02:53.700> move<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:55.080> finger

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
these two fingers move and this finger

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.430 
these two fingers move and this finger
goes<00:02:55.680> into<00:02:55.980> place<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.730> our<00:02:57.630> movement<00:02:58.110> is<00:02:58.200> very

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
goes into place and our movement is very

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.690 
goes into place and our movement is very
economical<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:01.020> makes<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> transition

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
economical that makes the transition

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.350 
economical that makes the transition
smoother<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.200> cleaner
