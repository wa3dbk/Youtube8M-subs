00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.919
 attention now begins a screen and biology class of high school 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.519
 you will watch appealed to the countless 50 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.449
 good studies 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.480
 neymar 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
 I do not understand anything 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.630
 the girl each one of them 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.569
 kennedy in new york 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:32.530
 country singer 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.110
 or pl 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.559
 abc is an article that says that there are more teens of the new generations 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
 as in accidents than in previous generations 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.980
 sure what the problem 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.820
 In other words, we lose telecourse 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.040
 nature has a large number of beings that even though they belong to the same 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.360
 species has individual differences 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 humans for example may be high 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.070
 have light or dark skin have more or less than a month and there goes signs of 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.749
 heating 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.120
 but I said here 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.400
 many teens and wisdom teeth and do not show up how it can 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.220
 now knowing how the pipoqueiro 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.070
 that species in the world through time 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.550
 So watch for us today. 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.810
 which will deal with the theory of evolution 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.040
 a theory 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.390
 who revolutionized the mood was thinking and of biology the ball will be known to 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.130
 naturalistic priority that lived in the 19th century in the neighborhood 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 different characteristics of the same species of brother you go 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.540
 understand why current selection is the basic principle that underlies the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.470
 dignity even this afternoon beside you will meet an organism one 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.130
 another theory that explains the genetic variability through several mechanisms 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.590
 among them mutagens of genetic recombination 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.050
 it can be said that peace the theory of evolution biology was never again the 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.920
 same 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.060
 the concerns of mankind with explanations about the diversity of 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.280
 species date back to ancient Greece but by the end of the 18th century 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.599
 that the species did not change and that their numbers were 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:21.499
 was with the work of a young naturalist named charles darwin who lives beyond 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:27.829
 technique in 1809 in 1882 that all beliefs changed 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:33.329
 everyone in just 22 years when he boarded the English ship hms 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.329
 beagle began a trip that lasted five years 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.719
 during the journey he collected several specimens of plants and fossils 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.430
 and made observations on the differences that find sick individuals of the same 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.099
 species 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.889
 of determination to travel in 1837 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.489
 convinced that species were changing but how they changed 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.489
 when we see that behind more information 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.240
 davi gomes is studied in detail 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.830
 and concluded that children of domestic 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.730
 chickens is a right way were created by the man we chose undue 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.289
 for crossing 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.079
 but you have to think about the sense of play 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.769
 every 10 animal choices he wants to reproduce not to achieve 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.709
 its purpose that interests economically we insist selection 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:28.619
 artificial 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:33.859
 but when darwin discovered he found that houses notified 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:34.979
 officially 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.249
 How do you ask yourself? 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.729
 the tennis player 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.769
 how the world species 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.769
 still on this issue he went on to study the fossils 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.729
 and then you know that I go with her 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.729
 and I think an explanation in the idea not completely 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.370
 a fossil to any petrified vestige of a server that has already 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:02.949
 inhabited our planet 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:03.999
 a footprint 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.999
 a leaf a piece of bone 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:11.869
 the study of fossils allowed us to reconstruct the morning peak form and 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.869
 even one knows that it produces them organisms of the past 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:19.329
 with the comparison of the fossils of different geological layers 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.640
 darvin concluded 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.509
 that living beings and not changing over time 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.640
 and has some characteristics of extinct animals 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.419
 they kept insisting on current animals 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.249
 and even though the more recent layers have shown easier organisms 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:37.050
 similar to living things 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.580
 in Patagonia in the extreme south of South America found fossils of a 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.889
 risk demonstrator 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.900
 much like a startup 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.140
 very depressed French studies 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.970
 let's draw some conclusions looks that looks like dinosaur footprints 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.839
 the dinosaur was biped the proper pt if asked to stand for footprint 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.719
 right 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:00.460
 no one should start soon 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.460
 He released the 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.909
 I say what it was 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.029
 even more so in the Senate because she 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.330
 the tennis tournament of bishop d 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.419
 It's not possible that I had the teeth of this mother to defend herself. 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.629
 an emerson perception 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.659
 need to observe carefully and raises several assumptions right 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.670
 beyond their knowledge and observations 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.460
 charles darwin has also studied papers published by other 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.059
 time 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:32.629
 in 1838 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.569
 met the theory of malthus 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.870
 population growth 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.000
 Malthus said that the population's reproductive potential in the year 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.559
 infinitely larger than the content until 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.889
 the means of subsistence 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.400
 in thesis a population does not cut shallow obstacles to growth 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.900
 there would be no way for everyone to survive 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.729
 what caught old attention 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.219
 was that Malthus imagined that unity was subject to the same law as the 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.180
 other species 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.559
 populations can grow very rapidly 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.580
 only this happened in practice 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.960
 hence came the idea of ​​the struggle for life philipp lahm animal breeders 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.300
 making artificial selection 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.910
 nature only survived the most attentive individuals for life was 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.670
 the current selection the populations could not grow too much because the environment acted 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.100
 selecting only the most 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.069
 natural selection 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:32.699
 what unit 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.400
 selection back 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.330
 ended up dying of the conditions of use 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.229
 only existing individuals selected by nature 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:42.159
 this is 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.759
 due to variation exist here among individuals of the same species 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.719
 is it possible for some to survive with a change in the environment 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:52.389
 we have to know how to live and leave descendants 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.270
 and the other competitors say mimi 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.560
 the classic example of Dida theory defended from serasa 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.990
 according to the ancestor flashes of the giraffes had shorter neck 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.700
 and that I how has happened the evolution of the population of xira 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.289
 take away the longer neck as it is nowadays
