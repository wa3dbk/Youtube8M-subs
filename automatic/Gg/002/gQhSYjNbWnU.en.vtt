fastest pokemon on this pokemon team and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.130 
fastest pokemon on this pokemon team and
the<00:01:36.700> problem<00:01:37.030> about<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.450> team<00:01:37.750> is<00:01:37.930> it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
the problem about this team is it's

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.260 
the problem about this team is it's
really<00:01:38.500> really<00:01:38.920> slow<00:01:39.220> i<00:01:39.250> mean<00:01:39.610> my<00:01:39.880> fastest

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
really really slow i mean my fastest

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.870 
really really slow i mean my fastest
pokemon<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:41.259> actually<00:01:41.740> my<00:01:41.920> lead<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:42.369> that's<00:01:42.670> a

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
pokemon is actually my lead and that's a

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.420 
pokemon is actually my lead and that's a
base<00:01:43.180> 80<00:01:43.479> timid<00:01:44.049> nature<00:01:44.079> so<00:01:44.649> none<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.250> my

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
base 80 timid nature so none of my

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.749 
base 80 timid nature so none of my
pokemon<00:01:45.909> actually<00:01:46.329> actually<00:01:46.689> reach<00:01:47.470> over<00:01:48.310> 300

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
pokemon actually actually reach over 300

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.209 
pokemon actually actually reach over 300
speed<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.329> that<00:01:49.570> might<00:01:50.110> might<00:01:50.560> mean<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.040> long

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
speed so that might might mean the long

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.700 
speed so that might might mean the long
run<00:01:51.460> because<00:01:51.700> um<00:01:52.240> with<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.110> lack<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.320> speed

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
run because um with the lack of speed

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.709 
run because um with the lack of speed
any<00:01:54.009> choice<00:01:54.369> Pokemon<00:01:54.880> can<00:01:55.030> pretty<00:01:55.240> much<00:01:55.360> tear

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
any choice Pokemon can pretty much tear

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.260 
any choice Pokemon can pretty much tear
through<00:01:55.899> my<00:01:56.020> team<00:01:56.320> but<00:01:57.159> um<00:01:57.369> he<00:01:57.850> goes<00:01:58.000> into<00:01:58.180> a

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
through my team but um he goes into a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.969 
through my team but um he goes into a
slow<00:01:58.540> King<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:58.930> that's<00:01:59.049> no<00:01:59.290> problem<00:01:59.590> because

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
slow King and that's no problem because

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.999 
slow King and that's no problem because
i<00:02:00.790> have<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.180> skuntank<00:02:01.689> and<00:02:01.960> skuntank<00:02:02.469> is<00:02:02.710> pretty

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
i have a skuntank and skuntank is pretty

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.219 
i have a skuntank and skuntank is pretty
much<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.219> best<00:02:03.520> counter<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.570> slowking<00:02:05.079> see

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
much the best counter to slowking see

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.010 
much the best counter to slowking see
available<00:02:05.829> in<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.340> end<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.579> tier<00:02:06.880> because<00:02:07.630> it

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
available in the end you tier because it

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.560 
available in the end you tier because it
does<00:02:08.619> carry<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.009> pursuit<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.580> pursuit<00:02:10.420> is

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
does carry the pursuit and pursuit is

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.960 
does carry the pursuit and pursuit is
super<00:02:10.869> effective<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.980> pretty<00:02:12.160> much<00:02:12.250> traps

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
super effective and it pretty much traps

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.360 
super effective and it pretty much traps
the<00:02:13.150> slow<00:02:13.390> king<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:13.870> forces<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.380> die<00:02:14.620> but

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
the slow king and forces it to die but

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.210 
the slow king and forces it to die but
unfortunately<00:02:15.520> on

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
unfortunately on

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.160 
unfortunately on
I<00:02:17.310> actually<00:02:17.730> went<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.480> pursuit<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.080> he

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
I actually went for the pursuit and he

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.930 
I actually went for the pursuit and he
stayed<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.800> that's<00:02:19.890> not<00:02:20.130> quite<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.760> hit

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
stayed in and that's not quite a to hit

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.810 
stayed in and that's not quite a to hit
KO<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:21.960> really<00:02:22.170> sucked<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.980> don't

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
KO so that really sucked but I don't

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.090 
KO so that really sucked but I don't
know<00:02:23.880> what<00:02:24.030> he<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.210> doing<00:02:24.270> he<00:02:24.660> went<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:25.020> the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
know what he was doing he went for the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.220 
know what he was doing he went for the
psychic<00:02:26.100> against<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.490> skuntank<00:02:26.970> maybe<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
psychic against a skuntank maybe a

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.470 
psychic against a skuntank maybe a
misclick<00:02:29.100> but<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.430> am<00:02:29.670> able<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.090> take<00:02:30.270> down<00:02:30.420> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
misclick but I am able to take down that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.140 
misclick but I am able to take down that
slow<00:02:30.900> king<00:02:31.140> with<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.320> crunch<00:02:31.820> now<00:02:32.820> he<00:02:32.940> goes<00:02:33.090> into

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
slow king with a crunch now he goes into

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.750 
slow king with a crunch now he goes into
a<00:02:33.360> typhlosion<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.460> I'm<00:02:35.460> just<00:02:35.520> gonna

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
a typhlosion here and I'm just gonna

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.030 
a typhlosion here and I'm just gonna
leave<00:02:36.000> my<00:02:36.300> skuntank<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.560> death<00:02:37.770> father

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
leave my skuntank here as death father

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.830 
leave my skuntank here as death father
because<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.670> don't<00:02:39.300> really<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.540> anything

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
because I don't really have anything

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.610 
because I don't really have anything
that<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.140> take<00:02:40.470> an<00:02:40.650> eruption<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.580> want<00:02:41.850> um

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
that can take an eruption and I want um

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.560 
that can take an eruption and I want um
bring<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.770> typhlosion<00:02:44.340> down<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.360> point

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
bring this typhlosion down to the point

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.180 
bring this typhlosion down to the point
where<00:02:45.840> eruption<00:02:46.380> doesn't<00:02:46.680> do<00:02:46.770> much<00:02:46.920> damage

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
where eruption doesn't do much damage

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.580 
where eruption doesn't do much damage
and<00:02:47.720> that's<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:48.840> nice<00:02:49.050> because<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.440> does

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and that's really nice because that does

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.910 
and that's really nice because that does
a<00:02:49.620> lot<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.310> damage<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.910> typhlosion<00:02:51.600> and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
a lot of damage to this typhlosion and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.090 
a lot of damage to this typhlosion and
um<00:02:52.920> yeah<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> do<00:02:54.390> have<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:55.020> poliwrath<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
um yeah so I do have a poliwrath and

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.250 
um yeah so I do have a poliwrath and
poliwrath<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.820> pretty<00:02:57.030> good<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:57.900> not<00:02:58.110> gonna

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
poliwrath is pretty good I'm not gonna

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.590 
poliwrath is pretty good I'm not gonna
go<00:02:58.709> for<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> sub<00:02:59.280> immediately<00:02:59.970> because<00:03:00.570> I

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
go for the sub immediately because I

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.150 
go for the sub immediately because I
haven't<00:03:00.959> seen<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.200> full<00:03:01.410> team<00:03:01.620> yet<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.860> want

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
haven't seen this full team yet I want

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.540 
haven't seen this full team yet I want
to<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.459> what<00:03:02.700> he<00:03:02.820> carries<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.680> went<00:03:05.310> for

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
to see what he carries and I went for

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.090 
to see what he carries and I went for
the<00:03:05.670> waterfall<00:03:06.090> here<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:07.050> straight<00:03:07.620> away<00:03:07.830> um

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the waterfall here just straight away um

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.220 
the waterfall here just straight away um
that<00:03:08.790> wasn't<00:03:09.000> really<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.360> great<00:03:09.690> move<00:03:09.959> in<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
that wasn't really a great move in the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.949 
that wasn't really a great move in the
long<00:03:10.440> run<00:03:10.470> um<00:03:11.180> sub<00:03:12.180> actually<00:03:12.690> would<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:12.870> been

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
long run um sub actually would have been

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.480 
long run um sub actually would have been
better<00:03:13.140> focused<00:03:13.680> punch<00:03:13.890> would<00:03:14.250> have<00:03:14.370> done

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
better focused punch would have done

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.660 
better focused punch would have done
more<00:03:14.670> damage<00:03:14.880> but<00:03:15.300> um<00:03:15.450> um<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:17.130> victory<00:03:17.490> bell

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
more damage but um um the victory bell

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.670 
more damage but um um the victory bell
isn't<00:03:18.030> really<00:03:18.300> too<00:03:18.660> big<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.990> deal<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.470> a

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
isn't really too big of a deal it is a

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.500 
isn't really too big of a deal it is a
threat<00:03:20.160> after<00:03:20.310> he<00:03:20.520> gets<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.760> sword<00:03:21.030> stance<00:03:21.330> up

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
threat after he gets a sword stance up

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.080 
threat after he gets a sword stance up
but<00:03:21.840> hopefully<00:03:22.410> my<00:03:22.590> poor<00:03:23.070> gun<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> kanab<00:03:23.730> speed

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
but hopefully my poor gun to kanab speed

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.199 
but hopefully my poor gun to kanab speed
because<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.840> carry<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:26.000> 216<00:03:27.000> speed<00:03:27.390> v's<00:03:27.720> and

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
because I carry like 216 speed v's and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.540 
because I carry like 216 speed v's and
fortunately<00:03:30.209> for<00:03:30.540> me<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:30.980> out<00:03:31.980> speed<00:03:32.340> this

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
fortunately for me I do out speed this

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.250 
fortunately for me I do out speed this
victory<00:03:33.060> bell<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.420> if<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.540> didn't<00:03:33.840> add<00:03:33.959> speed

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
victory bell and if I didn't add speed

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.670 
victory bell and if I didn't add speed
that<00:03:34.920> would<00:03:35.100> have<00:03:35.190> been<00:03:35.220> really<00:03:35.340> bad<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.680> he

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
that would have been really bad and he

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.080 
that would have been really bad and he
probably<00:03:37.890> could<00:03:38.160> have<00:03:38.190> sweetened<00:03:38.610> my<00:03:38.760> team

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
probably could have sweetened my team

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.050 
probably could have sweetened my team
but<00:03:39.360> um<00:03:39.570> yeah<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:41.130> am<00:03:41.430> it'll<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> take<00:03:41.910> down

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
but um yeah so I am it'll to take down

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.310 
but um yeah so I am it'll to take down
the<00:03:42.209> victory<00:03:42.480> bell<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.810> that's<00:03:42.930> really<00:03:43.170> nice

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
the victory bell and that's really nice

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.440 
the victory bell and that's really nice
and<00:03:43.620> now<00:03:43.769> he<00:03:43.890> goes<00:03:44.010> into<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.370> typhlosion<00:03:45.239> again

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
and now he goes into a typhlosion again

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.380 
and now he goes into a typhlosion again
and<00:03:45.660> i'm<00:03:46.440> almost<00:03:46.709> certain<00:03:47.100> i<00:03:47.370> can<00:03:47.549> live<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:48.000> arm

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
and i'm almost certain i can live a arm

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.229 
and i'm almost certain i can live a arm

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
go for the agility and for some reason

he<00:03:54.120> goes<00:03:54.299> for<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.750> eruption<00:03:55.290> this<00:03:55.560> time<00:03:55.830> which

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
he goes for the eruption this time which

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.250 
he goes for the eruption this time which
is<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:57.540> pretty<00:03:58.440> bad<00:03:58.680> play<00:03:59.250> because<00:03:59.730> um<00:04:00.260> that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
is a pretty bad play because um that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.509 
is a pretty bad play because um that
didn't<00:04:01.500> do<00:04:01.560> much<00:04:01.709> damage<00:04:01.920> at<00:04:02.190> all<00:04:02.220> because

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
didn't do much damage at all because

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.539 
didn't do much damage at all because
he's<00:04:02.760> at<00:04:02.970> such<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.480> low<00:04:03.750> health<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.470> I'm<00:04:05.400> just

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
he's at such a low health and I'm just

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.190 
he's at such a low health and I'm just
gonna<00:04:05.700> go<00:04:05.790> for<00:04:05.910> some<00:04:06.299> charge<00:04:06.570> beans<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.049> get

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
gonna go for some charge beans to get

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.979 
gonna go for some charge beans to get
some<00:04:07.410> special<00:04:07.680> tak<00:04:08.040> boosts<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.989> actually

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
some special tak boosts and actually

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.900 
some special tak boosts and actually
nice<00:04:10.170> because<00:04:10.200> i<00:04:10.560> think<00:04:10.620> i'm<00:04:10.980> at<00:04:11.160> plus-2<00:04:11.610> right

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
nice because i think i'm at plus-2 right

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.610 
nice because i think i'm at plus-2 right
now<00:04:12.060> because<00:04:12.269> I<00:04:12.360> got<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.540> boost<00:04:13.049> from<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.440> last

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
now because I got a boost from the last

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.340 
now because I got a boost from the last
one<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.070> unfortunately<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:15.480> don't<00:04:15.630> get<00:04:16.049> this

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
one and unfortunately I don't get this

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.190 
one and unfortunately I don't get this
one<00:04:16.620> which<00:04:16.830> um<00:04:17.040> isn't<00:04:18.000> too<00:04:18.239> big<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.750> deal<00:04:18.930> but

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
one which um isn't too big of a deal but

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.780 
one which um isn't too big of a deal but
um<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.620> kind<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.919> sucks<00:04:20.160> because<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.489> kind<00:04:20.729> of

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
um it kind of sucks because I kind of

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.190 
um it kind of sucks because I kind of
wanted<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.470> get<00:04:22.470> more<00:04:22.770> on<00:04:23.010> boosts<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.200> charge

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
wanted to get more on boosts and charge

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.430 
wanted to get more on boosts and charge
beam<00:04:25.440> what<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.099> does<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.550> on

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
beam what it does is on

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.200 
beam what it does is on
it<00:04:27.620> has<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.800> seventy<00:04:28.250> percent<00:04:28.430> chance<00:04:28.880> of

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
it has a seventy percent chance of

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.140 
it has a seventy percent chance of
getting<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.290> boost<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:31.400> didn't<00:04:31.940> get<00:04:32.030> the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
getting the boost but I didn't get the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.660 
getting the boost but I didn't get the
boost<00:04:32.330> again<00:04:32.780> which<00:04:32.990> really<00:04:33.320> sucks<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.920> after

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
boost again which really sucks and after

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.640 
boost again which really sucks and after
the<00:04:34.850> pain<00:04:35.060> split<00:04:35.390> he's<00:04:35.930> gonna<00:04:36.140> bring<00:04:36.440> me<00:04:36.620> down

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
the pain split he's gonna bring me down

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.450 
the pain split he's gonna bring me down
to<00:04:37.070> under<00:04:37.910> 100<00:04:38.600> HP<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.230> a<00:04:39.260> seismic<00:04:39.830> toss<00:04:40.040> would

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
to under 100 HP so a seismic toss would

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.460 
to under 100 HP so a seismic toss would
be<00:04:40.580> able<00:04:40.700> to<00:04:40.790> take<00:04:40.940> me<00:04:41.150> down<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:41.960> I'm<00:04:42.110> forced<00:04:42.380> to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
be able to take me down so I'm forced to

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.550 
be able to take me down so I'm forced to
go<00:04:42.650> for<00:04:43.070> my<00:04:43.310> strongest<00:04:43.700> attack<00:04:44.260> which<00:04:45.260> is<00:04:45.380> ice

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
go for my strongest attack which is ice

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.830 
go for my strongest attack which is ice
beam<00:04:45.800> since<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.370> do<00:04:46.430> carry<00:04:46.850> tritek<00:04:47.360> but<00:04:47.630> um

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
beam since I do carry tritek but um

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.450 
beam since I do carry tritek but um
that's<00:04:48.380> not<00:04:48.470> going<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.770> hit<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:48.920> ghost<00:04:49.220> and
