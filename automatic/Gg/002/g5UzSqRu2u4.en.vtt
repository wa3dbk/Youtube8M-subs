00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.480
 mayor 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.480
 then behind us then block the words of claude puel 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.809
 in my opinion these two cars 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.079
 quite won 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:11.789
 the word is evil 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.070
 it's a seafood risotto 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.970
 when we talk about him to water network while several varieties 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.320
 it's important for kosovo because we do it when we see the price 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.759
 that both countries 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.149
 to get the device this attack carries the gap has gone to 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:26.579
 side of your nickname 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.829
 surprise 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.829
 to start with they did it 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.760
 to complicate things 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.830
 all categories of the cockpit obama is back on the canvas we're going 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.160
 cut the vegetables also contact to tel tobback 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.300
 we knew it was 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 egypt 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.230
 in this sense 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.900
 in the race 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.180
 in fact the same thing 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.180
 we will start with the Planet of the Apes 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.250
 we will try to stay in touch 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 finally there is the face waiting outside the three provinces 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 to hope to maintain 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 for example 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 the first steps need recoil it just takes a little warm 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.020
 good especially 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.820
 so we're going to eliminate the June surplus that's what we're looking for 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.980
 is going to look at the dry food 13 speaking bars cooking rice and 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.500
 to lifeguards 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.200
 so we add laughter 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.600
 1 cars then must we obey the orders of lobbies other place 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.260
 so we can not blow up especially do not they color 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.320
 hybrid car comes over thirty suicides that bred in captivity 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.550
 everything starts to change 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 we will be able to add the white wine 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.170
 simply wait for the white wine to be saved by the gong 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.200
 a serious look at 18 20 minutes of work 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.430
 you will be able to opt for a dividend paid by the problem 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.909
 step by step 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.909
 so a little bit of a nose 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.279
 but we're pretty sure 17 minutes on the pack k sending we went when 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.379
 even those who understood that they are cooked but jean-stone maker 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.099
 and we estimate bruno jumper with the rice starch so except that the 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.439
 very very believable hair 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.210
 added vegetables 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.399
 and the primaries 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.429
 no further 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.029
 I then five games a little stress 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.029
 if you took the oath of m 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.819
 the dukes of angers 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.809
 bead of pearls 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.040
 the court is for the moment its own text and music in the ear we have 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.589
 well rolled he dies 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.869
 I leave 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:15.389
