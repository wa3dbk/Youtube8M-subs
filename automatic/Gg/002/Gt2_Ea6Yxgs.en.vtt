00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.709 
ignition and there's one that says
accessory<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.619> there's<00:01:58.619> two<00:01:59.189> wires<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.719> I'm

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
accessory and there's two wires here I'm

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
accessory and there's two wires here I'm
just<00:02:01.079> not<00:02:01.290> sure<00:02:01.320> where<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.159> hook<00:02:02.340> them<00:02:02.549> both<00:02:02.729> up

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
just not sure where to hook them both up

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.800 
just not sure where to hook them both up
to<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:05.820> splice<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.329> into<00:02:06.600> something

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
to if I could splice them into something

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719 
to if I could splice them into something
else<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.500> temperature<00:02:07.979> gauge<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
else like the temperature gauge or the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.059 
else like the temperature gauge or the
oil<00:02:09.000> pressure<00:02:09.360> line<00:02:09.690> which<00:02:10.379> I'm<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.709> sure<00:02:10.950> of

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
oil pressure line which I'm not sure of

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.780 
oil pressure line which I'm not sure of
where<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.459> would<00:02:11.580> be

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
where it would be

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.259 
where it would be
but<00:02:13.469> it<00:02:14.469> would<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:14.769> nice<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.010> hook<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:15.969> up<00:02:16.060> to

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
but it would be nice to hook it up to

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.970 
but it would be nice to hook it up to
the<00:02:16.390> key<00:02:16.659> if<00:02:16.930> not<00:02:17.140> I'll<00:02:17.379> hook<00:02:17.469> it<00:02:17.590> up<00:02:17.680> somewhere

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the key if not I'll hook it up somewhere

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.589 
the key if not I'll hook it up somewhere
else<00:02:18.040> because<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.489> have<00:02:18.730> heard<00:02:18.969> people<00:02:19.209> tell<00:02:19.569> me

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
else because I have heard people tell me

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.569 
else because I have heard people tell me
that<00:02:19.959> it's<00:02:20.530> better<00:02:20.769> not<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> hook<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.400> up<00:02:21.489> to

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
that it's better not to hook it up to

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.240 
that it's better not to hook it up to
the<00:02:21.670> key<00:02:21.849> because<00:02:22.120> if<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.329> leave<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.689> key<00:02:22.870> on

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
the key because if you leave the key on

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.849 
the key because if you leave the key on
then<00:02:24.250> you're<00:02:24.430> accumulating<00:02:24.700> hours<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.859> maybe

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
then you're accumulating hours and maybe

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:27.929 
then you're accumulating hours and maybe
it'd<00:02:27.040> be<00:02:27.159> better<00:02:27.340> just<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.609> hook<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.879> up

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
it'd be better just to hook it up

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.250 
it'd be better just to hook it up
somewhere<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.269> that<00:02:28.480> when<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.689> engine<00:02:29.170> is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
somewhere so that when the engine is

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.589 
somewhere so that when the engine is
running<00:02:29.519> ours<00:02:30.519> will<00:02:30.700> click<00:02:30.909> over<00:02:31.209> just<00:02:31.480> in

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
running ours will click over just in

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.179 
running ours will click over just in
case<00:02:31.750> someone<00:02:32.049> were<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.290> leave<00:02:32.439> the<00:02:32.590> key<00:02:32.769> on<00:02:32.980> on

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
case someone were to leave the key on on

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.789 
case someone were to leave the key on on
this<00:02:33.370> thing<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:34.569> like<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.930> said<00:02:35.170> again<00:02:35.290> I've<00:02:35.620> got

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
this thing so like I said again I've got

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.979 
this thing so like I said again I've got
a<00:02:36.010> yellow<00:02:36.220> black<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.239> yellow<00:02:37.420> white<00:02:37.780> or

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
a yellow black and a yellow white or

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.099 
a yellow black and a yellow white or
black<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.739> white<00:02:39.489> wire<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:40.659> both<00:02:40.870> tie

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
black and a white wire and they both tie

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.599 
black and a white wire and they both tie
into<00:02:41.379> these<00:02:41.500> red<00:02:41.709> ones<00:02:41.889> because<00:02:42.340> they<00:02:42.459> weren't

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
into these red ones because they weren't

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.399 
into these red ones because they weren't
long<00:02:42.819> enough<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.150> reach<00:02:43.299> over<00:02:43.480> here<00:02:43.599> and<00:02:43.810> I'm

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
long enough to reach over here and I'm

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.520 
long enough to reach over here and I'm
just<00:02:44.560> not<00:02:44.709> sure<00:02:44.769> where<00:02:45.609> they<00:02:45.760> plug<00:02:46.030> into<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:46.810> if

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
just not sure where they plug into so if

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.990 
just not sure where they plug into so if
any<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:47.829> know<00:02:48.069> where<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.340> can<00:02:48.609> hook<00:02:48.760> these

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
any of you know where I can hook these

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.629 
any of you know where I can hook these
into<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:50.530> let<00:02:50.709> me<00:02:50.829> know<00:02:50.980> comment<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.579> the

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639

video or message me just telling me
which<00:02:54.819> wire<00:02:55.209> goes<00:02:55.269> where<00:02:55.629> cuz<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:56.049> don't<00:02:56.109> think

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
which wire goes where cuz I don't think

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.629 
which wire goes where cuz I don't think
there's<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.769> ground<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.250> them<00:02:57.340> because<00:02:57.489> when<00:02:57.579> I

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
there's a ground on them because when I

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.699 
there's a ground on them because when I
look<00:02:57.819> on<00:02:57.970> my<00:02:58.000> lawnmower<00:02:58.299> they're<00:02:59.109> both<00:02:59.379> going

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
look on my lawnmower they're both going

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.319 
look on my lawnmower they're both going
into<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.069> key<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:00.669> don't<00:03:00.879> know<00:03:00.970> where<00:03:01.150> at

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
into the key I just don't know where at

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.149 
into the key I just don't know where at
because<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.629> is<00:03:01.780> setup<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.319> tractor<00:03:02.739> setup

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
because this is setup this tractor setup

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.149 
because this is setup this tractor setup
