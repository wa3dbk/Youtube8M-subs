was a year and a couple months ago and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.310 
was a year and a couple months ago and
obviously<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.330> more<00:01:34.479> subscribers<00:01:34.900> you<00:01:35.110> have

obviously the more subscribers you have

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.070 
obviously the more subscribers you have
the<00:01:35.680> faster<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.220> grow<00:01:36.610> on<00:01:36.940> youtube<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.049> i

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
the faster you grow on youtube so i

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.830 
the faster you grow on youtube so i
believe<00:01:38.409> carnage<00:01:38.860> will<00:01:39.100> be<00:01:39.280> at<00:01:39.520> we<00:01:40.299> think<00:01:40.630> if

that<00:02:02.560> I'm<00:02:02.650> sure<00:02:02.830> Apollo<00:02:03.130> would<00:02:03.280> figure<00:02:03.490> out

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
that I'm sure Apollo would figure out

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.789 
that I'm sure Apollo would figure out
what<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.000> deal<00:02:04.210> from<00:02:04.810> there<00:02:04.990> but<00:02:05.140> ok<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.439> say

for<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> milestone<00:02:45.810> video<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.860> carnage<00:02:47.370> with

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
for a milestone video on carnage with

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.339 
for a milestone video on carnage with
Apollo<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.330> maybe<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.630> couple<00:02:48.870> other<00:02:49.050> people

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
Apollo and maybe a couple other people

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.199 
Apollo and maybe a couple other people
from<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> who<00:02:49.769> would<00:02:49.890> be<00:02:50.010> down<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.400> do<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
from it who would be down to do it and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.180 
from it who would be down to do it and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
obviously have the money to you know

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.979 
obviously have the money to you know
skydive<00:02:53.910> because<00:02:54.300> I'm<00:02:54.420> sure<00:02:54.599> it's<00:02:54.780> kind<00:02:54.930> of

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
skydive because I'm sure it's kind of

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.390 
skydive because I'm sure it's kind of
expensive<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.590> skydive<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:55.980> we'd<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.250> to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
expensive to skydive and we'd have to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.100 
expensive to skydive and we'd have to
figure<00:02:56.550> out<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.730> place<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.209> everything<00:02:57.420> but

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
figure out a place and everything but

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.570 
figure out a place and everything but
would<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.290> be<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> video<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.549> guys

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
would that be a video that you guys

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.130 
would that be a video that you guys
would<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.090> interested<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.660> seeing<00:03:00.870> because

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140
