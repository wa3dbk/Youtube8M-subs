protein<00:00:14.790> skimmer<00:00:15.089> my<00:00:15.780> first<00:00:16.049> impressions<00:00:16.619> of

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
protein skimmer my first impressions of

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.429 
protein skimmer my first impressions of
it<00:00:16.949> I've<00:00:17.460> had<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> system<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
it I've had it in the system for about a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.380 
it I've had it in the system for about a
little<00:00:19.680> over<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.920> month<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:20.850> very<00:00:21.119> very

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
little over a month and I'm very very

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.810 
little over a month and I'm very very
happy<00:00:21.810> with<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.619> performing<00:00:23.369> most

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
happy with it it's performing most

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.529 
happy with it it's performing most
excellently<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.890> I<00:00:25.890> couldn't<00:00:26.670> say<00:00:26.939> enough

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
excellently and I couldn't say enough

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.349 
excellently and I couldn't say enough
good<00:00:27.689> things<00:00:27.750> about<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:29.000> upgrade<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
good things about it I upgrade it to the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.380 
good things about it I upgrade it to the
vertex<00:00:30.779> 150<00:00:31.349> from<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> reef<00:00:32.160> octopus<00:00:32.790> 1/10

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
vertex 150 from the reef octopus 1/10

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.030 
vertex 150 from the reef octopus 1/10
skimmer<00:00:33.690> which<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.110> also<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.530> very<00:00:34.829> good

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
skimmer which is also a very good

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.430 
skimmer which is also a very good
skimmer<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.910> reason<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.360> upgraded<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.050> because

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
skimmer the reason I upgraded is because

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.459 
skimmer the reason I upgraded is because
the<00:00:37.860> vertex<00:00:38.460> handles<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.360> water<00:00:39.719> volume<00:00:40.230> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the vertex handles more water volume and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340 
the vertex handles more water volume and
it's<00:00:40.920> more<00:00:41.190> powerful<00:00:41.370> than<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.149> reef<00:00:42.780> octopus

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it's more powerful than the reef octopus

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
it's more powerful than the reef octopus
110<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:45.030> four<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.390> five<00:00:45.600> days

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
110 this is about four or five days

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
110 this is about four or five days
worth<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> skin<00:00:46.500> mate<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> collection

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
worth the skin mate and the collection

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.580 
worth the skin mate and the collection
cup<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.789> purposely<00:00:48.300> left<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
cup I purposely left that in there so

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340 
cup I purposely left that in there so
that<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.600> video<00:00:51.960> but

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that you can see it on this video but

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
that you can see it on this video but
it's<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.800> dark<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> bunch<00:00:54.030> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it's really dark and it's got a bunch of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's really dark and it's got a bunch of
little<00:00:54.390> chunks<00:00:54.719> floating<00:00:54.899> around<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.410> there

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
little chunks floating around in there

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
little chunks floating around in there
from<00:00:55.710> stuff<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.309> pulling<00:00:56.670> out<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
from stuff that it's pulling out of the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.049 
from stuff that it's pulling out of the
water<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> first<00:00:59.129> stage<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.579> my<00:00:59.640> Ruby

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
water it's in the first stage of my Ruby

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.450 
water it's in the first stage of my Ruby
36<00:01:00.629> sump<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.340> about

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
36 sump and you can see that it's about

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.840 
36 sump and you can see that it's about
seven<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.030> half<00:01:03.059> inches<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.949> water<00:01:05.250> depth

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
seven and a half inches and water depth

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
seven and a half inches and water depth
I<00:01:05.880> had<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.570> acrylic<00:01:06.990> stand<00:01:07.439> made<00:01:07.710> because

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
I had this acrylic stand made because

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.590 
I had this acrylic stand made because
the<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.430> Crete<00:01:08.670> wasn't<00:01:09.030> working<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.540> me

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the in Crete wasn't working out for me

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
the in Crete wasn't working out for me
it<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.110> too<00:01:10.290> flimsy<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.600> skimmer

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it was just too flimsy and the skimmer

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.050 
it was just too flimsy and the skimmer
was<00:01:12.810> tilting<00:01:13.229> left<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> right<00:01:13.770> very<00:01:14.310> easily<00:01:14.580> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
was tilting left to right very easily so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.080 
was tilting left to right very easily so
I<00:01:15.090> had<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.509> made<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:16.650> local<00:01:16.860> plastics<00:01:17.549> shop

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
I had that made my local plastics shop

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.530 
I had that made my local plastics shop
and<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.930> working<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.409> very<00:01:19.470> very<00:01:19.950> nicely

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
and it's working out very very nicely

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.070 
and it's working out very very nicely
you<00:01:21.540> could<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.930> how<00:01:22.049> open<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.680> valve<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.130> here

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
you could see how open the valve is here

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
you could see how open the valve is here
and<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.200> where<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.790> where<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and that's where I like it and where I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.319 
and that's where I like it and where I
found<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.840> perform<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> best

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
found it to perform the best

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.880 
found it to perform the best
the<00:01:30.329> only<00:01:30.479> issue<00:01:30.689> I'm<00:01:30.900> having<00:01:30.930> has<00:01:31.439> nothing

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the only issue I'm having has nothing

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
the only issue I'm having has nothing
really<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> skimmer<00:01:33.180> itself<00:01:33.630> but

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
really to do with the skimmer itself but

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.780 
really to do with the skimmer itself but
I'm<00:01:34.110> getting<00:01:34.500> light<00:01:34.770> spillage<00:01:35.220> from<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
I'm getting light spillage from the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.390 
I'm getting light spillage from the
refugium<00:01:36.720> light<00:01:37.020> into<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> first<00:01:38.159> chamber

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
refugium light into the first chamber

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.120 
refugium light into the first chamber
here<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.090> causing<00:01:39.479> some<00:01:39.509> algae<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.259> grow

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
here and it's causing some algae to grow

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.149 
here and it's causing some algae to grow
inside<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.820> skimmer<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
inside the skimmer and so I'm have to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.190 
inside the skimmer and so I'm have to
fix<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.490> situation<00:01:44.970> otherwise<00:01:45.930> I'll<00:01:46.110> be

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
fix that situation otherwise I'll be

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.719 
fix that situation otherwise I'll be
cleaning<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.619> skimmer<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.250> often<00:01:47.549> than

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
cleaning the skimmer out more often than

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.210 
cleaning the skimmer out more often than
I<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.630> order<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.020> clean<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> there's<00:01:50.009> some

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
I like in order to clean it there's some

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
I like in order to clean it there's some
titanium<00:01:50.909> screws<00:01:51.240> down<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> bottom<00:01:52.020> that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
titanium screws down at the bottom that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.240 
titanium screws down at the bottom that
can<00:01:52.619> easily<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:53.040> removed<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.360> just

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
can easily be removed and then you just

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.440 
can easily be removed and then you just
disassembled<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> skimmer<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.329> in

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
disassembled the skimmer and get in

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510 
disassembled the skimmer and get in
there<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.659> clean<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.159> very<00:01:59.310> happy

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

there and clean it but I'm very happy
with<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.210> can't<00:02:00.570> say<00:02:00.780> enough<00:02:01.259> good<00:02:01.439> things

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
with it I can't say enough good things

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.920 
with it I can't say enough good things
about<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:03.090> said<00:02:03.299> I've<00:02:03.479> had<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> for

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
about it like I said I've had it for

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.469 
about it like I said I've had it for
about<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.710> over<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.219> month<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
about a little over a month the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.080 
about a little over a month the
instructions<00:02:07.320> call<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.920> 24<00:02:08.429> hour<00:02:08.550> break-in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
instructions call for a 24 hour break-in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.390 
instructions call for a 24 hour break-in
period<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> collection<00:02:10.170> cup<00:02:10.319> removed

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
period with the collection cup removed

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.720 
period with the collection cup removed
and<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:12.060> pipe<00:02:12.480> fully<00:02:12.959> opened<00:02:13.440> here<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.700> I

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and the pipe fully opened here but I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.850 
and the pipe fully opened here but I
found<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.209> that's<00:02:15.629> not<00:02:15.870> true<00:02:16.110> at<00:02:16.230> all<00:02:16.349> it

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
found that that's not true at all it

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.250 
found that that's not true at all it
actually<00:02:16.980> took<00:02:17.310> about<00:02:17.370> two<00:02:17.819> weeks<00:02:18.049> for<00:02:19.049> this

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
actually took about two weeks for this

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.250 
actually took about two weeks for this
thing<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.620> finally<00:02:19.950> calm<00:02:20.250> itself<00:02:20.670> down<00:02:21.260> during

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
thing to finally calm itself down during

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.589 
thing to finally calm itself down during
those<00:02:22.409> two<00:02:22.650> week<00:02:22.830> period<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.250> would<00:02:23.700> have<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
those two week period I would have the

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.320 
those two week period I would have the
skin<00:02:24.900> mate<00:02:25.049> either<00:02:25.819> flowing<00:02:26.819> over<00:02:27.000> and

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
skin mate either flowing over and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.539 
skin mate either flowing over and
filling<00:02:27.599> up<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.840> collection<00:02:28.049> cup<00:02:28.549> very

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
filling up this collection cup very

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.670 
filling up this collection cup very
quickly<00:02:29.879> or<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.840> phone<00:02:31.079> would<00:02:31.290> beat<00:02:31.440> down

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
quickly or the phone would beat down

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.920 
quickly or the phone would beat down
halfway<00:02:32.040> down<00:02:32.370> through<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:32.700> body<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.810> was

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
halfway down through the body so it was

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.479 
halfway down through the body so it was
really<00:02:34.110> hard<00:02:34.409> to<00:02:34.470> fine-tune<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.129> during<00:02:35.370> those

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
really hard to fine-tune it during those

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.509 
really hard to fine-tune it during those
first<00:02:35.700> two<00:02:35.940> weeks<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:36.840> over<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> last<00:02:37.519> three

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
first two weeks but over the last three

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.030 
first two weeks but over the last three
weeks<00:02:38.549> or<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.720> been<00:02:39.900> dialed<00:02:40.590> in<00:02:40.769> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
