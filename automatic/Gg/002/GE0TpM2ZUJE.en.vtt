00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.530
 ah 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.690
 hello everyone good as the title says 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.150
 of the video I will open the famous section of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.340
 questions I already know that this is the most 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.560
 spent and that I've been delayed a lot 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.560
 to upload a video but they must know that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.259
 I recently finished my university period 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.480
 a complete failure in my opinion but 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.460
 I did not want to upload a video just 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.949
 saying that because of this I have had 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.140
 delay although I have never promised dates 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.900
 or anything I felt that I should at least do 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.300
 time until the next video ends 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.490
 apart the video is not the only thing I've 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.920
 fact I have dedicated much of my 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.680
 time to redo my renders those who have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.350
 seen my face they already realized that I 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.540
 I'm moving to digital format and according to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.660
 My opinion is not as bad as 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.300
 I thought it would be apart they are many fuck 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.660
 that I have time to draw or that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 Well the bases of the questions are 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.369
 five questions per user maximum if 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.409
 repeat I 'll send them to hell they can 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.979
 ask the question who they want from 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.200
 channel to me the blonde the other blonde the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.000
 imperial soldier the girl that I 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.460
 remember 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.950
 and the gimondi teacher and please 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.570
 take care of your spelling that I'm sure of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.570
 that they are not illiterate 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.760
 australophitecus conejil is already a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 last thing surely have already been fixed 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.990
 that certain sister slainte has appeared 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.300
 in my videos this is the most obvious 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.310
 all but I was wondering if someone 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.350
 has seen more times because I've 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.540
 hidden in a total of seven times as 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.510
 throughout the chapters but 1 and 2 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.490
 if someone were to find him, it would be 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.620
 that has no life I say it would be the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.510
 second thing more were this planet and 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.460
 would deserve such a useless prize that a 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.410
 nobody would mind losing to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.880
 him so if they see more slender man 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.490
 comment on it in the corresponding video 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.180
 and maybe they'll win a prize of the most 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.910
 useless xd as that would be all have 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.310
 patience with chapter 3 that the sony 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.410
 vegas is fucking all that roll that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.929
 invented to walk paying more time 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.390
 I feel something is missing 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.850
 A) Yes 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.780
 it's not a nexus video if that team does not 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.780
 get a big one
