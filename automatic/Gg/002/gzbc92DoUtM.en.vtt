00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
over full speed link build and I don't

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.870 
over full speed link build and I don't
know<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.740> recently<00:00:20.160> learned<00:00:20.490> different

know I just recently learned different
Mondragon<00:00:22.010> blaze<00:00:23.010> again<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.359> I've<00:00:24.449> been

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
Mondragon blaze again so I've been

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.939 
Mondragon blaze again so I've been
trying<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.869> these<00:00:25.019> new<00:00:25.080> bills<00:00:25.380> myself<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
trying out these new bills myself and

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
trying out these new bills myself and
I've<00:00:26.039> been<00:00:26.400> finding<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.910> I've<00:00:27.060> had<00:00:27.240> quite<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I've been finding that I've had quite a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.830 
I've been finding that I've had quite a
lot<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> success<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:28.920> them<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.310> not<00:00:29.970> only<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
lot of success with them and not only is

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.190 
lot of success with them and not only is
it<00:00:30.869> good<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.510> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.630> transition<00:00:33.989> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it good because you can transition to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.209 
it good because you can transition to
middle<00:00:34.410> game<00:00:34.800> early<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.780> whatever<00:00:36.780> but

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
middle game early or whatever but

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.319 
middle game early or whatever but
providers<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.610> very<00:00:38.879> great<00:00:39.149> build

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
providers it's a very great build

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.080 
providers it's a very great build
because<00:00:39.510> they<00:00:39.809> generally<00:00:40.469> if<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.760> opponent

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
because they generally if your opponent

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
because they generally if your opponent
is<00:00:42.120> stupid<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.590> very<00:00:43.950> fast

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
is stupid then you can get very fast

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.270 
is stupid then you can get very fast
games<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.730> roll<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.840> mass<00:00:46.680> game<00:00:46.920> very

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
games that roll up just mass game very

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
games that roll up just mass game very
quickly<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.879> that's<00:00:48.149> why<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.570> build

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
quickly so that's why I like this build

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.340 
quickly so that's why I like this build
so<00:00:48.809> much<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> cool<00:00:50.610> things<00:00:50.640> and

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
couple of drones and then you make an

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.010 
couple of drones and then you make an
extractor<00:01:05.530> or<00:01:05.619> 10<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:07.270> can<00:01:07.780> see<00:01:07.899> I'm

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.469 
extractor or 10 so you can see I'm
saying<00:01:08.290> his<00:01:08.409> Nexus<00:01:08.710> right<00:01:08.890> here<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.520> what's

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
saying his Nexus right here and what's

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.120 
saying his Nexus right here and what's
great<00:01:10.630> about<00:01:10.689> this<00:01:10.899> build<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.470> if<00:01:11.770> they<00:01:11.979> see

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
great about this build is if they see

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.649 
great about this build is if they see
your<00:01:12.250> Overlord<00:01:12.549> they're<00:01:12.759> generally<00:01:13.479> gonna

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
your Overlord they're generally gonna

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.990 
your Overlord they're generally gonna

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.850 
send that probe right they're gonna try
and<00:01:16.090> block<00:01:16.240> your<00:01:16.390> hatchery<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.500> when<00:01:17.770> you're

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
and block your hatchery so when you're

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.889 
and block your hatchery so when you're
doing<00:01:18.039> this<00:01:18.130> build<00:01:18.430> they<00:01:19.299> won't<00:01:19.479> be<00:01:19.630> able<00:01:19.750> to

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
doing this build they won't be able to

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.980 
doing this build they won't be able to
lock<00:01:20.170> your<00:01:20.320> hatch<00:01:20.470> or<00:01:20.680> yourself<00:01:21.450> also<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.600> puts

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
lock your hatch or yourself also it puts

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.770 
lock your hatch or yourself also it puts
pressure<00:01:23.229> on<00:01:23.409> them<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:23.799> get<00:01:23.950> some<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.520> make

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
pressure on them and get some to make

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.990 
pressure on them and get some to make
cannons<00:01:25.780> first<00:01:26.170> if<00:01:26.740> they<00:01:27.070> do<00:01:27.130> our<00:01:27.670> doing<00:01:27.939> a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
cannons first if they do our doing a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.090 
cannons first if they do our doing a
fast<00:01:28.180> expand<00:01:28.539> which<00:01:28.780> 99%<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:29.890> time

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
fast expand which 99% of the time

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.399 
fast expand which 99% of the time
process<00:01:31.000> -<00:01:31.179> so<00:01:31.479> I'm<00:01:31.720> getting<00:01:31.869> my<00:01:32.050> extract

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
process - so I'm getting my extract

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.850 
process - so I'm getting my extract
right<00:01:32.619> now<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.850> sure<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.300> stop<00:01:34.600> larva<00:01:35.080> after

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
right now make sure you stop larva after

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.770 
right now make sure you stop larva after
you<00:01:35.950> get<00:01:36.100> your<00:01:36.250> start<00:01:36.789> stop<00:01:37.270> making<00:01:37.539> drones

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
you get your start stop making drones

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.389 
you get your start stop making drones
after<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.380> get<00:01:39.210> 10<00:01:40.210> supply<00:01:40.569> a<00:01:41.250> general<00:01:42.250> rule

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
after you get 10 supply a general rule

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.120 
after you get 10 supply a general rule
of<00:01:42.459> thumb<00:01:42.580> is<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:42.940> when<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.860> spawning<00:01:44.860> pool

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
of thumb is that when the spawning pool

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.120 
of thumb is that when the spawning pool
is<00:01:45.340> at<00:01:45.549> 350<00:01:46.240> health<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:47.200> should<00:01:47.350> have<00:01:47.530> one<00:01:47.920> bar

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
is at 350 health you should have one bar

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.710 
is at 350 health you should have one bar
but<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:49.780> not<00:01:50.229> being<00:01:50.740> used<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.399> that<00:01:51.720> way

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
but that's not being used so that way

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.789 
but that's not being used so that way
you'll<00:01:52.990> be<00:01:53.049> able<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.899> six<00:01:56.229> servings<00:01:56.590> as

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
you'll be able to get six servings as

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.190 
you'll be able to get six servings as
soon<00:01:56.979> as<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.310> spawning<00:01:57.880> pool<00:01:58.060> finishes<00:01:58.509> so

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
soon as the spawning pool finishes so

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.539 
soon as the spawning pool finishes so
basically<00:01:59.500> what<00:01:59.679> you<00:01:59.740> do<00:01:59.860> is<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.340> get

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
basically what you do is you just get

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.719 
basically what you do is you just get
100<00:02:01.090> guests<00:02:01.299> get<00:02:02.170> your<00:02:02.259> speedling<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.039> then

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
100 guests get your speedling and then

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.429 
100 guests get your speedling and then
there's<00:02:04.659> a<00:02:04.719> couple<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:04.990> good<00:02:05.109> things<00:02:05.289> you

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
there's a couple of good things you

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.130 
there's a couple of good things you
didn't<00:02:05.619> do

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
didn't do

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.300 
didn't do
what<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.170> really<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:08.619> about<00:02:08.649> this<00:02:08.920> build<00:02:09.160> is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
what I really like about this build is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.610 
what I really like about this build is
if<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:09.970> just<00:02:10.179> step<00:02:10.479> into<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> boss<00:02:11.350> player

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
if you just step into the boss player

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.080 
if you just step into the boss player
shoes<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.280> realize<00:02:12.579> that<00:02:12.730> they're<00:02:12.850> not<00:02:12.970> gonna

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
shoes you realize that they're not gonna

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.210 
shoes you realize that they're not gonna
be<00:02:13.209> able<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.390> get<00:02:13.510> any<00:02:13.690> scouting<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.320> they

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
be able to get any scouting in they

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
be able to get any scouting in they
won't<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.459> able<00:02:15.609> to<00:02:15.700> know<00:02:15.790> what<00:02:15.940> you're<00:02:16.030> doing

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
won't be able to know what you're doing

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.990 
won't be able to know what you're doing
and<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.739> could<00:02:17.890> be<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.160> master<00:02:18.430> zerglings

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
and you could be going master zerglings

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.410 
and you could be going master zerglings
you<00:02:19.329> could<00:02:19.510> be<00:02:19.720> macaron<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.829> a<00:02:21.030> macro<00:02:22.030> beast

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
you could be macaron like a macro beast

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.660 
you could be macaron like a macro beast
or<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.680> could<00:02:23.859> just<00:02:24.070> be<00:02:24.930> going<00:02:25.930> uh<00:02:26.350> hide<00:02:27.280> or

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
or you could just be going uh hide or

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.069 
or you could just be going uh hide or
hide<00:02:28.060> runs<00:02:28.299> maybe<00:02:28.540> you're<00:02:28.690> just<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.989> to

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
hide runs maybe you're just going to

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.110 
hide runs maybe you're just going to
standard<00:02:29.470> lurkers<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:30.700> pretty<00:02:30.940> crucial

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
standard lurkers so it's pretty crucial

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.420 
standard lurkers so it's pretty crucial
to<00:02:31.329> get<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:31.570> first<00:02:31.870> probe<00:02:32.079> down<00:02:32.430> because

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
to get this first probe down because

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.199 
to get this first probe down because
then<00:02:33.549> they<00:02:33.670> won't<00:02:33.820> know<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.090> you're

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
then they won't know if you're

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.390 
then they won't know if you're
continuing<00:02:34.870> Ling's

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
continuing Ling's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.860 
continuing Ling's
it<00:02:36.400> forces<00:02:36.910> them<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.030> pull<00:02:37.329> probes<00:02:37.630> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
it forces them to pull probes and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.479 
it forces them to pull probes and
actually<00:02:38.170> defend<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.739> expansion<00:02:39.100> because

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
actually defend that expansion because

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.940 
actually defend that expansion because
the<00:02:40.480> cannons<00:02:40.870> are<00:02:40.959> alone<00:02:41.380> are<00:02:41.620> not<00:02:41.650> gonna<00:02:41.890> be

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
the cannons are alone are not gonna be

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.199 
the cannons are alone are not gonna be
able<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.160> block<00:02:42.310> off<00:02:42.519> your<00:02:42.670> circlings

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
able to block off your circlings

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.660 
able to block off your circlings
and<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:44.739> really<00:02:45.040> nice<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.310> get<00:02:45.370> off<00:02:45.489> this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
and it's really nice to get off this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.250 
and it's really nice to get off this
first<00:02:46.000> probe<00:02:46.269> because<00:02:46.600> after<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.079> get<00:02:47.170> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
first probe because after you get the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.930 
first probe because after you get the
first<00:02:47.440> probe<00:02:47.709> dead<00:02:47.980> they're<00:02:48.549> not<00:02:48.700> gonna<00:02:48.850> be

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
first probe dead they're not gonna be

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.340 
first probe dead they're not gonna be
able<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> get<00:02:49.209> any<00:02:49.359> more<00:02:49.450> scouting<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.079> because

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
able to get any more scouting in because

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.900 
able to get any more scouting in because
you're<00:02:50.530> gonna<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.010> your<00:02:51.280> legs

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
you're gonna have the your legs

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.290 
you're gonna have the your legs
senators<00:02:52.330> base<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:53.790> really<00:02:54.790> nice<00:02:54.910> here<00:02:55.180> you

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
senators base so really nice here you

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.690 
senators base so really nice here you
get<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.540> probe<00:02:55.750> down<00:02:55.900> right<00:02:56.140> here<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.700> then

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
get the probe down right here and then

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.920 
get the probe down right here and then
you<00:02:57.790> just<00:02:57.970> put<00:02:58.120> your<00:02:58.240> legs<00:02:58.390> right<00:02:58.570> outside<00:02:58.810> his

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
you just put your legs right outside his

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.750 
you just put your legs right outside his
face<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.770> can<00:02:59.860> see<00:03:00.010> he's<00:03:00.160> already<00:03:00.310> starting

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
face you can see he's already starting

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.500 
face you can see he's already starting
to<00:03:00.790> pull<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> couple<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.810> probes<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.770> defense

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
to pull a couple of probes for defense

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.480 
to pull a couple of probes for defense
and<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:05.170> got<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.500> got<00:03:05.740> my<00:03:05.770> expansion<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.310> little

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
and I got I got my expansion a little

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.490 
and I got I got my expansion a little
bit<00:03:06.610> late<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:07.140> should<00:03:08.140> be<00:03:08.230> getting<00:03:08.350> your

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
bit late you should be getting your

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.470 
bit late you should be getting your
expansion<00:03:09.010> at<00:03:09.070> 16<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.610> little<00:03:09.970> bit<00:03:10.060> early<00:03:10.360> or

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
expansion at 16 a little bit early or

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.910 
expansion at 16 a little bit early or
maybe<00:03:10.660> 15<00:03:11.170> but<00:03:12.070> it's<00:03:12.670> pretty<00:03:12.820> fine<00:03:13.920> usually

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
maybe 15 but it's pretty fine usually

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.350 
maybe 15 but it's pretty fine usually
you<00:03:15.010> don't<00:03:15.130> do<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.550> build<00:03:15.760> on<00:03:15.940> maps<00:03:16.180> with

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
you don't do this build on maps with

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.880 
you don't do this build on maps with
ramps<00:03:16.750> because<00:03:16.930> all<00:03:17.320> they<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.590> do<00:03:17.710> is<00:03:17.740> just

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
ramps because all they can do is just

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.650 
ramps because all they can do is just
block<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.400> ramp<00:03:18.640> but<00:03:19.980> even<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:22.360> can<00:03:22.510> just

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
block the ramp but even so you can just

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.030 
block the ramp but even so you can just
a<00:03:22.780> nice<00:03:22.960> scouting<00:03:23.410> which<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.740> already<00:03:24.010> a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
a nice scouting which is already a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.860 
a nice scouting which is already a
crucial<00:03:24.430> part<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.760> game<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.180> even<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:25.810> you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
crucial part of the game so even if you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.170 
crucial part of the game so even if you
can't<00:03:26.140> do<00:03:26.260> damage<00:03:26.500> with<00:03:26.650> these<00:03:26.860> ceilings<00:03:27.220> you

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
can't do damage with these ceilings you

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.940 
can't do damage with these ceilings you
can<00:03:28.660> deny<00:03:28.780> scouting<00:03:29.320> I<00:03:29.410> thought<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.710> wasn't

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
can deny scouting I thought I wasn't

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.260 
can deny scouting I thought I wasn't
gonna<00:03:30.160> be<00:03:30.310> able<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.490> do<00:03:30.640> some<00:03:30.820> damage<00:03:30.850> with<00:03:31.090> new

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
gonna be able to do some damage with new

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.510 
gonna be able to do some damage with new
things<00:03:31.770> because<00:03:32.770> he<00:03:32.860> didn't<00:03:33.040> have<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.280> great

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
things because he didn't have that great

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.640 
things because he didn't have that great
cam<00:03:34.030> placement<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.750> did<00:03:35.050> continue<00:03:35.470> getting

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
cam placement so I did continue getting

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.590 
cam placement so I did continue getting
things<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.430> usually<00:03:36.610> stop<00:03:36.970> at<00:03:37.000> 10<00:03:37.270> or<00:03:37.300> 12

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
things you usually stop at 10 or 12

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.130 
things you usually stop at 10 or 12
leagues<00:03:37.810> though<00:03:38.100> so<00:03:39.390> yeah<00:03:40.390> at<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:40.870> point

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
choices at this point I could have just

was not defending the cannons but I

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.000

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.690 
game was just for Hydra three hat Hydra
something<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.550> that<00:04:04.590> because<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:06.520> need

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
something like that because you need

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.850 
something like that because you need
lots<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.120> kids<00:04:07.330> defense<00:04:07.780> against<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.260> unless

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
lots of kids defense against that unless

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.270 
lots of kids defense against that unless
you<00:04:09.010> take<00:04:09.250> hanger<00:04:09.580> fast<00:04:09.880> which<00:04:10.920> she<00:04:11.920> was<00:04:12.070> not

definitely very strong a transition

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.930 
definitely very strong a transition
