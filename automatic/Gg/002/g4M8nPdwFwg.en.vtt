00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.460
 well this is a small tutorial 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.210
 how to make a thaumaturge 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.570
 first of all I use a small 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.189
 piece of thin plywood that 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.040
 I cut in a circle with a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.869
 diameter of 7 centimeters in this case 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.230
 you can use another type of material 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.820
 thick cardboard or something that serves and that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.470
 be a little resistant so that at 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 moment that turns 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:42.030
 do not miss so much I'm also going to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.760
 use some markers to paint the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.350
 small illustration 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.769
 and some leagues these leagues are for 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.039
 introduce them within the circles of 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.229
 tropo trauma and at the moment that what 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.739
 we have finished can rotate with 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:03.100
 quick facility and we can observe the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.100
 animation 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:12.010
 well first of all we're going to need 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.170
 draw a picture of a side in my case 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.900
 after a little dragon with wings 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.479
 upwards based on a pencil and the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.880
 another back side the same dragon in the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.430
 same position but with wings towards 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.190
 down this serves for the moment that of 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.119
 back that is the illusion that goes 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.580
 flying my little dragon in my case already 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.580
 it took him a bit advanced only after 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.050
 those two sides and paint one side of the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.690
 face so you would notice the difference 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.340
 and now I will start painting what would be 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.890
 my trauma trick 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.770
 my dragon I chose it green 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.190
 and right now your images of how it was 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.190
 staying 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.040
 painting my dragon 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.610
 if they are fixed they remain the same 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.879
 but in a different position now they continue 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.329
 the images about how it was staying 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.329
 the bottom 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.080
 good here you meet and tropo trauma 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.590
 already completely finished 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.270
 in the previous images putting the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.480
 process of how it went painting 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.030
 change some markers for 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.319
 be able to use a little bit of acrylic 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.940
 more for the background 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.070
 it was finished 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.950
 league were introduced in the holes 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.310
 indicated 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:23.230
 and well I think this is all I leave you with 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.230
 the little animation of how he 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.120
 we go
