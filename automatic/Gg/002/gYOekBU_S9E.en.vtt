 Schwarzenegger 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.319
 an elegant Maserati 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.119
 or a sporty Ferrari these are cars that men like 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.420
 Women, on the other hand, prefer practical small and mid-size cars in chic style 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 design 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.730
 There is a lot of space in the trunk 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.120
 as far as the clichés but voices at all 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.380
 Konrad Weßner knows the answer 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.810
 The market researcher from Nuremberg is an automotive expert and explores the 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 Preferences of men and women buying a car 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.390
 percent 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.140
 Men bought if you are a bar or in shape then probably that's why 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 because the stomach bought that word from him 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.760
 Women have very different requirements 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.970
 because already expensive then her dream car should be especially spacious with 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.820
 enough space for a concert 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.280
 Grass this SUV 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.290
 My own shadows are very comfortable and we have a lot of room ten 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.570
 With 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.370
 the male eyes 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.370
 we have an elevated seating position myself 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.130
 Application needing special endangerment 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 The statistic says that more than three quarters of all car buying decisions 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190
 be hit by women today 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.190
 Tips the men's game wear tails 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.690
 Football of the stocks depend 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.439
 among the participants 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.699
 to be invested 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.099
 i like little funny cars i do not care about much prestige 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.819
 Georg, I find it embarrassing 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.869
 I do not February for an app of everything 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.179
 and safety 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:29.160
 Italian carmaker Fiat knows its target audience very well 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.400
 In Germany alone, around 63 percent of the buyers of the ziert 530 wo 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.400
 Something like women at the small car maker Suzuki 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:45.349
 So look at the job that they say very much like the Japanese that's hardly 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.759
 Further, this word turns out what the car is for us as a small and 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.439
 Hochscheid these are properties that you associate with the vehicle and me 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.859
 Guess that's the kind and design women will like to be no for 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.219
 will form next to LB red Dohrmann the Winnender Leite 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.439
 and try the men on the Geneva 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.179
 Motor Show 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:11.009
 For many, cars are still status symbols that inspire 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.549
 each by 20 percent of male car buyers 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.969

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.969

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.040
 I would go see Bahrain trends 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.390
 that men are still looking for a powerful engine 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.979
 Value without needle on a pronounced sportiness 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.299
 but the statistics are correct 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:41.119
 Dressage LK will read big and fast cars the minimum is 250 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.579
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.749
 but more and more women are enthusiastic about fast Capri Russ 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:49.589
 everybody cares 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.679
 I drive a small car but would not have more money then I would 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:56.029
 definitely buy a sports car 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.789
 According to market research, there is no car that both sexes alike 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:04.629
 appeals to her love half of men and women bought Konrad 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.629
 Weßner knows what women appreciate about him 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.449
 a simple operation not too many 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.870
 2 technical instruments everything here very robust 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.340

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.000
 up a gate is self-explanatory and easy to use 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:28.349
 even more so than the one for a small car state 175 we 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.559
 start 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:32.009
 if own 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:32.890

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.890
 Migration expect women tend 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.559
 Quality appearance and beauty 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.370
 The roles of men and women buying a car are approaching more 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.349
 at the Geneva Motor Show, more will find their dream car
