 time 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:38.410

 called a counter thigh 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.490

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.680
 remember that salt and pepper are 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.260
 taste

 purple Onion 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.260
 and carrot 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.590
 The first thing I will do is place in a 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:37.520
 pan about four or five tablespoons of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.130

 the green red paprika and the phyto agita 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.360
 I mix a little 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.200
 then the carrot 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.289
 the chicken broth 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.840
 remember that they are two cups if you want 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.640
 change the chicken stock per broth 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.729
 You can also do meat, but I 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.490
 I prefer the chicken stock and continued 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.160
 adding the three cups of water 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.230
 the counter chicken thigh remember that 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.050
 the contra thigh only I'm going to 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.750
 place in this preparation so that you 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.900
 give a better flavor and add the sheet 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.900
 laurel 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:31.870
 and then the pieces of auyama 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.870
 they realize they are big pieces 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.490
 I mix very well 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.040
 I leave this preparation for about 15 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.489
 minutes over medium heat and cover 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.730
 after about 15 or 20 minutes you should already 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.209
 be the softest pot look 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.989
 it's soft right now I should 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.940
 put out the fire and proceed to liquefy or 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:05.510
 process this preparation 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.060
 today I decided to use the blender when 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.060
 we are going to liquefy foods that are very 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.330
 hot we must remove the lid of the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.950
 blender and place a cloth to avoid 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.930
 accidents 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.130
 at the end of liquefying all 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.870
 ingredients look how creamy it was 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.500
 Now I'm going to bring the cream of a flame 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.720
 Once again in the pan, place it on a fire 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.920
 medium 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.920
 mix a little 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.390
 continued the preparation adding the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.810
 milk cream 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.560
 and I will integrate it very well with the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.560
 auyama cream 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.080
 finally I'm going to add salt and 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.590
 pepper and I keep mixing 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.950
 I leave it about 5 more minutes in the stove and 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:04.660

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.720
