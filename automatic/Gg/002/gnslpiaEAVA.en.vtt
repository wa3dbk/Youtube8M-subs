00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.100 

you<00:02:17.400> know<00:02:17.490> something<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.210> need<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.630> say<00:02:18.750> this

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
you know something I need to say this

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.620 
you know something I need to say this
I'm<00:02:19.980> not<00:02:20.190> sure<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.850> he<00:02:20.880> knew<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.600> a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I'm not sure that he knew that was a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
I'm not sure that he knew that was a
checkered<00:02:21.990> flag<00:02:22.230> cuz<00:02:22.800> he<00:02:22.950> had<00:02:23.070> shifted<00:02:23.490> up<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
checkered flag cuz he had shifted up the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.180 
checkered flag cuz he had shifted up the
gear<00:02:23.970> from<00:02:24.150> fifth<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> sixth<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.890> think

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
gear from fifth to sixth and I think

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.470 
gear from fifth to sixth and I think
