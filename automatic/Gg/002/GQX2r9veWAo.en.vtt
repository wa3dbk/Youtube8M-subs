00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.990 

and<00:01:32.299> now<00:01:33.299> Patrick's<00:01:33.840> gonna<00:01:33.990> bet<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
and now Patrick's gonna bet it

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.170 
and now Patrick's gonna bet it
forty-five<00:01:36.000> grand<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.960> he's<00:01:37.140> got<00:01:37.350> ace<00:01:37.560> king

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.940 

Jamie<00:01:42.180> knows<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.990> Patrick<00:01:43.470> doesn't<00:01:43.619> have

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
Jamie knows that Patrick doesn't have

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.060 
Jamie knows that Patrick doesn't have
Jack<00:01:44.189> nine<00:01:44.810> but<00:01:45.810> Jamie<00:01:46.049> should<00:01:46.290> also<00:01:46.470> realize

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
Jack nine but Jamie should also realize

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.330 
Jack nine but Jamie should also realize
he<00:01:47.610> only<00:01:47.880> bet<00:01:48.110> 15,000<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> flop<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.159> it's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
he only bet 15,000 on the flop so it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.289 
he only bet 15,000 on the flop so it's
possible<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.360> Patrick<00:01:52.079> has<00:01:52.259> ace<00:01:52.500> jack<00:01:53.270> but<00:01:54.270> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
possible that Patrick has ace jack but I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.160 
possible that Patrick has ace jack but I
don't<00:01:54.570> think<00:01:54.720> Jamie<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.229> stop<00:01:55.470> himself

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
