00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.390
 life puts obstacles in one's 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.980
 stop as many times as necessary and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.530
 that does not matter 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.880
 the drawbacks because I am one of 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.110
 the people that life makes me 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.860
 I was almost eight years old and yet 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.620
