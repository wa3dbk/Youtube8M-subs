00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
coloring it does this by stabilizing

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.230 
coloring it does this by stabilizing
your<00:01:13.920> strokes<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.820> software<00:01:15.540> meaning

with<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> stabilization<00:01:18.840> set<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:19.740> 100<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.670> I

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
with a stabilization set at 100 like I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.770 
with a stabilization set at 100 like I
used<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> sketch<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.190> began<00:01:23.780> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
used for this sketch when I began to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.780 
used for this sketch when I began to
trace<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:26.390> can<00:01:27.390> trace<00:01:27.720> slowly<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.790> still

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
trace I can trace slowly and still

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.040 
trace I can trace slowly and still
maintain<00:01:30.710> tons<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.980> control<00:01:32.540> even<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
maintain tons of control even on the

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.100 
maintain tons of control even on the
slick<00:01:34.350> surface<00:01:34.620> of<00:01:35.130> my<00:01:35.280> Wacom<00:01:35.730> tablet<00:01:36.300> which

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
slick surface of my Wacom tablet which

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.090 
slick surface of my Wacom tablet which
makes<00:01:37.440> tracing<00:01:38.180> more<00:01:39.180> accurate<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.100> gives

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
makes tracing more accurate and gives

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.070 
makes tracing more accurate and gives
you<00:01:41.340> smoother<00:01:41.940> strokes<00:01:43.040> for<00:01:44.040> instance<00:01:45.080> I'll

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
you smoother strokes for instance I'll

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.900 
you smoother strokes for instance I'll
go<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.590> new<00:01:46.800> canvas<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.610> show<00:01:47.850> you

this<00:02:00.070> is<00:02:00.310> stabilization<00:02:01.299> at<00:02:01.479> 100<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:03.490> will

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
this is stabilization at 100 you will

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.139 
this is stabilization at 100 you will
have<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.030> enter<00:02:04.180> 100<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:06.189> tool<00:02:06.430> property

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
have to enter 100 and the tool property

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.960 
have to enter 100 and the tool property
under<00:02:07.800> stabilization<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:09.340> click<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.789> little

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
under stabilization you click the little

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.890 
under stabilization you click the little
arrow<00:02:10.269> here<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.959> enter<00:02:11.590> 100<00:02:12.280> now<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.599> same

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
arrow here and enter 100 now the same

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.710 
arrow here and enter 100 now the same
line<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.650> draw<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.519> drew<00:02:15.790> here<00:02:20.190> is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
line that I draw that I drew here is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.030 
line that I draw that I drew here is
controlled<00:02:22.720> by<00:02:23.069> stabilization<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:26.739> I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
controlled by stabilization but if I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.210 
controlled by stabilization but if I
want<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.730> do<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.180> very<00:02:28.660> squiggly<00:02:29.230> line<00:02:29.440> then

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
want it to do a very squiggly line then

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.430 
want it to do a very squiggly line then
I've<00:02:30.459> learned<00:02:30.700> with<00:02:30.940> stabilization<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:32.170> just

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
I've learned with stabilization you just

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.839 
I've learned with stabilization you just
go<00:02:32.620> slow<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.590> control<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.549> trace

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
go slow and you have control to trace

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:56.750 
go slow and you have control to trace
whatever<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.540> are

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.759 

laughing<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.939> like<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.569> sketch<00:02:58.959> fast<00:02:59.319> so<00:02:59.739> I

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
laughing I like to sketch fast so I

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.729 
laughing I like to sketch fast so I
usually<00:03:00.220> turn<00:03:00.450> stabilization<00:03:01.450> off<00:03:01.629> when<00:03:02.590> I'm

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
usually turn stabilization off when I'm

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.699 
usually turn stabilization off when I'm
sketching<00:03:03.099> but<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.629> can<00:03:04.900> draw<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.319> sketch

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
sketching but you can draw in sketch

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.670 
sketching but you can draw in sketch
with<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.189> all<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.930> feature<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.440> can
