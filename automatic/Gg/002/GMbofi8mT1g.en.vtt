overlap the petals this will make it so
you<00:03:00.470> don't<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.769> any<00:03:00.830> big<00:03:01.160> gaps<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.880> your

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
you don't have any big gaps in your

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:13.800 
you don't have any big gaps in your
flower<00:03:04.870> when<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.900> do<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.230> with<00:03:06.350> all<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.739> petals

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.660 

now<00:03:14.810> I've<00:03:14.930> got<00:03:15.140> four<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.040> normally<00:03:16.519> if<00:03:16.610> I

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
now I've got four on and normally if I

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.310 
now I've got four on and normally if I
was<00:03:16.820> just<00:03:16.940> doing<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.299> pie<00:03:17.480> shape<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:18.140> would

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
was just doing the pie shape that would

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.410 
was just doing the pie shape that would
be<00:03:18.500> closed<00:03:18.859> up<00:03:19.130> but<00:03:19.459> there's<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> little<00:03:20.209> bit<00:03:20.359> of

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
be closed up but there's a little bit of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.810 
be closed up but there's a little bit of
a<00:03:20.510> gap<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.019> that's<00:03:21.140> where<00:03:21.320> we're<00:03:21.470> going<00:03:21.620> to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
a gap and that's where we're going to

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.319 
a gap and that's where we're going to
continue<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.480> circular<00:03:25.090> edition<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
continue the circular edition of the

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.199 
continue the circular edition of the
petals<00:03:26.920> letter<00:03:27.920> try<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.340> keep<00:03:28.609> it<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.030> that

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
petals letter try and keep it so that

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.780 
petals letter try and keep it so that
it's<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.600> round<00:03:31.150> circular<00:03:32.440> shape<00:03:33.700> well<00:03:34.700> the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
it's a round circular shape well the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.819 
it's a round circular shape well the
petals<00:03:35.060> don't<00:03:35.269> get<00:03:35.450> all<00:03:35.870> steamed<00:03:36.230> up<00:03:36.320> this<00:03:36.530> and

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
petals don't get all steamed up this and

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.330 
petals don't get all steamed up this and
the<00:03:37.670> flowers<00:03:38.000> become<00:03:38.690> misshapen<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:40.160> you're

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
the flowers become misshapen so you're

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:52.899 
the flowers become misshapen so you're
going<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.640> keep<00:03:40.820> going

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.250 

and<00:03:53.909> the<00:03:54.000> overlaps<00:03:54.420> about<00:03:54.719> a<00:03:54.750> quarter<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.140> an

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
and the overlaps about a quarter of an

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:27.800 
and the overlaps about a quarter of an
inch<00:04:25.130> okay<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.880> now<00:04:27.060> you're<00:04:27.300> ready<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.570> start

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
inch okay so now you're ready to start

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.180 
inch okay so now you're ready to start
making<00:04:27.960> your<00:04:28.699> your<00:04:29.699> flower<00:04:30.030> blossom<00:04:31.160> so<00:04:32.160> I

making your your flower blossom so I
start<00:04:32.729> like<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.120> start<00:04:33.360> on<00:04:33.449> the<00:04:33.539> back<00:04:34.160> find<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
start like to start on the back find the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.189 
start like to start on the back find the
first<00:04:35.550> petal<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.389> put<00:04:36.720> down<00:04:36.840> on<00:04:37.050> your

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
first petal that you put down on your

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.560 
first petal that you put down on your
circle<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:38.039> you're<00:04:38.580> going<00:04:38.789> to<00:04:38.910> reach<00:04:39.240> inside

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
circle and you're going to reach inside

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.629 
circle and you're going to reach inside
the<00:04:40.970> petal<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.150> take<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.410> inside<00:04:43.860> edge<00:04:44.220> in

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
the petal and take the inside edge in

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.400 
the petal and take the inside edge in
and<00:04:45.360> twist<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.199> toward<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.860> center<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:48.410> the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
and twist it toward the center of the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.460 
and twist it toward the center of the
petal<00:04:52.909> so<00:04:53.909> you<00:04:54.000> can<00:04:54.270> see<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.449> will<00:04:55.110> give<00:04:55.349> it

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
petal so you can see that will give it

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:04.260 
petal so you can see that will give it
its<00:04:55.710> dimension<00:05:01.520> want<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.699> keep

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
its dimension want to keep

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:33.610 
its dimension want to keep
doing<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.870> all<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.500> petals<00:05:32.470> see<00:05:33.470> it's

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
doing that to all the petals see it's

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.440 
doing that to all the petals see it's
really<00:05:33.800> starting<00:05:34.130> to<00:05:34.340> fluff<00:05:34.700> up<00:05:34.880> there<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:38.330> I

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
really starting to fluff up there and I

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
finished fluffing as you can see it's

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:52.480 
finished fluffing as you can see it's

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
nice and full I sprayed a old dictionary

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:59.890 
nice and full I sprayed a old dictionary
page<00:05:55.360> with<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.750> darker<00:05:57.350> shade<00:05:58.210> and<00:05:59.210> I'm<00:05:59.480> going

page with a darker shade and I'm going

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:13.180 
page with a darker shade and I'm going
to<00:06:03.340> punch<00:06:04.340> out<00:06:04.640> a<00:06:04.670> scallop<00:06:05.210> circle<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:12.860> next

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
to punch out a scallop circle the next

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
to punch out a scallop circle the next
thing<00:06:13.310> you<00:06:13.460> do<00:06:13.610> is<00:06:13.640> you<00:06:13.940> take<00:06:13.970> your<00:06:16.210> needle

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
thing you do is you take your needle

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.540 
thing you do is you take your needle
tool<00:06:17.360> or<00:06:17.930> your<00:06:18.230> round<00:06:18.440> file<00:06:18.800> and<00:06:19.160> you're<00:06:19.310> going

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
tool or your round file and you're going

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.730 
tool or your round file and you're going
to<00:06:19.640> poke<00:06:20.030> it<00:06:20.270> through<00:06:20.300> actually<00:06:21.290> you<00:06:21.500> should

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
to poke it through actually you should

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.310 
to poke it through actually you should
probably<00:06:21.770> go<00:06:22.280> ahead<00:06:22.460> and<00:06:22.610> put<00:06:22.730> the<00:06:22.850> paper

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
probably go ahead and put the paper

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.850 
probably go ahead and put the paper
right<00:06:24.320> in<00:06:24.500> the<00:06:24.590> middle<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:26.350> find<00:06:27.350> the<00:06:27.470> center

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
right in the middle and find the center

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.330 
right in the middle and find the center
and<00:06:28.070> poke<00:06:28.340> it<00:06:28.370> through<00:06:29.680> till<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:30.890> goes<00:06:31.070> all<00:06:31.310> the

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
and poke it through till it goes all the

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.430 
and poke it through till it goes all the
way<00:06:31.490> through<00:06:31.520> the<00:06:31.850> back<00:06:32.060> you<00:06:32.240> wanna<00:06:32.450> make<00:06:33.260> sure

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440
