what<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.370> were<00:02:17.820> used<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.180> earlier<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.840> summer

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
what we were used to earlier this summer

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.100 
what we were used to earlier this summer
from<00:02:19.440> offshore<00:02:19.940> inland<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.210> coming<00:02:21.660> up<00:02:21.870> from

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
from offshore inland it's coming up from

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.780 
from offshore inland it's coming up from
the<00:02:22.170> south<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.530> also<00:02:23.100> coming<00:02:23.460> from<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the south and also coming from the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.750 
the south and also coming from the
southwest<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.470> what's<00:02:25.740> happened<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.400> it

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
southwest out so what's happened is it

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.210 
southwest out so what's happened is it
that<00:02:27.020> air<00:02:28.020> which<00:02:28.320> would<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.590> moved<00:02:28.710> inland

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
that air which would have moved inland

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.170 
that air which would have moved inland
is<00:02:29.400> actually<00:02:29.820> moving<00:02:30.030> west<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.190> we<00:02:32.460> where

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
is actually moving west and so we where

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.970 
is actually moving west and so we where
we<00:02:33.330> wouldn't<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:34.080> smelled<00:02:34.470> something<00:02:34.740> like

we wouldn't have smelled something like
that<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> regular<00:02:36.210> pattern<00:02:36.950> because<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
that in the regular pattern because of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.520

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
an hour winds that got swept through the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.950 
an hour winds that got swept through the
sea<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.560> his<00:03:11.510> speculation<00:03:12.510> was<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.720> that

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
sea and his speculation was that that

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.410 
sea and his speculation was that that
possibly<00:03:13.170> sort<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.620> kind<00:03:14.460> of<00:03:14.520> turned<00:03:15.270> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
possibly sort of kind of turned the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.360 
possibly sort of kind of turned the
surface<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.110> water<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.440> little<00:03:16.590> bit<00:03:16.890> where

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
surface of the water a little bit where

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.340 
surface of the water a little bit where
these<00:03:17.520> dead<00:03:17.880> fish<00:03:18.150> are<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.050> sort<00:03:19.290> of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
these dead fish are and that sort of

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.890 
these dead fish are and that sort of
basically<00:03:19.560> caused<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.950> big<00:03:20.190> stink<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:21.270> blow<00:03:21.600> I

basically caused a big stink to blow I

basically caused a big stink to blow I

California but Andrews you said they're

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.690 
California but Andrews you said they're
still<00:03:28.590> investigating<00:03:28.739> exactly<00:03:29.190> what

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
still investigating exactly what

there's<00:03:40.200> kind<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.590> guess<00:03:40.860> right<00:03:41.220> now

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
there's kind of a guess right now

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.640 
there's kind of a guess right now
there's<00:03:41.700> not<00:03:41.850> an<00:03:42.030> absolute<00:03:42.810> bottom<00:03:43.140> line<00:03:43.470> and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
there's not an absolute bottom line and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.780 
there's not an absolute bottom line and
we're<00:03:43.800> going<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.980> keep<00:03:44.220> working<00:03:44.280> on<00:03:44.760> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
we're going to keep working on that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.180

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
there's still little skepticism oh that

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.970 
there's still little skepticism oh that
could<00:04:09.570> really<00:04:09.720> be<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.019> cause<00:04:10.200> but<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.650> sounds

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
could really be the cause but it sounds

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.040 
could really be the cause but it sounds
like<00:04:11.040> no<00:04:11.340> other<00:04:11.550> real<00:04:11.790> cause<00:04:12.120> as<00:04:12.750> they

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
like no other real cause as they

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.470 
like no other real cause as they
determine<00:04:13.500> other<00:04:13.739> than<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.190> right<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.090> mean

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
determine other than that right I mean

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.449 
determine other than that right I mean
that<00:04:15.660> would<00:04:15.930> surprise<00:04:16.260> me<00:04:16.680> again<00:04:16.980> talking<00:04:17.280> to

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
that would surprise me again talking to

I've been at the paper and we were kind
of<00:04:36.210> all<00:04:37.280> scratching<00:04:38.280> our<00:04:38.370> heads<00:04:38.580> trying<00:04:38.759> to

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
of all scratching our heads trying to

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.460 
of all scratching our heads trying to
figure<00:04:39.090> out<00:04:39.150> what<00:04:39.300> what<00:04:39.569> could<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.750> be<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:40.229> mean

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
figure out what what could it be I mean

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.180 
figure out what what could it be I mean
is<00:04:41.129> it<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.819> it<00:04:42.000> oil<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.919> something

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
is it is it oil is it is it something

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.520 
is it is it oil is it is it something
from<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.610> sewers<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:46.020> know<00:04:46.110> what<00:04:46.379> is

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
from the sewers is it you know what is

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.330 
from the sewers is it you know what is
it<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.789> think<00:04:48.259> big<00:04:49.259> as<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.710> said<00:04:49.979> the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
it and and I think big as you said the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.700 
it and and I think big as you said the
fact<00:04:50.639> that<00:04:50.759> it's<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.090> far<00:04:51.629> to<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.110> east<00:04:52.139> from

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
fact that it's so far to the east from

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.760 
fact that it's so far to the east from
this<00:04:52.919> would<00:04:53.520> would<00:04:54.000> be<00:04:54.449> a<00:04:54.720> real<00:04:54.990> surprise<00:04:55.229> but

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
this would would be a real surprise but

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.730 
this would would be a real surprise but
clearly<00:04:56.639> it's<00:04:57.509> right<00:04:58.110> now<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.349> best

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
clearly it's right now the best

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.430 
clearly it's right now the best
explanation<00:04:59.099> that<00:04:59.699> we<00:04:59.819> have<00:05:00.139> yeah<00:05:01.139> and<00:05:01.380> it

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
explanation that we have yeah and it

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.230 
explanation that we have yeah and it
sounds<00:05:01.800> like<00:05:01.860> it's<00:05:02.039> also<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:02.610> also<00:05:02.940> sounds

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
sounds like it's also it also sounds

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.879 
sounds like it's also it also sounds
like<00:05:03.270> it's<00:05:03.599> somewhat<00:05:04.020> scattered<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.710> think

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
like it's somewhat scattered I think

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.649 
like it's somewhat scattered I think
we've<00:05:04.979> heard<00:05:05.009> a<00:05:05.400> lot<00:05:05.669> of<00:05:05.909> reports<00:05:06.389> in<00:05:06.569> the

questions were I'd have to kind of

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.670 
questions were I'd have to kind of
figure<00:05:26.099> out<00:05:26.340> today<00:05:26.639> is<00:05:27.050> why<00:05:28.050> it<00:05:28.110> is<00:05:28.259> that<00:05:28.379> it

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
figure out today is why it is that it

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.350 
figure out today is why it is that it
could<00:05:28.800> be<00:05:28.919> so<00:05:29.190> widespread<00:05:29.430> in<00:05:29.789> certain<00:05:30.240> areas

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
could be so widespread in certain areas

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.999 
could be so widespread in certain areas
and<00:05:30.750> then<00:05:30.870> in<00:05:31.020> other<00:05:31.139> areas<00:05:31.440> you<00:05:31.620> just<00:05:31.650> don't

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
and then in other areas you just don't

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.230 
and then in other areas you just don't
spell<00:05:32.250> it<00:05:32.280> or<00:05:32.490> something<00:05:32.789> else<00:05:33.090> something

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
spell it or something else something

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.839 
spell it or something else something
much<00:05:33.750> more<00:05:33.930> faint<00:05:34.289> yeah<00:05:35.130> I<00:05:35.159> know<00:05:35.310> it's<00:05:35.610> true

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
much more faint yeah I know it's true

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.159 
much more faint yeah I know it's true
and<00:05:36.000> again<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.449> know<00:05:36.539> we<00:05:36.659> have<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:36.990> very

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
and again you know we have this very

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.740 
and again you know we have this very
kind<00:05:37.530> of<00:05:37.620> nice<00:05:38.039> unseasonable<00:05:39.030> cool<00:05:39.389> summer

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
kind of nice unseasonable cool summer

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.830 
kind of nice unseasonable cool summer
now<00:05:40.080> we<00:05:40.139> have<00:05:40.409> very<00:05:41.159> humid<00:05:42.120> air<00:05:42.300> almost<00:05:42.509> like

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
now we have very humid air almost like

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.890 
now we have very humid air almost like
the<00:05:42.990> East<00:05:43.199> Coast<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:43.830> you<00:05:44.639> know<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:44.969> the<00:05:45.630> fact

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
the East Coast and you know the the fact

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.800 
the East Coast and you know the the fact
that<00:05:46.190> how<00:05:47.190> did<00:05:47.400> those<00:05:47.520> winds<00:05:47.849> get<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.360> out<00:05:48.509> here

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
that how did those winds get it out here

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.420 
that how did those winds get it out here
and<00:05:48.990> how<00:05:49.169> did<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.409> scatter<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:50.099> I<00:05:50.190> mean<00:05:50.279> I<00:05:50.340> think

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
and how did it scatter it I mean I think

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.920 
and how did it scatter it I mean I think
that'll<00:05:50.940> be<00:05:50.969> one<00:05:51.419> of<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.630> things<00:05:51.870> that

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
that'll be one of the things that

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.779 
that'll be one of the things that
obviously<00:05:52.139> will<00:05:52.500> be<00:05:52.680> pursuing<00:05:53.130> in<00:05:53.460> you<00:05:53.699> know

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789

smelled like rotten eggs but one thing
it<00:06:11.340> seems<00:06:11.490> like<00:06:11.610> comment<00:06:12.000> on<00:06:12.120> there's<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.419> lot

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
it seems like comment on there's a lot

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.300

rather and think that their sources to

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.830 
rather and think that their sources to
is<00:06:16.740> backed<00:06:16.979> up<00:06:17.159> yeah<00:06:18.060> and<00:06:18.270> every<00:06:18.479> once<00:06:18.659> in<00:06:18.779> a

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840

about you yeah I guess what the
questions<00:06:36.180> I<00:06:36.210> think<00:06:36.360> we're<00:06:36.449> also<00:06:36.570> trying<00:06:36.750> to

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:36.839 
questions I think we're also trying to

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:37.670 
questions I think we're also trying to
figure<00:06:37.080> out<00:06:37.110> is<00:06:37.289> web

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
figure out is web

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.010 
figure out is web
we<00:06:38.520> think<00:06:38.759> this<00:06:38.850> is<00:06:39.030> slowly<00:06:39.270> dissipating<00:06:39.960> a

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
we think this is slowly dissipating a

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.360 
we think this is slowly dissipating a
lot<00:06:40.199> of<00:06:40.259> these<00:06:40.350> calls<00:06:40.710> occurred<00:06:41.130> in<00:06:41.310> the

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
lot of these calls occurred in the

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.120 
lot of these calls occurred in the
