00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.710 
you back with open arms and that's what
they<00:03:25.650> did<00:03:25.799> with<00:03:26.010> TJ<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:26.879> think<00:03:27.389> that<00:03:27.540> when

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
they did with TJ and I I think that when

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.439 
they did with TJ and I I think that when
when<00:03:28.260> when<00:03:28.530> players<00:03:28.919> leave<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.329> know

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
when when players leave and you know

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.569 
when when players leave and you know
when<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.900> time<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.769> up<00:03:31.949> playing<00:03:32.340> wise

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
when the time is up playing wise

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.250 
when the time is up playing wise
obviously<00:03:33.329> they<00:03:33.480> want<00:03:33.659> to<00:03:33.720> continue<00:03:33.959> that

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
obviously they want to continue that

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.589 
obviously they want to continue that
part<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.620> their<00:03:34.739> career<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.250> as<00:03:35.340> they

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
part of their career and as they

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.920 
part of their career and as they
continue<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.629> do<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.379> as<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.949> natural

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
continue to do that and as a the natural

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.599 
continue to do that and as a the natural
maturity<00:03:39.930> process<00:03:40.139> continues<00:03:40.979> they<00:03:41.190> realize

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
maturity process continues they realize

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.640 
maturity process continues they realize
what<00:03:42.000> we<00:03:42.659> always<00:03:42.930> tell<00:03:43.319> them<00:03:43.440> they've<00:03:43.620> been

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
what we always tell them they've been

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.530 
what we always tell them they've been
told<00:03:44.010> their<00:03:44.159> whole<00:03:44.190> life<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.879> know<00:03:45.000> they

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
told their whole life that you know they

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.059 
told their whole life that you know they
need<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:46.019> knowledge<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:46.739> need<00:03:46.769> that

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
need that knowledge they need that

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.520 
need that knowledge they need that
education<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.909> once<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.959> get<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.379> can

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
education and once you get it it can

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.670 
education and once you get it it can
never<00:03:49.650> be<00:03:49.799> taken<00:03:49.979> away<00:03:50.190> from<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
never be taken away from you and the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.020 
never be taken away from you and the
fact<00:03:52.919> that<00:03:52.979> they<00:03:53.129> want<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.430> come<00:03:53.579> back<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:53.970> I

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
fact that they want to come back and I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.770 
fact that they want to come back and I
think<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.620> as<00:03:55.620> they've<00:03:55.919> come<00:03:56.159> back<00:03:56.629> you<00:03:57.629> know<00:03:57.720> I

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
think to as they've come back you know I

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.719 
think to as they've come back you know I
think<00:03:57.870> they<00:03:58.109> really<00:03:58.680> respect<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.519> know<00:03:59.609> the

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
think they really respect you know the

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.360 
think they really respect you know the
job<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.180> ran<00:04:00.389> to<00:04:00.419> Ryan<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.560> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
job that ran to Ryan and and the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.219 
job that ran to Ryan and and the
academic<00:04:02.940> side<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.239> our<00:04:03.479> program<00:04:03.930> what<00:04:04.109> it's

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
academic side of our program what it's

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.439 
academic side of our program what it's
about<00:04:04.349> I<00:04:04.530> also<00:04:05.040> think<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.639> part<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.150> them

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
about I also think that a part of them

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.270 
about I also think that a part of them
coming<00:04:06.750> back<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.319> job<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.739> Todd<00:04:07.979> right

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
coming back is the job that Todd right

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.860 
coming back is the job that Todd right
and<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.760> strength<00:04:09.000> conditioning<00:04:09.209> program

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
and the strength conditioning program

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.259 
and the strength conditioning program
what<00:04:10.019> that's<00:04:10.199> about<00:04:10.409> and<00:04:10.979> I<00:04:11.819> think<00:04:11.879> as<00:04:12.150> they

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
what that's about and I think as they

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.699 
what that's about and I think as they
get<00:04:12.419> away<00:04:12.540> from<00:04:12.870> here<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.109> they've<00:04:13.229> all<00:04:13.409> told

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
get away from here and they've all told

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.129 
get away from here and they've all told
me<00:04:13.889> this<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.370> they've<00:04:15.120> never<00:04:15.359> been<00:04:15.569> more<00:04:15.870> or

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
me this that they've never been more or

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.659 
me this that they've never been more or
better<00:04:16.470> taken<00:04:16.829> care<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.039> than<00:04:17.190> their<00:04:17.459> time

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
better taken care of than their time

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.189 
better taken care of than their time
here<00:04:17.849> at<00:04:17.940> Texas<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.570> don't<00:04:18.840> think<00:04:19.019> we're<00:04:19.109> gonna

here at Texas I don't think we're gonna
be<00:04:19.320> in<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.440> same

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
be in the same

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.120 
be in the same

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
something some of the same classes this

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.330 
something some of the same classes this
summer<00:04:31.120> because<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:32.560> know<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.740> helped<00:04:33.190> them

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
summer because you know I helped them

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.279 
summer because you know I helped them
get<00:04:33.520> reacquainted<00:04:33.820> with<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.750> know<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.050> books

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
get reacquainted with you know the books

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.640 
get reacquainted with you know the books
and<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.740> was<00:04:35.830> easier<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.250> study<00:04:36.639> together<00:04:36.850> and

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
and it was easier to study together and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.650 
and it was easier to study together and
just<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.979> know<00:04:39.130> finish<00:04:39.490> out<00:04:39.669> our<00:04:39.880> work<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.389> I

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
think that's why we were in the same

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.100 
think that's why we were in the same
