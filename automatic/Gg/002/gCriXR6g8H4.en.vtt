 [Music]

 hit the spot even working at home 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.869
 it's no joke 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.640
 discipline is one of the rules 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.250
 fundamental for those who want to 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.530
 transfer from home to home stay 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.260
 away from the family's closest chef 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.580
 able to make schedules more flexible 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.610
 some of the reasons they are taking 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.699
 many people setting up a home office are 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.350
 increasingly easy to 500 businesses 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.089
 all the tools to work 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.010
 now they are mobile here in the 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.199
 computer and can be taken to 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 any place wants to build their space in 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.360
 home then let's plan together 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.910
 think about lighting 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.739
 if the corner was set up near the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.089
 window you gain natural light and 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.190
 saves energy 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.500
 if it is not possible to arrange 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.770
 directional lights or fixtures that will give you 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.780
 more visual comfort to work 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.610
 ergonomics the position of the table and 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.250
 are essential for not 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.440
 impair your posture and cause pain 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.450
 You're going to spend hours sitting there. 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.630
 invest in real estate with regulations that 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.800
 can be easily adjusted to the bench 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.349
 should be the size of your 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.990
 needs beyond all the computer must 

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.039
 accommodate printer books being one was 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.530
 to write 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.500
 if you have little space shelves and 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.660
 niches can help the organization is 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.340
 fundamentally a man 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.360
 office is in the shared corner 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.450
 for all 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.539
 pens papers documents everything has to 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.069
 to be in the right place a scrapbook 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.979
 facilitates better visualization of tasks and 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.020
 the commitments do not forget to leave 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.020
 a phone line to cancer 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.390
 if I prefer notebook or desktop beyond 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.880
 less space does not have that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.080
 huge amount of wires and much more 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.179
 Versatile home office also has to be 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.140
 a pleasant place of preference with the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.360
 your face 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.060
 if you can count on the whole world 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.550
 For him, you can use it in the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.340
 ideas here in this environment the people 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.930
 worked the advertising tron space 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.900
 then it is an environment that has this 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.640
 feature of the table 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.470
 people worked a composition with a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.730
 that is an airplane wing that in the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.650
 truth has been adapted to a table 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.599
 has an area of truth that people 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.000
 worked a little corner too. 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.610
 coffee maker so that it has water to 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.340
 able to serve the customers we opt for 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.280
 suspend the customers' chairs to 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.319
 to free up space in his area . 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.290
 work when there is a need to 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.390
 receive someone he lowers the chairs and 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.390
 can receive the person calmly 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.120
 [Music] 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.549
 in this other environment the proposal was 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.470
 completely different the couple 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.660
 concentration was required for the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.810
 work and that's why we made a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.180
 environment a time of color stimulation 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.120
 to avoid dispersion wizards are 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.000
 totally and metric they are equal 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.640
 both on the one hand and on the other 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.190
 the niches of them are is of sizes 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.959
 varied to be able to put both lps 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.239
 that it was something that a 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.040
 collection he already had how many books 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.650
 of different sizes daily books 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.019
 research books and we also create 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.629
 two michu separate decorative objects 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.750
 to avoid being left for an instant 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.599
 totally monotonous with books only 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.989
 the workbench was close to the window 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.049
 help in brightness at the time of study 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.910
 and also when they need it 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:57.349
 distract him a little he can open the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:04:00.169
 window and view the landscape if 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.910
 You do not have much space so I chose 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.829
 a little corner and in your house that we give 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.690
 how to decorate it here in 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.169
 internet found incredible suggestions 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.870
 has an office inside the closet and 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:14.810
 others coming out of niches 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.049
 fixed to the wall or are concentrated 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.750
 on a single piece of furniture looks strange but 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.630
 How many options did I find in a little place? 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.970
 under the window you can create a 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.710
 super cozy and bright 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.410
 thaÃ­sa also created some famous 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.360
 and show us the 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.479
 property was created both for the home 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.940
 office to another function in the 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.729
 case as they use this space only 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.599
 at night to access 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.689
 during the day she can use it 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:49.029
 also with the other makeup function 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.249
 so here we have a support for 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.559
 she has a mirror and a space for 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:56.710
 save all her makeup 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:58.749
 as the space is tiny and is reserved 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.270
 we created this illumination so much for 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:03.699
 facilitate in the aid using the computer 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.889
 How much for the makeup is a lighting 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.150
 specific service meets separately from 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.610
 other ambient lights 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.169
 [Music] 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.990
 this other corner was created for a 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.270
 couple that loves gastronomy then 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.550
 created the home office integrated with 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.900
 cook this way while you're 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.770
