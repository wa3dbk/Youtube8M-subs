ahead of time and store it so that then

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
ahead of time and store it so that then
you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:37.980> crumble<00:00:38.490> it<00:00:38.579> into<00:00:38.880> any<00:00:39.060> kind<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you can just crumble it into any kind of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
you can just crumble it into any kind of
liquid<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> bunch<00:00:40.560> of<00:00:40.680> melted<00:00:41.070> butter<00:00:41.100> on

liquid with a bunch of melted butter on
the<00:00:41.670> stove<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.480> go<00:00:42.600> ahead<00:00:42.720> and<00:00:42.960> start

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the stove I can go ahead and start

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860 
the stove I can go ahead and start
adding<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.560> little<00:00:43.590> bit<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.980> flour<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.870> I'm

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
adding a little bit of flour to it I'm

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.950 
adding a little bit of flour to it I'm
not<00:00:45.930> measuring<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.980> normally<00:00:47.040> don't

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
not measuring because I normally don't

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.900 
not measuring because I normally don't
and<00:00:48.960> since<00:00:49.560> they<00:00:49.710> sent<00:00:49.920> me<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.250> pans<00:00:50.489> let's<00:00:50.790> go

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and since they sent me the pans let's go

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.340 
and since they sent me the pans let's go
ahead<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.210> try<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.450> rack<00:00:51.630> them<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.899> let's<00:00:52.170> use

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
ahead and try and rack them up let's use

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.580 
ahead and try and rack them up let's use
a<00:00:52.380> metal<00:00:52.770> whisk<00:00:53.450> in<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.510> metal<00:00:54.899> pan<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
a metal whisk in the metal pan and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.389 
a metal whisk in the metal pan and
combined<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.520> butter<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> flour<00:01:01.190> until<00:01:02.190> we

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
combined that butter and flour until we

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.889 
combined that butter and flour until we
get<00:01:02.520> something<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:02.910> looks<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.540> kind

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
get something that looks like that kind

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
get something that looks like that kind
of<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:03.989> wallpaper<00:01:04.350> paste<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.579> the

of like wallpaper paste you know the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.039 
of like wallpaper paste you know the

like really thick gooey sludgy kind of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.340 
like really thick gooey sludgy kind of
thing<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.409> dry<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.250> grainy<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:12.120> crumbly<00:01:12.840> but

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
thing not dry not grainy not crumbly but

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.740 
thing not dry not grainy not crumbly but
our<00:01:13.500> Roux<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.220> combination<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:15.150> fat<00:01:15.510> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
our Roux this combination of fat and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
our Roux this combination of fat and
starch<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.860> what's<00:01:17.130> gonna<00:01:17.280> thicken<00:01:17.640> liquid

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
starch is what's gonna thicken liquid

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.910 
starch is what's gonna thicken liquid
for<00:01:18.510> us<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> future<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.740> want

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
for us in the future so we want

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
for us in the future so we want
something<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> little<00:01:21.270> runny

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
something just like that a little runny

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.289 
something just like that a little runny
ER<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.110> isn't<00:01:22.650> bad<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.280> won't<00:01:23.490> thicken<00:01:24.060> as

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
ER it isn't bad but it won't thicken as

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.840 
ER it isn't bad but it won't thicken as
well<00:01:24.510> now<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.200> we've<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> butter<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
well now that we've got the butter and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
well now that we've got the butter and
the<00:01:26.940> flour<00:01:26.970> combined<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.470> next<00:01:28.710> thing<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the flour combined the next thing that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
the flour combined the next thing that
we<00:01:29.070> want<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.580> cook<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> lot<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
we want to do is cook out a lot of the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
we want to do is cook out a lot of the
protein<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.260> the<00:01:31.380> flour<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:32.310> what

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
protein in the flour and that's what

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.850 
protein in the flour and that's what
gives<00:01:33.060> us<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.330> really<00:01:33.479> pasty<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.530> flowery

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
gives us a really pasty really flowery

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.730 
gives us a really pasty really flowery
tasting<00:01:35.820> sauce<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> proteins<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
tasting sauce is the proteins in the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.399 
tasting sauce is the proteins in the
flour<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.670> start<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.689> ruler

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
flour so you start to see in my ruler

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
flour so you start to see in my ruler
where<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.830> starts<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.340> from<00:01:41.580> yellow<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
where it starts to go from yellow to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.850 
where it starts to go from yellow to
white<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.810> where<00:01:43.049> some<00:01:43.260> of<00:01:43.290> these<00:01:43.470> bubbles

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
white and where some of these bubbles

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
white and where some of these bubbles
are<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.210> start<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.570> turn<00:01:45.840> white

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
are you can see it start to turn white

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.289 
are you can see it start to turn white
this<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> proteins<00:01:47.970> are
