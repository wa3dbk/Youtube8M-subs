it<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.389> got<00:02:48.510> my<00:02:48.659> return<00:02:49.019> line<00:02:49.260> coming

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
it and it got my return line coming

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.619 
it and it got my return line coming
right<00:02:49.799> back<00:02:49.980> down<00:02:50.250> going<00:02:51.030> right<00:02:51.180> back<00:02:51.299> into

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
right back down going right back into

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:59.960 
right back down going right back into
the<00:02:51.780> gas<00:02:52.139> tank<00:02:52.170> down<00:02:52.739> here<00:02:58.459> all<00:02:59.459> right<00:02:59.700> let's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the gas tank down here all right let's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:04:03.090 
the gas tank down here all right let's
fire<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.209> up

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.480 

a<00:04:04.290> little<00:04:05.290> bit<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.500> surgeon<00:04:05.920> going<00:04:06.130> down<00:04:06.280> there

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
a little bit of surgeon going down there

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.630 
a little bit of surgeon going down there
I<00:04:06.520> got<00:04:06.760> some<00:04:07.260> at<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.410> big<00:04:08.620> vacuum<00:04:08.860> brake<00:04:09.370> for

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
I got some at the big vacuum brake for

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.910 
I got some at the big vacuum brake for
the<00:04:09.700> brake<00:04:09.880> boosters<00:04:10.300> just<00:04:11.290> sitting<00:04:11.620> here<00:04:11.770> on

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
the brake boosters just sitting here on

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.960 
the brake boosters just sitting here on
plug<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:14.070> that's<00:04:15.070> main<00:04:15.310> reason<00:04:15.610> why<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.760> was

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
plug so that's main reason why I was

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.680 
plug so that's main reason why I was
surging<00:04:16.390> there<00:04:19.200> all<00:04:20.200> right<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.590> it's<00:04:20.770> a<00:04:21.690> it's

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
surging there all right and it's a it's

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.820 
surging there all right and it's a it's
got<00:04:22.810> quite<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:23.050> bit<00:04:23.200> miles<00:04:23.380> on<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:23.770> still

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
got quite a bit miles on it but still

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.990 
got quite a bit miles on it but still
runs<00:04:24.100> good<00:04:26.220> it'll<00:04:27.220> be<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.340> major<00:04:27.610> improvement

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
runs good it'll be a major improvement

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.540 
runs good it'll be a major improvement
for<00:04:28.390> my<00:04:28.740> 92<00:04:29.740> Silverado<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:31.530> TBI<00:04:32.530> motor<00:04:32.860> don't
