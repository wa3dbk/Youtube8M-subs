00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.140
 m 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.450
 especially on 415 we find ourselves for a 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.730
 new video you have 5 years nike 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.960
 unlimited power of money in solo 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.490
 after the 1.12 patch so for that you 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.489
 are first on the internet and you 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.750
 could buy so 800 batiÃ© so 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.540
 I already wanted so I will not 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.550
 do you need them both 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.320
 801 buildings you are going to eat in a 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.320
 of his motorcycles and you're going out of 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.160
 garage 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.989
 once you are outside the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.970
 garage you will pass the bike as 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.739
 here with me he was already so I'm going 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.370
 not do it so would like to put it well 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.370
 in front of the garage 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.140
 ithaca had bought these vehicles 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.250
 so what is the day and once that 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.250
 you have it so you go up 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 and also you have placed so as 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.780
 this one and you go down you go 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.640
 enter the garage 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.950
 once you are in which you 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.270
 go take the other bike and then 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.979
 again you're going out of the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.290
 garage and there normally we went out 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.540
 so the day is sadly going 801 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.509
 voices are blocking you and you're going 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.470
 automatically get off the bike so 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.970
 once you have come down you 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.590
 have more mechanics it is necessary that he 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.229
 find so without selected you 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.399
 go ride on the bike is also you 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.399
 will make the shake tons 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.570
 once you have arrived ls custom 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.920
 you are going to buy the heart is nobel 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.960
 of which $ 4000 once you have 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.390
 bought you placed the bike so 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.960
 like this and as soon as you called 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.250
 again the mechanic a boy reaches 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.840
 once he responds to issue the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.549
 pusher on their rebels and you 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.619
 going so far advanced if you have 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.110
 selected the robert and to be more 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.009
 any right arrow crack once 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.840
 This is done so you did 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.860
 surprise once and twice a 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.480
 times that mark you so if you 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.310
 really want to sell you've waited 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.140
 each and you will have the orange slider 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.650
 who would appear so down right 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.090
 video 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.530
 once it's over you go from 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.930
 the front '' so there as you see I 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.549
 can sell at 8900 from there but it depends 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.110
 if you have cost and museums at most 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:32.450
 or not so obviously when you 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.610
 return to the garage the baci well here 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.650
 so after all it takes 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.330
 declines in your many times so 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.860
 that's all for this video so 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.530
