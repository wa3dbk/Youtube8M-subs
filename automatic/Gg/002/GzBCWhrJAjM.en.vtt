00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:19.710 

I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:36.120 

okay<00:00:20.720> tweaking<00:00:22.060> now<00:00:23.060> lets<00:00:23.510> just<00:00:23.660> hear<00:00:23.840> again

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.320 

sounds<00:00:37.130> pretty<00:00:37.340> good<00:00:37.610> this<00:00:37.910> is<00:00:38.090> being

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
sounds pretty good this is being

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.820 
sounds pretty good this is being
stretched<00:00:38.630> and<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.080> being<00:00:39.320> compressed<00:00:39.590> I

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
stretched and this is being compressed I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.369 
stretched and this is being compressed I
just<00:00:40.010> want<00:00:40.130> to<00:00:40.190> go<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.370> look<00:00:40.580> at<00:00:40.760> this

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
just want to go and look at this

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.130 
just want to go and look at this
transient<00:00:42.379> marker<00:00:42.770> whether<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:43.250> join<00:00:44.140> just

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
transient marker whether to join just

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.750 
transient marker whether to join just
have<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.290> look<00:00:45.440> at<00:00:45.590> that<00:00:45.739> just<00:00:46.190> using<00:00:46.489> a<00:00:46.550> key

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
have a look at that just using a key

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.340 
have a look at that just using a key
command<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.270> zoom<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:47.629> there<00:00:48.550> it's<00:00:49.550> just<00:00:50.350> turn

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
command to zoom in there it's just turn

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.550 
command to zoom in there it's just turn
this<00:00:51.590> off<00:00:52.150> because<00:00:53.150> where<00:00:53.540> does<00:00:53.720> that<00:00:53.870> there's

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
this off because where does that there's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.130 
this off because where does that there's
this<00:00:54.650> flurry<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.730> rule<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.329> who<00:00:56.510> did<00:00:56.690> it<00:00:56.870> if<00:00:57.020> I

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
this flurry to rule it who did it if I

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.800 
this flurry to rule it who did it if I
do<00:00:57.230> don't<00:00:57.980> sort<00:00:58.130> of<00:00:58.250> brood<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.970> flurry<00:00:59.510> a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
do don't sort of brood a flurry a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.920 
do don't sort of brood a flurry a
slurring<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.220> guitar<00:01:01.550> notes<00:01:01.910> before<00:01:02.810> the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
slurring of the guitar notes before the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.010 
slurring of the guitar notes before the
actual<00:01:03.520> dudududududu<00:01:04.520> did<00:01:04.880> indeed<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.570> so

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
actual dudududududu did indeed it is so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.020 
actual dudududududu did indeed it is so
let's<00:01:06.229> see<00:01:06.440> whether<00:01:07.399> this<00:01:07.640> needs<00:01:07.910> to<00:01:07.970> be

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
let's see whether this needs to be

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.060 
let's see whether this needs to be
brought<00:01:08.270> this<00:01:08.479> way<00:01:08.720> bit<00:01:08.990> perhaps<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.530> supply<00:01:10.009> it

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
brought this way bit perhaps I supply it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.920 
brought this way bit perhaps I supply it
from<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.369> very<00:01:10.640> beginning<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.119> that<00:01:11.240> flurry

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.260 

say<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.170> could<00:01:15.560> actually<00:01:15.740> be<00:01:15.950> there<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.970> more

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
say it could actually be there is more

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.389 
say it could actually be there is more
like<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.630> beginning<00:01:18.110> let's<00:01:18.649> try<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:21.399> all

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
like the beginning let's try that all

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.700 
like the beginning let's try that all
right<00:01:22.580> let's<00:01:22.880> try<00:01:23.090> there<00:01:25.540> yeah<00:01:26.540> I'd<00:01:27.260> say<00:01:27.320> it's

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
right let's try there yeah I'd say it's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.550 
right let's try there yeah I'd say it's
more<00:01:27.770> there<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:29.450> I'm<00:01:29.510> gonna<00:01:29.780> put<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.229> into

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
more there so I'm gonna put this into

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.740 
more there so I'm gonna put this into
samples<00:01:31.370> and<00:01:31.580> then<00:01:31.700> holding<00:01:32.030> down<00:01:32.150> alt<00:01:32.330> move

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
samples and then holding down alt move

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.440 
samples and then holding down alt move
that<00:01:33.049> transient<00:01:33.590> marker<00:01:33.979> across<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.740> like

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.810 

then<00:01:41.450> snap<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:45.100> say<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.280> now<00:01:46.430> that's<00:01:46.640> had

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
then snap it I say that now that's had

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.230 
then snap it I say that now that's had
the<00:01:46.940> effect<00:01:47.330> of<00:01:47.540> making<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:49.240> original

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
the effect of making this the original

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.359 
the effect of making this the original
tempo<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.049> was<00:01:51.170> played<00:01:51.409> axis<00:01:51.830> neither<00:01:52.070> green

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
tempo it was played axis neither green

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.690 
tempo it was played axis neither green
or<00:01:52.520> orange<00:01:52.549> this<00:01:53.450> is<00:01:53.600> still<00:01:53.840> stretched<00:01:54.229> but

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
or orange this is still stretched but

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.580 
or orange this is still stretched but
because<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.790> move<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.270> marker<00:01:57.110> down<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:57.500> then

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
because I move this marker down and then

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.289 
because I move this marker down and then
brought<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:57.890> back<00:01:58.070> up<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.490> way<00:01:58.640> it's<00:01:58.820> less

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
brought it back up that way it's less

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.100 
brought it back up that way it's less
stretched<00:02:00.110> lets<00:02:00.710> just<00:02:00.799> hear<00:02:04.750> one<00:02:05.750> see<00:02:06.049> the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
stretched lets just hear one see the

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:27.970 
stretched lets just hear one see the
first<00:02:06.380> four<00:02:06.979> bars<00:02:07.189> here<00:02:07.670> we<00:02:07.759> go

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.320 

this<00:02:28.980> sounds<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> little<00:02:29.580> slow<00:02:29.910> doesn't<00:02:30.270> it

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
this sounds a little slow doesn't it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:40.970 
this sounds a little slow doesn't it
this<00:02:30.510> one<00:02:38.870> maybe<00:02:39.870> that's<00:02:40.080> my<00:02:40.230> imagination<00:02:40.860> as

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
this one maybe that's my imagination as

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.350 
this one maybe that's my imagination as
I<00:02:41.070> said<00:02:41.250> as<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> certain<00:02:41.730> amount<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.000> musical

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
I said as a certain amount of musical

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.530 
I said as a certain amount of musical
interpretation<00:02:42.630> here<00:02:44.150> let's<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.510> a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
interpretation here let's just have a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:58.790 
interpretation here let's just have a
look<00:02:45.600> at<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:54.050> say<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:57.530> zoom<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.710> even

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
look at this say that zoom in even

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.930 
look at this say that zoom in even
further<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:02.130> know<00:03:02.220> I'm<00:03:02.400> actually<00:03:02.550> going<00:03:02.850> to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
further you know I'm actually going to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.030 
further you know I'm actually going to
move<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.630> I'm<00:03:04.530> bowls<00:03:05.780> alt<00:03:06.780> drag<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.890> I'm

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
move that I'm bowls alt drag that I'm

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.710 
move that I'm bowls alt drag that I'm
going<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.220> bring<00:03:08.460> that<00:03:08.490> back<00:03:08.820> further<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
going to bring that back further to the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.280 
going to bring that back further to the
then<00:03:10.350> snap<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.100> back<00:03:11.450> I'll<00:03:12.450> move<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.050> back

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
then snap that back I'll move it back

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.540 
then snap that back I'll move it back
out<00:03:13.500> sale<00:03:14.270> snap<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.890> exactly<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.980> pass<00:03:17.280> him

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
out sale snap it exactly to pass him

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.420 
out sale snap it exactly to pass him
right<00:03:17.910> okay<00:03:18.240> I<00:03:18.560> had<00:03:19.560> very<00:03:19.740> little<00:03:20.070> difference

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
right okay I had very little difference

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:31.500 
right okay I had very little difference
me<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:20.940> very<00:03:21.150> subtle<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:21.810> nicera

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.680 

hmm<00:03:33.190> my<00:03:34.190> son's<00:03:34.550> arrived<00:03:34.849> it<00:03:35.120> sounds<00:03:35.510> pretty

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
hmm my son's arrived it sounds pretty

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.740 
hmm my son's arrived it sounds pretty
good<00:03:36.819> entirely<00:03:37.819> convinced<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.300> really<00:03:38.599> was

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
good entirely convinced that really was

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.470 
good entirely convinced that really was
helpful<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.410> did<00:03:39.769> there<00:03:40.010> by<00:03:40.940> moving<00:03:41.239> this

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
helpful I did there by moving this

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.720 
helpful I did there by moving this
marker<00:03:41.959> further<00:03:42.290> from<00:03:42.739> where<00:03:42.980> it<00:03:43.310> was<00:03:43.340> there

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
marker further from where it was there

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.670 
marker further from where it was there
to<00:03:44.120> there<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.660> then<00:03:44.720> bringing<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.290> back<00:03:45.440> this

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
to there and then bringing it back this

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.800 
to there and then bringing it back this
way<00:03:45.950> we<00:03:46.190> in<00:03:46.280> fact<00:03:46.459> stretched<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.180> bar<00:03:47.510> more

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
way we in fact stretched this bar more

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.390 
way we in fact stretched this bar more
haven't<00:03:48.170> we<00:03:48.290> but<00:03:48.470> we've<00:03:48.590> slightly<00:03:49.010> compressed

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
haven't we but we've slightly compressed

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.449 
haven't we but we've slightly compressed
this<00:03:49.760> bar<00:03:50.590> let's<00:03:51.590> go<00:03:51.769> down<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:51.980> look<00:03:52.160> at<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
this bar let's go down and look at the

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:00.369 
this bar let's go down and look at the
end<00:03:52.580> of<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.879> bar<00:03:55.000> mm<00:03:56.000> that's<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.690> bit<00:03:59.379> alright

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
end of that bar mm that's a bit alright

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.380 
end of that bar mm that's a bit alright
let's<00:04:00.650> listen<00:04:01.040> if<00:04:01.730> we<00:04:01.819> got<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.030> beginning<00:04:02.360> of

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
let's listen if we got the beginning of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.000 
let's listen if we got the beginning of
bar<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.660> ride<00:04:03.170> pause<00:04:03.709> play<00:04:05.709> see<00:04:06.709> again<00:04:06.980> that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
bar a ride pause play see again that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.850 
bar a ride pause play see again that
could<00:04:07.370> be<00:04:07.549> moved<00:04:08.410> because<00:04:09.410> it's<00:04:09.650> in<00:04:09.799> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
could be moved because it's in the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.620 
could be moved because it's in the
middle<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.069> that<00:04:10.220> flurry<00:04:10.670> isn't<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.269> maybe

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
middle of that flurry isn't it and maybe

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.110 
middle of that flurry isn't it and maybe
that's<00:04:11.870> more<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.290> attack<00:04:12.590> there<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:13.640> strike

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
that's more the attack there that strike

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.300 
that's more the attack there that strike
zone<00:04:14.150> let<00:04:14.630> me<00:04:14.690> hold<00:04:14.870> down<00:04:15.079> alt<00:04:15.110> within<00:04:15.680> samples

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
zone let me hold down alt within samples

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.120 
zone let me hold down alt within samples
just<00:04:16.690> move<00:04:17.690> this<00:04:17.870> transit<00:04:18.350> marker<00:04:18.739> along<00:04:19.100> a

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
just move this transit marker along a

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.050 
just move this transit marker along a
bit<00:04:19.459> let's<00:04:19.880> say<00:04:20.150> two<00:04:20.209> there<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:22.789> bring<00:04:23.030> that

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
bit let's say two there and bring that

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.820 
bit let's say two there and bring that
back<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.539> bar<00:04:23.750> right<00:04:24.789> let's<00:04:25.789> hear<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:29.830> bit

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
back to bar right let's hear that a bit

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.850 
back to bar right let's hear that a bit
clipped<00:04:31.190> maybe<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:32.050> alt

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.750 

see<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:44.080> if<00:04:45.080> it's<00:04:45.260> more<00:04:45.500> on<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.770> big<00:04:46.220> attack

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
see that if it's more on the big attack

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.520 
see that if it's more on the big attack
transient<00:04:49.300> well<00:04:50.300> actually<00:04:50.480> yeah<00:04:50.870> okay<00:04:51.350> so<00:04:51.410> I'm

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
transient well actually yeah okay so I'm

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.940 
transient well actually yeah okay so I'm
going<00:04:51.650> to<00:04:51.680> move<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:52.010> up<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.400> there<00:04:53.890> and<00:04:54.890> then

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
going to move it up to there and then

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.040 
going to move it up to there and then
bring<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.610> back<00:04:55.790> to<00:04:55.820> power<00:04:56.090> 6<00:04:56.300> i'll<00:04:56.510> snap<00:04:56.870> in

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
bring that back to power 6 i'll snap in

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.600 
bring that back to power 6 i'll snap in
fact<00:04:57.380> with<00:04:57.560> Pete<00:04:58.160> as<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.700> snap<00:05:00.370> right<00:05:01.370> that's

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
fact with Pete as the snap right that's

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.180 
fact with Pete as the snap right that's
had<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:01.910> effect<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.360> we<00:05:03.140> moved<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.740> transit

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
had the effect of we moved that transit

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.800 
had the effect of we moved that transit
maka<00:05:04.400> further<00:05:04.730> in<00:05:04.970> this<00:05:05.090> so<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:05.660> it<00:05:05.720> will

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
maka further in this so I so it will

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.840 
maka further in this so I so it will
have<00:05:05.870> shortened<00:05:06.560> this<00:05:06.800> bar<00:05:07.070> actually<00:05:07.310> and

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
have shortened this bar actually and

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.940 
have shortened this bar actually and
made<00:05:08.360> that<00:05:08.630> bar<00:05:08.930> slightly<00:05:10.900> longer<00:05:11.900> I<00:05:12.380> see<00:05:12.890> if

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
made that bar slightly longer I see if

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:22.020 
made that bar slightly longer I see if
that<00:05:13.070> sounds<00:05:13.400> like<00:05:13.550> rubbish<00:05:14.000> there<00:05:14.960> we<00:05:15.050> go

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
them back to 44 turn off the metronome

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.290 
them back to 44 turn off the metronome
okay<00:06:01.770> so<00:06:01.830> we<00:06:02.009> got<00:06:02.099> our<00:06:02.219> bar<00:06:02.430> markers<00:06:02.819> lined<00:06:03.090> up

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
okay so we got our bar markers lined up

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.390 
okay so we got our bar markers lined up
and<00:06:03.449> it's<00:06:03.599> actually<00:06:03.840> sounding<00:06:04.319> really<00:06:04.500> okay<00:06:05.370> I

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
and it's actually sounding really okay I

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.339 
and it's actually sounding really okay I
mean<00:06:05.759> to<00:06:06.150> be<00:06:06.180> honest<00:06:06.509> if<00:06:06.599> you<00:06:06.629> played<00:06:07.080> that

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
mean to be honest if you played that

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.570 
mean to be honest if you played that
eight<00:06:07.590> click<00:06:09.379> to<00:06:10.379> a<00:06:10.409> guitarist<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:10.979> said<00:06:11.189> play

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
eight click to a guitarist and said play

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.629 
eight click to a guitarist and said play
that<00:06:11.879> riff<00:06:12.210> along<00:06:12.539> to<00:06:12.719> that<00:06:12.870> count<00:06:13.460> but<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.550> be

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
that riff along to that count but to be

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.709 
that riff along to that count but to be
honest<00:06:14.849> I<00:06:14.939> doubt<00:06:15.090> they'd<00:06:15.300> come<00:06:15.449> up<00:06:15.569> with

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
honest I doubt they'd come up with

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.240 
honest I doubt they'd come up with
anything<00:06:16.020> tighter<00:06:16.409> than<00:06:16.710> that<00:06:16.770> that's

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
anything tighter than that that's

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.379 
anything tighter than that that's
actually<00:06:17.430> sounding<00:06:17.969> or<00:06:18.060> I<00:06:18.090> mean<00:06:18.330> that's

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
actually sounding or I mean that's

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.110 
actually sounding or I mean that's
usable<00:06:18.960> now<00:06:21.560> and<00:06:22.560> it's<00:06:22.680> usable<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.400> rounded

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
usable now and it's usable a rounded

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.140 
usable now and it's usable a rounded
full<00:06:24.360> tempo<00:06:24.840> of<00:06:24.960> 89<00:06:25.740> rather<00:06:26.340> than<00:06:26.520> 88<00:06:26.909> points

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
full tempo of 89 rather than 88 points

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.360 
full tempo of 89 rather than 88 points
something<00:06:27.780> all<00:06:27.900> over<00:06:28.169> you<00:06:28.259> and<00:06:28.409> it's<00:06:29.009> working

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
something all over you and it's working

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.790 
something all over you and it's working
across<00:06:29.759> eight<00:06:30.150> bars<00:06:30.569> so<00:06:31.259> the<00:06:31.440> next<00:06:31.469> thing<00:06:31.650> we

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
across eight bars so the next thing we

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.490 
across eight bars so the next thing we
need<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:31.949> do<00:06:32.069> is<00:06:32.129> bring<00:06:32.280> in<00:06:32.400> a<00:06:32.460> drum<00:06:32.639> be<00:06:33.500> and

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
need to do is bring in a drum be and

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.409 
need to do is bring in a drum be and
then<00:06:34.800> find<00:06:35.520> tweak<00:06:35.819> if<00:06:36.449> necessary<00:06:37.169> any<00:06:37.379> interim

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
then find tweak if necessary any interim

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.670 
then find tweak if necessary any interim
transient<00:06:39.419> markers<00:06:39.750> within<00:06:39.930> each<00:06:40.169> bar<00:06:40.469> to

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
transient markers within each bar to

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.769 
transient markers within each bar to
suit<00:06:40.979> the<00:06:41.250> beat<00:06:41.430> to<00:06:41.879> make<00:06:42.060> the<00:06:42.210> feel<00:06:42.449> better

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:42.779 
suit the beat to make the feel better

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:45.499 
suit the beat to make the feel better
you<00:06:43.050> know<00:06:43.080> it's<00:06:43.560> all<00:06:43.849> listen<00:06:44.849> and<00:06:45.000> tweak<00:06:45.240> and

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
you know it's all listen and tweak and

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.920 
you know it's all listen and tweak and
to<00:06:45.689> taste<00:06:45.960> really<00:06:46.620> so<00:06:47.340> that<00:06:47.520> is<00:06:47.699> the<00:06:47.930> final

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
to taste really so that is the final

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.439 
to taste really so that is the final
stage<00:06:49.229> getting<00:06:50.159> a<00:06:50.250> drumbeat<00:06:50.520> to<00:06:50.939> go<00:06:51.090> with<00:06:51.300> it

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
stage getting a drumbeat to go with it

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:55.369 
stage getting a drumbeat to go with it
and<00:06:51.539> then<00:06:52.529> tweaking<00:06:53.099> any<00:06:53.750> interim<00:06:54.750> transient

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379 
and then tweaking any interim transient

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.490 
and then tweaking any interim transient
markers<00:06:55.680> within<00:06:55.860> each<00:06:56.069> bar<00:06:56.370> if<00:06:56.610> necessary<00:06:57.500> so

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
markers within each bar if necessary so

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.360 
markers within each bar if necessary so
let's<00:06:58.680> move<00:06:58.830> on<00:06:58.979> to<00:06:59.009> that<00:06:59.279> final<00:06:59.879> stage
