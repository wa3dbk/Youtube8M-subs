to<00:01:55.290> ignite<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.920> air<00:01:56.100> fuel<00:01:56.430> mixture<00:01:57.170> okay<00:01:58.170> let

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to ignite the air fuel mixture okay let

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.819 
to ignite the air fuel mixture okay let
me<00:01:58.829> back<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.070> let's<00:01:59.759> talk<00:01:59.969> about<00:02:00.149> why<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.469> coil

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
me back up let's talk about why the coil

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.490 
me back up let's talk about why the coil
has<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.310> amplify<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.600> electrical<00:02:04.140> current

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
has to amplify the electrical current

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
has to amplify the electrical current
okay<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.969> crucial<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.780> how<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
okay this is this is crucial on how the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.690 
okay this is this is crucial on how the
engine<00:02:07.530> works<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.099> understand<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
engine works and to understand it you

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.279 
engine works and to understand it you
have<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.060> understand<00:02:09.509> how<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> four-stroke

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
have to understand how a four-stroke

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.620 
have to understand how a four-stroke
engine<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:11.459> put<00:02:11.700> together<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.120> how<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.270> work

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
engine is put together and how it work

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.380 
engine is put together and how it work
okay<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.650> video<00:02:13.890> number<00:02:14.130> one<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.820> talked

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
okay so in video number one I talked

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.210 
okay so in video number one I talked
about<00:02:15.540> what<00:02:15.960> we<00:02:16.050> call<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.410> intake<00:02:16.860> stroke

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
about what we call the intake stroke

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.910 
about what we call the intake stroke
where<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.630> got<00:02:18.750> our<00:02:18.780> piston<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.350> top<00:02:19.470> dead

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
where we got our piston on top dead

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.330 
where we got our piston on top dead
center<00:02:20.340> alright<00:02:21.240> our<00:02:21.510> intake<00:02:22.410> valve<00:02:22.770> begins

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
center alright our intake valve begins

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.850 
center alright our intake valve begins
to<00:02:23.520> open<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:24.030> our<00:02:24.150> piston<00:02:24.540> travels<00:02:24.960> down<00:02:25.260> that

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
to open as our piston travels down that

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.310 
to open as our piston travels down that
creates<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.400> suction<00:02:26.760> pulling<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.870> our<00:02:28.050> air

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
creates a suction pulling in our air

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.010 
creates a suction pulling in our air
fuel<00:02:28.890> mixture<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.910> now<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.420> our<00:02:30.540> air<00:02:30.690> fuel

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
fuel mixture so now we have our air fuel

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.870 
fuel mixture so now we have our air fuel
mixture<00:02:31.050> completely<00:02:31.800> filling<00:02:32.490> up<00:02:32.700> our

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
mixture completely filling up our

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.240 
mixture completely filling up our
cylinder<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.960> piston<00:02:34.500> begins<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.040> come

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
cylinder as this piston begins to come

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.770 
cylinder as this piston begins to come
back<00:02:35.520> up<00:02:35.850> okay

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
back up okay

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.950 
back up okay
the<00:02:37.530> intake<00:02:37.860> valve<00:02:38.160> will<00:02:38.400> close<00:02:38.760> now<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.750> will

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
the intake valve will close now it will

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.430 
the intake valve will close now it will
compress<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:41.400> air<00:02:41.430> fuel<00:02:42.210> mixture<00:02:42.240> up<00:02:42.870> against

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
compress the air fuel mixture up against

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.820 
compress the air fuel mixture up against
the<00:02:43.590> head<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.490> why<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:44.880> has<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.390> do<00:02:45.540> that

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
the head this is why it has to do that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.800 
the head this is why it has to do that
for<00:02:46.830> example<00:02:46.920> take<00:02:47.790> some<00:02:48.000> gunpowder<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.720> you

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
for example take some gunpowder if you

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.750 
for example take some gunpowder if you
take<00:02:48.990> gunpowder<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.280> spread<00:02:50.580> it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
take gunpowder and you just spread it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.400 
take gunpowder and you just spread it
out<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.090> table<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.810> light<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.260> all

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
out on the table and you light it all

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.190 
out on the table and you light it all
you're<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.100> get<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.520> fire<00:02:53.940> okay<00:02:54.570> now

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
you're going to get is a fire okay now

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.350 
you're going to get is a fire okay now
if<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.470> take<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.740> very<00:02:56.220> same<00:02:56.550> gunpowder<00:02:57.090> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
if you take that very same gunpowder and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.930 
if you take that very same gunpowder and
pack<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.110> tightly<00:02:58.440> into<00:02:58.830> something<00:02:59.220> or<00:02:59.550> into<00:02:59.910> a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
pack it tightly into something or into a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.300 
pack it tightly into something or into a
firecracker<00:03:00.660> when<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.350> light<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.890> you're

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
firecracker when you light it you're

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.970 
firecracker when you light it you're
going<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.520> get<00:03:02.640> an<00:03:02.760> explosion<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:04.170> explosion

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
going to get an explosion that explosion

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.890 
going to get an explosion that explosion
inside<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.940> engine<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.540> tightly

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
inside that engine so it's tightly

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.530 
inside that engine so it's tightly
compressed<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.710> explosion<00:03:08.280> that's<00:03:09.210> where

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
compressed that explosion that's where

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.570 
compressed that explosion that's where
all<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.960> horsepower<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.890> speed<00:03:11.310> are

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
all the horsepower and the speed are

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.050 
all the horsepower and the speed are
created<00:03:12.270> so<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:13.260> problem<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:14.070> when<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
created so the problem is when it is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.870 
created so the problem is when it is
compressed<00:03:15.900> really<00:03:16.440> tight<00:03:16.710> it's<00:03:17.070> hard<00:03:17.670> to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
compressed really tight it's hard to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.140 
compressed really tight it's hard to
ignite<00:03:18.210> so<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.350> larger<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.950> spark<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.760> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
ignite so the larger the spark and the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.360 
ignite so the larger the spark and the
longer<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> spark<00:03:22.260> we<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.620> get<00:03:22.770> on<00:03:22.890> our<00:03:22.920> spark

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
longer the spark we can get on our spark

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.090 
longer the spark we can get on our spark
plug<00:03:23.700> that's<00:03:24.270> going<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.750> ignite<00:03:25.200> or<00:03:25.500> combust

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
plug that's going to ignite or combust

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.730 
plug that's going to ignite or combust
all<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.030> airflow<00:03:27.630> or<00:03:27.660> all<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.140> fuel<00:03:28.470> and

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
all of that airflow or all that fuel and

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.830 
all of that airflow or all that fuel and
air<00:03:28.860> mixture<00:03:29.100> completely<00:03:29.700> giving<00:03:30.570> us<00:03:30.690> the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
air mixture completely giving us the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.890 
air mixture completely giving us the
most<00:03:31.020> efficient<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.280> most<00:03:32.520> horsepower

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
most efficient in the most horsepower

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.210 
most efficient in the most horsepower
possible<00:03:34.010> okay<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.520> now<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.820> we<00:03:36.090> understand

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
possible okay so now that we understand

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.710 
possible okay so now that we understand
how<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.250> electrical<00:03:38.850> system<00:03:39.180> works<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.570> how

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
how the electrical system works and how

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.360 
how the electrical system works and how
you<00:03:39.780> know<00:03:40.110> how<00:03:40.260> we<00:03:40.320> get<00:03:40.560> speed<00:03:40.890> how<00:03:41.070> we<00:03:41.130> get

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
you know how we get speed how we get

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.940 
you know how we get speed how we get
horsepower<00:03:41.850> okay<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.750> first<00:03:42.990> thing<00:03:43.380> to

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
horsepower okay the first thing to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.949 
horsepower okay the first thing to
maximize<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:44.940> how<00:03:45.150> do<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.300> maximize<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
maximize this how do you maximize the

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.420 
maximize this how do you maximize the
speed<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.680> how<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:46.860> maximize<00:03:47.100> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
speed and how you maximize the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.650 
speed and how you maximize the
horsepower<00:03:48.000> okay

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
horsepower okay

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.630 
horsepower okay
now<00:03:48.959> I'm<00:03:49.110> assuming<00:03:49.200> you're<00:03:50.040> running<00:03:50.459> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
if you just upgrade to this don't expect

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.810 
if you just upgrade to this don't expect
a<00:04:18.480> lot<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.840> performance<00:04:19.320> gains<00:04:19.650> okay<00:04:20.310> we've

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
a lot of performance gains okay we've

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.880 
a lot of performance gains okay we've
tested<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.900> may<00:04:22.080> get<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.290> little<00:04:22.620> bit<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.830> a

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
tested it you may get a little bit of a

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.260 
tested it you may get a little bit of a
gain<00:04:23.100> but<00:04:23.520> you're<00:04:23.669> not<00:04:23.820> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.120> get

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
gain but you're not going to get

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.120 
gain but you're not going to get
increased<00:04:25.169> speed<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.470> horsepower

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
increased speed and horsepower

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.530 
increased speed and horsepower
or<00:04:26.190> anything<00:04:26.370> like<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:26.970> may<00:04:27.090> get<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.300> tiny

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
or anything like that you may get a tiny

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.840 
or anything like that you may get a tiny
little<00:04:27.690> bit<00:04:28.050> but<00:04:28.440> why<00:04:29.010> is<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.340> important<00:04:29.820> to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
little bit but why is it important to

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.510 
little bit but why is it important to
run<00:04:30.150> this<00:04:30.390> with<00:04:31.050> these<00:04:31.440> aftermarket<00:04:31.920> parts

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
run this with these aftermarket parts

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.300 
run this with these aftermarket parts
okay<00:04:33.000> or<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.810> can<00:04:33.960> run<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.140> stock<00:04:34.530> just<00:04:35.040> don't

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
okay or you can run it stock just don't

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.620 
okay or you can run it stock just don't
mean<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:35.670> don't<00:04:35.880> expect<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.240> whole<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.600> know

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
mean just don't expect a whole you know

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.880 
mean just don't expect a whole you know
just<00:04:36.900> don't<00:04:36.960> expect<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.380> lot<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.650> horsepower

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
just don't expect a lot of horsepower

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.730 
just don't expect a lot of horsepower
gains<00:04:38.340> okay<00:04:38.670> what<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.390> is<00:04:39.630> this<00:04:39.900> has<00:04:40.170> a<00:04:40.440> lot

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
gains okay what this is this has a lot

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.680 
gains okay what this is this has a lot
better<00:04:41.040> parts<00:04:41.490> inside<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.300> okay<00:04:42.480> better

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
better parts inside of it okay better

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.470 
better parts inside of it okay better
transistors<00:04:43.320> than<00:04:43.890> your<00:04:44.070> stock<00:04:44.280> box<00:04:44.640> okay

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
transistors than your stock box okay

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.830 
transistors than your stock box okay
number<00:04:45.930> two<00:04:46.320> all<00:04:47.190> right<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.910> has<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.210> way<00:04:48.570> of

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
number two all right this has a way of

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.980 
number two all right this has a way of
increasing<00:04:49.700> how<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:51.060> gets<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.420> electrical

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
increasing how it gets the electrical

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.270 
increasing how it gets the electrical
charge<00:04:52.290> to<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.150> coil<00:04:54.450> so<00:04:54.950> when<00:04:55.950> we<00:04:56.070> run

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
charge to to the coil so when we run

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.400 
charge to to the coil so when we run
more<00:04:56.520> more<00:04:56.970> air<00:04:57.270> fuel<00:04:57.600> mixture<00:04:57.630> in<00:04:58.050> engines

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
more more air fuel mixture in engines

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.460 
more more air fuel mixture in engines
we're<00:04:58.920> going<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.100> get<00:04:59.190> more<00:04:59.490> rpm<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.690> more<00:05:00.930> rpm

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
we're going to get more rpm the more rpm

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.860 
we're going to get more rpm the more rpm
we<00:05:01.800> have<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.520> faster<00:05:03.150> we<00:05:03.300> have<00:05:03.480> to<00:05:03.600> get<00:05:03.750> that

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
we have the faster we have to get that

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.690 
we have the faster we have to get that
electrical<00:05:04.350> charge<00:05:04.620> up<00:05:04.860> there<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.190> make<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
going to start a little bit better may

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.710 
going to start a little bit better may
run<00:05:14.640> a<00:05:14.670> little<00:05:14.820> bit<00:05:14.970> smoother<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:15.510> things

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
run a little bit smoother and things

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.240 
run a little bit smoother and things
like<00:05:15.930> that<00:05:16.170> okay<00:05:16.410> this<00:05:16.650> thing<00:05:16.830> here<00:05:17.010> just

like that okay this thing here just

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.940 
like that okay this thing here just
keeps<00:05:17.460> up<00:05:17.670> better<00:05:17.910> when<00:05:18.540> you're<00:05:18.840> at<00:05:18.990> high<00:05:19.380> rpm

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
keeps up better when you're at high rpm

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.270 
keeps up better when you're at high rpm
in<00:05:20.130> your<00:05:20.310> full<00:05:20.550> throttle<00:05:21.060> okay<00:05:21.510> now<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:23.250> next

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
in your full throttle okay now the next

thing I'm going to suggest you upgrade
to<00:05:26.010> is<00:05:26.400> going<00:05:26.910> to<00:05:27.120> be<00:05:27.270> our<00:05:27.480> aftermarket<00:05:28.050> coil

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
to is going to be our aftermarket coil

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.880 
to is going to be our aftermarket coil
now<00:05:29.430> this<00:05:30.060> cool<00:05:30.330> does<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.750> exact<00:05:31.170> same<00:05:31.500> thing

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
now this cool does the exact same thing

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.020 
now this cool does the exact same thing
as<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.400> stock<00:05:32.670> coil<00:05:33.080> except<00:05:34.080> okay<00:05:34.680> it

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
as the stock coil except okay it

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.900 
as the stock coil except okay it
amplifies<00:05:36.030> at<00:05:36.540> a<00:05:36.600> much<00:05:37.140> higher<00:05:37.560> rate<00:05:38.070> than<00:05:38.700> the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
amplifies at a much higher rate than the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.320 
amplifies at a much higher rate than the
stock<00:05:39.210> coil<00:05:39.570> this<00:05:40.050> coil<00:05:40.380> here<00:05:40.890> will<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:42.210> know

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
stock coil this coil here will you know

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.980 
stock coil this coil here will you know
it<00:05:42.510> will<00:05:42.630> go<00:05:42.750> up<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.290> 30,000<00:05:44.220> plus<00:05:44.400> volts<00:05:45.240> okay

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
it will go up to 30,000 plus volts okay

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.760 
it will go up to 30,000 plus volts okay
so<00:05:46.560> this<00:05:47.010> is<00:05:47.280> super<00:05:47.670> essential<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:49.080> have<00:05:49.350> this

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
so this is super essential to have this

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.740 
so this is super essential to have this
when<00:05:50.310> you<00:05:50.340> have<00:05:50.610> this<00:05:50.820> increase<00:05:51.450> air/fuel

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
when you have this increase air/fuel

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.650 
when you have this increase air/fuel
mixture<00:05:52.500> okay<00:05:52.620> if<00:05:53.010> you<00:05:53.400> don't<00:05:53.700> you<00:05:54.210> may<00:05:54.420> not

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
mixture okay if you don't you may not

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.630 
mixture okay if you don't you may not
ignite<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.350> entire<00:05:55.440> air<00:05:55.920> fuel<00:05:56.190> mixture<00:05:56.220> that

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
ignite the entire air fuel mixture that

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.100 
ignite the entire air fuel mixture that
you<00:05:56.760> have<00:05:57.000> so<00:05:57.480> what<00:05:57.510> you're<00:05:57.750> doing<00:05:57.960> is<00:05:58.020> you're

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
you have so what you're doing is you're

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.630 
you have so what you're doing is you're
robbing<00:05:58.440> yourself<00:05:58.500> of<00:05:58.830> horsepower<00:05:59.340> and

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
robbing yourself of horsepower and

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.690 
robbing yourself of horsepower and
you're<00:06:00.060> robbing<00:06:00.390> yourself<00:06:00.480> of<00:06:00.810> speed<00:06:01.650> okay<00:06:02.220> so

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
you're robbing yourself of speed okay so

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.300 
you're robbing yourself of speed okay so
that's<00:06:03.180> what<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:03.360> recommend<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.440> aftermarket
