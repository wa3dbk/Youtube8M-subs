00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
obviously you can see the big difference

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.240 
obviously you can see the big difference
right<00:01:27.920> now<00:01:28.510> this<00:01:29.620> screen<00:01:30.620> was<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.890> ball

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
right now this screen was the ball

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.640

with that 800 by 600 resolution and the
past<00:01:39.380> 10<00:01:39.590> test<00:01:40.190> pattern<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.760> we<00:01:40.880> use<00:01:41.120> is

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
past 10 test pattern that we use is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.900 
past 10 test pattern that we use is
called<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:41.780> -<00:01:42.170> with<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.250> color<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.850> the

another one on four corners and then

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.229 
another one on four corners and then
they<00:02:12.769> measure<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.640> an<00:02:13.760> average<00:02:13.909> value

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
they measure and get an average value

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.929 
they measure and get an average value
and<00:02:14.629> then<00:02:15.260> they<00:02:15.560> come<00:02:15.769> by<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.010> needs<00:02:16.340> that's

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
and then they come by the needs that's

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.550 
and then they come by the needs that's
how<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.239> can<00:02:17.480> find<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.870> needs<00:02:18.079> on<00:02:18.290> this

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
how we can find the needs on this

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.680 
how we can find the needs on this
specification<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.550> all<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:19.940> measurement<00:02:20.599> is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
specification so all this measurement is

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.550 
specification so all this measurement is
done<00:02:20.930> inside<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:22.099> dot<00:02:22.310> rooms<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.540> anyway<00:02:24.349> on

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
done inside the dot rooms so anyway on

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.650 
done inside the dot rooms so anyway on
this<00:02:24.770> video<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.550> just<00:02:25.760> want<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.030> show<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.270> a

you<00:03:18.680> see<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.950> difference<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.090> done<00:03:20.360> by

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
you see the difference this is done by

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.180 
you see the difference this is done by
the<00:03:20.510> equipment's<00:03:21.080> so<00:03:21.590> let's<00:03:21.799> say<00:03:21.890> what<00:03:22.040> kind

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
the equipment's so let's say what kind

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.949 
the equipment's so let's say what kind
of<00:03:22.220> equipment<00:03:22.400> again<00:03:22.730> let's<00:03:22.910> see<00:03:23.060> now<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.810> is

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
of equipment again let's see now this is

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.949 
of equipment again let's see now this is
it<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.180> mean<00:03:26.600> older<00:03:26.930> meter<00:03:27.160> okay<00:03:28.160> and

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
it this is mean older meter okay and

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:37.330 
it this is mean older meter okay and
then<00:03:30.700> me<00:03:31.700> loader<00:03:34.390> all<00:03:35.390> right<00:03:36.220> at<00:03:37.220> the

then me loader all right at the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.280 
then me loader all right at the
beginning<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.000> video<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.660> was<00:03:39.049> mentioning

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
beginning of this video I was mentioning

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.199 
beginning of this video I was mentioning
about<00:03:39.590> MSA<00:03:41.410> four<00:03:42.410> five<00:03:42.739> six<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.280> be<00:03:43.519> settings

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
about MSA four five six you be settings

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.710 
about MSA four five six you be settings
the<00:03:44.720> seven<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:46.069> was<00:03:46.370> on<00:03:46.579> that's<00:03:47.450> why<00:03:47.660> you

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the seven and a was on that's why you

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.900 
the seven and a was on that's why you
see<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.109> previous<00:03:48.290> video<00:03:48.709> was<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:49.340> bright<00:03:49.639> and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
see the previous video was so bright and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.020 
see the previous video was so bright and
you<00:03:50.329> get<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.569> cheaper<00:03:51.049> sunlight<00:03:51.530> readable

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
you get a cheaper sunlight readable

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.120 
now we're going to use a meter to test
it<00:05:17.910> let<00:05:18.900> me<00:05:18.930> go<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.229> site<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:21.289> okay<00:05:22.289> all<00:05:22.919> right

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
it let me go to site and okay all right

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.659 
it let me go to site and okay all right
so<00:05:23.849> now<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.240> testing<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:25.039> OC<00:05:26.039> screen<00:05:26.430> at

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
so now is testing a OC screen at

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.790 
so now is testing a OC screen at
minimize<00:05:27.800> output<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:30.139> all<00:05:31.139> right<00:05:31.380> so<00:05:31.620> let's

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
minimize output and all right so let's

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.230 
minimize output and all right so let's
check<00:05:31.860> out<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.220> meter<00:05:33.530> Wow<00:05:34.590> still<00:05:35.000> 423<00:05:36.000> and

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
check out the meter Wow still 423 and

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.420 
check out the meter Wow still 423 and
let's<00:05:37.229> check<00:05:37.410> out<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:38.870> CCF<00:05:39.870> I<00:05:40.020> one<00:05:40.229> see<00:05:40.860> what<00:05:41.160> is

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
let's check out a CCF I one see what is

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:48.890 
let's check out a CCF I one see what is
the<00:05:42.979> dryness<00:05:44.780> level<00:05:45.780> or<00:05:45.930> neat<00:05:47.419> all<00:05:48.419> right<00:05:48.630> so

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
the dryness level or neat all right so

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.870 
the dryness level or neat all right so
it's<00:05:49.080> finished<00:05:49.440> let's<00:05:50.400> see

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
it's finished let's see

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.990 
it's finished let's see
yes<00:05:51.660> about<00:05:51.900> one<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:52.410> 24<00:05:52.949> that's<00:05:53.520> about<00:05:53.789> right

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
yes about one and 24 that's about right

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.570 
yes about one and 24 that's about right
same<00:05:54.479> as<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:54.750> one<00:05:54.870> before<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:56.010> obviously<00:05:56.039> you

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
same as the one before so obviously you

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.270 
same as the one before so obviously you
can<00:05:56.729> see<00:05:56.760> even<00:05:57.449> though<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.110> is<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.500> minimize<00:05:58.949> a

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
can see even though it is the minimize a

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.540 
can see even though it is the minimize a
output<00:06:00.060> on<00:06:00.240> led<00:06:00.780> contour<00:06:01.560> is<00:06:02.010> still<00:06:02.310> much

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
output on led contour is still much

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.980 
output on led contour is still much
brighter<00:06:02.910> than<00:06:03.210> a<00:06:04.280> CCFL<00:06:05.280> screen<00:06:05.660> now<00:06:06.660> it's

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
brighter than a CCFL screen now it's

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.260 
brighter than a CCFL screen now it's
signing<00:06:07.349> a<00:06:07.440> minimum<00:06:08.039> it's<00:06:08.490> a<00:06:08.580> two<00:06:08.789> three<00:06:08.970> on

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
signing a minimum it's a two three on

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.080 
signing a minimum it's a two three on
and<00:06:09.710> this<00:06:10.710> is<00:06:10.860> CCFL<00:06:11.520> this<00:06:11.880> is<00:06:12.120> LED<00:06:12.930> kids<00:06:13.229> I<00:06:14.099> want

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
led left side is a CCFL obviously you

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.029 
led left side is a CCFL obviously you
can<00:07:10.330> see<00:07:10.539> the<00:07:10.720> difference<00:07:13.710> remember<00:07:14.710> right

can see the difference remember right

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.260 
can see the difference remember right
now<00:07:15.070> it's<00:07:15.610> on<00:07:15.849> a<00:07:15.880> minimum<00:07:17.699> current<00:07:18.699> output

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
now it's on a minimum current output

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.029 
now it's on a minimum current output
