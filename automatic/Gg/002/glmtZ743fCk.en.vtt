00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
creo parametric now I have created a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.749 
creo parametric now I have created a
very<00:00:12.389> simple<00:00:12.719> box<00:00:13.170> using<00:00:13.590> blender<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.519> then

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
very simple box using blender and then

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.560 
very simple box using blender and then
flange<00:00:15.089> wall<00:00:15.299> now<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> want<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.800> create<00:00:17.010> some

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
flange wall now I want to create some

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.920

cutout<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.770> box<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.970> necessarily<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> need

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
cutout on this box so necessarily I need

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.769 
cutout on this box so necessarily I need
to<00:00:22.080> unbend<00:00:22.519> this<00:00:23.519> box<00:00:23.850> because<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.510> cannot

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
to unbend this box because one cannot

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.790 
to unbend this box because one cannot
form<00:00:25.680> such<00:00:25.980> operation<00:00:27.170> practically<00:00:28.170> also<00:00:28.439> in

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
form such operation practically also in

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.910 
form such operation practically also in
the<00:00:29.010> Ben<00:00:29.189> States<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:31.130> will<00:00:32.130> unbend<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
the Ben States so I will unbend it and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.670 
the Ben States so I will unbend it and
hit<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> cutout<00:00:36.320> now<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.620> need<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.780> bend

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
hit the cutout now I need I want to bend

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.889 
hit the cutout now I need I want to bend
it<00:00:40.890> back<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> initial<00:00:41.850> State<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.450> simply

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it back in the initial State so simply

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.880 
it back in the initial State so simply
Bend<00:00:43.649> back<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.890> automatically

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
Bend back here it is the automatically

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
Bend back here it is the automatically
automatically<00:00:47.579> select<00:00:48.079> oil<00:00:49.079> unbend<00:00:49.410> geometry

automatically select oil unbend geometry

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.479 
automatically select oil unbend geometry
or<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.610> select<00:00:50.789> them<00:00:51.000> manually

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
or you can select them manually

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.119 
or you can select them manually
initially<00:00:53.489> let's<00:00:53.760> automate<00:00:54.180> again<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.920> can

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
initially let's automate again you can

initially let's automate again you can
see<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.840> box<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.000> initial

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
see we have this box in the initial

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.380 
see we have this box in the initial
State<00:01:00.649> now<00:01:02.750> suppose<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.790> bend<00:01:05.790> only

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
State now suppose I want to bend only

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.770 
State now suppose I want to bend only
these<00:01:06.630> two<00:01:06.869> surface<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.580> these<00:01:08.580> two<00:01:08.820> should

these two surface and these two should

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.330 
these two surface and these two should
be<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.880> flattened<00:01:11.880> State<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.340> will

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
be in the flattened State so I will

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.510 
be in the flattened State so I will
select<00:01:14.930> manual<00:01:15.930> selection<00:01:16.130> go<00:01:17.130> into<00:01:17.400> this
