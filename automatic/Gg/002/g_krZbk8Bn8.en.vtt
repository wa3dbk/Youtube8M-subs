00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.969 
is using an abbreviated motion and a low
and<00:01:56.470> leading<00:01:56.740> toss<00:01:57.330> blocks<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:58.540> again<00:01:58.979> check

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
and leading toss blocks that again check

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.650 
and leading toss blocks that again check
out<00:02:00.130> how<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.399> toss<00:02:00.670> creates<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.119> body<00:02:01.330> angle

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
out how the toss creates a body angle

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.570 
out how the toss creates a body angle
that<00:02:01.780> forces<00:02:02.229> Martin<00:02:02.560> into<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.890> court<00:02:03.160> so<00:02:03.460> we

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
that forces Martin into the court so we

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.980 
that forces Martin into the court so we
can<00:02:03.729> move<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.030> quickly<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.750> net

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
can move in quickly to the net

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.949 
can move in quickly to the net
now<00:02:06.770> let's<00:02:07.010> examine<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.490> swing<00:02:07.729> contact<00:02:08.690> and
