areas on the side here and a area here I
still<00:00:41.600> haven't<00:00:41.930> figured<00:00:42.260> out<00:00:42.559> how<00:00:43.100> you<00:00:43.160> can

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
still haven't figured out how you can

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.630 
still haven't figured out how you can
get<00:00:43.790> below<00:00:44.149> these<00:00:44.329> but<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.710> did<00:00:46.129> take<00:00:46.340> a<00:00:46.399> look

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
get below these but I did take a look

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.360 
get below these but I did take a look
around<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:47.920> for<00:00:48.920> me<00:00:49.100> there<00:00:49.370> are<00:00:49.550> two<00:00:51.370> spiders

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
around and for me there are two spiders

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.610 
around and for me there are two spiders
what<00:00:53.270> it<00:00:53.449> should<00:00:53.690> be<00:00:53.870> is<00:00:54.110> one<00:00:54.350> over<00:00:54.530> there

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
what it should be is one over there

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:03.420 
what it should be is one over there
spacing<00:00:55.160> out<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:56.750> still<00:00:57.530> pop<00:00:57.800> in<00:00:59.890> this<00:01:00.890> one

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.920 

there<00:01:04.430> should<00:01:04.790> be<00:01:05.030> one<00:01:05.330> more<00:01:05.360> somewhere<00:01:07.930> least

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
there should be one more somewhere least

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.600 
there should be one more somewhere least
the<00:01:09.140> word<00:01:09.350> when<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.250> load<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:10.729> up<00:01:11.000> again<00:01:12.610> that's

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
the word when I load it up again that's

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.260 
the word when I load it up again that's
strange

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
strange

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.010 
strange
so<00:01:14.810> if<00:01:15.619> we<00:01:15.740> have<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.890> look<00:01:16.070> around<00:01:16.130> here<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:17.020> have

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
so if we have a look around here I have

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.810 
so if we have a look around here I have
looked<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.439> looked<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:19.070> can't<00:01:19.460> find

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
looked and looked and I can't find

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.030 
looked and looked and I can't find
anything<00:01:20.299> that<00:01:21.140> resembles<00:01:21.799> a<00:01:21.979> lever<00:01:22.670> or<00:01:22.759> a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
anything that resembles a lever or a

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.730 
anything that resembles a lever or a
button<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.280> any<00:01:25.670> kind<00:01:25.970> because<00:01:26.630> there<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.259> some

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
button of any kind because there is some

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.140 
button of any kind because there is some
sort<00:01:28.040> of<00:01:28.750> bar<00:01:29.750> system<00:01:30.380> right<00:01:30.560> here<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.150> it

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
sort of bar system right here and it

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.490 
sort of bar system right here and it
looks<00:01:32.479> like<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.200> walk<00:01:33.380> over<00:01:34.810> but<00:01:35.810> if<00:01:36.110> we

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
looks like you can walk over but if we

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.950 
looks like you can walk over but if we
change<00:01:36.829> into<00:01:39.250> toggle<00:01:40.250> free<00:01:40.460> camera<00:01:40.759> we<00:01:41.750> can

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
change into toggle free camera we can

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.969 
change into toggle free camera we can
have<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> look<00:01:42.380> inside

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
have a look inside

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.830 
have a look inside
and<00:01:45.040> there<00:01:46.040> doesn't<00:01:46.579> really<00:01:46.880> appear<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.689> be

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
and there doesn't really appear to be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.060 
and there doesn't really appear to be
anything<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:49.280> can<00:01:49.610> do<00:01:49.939> in<00:01:49.970> here

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
anything you can do in here

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.139 
anything you can do in here
there<00:01:52.070> aren't<00:01:52.549> any<00:01:52.850> chests<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.869> I'm<00:01:54.500> not<00:01:54.680> sure

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
there aren't any chests and I'm not sure

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.780 
there aren't any chests and I'm not sure
if<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:56.570> even<00:01:56.810> can<00:01:57.020> pass<00:01:57.229> below<00:01:58.130> these<00:01:58.490> pipes

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
if you even can pass below these pipes

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.700 
if you even can pass below these pipes
or<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:01.729> gate<00:02:02.090> in<00:02:02.450> these<00:02:02.750> pipes

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
or this this gate in these pipes

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.800 
or this this gate in these pipes
and<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> look<00:02:05.970> over<00:02:06.120> here<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:06.780> can

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and if we have a look over here you can

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.420 
and if we have a look over here you can
see<00:02:07.170> there's<00:02:07.380> one<00:02:08.149> spider<00:02:09.149> over<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:10.430> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
see there's one spider over there and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.210 
see there's one spider over there and
here<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> side<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.750> can<00:02:13.050> probably<00:02:13.590> if<00:02:13.770> you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
here on the side you can probably if you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.460 
here on the side you can probably if you
can<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.580> under<00:02:14.850> here<00:02:15.709> walk<00:02:16.709> over<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.190> but

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
can get under here walk over here but

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.580 
can get under here walk over here but
there<00:02:19.470> isn't<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.800> anything<00:02:21.200> as<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.440> can

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
there isn't really anything as you can

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.420 
there isn't really anything as you can
see<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.630> same<00:02:24.660> goes<00:02:25.140> below<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:28.430> there

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
see and the same goes below here there

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
see and the same goes below here there
isn't<00:02:29.610> really<00:02:29.970> anything<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.380> get

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
isn't really anything to do you can get

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.710 
isn't really anything to do you can get
over<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.890> pipe<00:02:35.190> then<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.330> reach<00:02:36.450> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
over this pipe then we can reach this

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.060 
over this pipe then we can reach this
area<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.380> there's<00:02:37.739> nothing<00:02:38.160> here<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:40.070> there

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
area but there's nothing here and there

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.680 
area but there's nothing here and there
is<00:02:41.220> nothing<00:02:41.519> on<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.450> side<00:02:42.720> either<00:02:44.450> as<00:02:45.450> you

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
is nothing on this side either as you

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.990 
is nothing on this side either as you
can<00:02:45.840> see<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:48.019> what<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.050> think<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.769> this<00:02:50.700> is

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
can see so what I think is that this is

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.900 
can see so what I think is that this is
just<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:53.180> area<00:02:54.180> with<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> really<00:02:54.959> annoying<00:02:55.320> ooh

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
Dwemer spider and as you can see he kind

Dwemer spider and as you can see he kind
of<00:03:00.360> spaz<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.780> out<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:02.160> teleports<00:03:02.910> from

of spaz is out and the teleports from

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.680 
of spaz is out and the teleports from
different<00:03:04.590> parts<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.850> guess<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.390> spawn

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
different parts so I guess the spawn

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.920 
different parts so I guess the spawn
point<00:03:07.050> for<00:03:07.230> him<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.650> kind<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.980> bugged<00:03:08.190> out

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
point for him is kind of bugged out

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.000 
point for him is kind of bugged out
maybe<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.079> should<00:03:10.350> be<00:03:10.380> up<00:03:10.709> here<00:03:10.950> somewhere<00:03:11.190> but

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
maybe it should be up here somewhere but

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.210 
maybe it should be up here somewhere but
but<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.870> yes<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.079> can<00:03:16.200> see<00:03:16.320> has<00:03:16.769> been<00:03:16.799> bugged

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
but it yes you can see has been bugged

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.819 
but it yes you can see has been bugged
out<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.790> he's<00:03:18.150> spawning<00:03:18.450> below<00:03:21.200> yeah<00:03:22.200> there<00:03:22.709> is

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
out so he's spawning below yeah there is

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.500 
out so he's spawning below yeah there is
really<00:03:23.459> nothing<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:24.060> do<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.880> if<00:03:27.390> we

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
really nothing to do in here so if we

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.140 
really nothing to do in here so if we
turn<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:28.049> off<00:03:29.120> we<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:30.329> try<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.660> take<00:03:31.560> him<00:03:31.769> out

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
turn this off we can try to take him out

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150 
turn this off we can try to take him out
since<00:03:33.150> we<00:03:33.329> can't<00:03:33.570> get<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.890> need<00:03:35.040> to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
since we can't get in and you need to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.840 
since we can't get in and you need to
clear<00:03:35.430> out<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.730> area<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.320> get<00:03:37.320> your<00:03:37.850> full

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
clear out the area to get your full

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.690 
clear out the area to get your full

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
synchronisation I was about to say thank

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.600 
synchronisation I was about to say thank

want to take this guy out to get this
area<00:03:47.340> cleared<00:03:48.769> there<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:49.829> can<00:03:49.950> see<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.160> space

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
area cleared there you can see in space

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.110 
area cleared there you can see in space
map<00:03:50.640> so<00:03:51.090> what<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.350> do<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.970> change<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:56.120> for

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
map so what we can do is change to for

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.979 
map so what we can do is change to for
example<00:03:57.570> condor<00:03:58.109> flame<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.739> rock<00:03:59.989> because

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
example condor flame and rock because

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.010 
example condor flame and rock because
what<00:04:01.170> we<00:04:01.350> can<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.769> is<00:04:02.090> aim

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
what we can do is aim

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.900 
what we can do is aim
at<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:05.730> floor<00:04:05.970> right<00:04:06.150> here<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:07.730> let's<00:04:08.730> see

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
at the floor right here and let's see

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.740 
at the floor right here and let's see
how<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.240> works

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
how this works

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.800 
how this works
she<00:04:10.350> should<00:04:10.680> be<00:04:11.190> spawning<00:04:11.670> or<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.540> should<00:04:12.780> be

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
she should be spawning or it should be

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.550 
she should be spawning or it should be
spawning<00:04:13.170> down<00:04:14.130> here<00:04:14.400> below<00:04:15.080> below<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.380> deck

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
spawning down here below below the deck

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.530 
spawning down here below below the deck
but<00:04:18.020> this<00:04:19.020> teleport<00:04:19.920> thing<00:04:20.220> should<00:04:20.640> be<00:04:20.970> up

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
but this teleport thing should be up

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.450 
but this teleport thing should be up
here<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.050> let's<00:04:22.350> see<00:04:23.180> there<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.240> can<00:04:24.270> see<00:04:24.540> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
here so let's see there you can see the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.910 
here so let's see there you can see the
sort<00:04:26.460> of<00:04:26.660> Condor<00:04:27.660> thing<00:04:27.990> was<00:04:28.260> up<00:04:28.440> there<00:04:28.650> but

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
sort of Condor thing was up there but

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.730 
sort of Condor thing was up there but
she<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:29.490> down<00:04:29.760> here<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.620> attacking<00:04:31.620> the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
Magica P and we can skip playing so it

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.160 
Magica P and we can skip playing so it
the<00:05:20.700> kind<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:21.060> box<00:05:21.240> out<00:05:21.480> if<00:05:21.690> you<00:05:21.810> want<00:05:22.020> to

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
the kind of box out if you want to

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.170 
the kind of box out if you want to
conjure<00:05:22.710> one<00:05:22.890> up<00:05:23.700> here<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.450> might<00:05:24.780> work<00:05:24.990> if<00:05:25.200> you

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
conjure one up here it might work if you

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.140 
conjure one up here it might work if you
aim<00:05:27.180> at<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.570> wall<00:05:27.840> or<00:05:28.740> you're<00:05:29.280> some<00:05:29.520> area<00:05:29.880> that

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
aim at the wall or you're some area that

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.690 
aim at the wall or you're some area that
isn't<00:05:30.680> transparent<00:05:31.680> like<00:05:32.160> this<00:05:32.340> one<00:05:33.140> so<00:05:34.700> see

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
isn't transparent like this one so see

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.550 
isn't transparent like this one so see
if<00:05:35.880> we<00:05:36.060> can<00:05:36.270> guide<00:05:36.960> her<00:05:38.930> no<00:05:39.930> she<00:05:40.110> gets<00:05:40.290> stuck

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
if we can guide her no she gets stuck

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.030 
if we can guide her no she gets stuck
over<00:05:40.740> there

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
over there

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:50.150 
over there
so<00:05:46.010> can't<00:05:47.010> interact<00:05:47.520> so<00:05:48.510> my<00:05:49.440> prediction<00:05:49.770> is

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
so can't interact so my prediction is

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.900 
so can't interact so my prediction is
that<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:51.840> spawn<00:05:52.140> point<00:05:52.410> is<00:05:52.650> just<00:05:52.890> bugged<00:05:53.220> for

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
that the spawn point is just bugged for

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.630 
that the spawn point is just bugged for
this<00:05:54.120> spider<00:05:54.660> or<00:05:54.930> if<00:05:55.710> there<00:05:55.950> are<00:05:56.070> two<00:05:56.310> of<00:05:56.490> them

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
this spider or if there are two of them

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.140 
this spider or if there are two of them
and<00:05:56.850> you<00:05:57.890> shouldn't<00:05:58.890> be<00:05:58.980> able<00:05:59.160> to<00:05:59.340> go<00:05:59.940> down

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
and you shouldn't be able to go down

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.190 
and you shouldn't be able to go down
here<00:06:00.450> but<00:06:00.660> I<00:06:01.230> have<00:06:02.190> no<00:06:02.220> real<00:06:03.030> evidence<00:06:03.200> except

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
here but I have no real evidence except

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.240 
here but I have no real evidence except
for<00:06:05.030> the<00:06:06.030> fact<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:06.360> no<00:06:07.050> one<00:06:07.260> appears<00:06:07.920> to<00:06:08.160> be

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
for the fact that no one appears to be

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.080 
for the fact that no one appears to be
able<00:06:08.340> to<00:06:08.460> find<00:06:08.850> a<00:06:09.210> lever<00:06:09.810> or<00:06:09.900> anything<00:06:10.500> that

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
able to find a lever or anything that

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:18.470 
able to find a lever or anything that
can<00:06:12.090> open<00:06:12.540> this<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:16.250> there<00:06:17.250> is<00:06:17.430> nothing<00:06:18.060> to<00:06:18.360> do

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
can open this and there is nothing to do

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.240 
can open this and there is nothing to do
of<00:06:18.750> course<00:06:18.780> if<00:06:19.200> there<00:06:19.410> were<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.560> chest<00:06:19.950> back

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
of course if there were a chest back

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.600 
of course if there were a chest back
there<00:06:20.520> of<00:06:20.880> some<00:06:21.630> sort<00:06:21.960> or<00:06:22.200> some<00:06:22.680> gems<00:06:23.220> or

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
there of some sort or some gems or

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.150 
there of some sort or some gems or
whatever<00:06:24.020> it<00:06:25.020> would<00:06:25.230> have<00:06:25.320> been<00:06:25.470> another

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
whatever it would have been another

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.090 
whatever it would have been another
thing<00:06:26.460> but<00:06:27.170> since<00:06:28.170> there's<00:06:28.410> really<00:06:28.620> nothing

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
thing but since there's really nothing

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.700 
thing but since there's really nothing
and<00:06:29.310> you<00:06:29.490> can<00:06:29.520> probably<00:06:29.990> can<00:06:30.990> even<00:06:31.230> pass<00:06:31.410> that

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
and you can probably can even pass that

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.780 
and you can probably can even pass that
first<00:06:32.480> first<00:06:33.480> gate<00:06:33.840> right<00:06:34.170> there<00:06:34.640> this<00:06:35.640> is

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
first first gate right there this is

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.990 
first first gate right there this is
probably<00:06:36.210> your<00:06:36.450> stare<00:06:36.750> for<00:06:37.250> visuals<00:06:38.250> and<00:06:38.520> it's

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
probably your stare for visuals and it's

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.490 
probably your stare for visuals and it's
on<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.240> map<00:06:39.420> theists<00:06:41.300> appear<00:06:42.300> to<00:06:42.570> be<00:06:42.780> part<00:06:43.380> of

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.170 
on the map theists appear to be part of
the<00:06:43.680> world<00:06:44.510> so<00:06:45.510> I<00:06:46.290> hope<00:06:46.800> that<00:06:47.070> answers<00:06:47.520> some<00:06:47.820> of

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
the world so I hope that answers some of
