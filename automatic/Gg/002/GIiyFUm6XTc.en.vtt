notches<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.340> down<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.810> not

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
notches that are down here but do not

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.300 
notches that are down here but do not
lift<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.439> keyboard<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:08.069> it's

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
lift up the keyboard because it's

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
lift up the keyboard because it's
connected<00:02:08.729> by<00:02:08.759> cable<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.750> turn<00:02:10.020> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
connected by cable you just turn it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.850 
connected by cable you just turn it
around

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
around

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.040 
around
and<00:02:11.070> you'll<00:02:11.370> find<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.570> ribbon

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and you'll find that you have a ribbon

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.090 
and you'll find that you have a ribbon
cable<00:02:13.230> here<00:02:14.960> which<00:02:15.960> needs<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.350> be<00:02:16.440> unclipped

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
cable here which needs to be unclipped

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.680 
cable here which needs to be unclipped
now<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:19.580> way<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.510> we

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
now the way you do that is that we

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.920 
now the way you do that is that we
actually<00:02:21.840> need<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.230> lift<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.950> top<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.930> this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
actually need to lift up the top of this

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.500 
actually need to lift up the top of this
connector<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:26.040> will<00:02:26.280> open<00:02:26.880> up<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.210> little

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
connector it will open up like a little

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.340 
connector it will open up like a little
door<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.070> there<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.820> go<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.200> have

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
door like that there you go and we have

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.330 
door like that there you go and we have
a<00:02:31.560> flat<00:02:32.340> ribbon<00:02:33.240> cable<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.770> we<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.070> need<00:02:35.250> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
a flat ribbon cable that we just need to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.970 
a flat ribbon cable that we just need to
lift<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.850> pull<00:02:36.300> out<00:02:36.450> now<00:02:36.740> notice<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
lift and pull out now notice that the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.600 
lift and pull out now notice that the
ribbon<00:02:38.250> cable<00:02:38.580> has<00:02:38.730> got<00:02:38.910> these<00:02:39.060> tiny<00:02:39.840> little

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
ribbon cable has got these tiny little

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.730 
ribbon cable has got these tiny little
notches<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.060> side<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.780> those<00:02:43.350> notches

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
notches on the side and those notches

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.950 
notches on the side and those notches
are<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.910> align<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.450> cable<00:02:45.750> when<00:02:45.870> you

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
are so that you align the cable when you

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.600 
are so that you align the cable when you
put<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.230> back<00:02:46.320> when<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> put<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> other<00:02:47.340> key

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
put it back when you put the other key

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.520 
put it back when you put the other key
back<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.090> there<00:02:48.300> you'll<00:02:48.810> see<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.350> little

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
back in there you'll see that the little

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.950 
back in there you'll see that the little
notches<00:02:49.800> actually<00:02:50.490> housed<00:02:50.760> themselves<00:02:51.570> on

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
notches actually housed themselves on

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.570 
notches actually housed themselves on
the<00:02:52.350> inside<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.520> connector<00:02:53.820> okay<00:02:54.630> so

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
the inside of the connector okay so

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.860 
the inside of the connector okay so
it'll<00:02:56.580> make<00:02:56.730> sense<00:02:57.060> when<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.420> are<00:02:57.450> sort<00:02:57.810> of

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
it'll make sense when you are sort of

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.040 
it'll make sense when you are sort of
doing<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.980> yourself<00:02:59.430> as<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.970> say<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.780> I'm<00:03:00.870> taking

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
doing it yourself as I say so I'm taking

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.290 
doing it yourself as I say so I'm taking
this<00:03:01.320> keyboard<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.950> I'm<00:03:02.310> now<00:03:02.490> going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.060> grab

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
this keyboard and I'm now going to grab

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.510 
this keyboard and I'm now going to grab
the<00:03:03.450> replacement<00:03:04.050> keyboard<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:07.280> put<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.370> in

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
the replacement keyboard and put it in

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.300 
the replacement keyboard and put it in
so<00:03:08.970> here's<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.410> case<00:03:10.620> I'm<00:03:10.980> swapping

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
so here's the in this case I'm swapping

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.690 
so here's the in this case I'm swapping
it<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:11.730> our<00:03:11.880> Spanish<00:03:12.330> keyboard<00:03:13.130> so<00:03:14.130> first

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
it for our Spanish keyboard so first

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.750 
it for our Spanish keyboard so first
thing<00:03:14.820> we<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:16.340> we're<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.520> put<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
thing we do is we're going to put the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.520 
thing we do is we're going to put the
connector<00:03:18.150> back<00:03:18.270> in<00:03:18.480> there<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.700> we<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:21.530> place

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
connector back in there so we just place

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.199 
connector back in there so we just place
it<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.950> right<00:03:23.130> place<00:03:23.430> we'll<00:03:23.730> see<00:03:23.970> when<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
it in the right place we'll see when the

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.180 
it in the right place we'll see when the
notch<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.220> perfectly<00:03:26.220> set<00:03:26.490> in<00:03:26.700> like<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.570> and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
notch is perfectly set in like that and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.640 
notch is perfectly set in like that and
we<00:03:29.190> then<00:03:29.370> close<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.850> little<00:03:30.090> lid<00:03:30.650> another

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
we then close the little lid another

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.870 
we then close the little lid another
little<00:03:31.920> secret<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.580> you're<00:03:32.730> going<00:03:32.850> to

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
little secret is that you're going to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.690 
little secret is that you're going to
see<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> white<00:03:33.510> line<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:34.770> your<00:03:35.010> ribbon<00:03:35.220> cable

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
see a white line on your ribbon cable

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.680 
see a white line on your ribbon cable
okay<00:03:36.480> if<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:37.380> crooked<00:03:37.830> or<00:03:38.459> if<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.300> sticking

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
okay if it's crooked or if it's sticking

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.780 
okay if it's crooked or if it's sticking
out<00:03:39.959> more<00:03:40.380> than<00:03:40.560> what<00:03:40.950> you've<00:03:41.100> what<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.580> see

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
out more than what you've what you see

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.449 
out more than what you've what you see
here<00:03:42.150> then<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:43.080> likely<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.980> cable<00:03:44.340> is

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
here then it's likely that the cable is

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.390 
here then it's likely that the cable is
being<00:03:44.670> inserted<00:03:44.970> incorrectly<00:03:45.320> okay<00:03:46.400> and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
being inserted incorrectly okay and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.980 
being inserted incorrectly okay and
you'll<00:03:47.580> notice<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.240> keyboard<00:03:48.450> won't

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
you'll notice that the keyboard won't

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.630 
you'll notice that the keyboard won't
basically<00:03:49.920> work<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:52.100> we're<00:03:53.100> now<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.580> put

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
basically work so we're now going to put

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.880 
basically work so we're now going to put
the<00:03:54.000> thing<00:03:54.420> back<00:03:54.600> together<00:03:54.780> again<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.680> first

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
the thing back together again the first

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.990 
the thing back together again the first
thing<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.280> we're<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.670> take<00:03:56.880> these

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
thing is we're going to take these

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.370 
thing is we're going to take these
little<00:03:57.270> notches<00:03:57.450> at<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.810> bottom<00:03:58.110> I'm<00:03:58.230> going

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
little notches at the bottom I'm going

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.340 
little notches at the bottom I'm going
to<00:03:58.500> slide<00:03:58.770> them<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.100> underneath<00:03:59.750> then<00:04:00.750> we're

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
to slide them in underneath then we're

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.330 
to slide them in underneath then we're
going<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.650> push<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.459> sides<00:04:02.700> in<00:04:03.260> like<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.440> so

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
going to push the sides in like that so

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.610 
going to push the sides in like that so
that<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.700> keyboard<00:04:05.940> clicks<00:04:06.930> in<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.290> sides

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
that the keyboard clicks in on the sides

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.140 
that the keyboard clicks in on the sides
and<00:04:08.270> we're<00:04:09.270> going<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.510> replace<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:11.150> two

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
and we're going to replace the two

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.300 
and we're going to replace the two
screws<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:13.200> keep<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.590> all<00:04:13.709> down<00:04:14.720> back

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
screws that keep it all down back

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.819 
screws that keep it all down back
now<00:04:17.850> whilst<00:04:18.090> I'm<00:04:18.269> doing<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:19.380> procedure

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
now whilst I'm doing that this procedure

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.450 
now whilst I'm doing that this procedure
is<00:04:20.100> relatively<00:04:21.049> identical<00:04:22.049> for<00:04:22.350> most<00:04:23.060> laptops

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
is relatively identical for most laptops

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.400 
is relatively identical for most laptops
the<00:04:26.460> only<00:04:26.670> difference<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.420> that<00:04:27.480> you<00:04:28.020> might

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
the only difference is that you might

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.170 
the only difference is that you might
have<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.920> couple<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.670> screws<00:04:30.080> from<00:04:31.080> underneath

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
have a couple of screws from underneath

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.220 
have a couple of screws from underneath
to<00:04:33.180> replace<00:04:35.030> now<00:04:36.030> I'm<00:04:36.390> doing<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.750> wrong<00:04:36.930> the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
to replace now I'm doing that wrong the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.070 
to replace now I'm doing that wrong the
keyboard<00:04:37.590> moved<00:04:37.890> up<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.340> therefore<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.390> do<00:04:39.600> not

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
keyboard moved up and therefore I do not

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.740 
keyboard moved up and therefore I do not
let<00:04:40.980> me<00:04:41.130> just<00:04:41.340> lift<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.580> up<00:04:41.700> again<00:04:44.450> right<00:04:45.450> and

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.870 

right<00:04:48.750> that's<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:51.680> there's<00:04:52.680> two<00:04:53.010> screws<00:04:53.400> or

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
right that's and there's two screws or

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.850 
right that's and there's two screws or
maybe<00:04:54.180> three<00:04:54.570> to<00:04:54.900> remove<00:04:55.260> from<00:04:55.500> underneath

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
maybe three to remove from underneath

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.510 
maybe three to remove from underneath
the<00:04:56.250> key<00:04:56.460> underneath<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.300> laptop<00:04:57.780> which<00:04:58.770> also

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
the key underneath the laptop which also

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.970 
the key underneath the laptop which also
keep<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.240> keyboard<00:05:00.780> locked<00:05:01.290> down<00:05:01.620> from

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
keep the keyboard locked down from

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.800 
keep the keyboard locked down from
different<00:05:02.340> positions<00:05:02.490> under<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.390> keyboard

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
different positions under the keyboard

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.130 
different positions under the keyboard
but<00:05:04.770> in<00:05:04.919> this<00:05:05.040> case<00:05:05.340> in<00:05:05.580> this<00:05:05.730> Dell<00:05:06.140> quite

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
but in this case in this Dell quite

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.280 
but in this case in this Dell quite
simply<00:05:07.770> we<00:05:08.580> have<00:05:08.790> only<00:05:08.970> two<00:05:09.270> screws<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:10.110> deal

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
simply we have only two screws to deal

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.650 
simply we have only two screws to deal
with<00:05:11.480> so<00:05:12.480> let<00:05:12.660> me<00:05:12.750> just<00:05:13.220> put<00:05:14.220> those<00:05:14.419> back<00:05:15.419> in

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
with so let me just put those back in

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.270 
with so let me just put those back in
there

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
there

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.380 
there
and<00:05:19.130> we<00:05:20.130> place<00:05:20.610> back<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.860> panel<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:24.090> there's

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
and we place back the panel so there's

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.840 
and we place back the panel so there's
little<00:05:25.050> notches<00:05:25.950> in<00:05:26.250> there<00:05:26.400> we<00:05:26.520> make<00:05:26.669> sure

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
little notches in there we make sure

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.430 
little notches in there we make sure
that<00:05:27.060> they<00:05:27.150> go<00:05:27.330> in<00:05:27.510> underneath<00:05:28.050> and<00:05:28.729> not<00:05:30.440> above

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
that they go in underneath and not above

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.330 
that they go in underneath and not above
because<00:05:32.220> you'll<00:05:32.460> break<00:05:32.700> them<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:34.040> then<00:05:35.040> we

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
because you'll break them and then we

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.640 
because you'll break them and then we
just<00:05:35.640> push<00:05:35.940> it<00:05:36.120> down<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.720> you'll<00:05:36.960> find<00:05:37.320> that

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
just push it down and you'll find that

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.600 
just push it down and you'll find that
it<00:05:38.040> just<00:05:38.270> clips<00:05:39.270> in<00:05:39.840> just<00:05:40.740> like<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:41.070> click

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
it just clips in just like that click

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.750 
it just clips in just like that click
click<00:05:41.669> click<00:05:42.150> click<00:05:42.419> click<00:05:42.800> there<00:05:43.800> you<00:05:43.860> go<00:05:44.010> so

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
click click click click there you go so

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.250 
click click click click there you go so
I'm<00:05:44.850> also<00:05:45.000> pushing<00:05:45.330> these<00:05:45.600> sections<00:05:46.050> down

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
I'm also pushing these sections down

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.290 
I'm also pushing these sections down
because<00:05:46.650> they<00:05:46.770> clip<00:05:47.040> in<00:05:47.220> and<00:05:47.850> all<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.270> way

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
because they clip in and all the way

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.350 
because they clip in and all the way
along<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:50.750> panel<00:05:52.520> there<00:05:53.520> you<00:05:53.700> go<00:05:53.880> the

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
along the panel there you go the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.480 
along the panel there you go the
keyboard<00:05:54.750> has<00:05:54.930> been<00:05:55.080> replaced

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
keyboard has been replaced

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.260 
keyboard has been replaced
just<00:05:56.940> as<00:05:57.090> a<00:05:57.120> clue<00:05:57.510> for<00:05:57.780> other<00:05:58.050> laptops

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
just as a clue for other laptops

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.700 
just as a clue for other laptops
normally<00:06:00.270> underneath<00:06:00.870> like<00:06:01.140> all<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.410> saying

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
normally underneath like all the saying

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.610 
normally underneath like all the saying
you'll<00:06:02.340> find<00:06:02.700> some<00:06:03.030> screws<00:06:03.540> that<00:06:04.200> you<00:06:04.260> might

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
you'll find some screws that you might

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.980 
you'll find some screws that you might
need<00:06:04.800> to<00:06:05.010> undo<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:06.060> what<00:06:06.240> you're<00:06:06.390> looking<00:06:06.720> for

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.450 
need to undo and what you're looking for
is<00:06:07.229> when<00:06:07.620> whoops<00:06:08.220> when<00:06:09.090> you're<00:06:10.310> looking<00:06:11.310> at

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
these screws some of them will have a

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.510 
these screws some of them will have a
clue<00:06:12.930> like<00:06:13.290> for<00:06:14.130> example<00:06:15.979> over<00:06:16.979> here<00:06:17.010> we<00:06:17.340> have

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
clue like for example over here we have

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.360 
clue like for example over here we have
the<00:06:17.729> letters<00:06:18.030> MC<00:06:18.630> which<00:06:19.310> represent<00:06:20.310> the

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
the letters MC which represent the

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.790 
the letters MC which represent the
memory<00:06:20.970> compartment<00:06:21.720> and<00:06:22.200> the<00:06:22.560> wireless

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
memory compartment and the wireless

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.260 
memory compartment and the wireless
compartment<00:06:23.640> and<00:06:24.289> you<00:06:25.310> would<00:06:26.310> find<00:06:26.580> maybe<00:06:26.789> a<00:06:26.910> K

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
compartment and you would find maybe a K

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.770 
compartment and you would find maybe a K
or<00:06:27.570> a<00:06:28.349> picture<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.950> a<00:06:29.070> square<00:06:29.370> box<00:06:29.640> with<00:06:29.910> little

or a picture of a square box with little

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.490 
or a picture of a square box with little
that<00:06:31.440> represents<00:06:32.100> that<00:06:32.210> a<00:06:33.210> keyboard<00:06:34.020> screw

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
that represents that a keyboard screw

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.550 
that represents that a keyboard screw
and<00:06:34.740> you<00:06:35.370> will<00:06:35.520> need<00:06:35.670> to<00:06:35.790> undo<00:06:36.300> that<00:06:36.480> screw<00:06:36.690> so

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
and you will need to undo that screw so

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.410 
and you will need to undo that screw so
that<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:37.920> keyboard<00:06:38.340> isn't<00:06:38.490> clamped<00:06:38.970> down<00:06:39.030> as

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
that the keyboard isn't clamped down as

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.320 
that the keyboard isn't clamped down as
well<00:06:39.600> as<00:06:39.720> maybe<00:06:39.930> removing<00:06:40.560> some<00:06:40.800> other<00:06:40.950> top

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330
