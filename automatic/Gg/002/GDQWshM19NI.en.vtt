00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
band around it it's not really so easy

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.490

that stuff very nice and then the wood
over<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.099> like<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.459> sculpting<00:02:30.030> there's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
over here I like the sculpting there's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.820 
over here I like the sculpting there's
no<00:02:30.840> wash<00:02:31.110> or<00:02:31.349> anything

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
no wash or anything

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.410 
no wash or anything
but<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.520> know<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.790> still<00:02:33.030> looks<00:02:33.180> really

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
but you know it still looks really

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.450 
but you know it still looks really
really<00:02:33.630> good<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.930> here's<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.200> handle<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:34.980> then

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
really good and here's a handle and then

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.560 
really good and here's a handle and then
we<00:02:35.550> get<00:02:35.640> another<00:02:35.790> handle<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.300> then<00:02:36.390> it's

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
we get another handle and then it's

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.180 
we get another handle and then it's
actually<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.020> pitchfork<00:02:37.350> also<00:02:37.980> at<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
actually like a pitchfork also at the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.070 
actually like a pitchfork also at the
very<00:02:38.220> bottom<00:02:38.610> over<00:02:39.000> here<00:02:39.030> which<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.840> could<00:02:39.990> have

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
very bottom over here which I could have

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.570 
very bottom over here which I could have
done<00:02:40.290> without<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.040> cool<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.310> it's

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
done without but it's cool that it's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.220 
done without but it's cool that it's
like<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> multi-use<00:02:42.420> weapon<00:02:42.780> even<00:02:42.870> got<00:02:43.110> some

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
like a multi-use weapon even got some

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.110 
like a multi-use weapon even got some
scratches<00:02:43.770> right<00:02:43.950> here<00:02:44.250> it's<00:02:44.460> like<00:02:44.550> sculpted

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
scratches right here it's like sculpted

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.580 
scratches right here it's like sculpted
in<00:02:45.210> there<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> circles<00:02:45.990> mostly<00:02:46.290> meant<00:02:46.470> to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
in there so the circles mostly meant to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.100 
in there so the circles mostly meant to
be<00:02:46.710> posed<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.160> his<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:47.640> hand<00:02:47.970> which<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.810> be

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
be posed in his right hand which can be

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.410 
be posed in his right hand which can be
a<00:02:49.140> little<00:02:49.560> awkward<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.580> guess<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.060> could<00:02:51.210> have

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
a little awkward I guess you could have

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.090 
a little awkward I guess you could have
it<00:02:51.540> closed<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.110> way<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.410> he's<00:02:52.740> holding<00:02:52.890> it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
it closed this way so he's holding it

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.340 
it closed this way so he's holding it
like<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.550> that's<00:02:54.330> kind<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.930> cool<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.170> could

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
like that that's kind of cool you could

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.170 
like that that's kind of cool you could
do<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:56.250> having<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.610> resting<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.060> this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
do that I like having it resting in this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.700 
do that I like having it resting in this
hand<00:02:57.420> over<00:02:57.480> here<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:57.960> that's<00:02:58.080> pretty<00:02:58.410> clean

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
hand over here so that's pretty clean

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.230 
hand over here so that's pretty clean
you<00:02:59.010> could<00:02:59.130> also<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.490> him<00:02:59.670> holding<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.090> like

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
you could also have him holding it like

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.510 
you could also have him holding it like
this<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:01.020> could<00:03:01.140> work<00:03:01.350> too<00:03:01.680> or<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.340> face

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
this that could work too or have it face

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.950 
this that could work too or have it face
the<00:03:02.700> other<00:03:02.850> way<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.240> don't<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:03.810> having

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
the other way I don't really like having

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.390 
the other way I don't really like having
them<00:03:04.200> hold<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.620> way<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.070> kind<00:03:05.370> of

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
them hold it this way this is kind of

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.950 
them hold it this way this is kind of
weird<00:03:05.520> it's<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.910> sickle<00:03:06.300> gun<00:03:06.450> puh<00:03:06.780> puh

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
weird it's like a sickle gun puh puh

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.380 
weird it's like a sickle gun puh puh
bang<00:03:07.530> bang<00:03:07.830> now<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.280> really<00:03:08.760> like<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.120> figure

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390

bang bang now I really like this figure
a<00:03:09.720> lot<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.590> have<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.550> complaint<00:03:12.060> though<00:03:12.330> and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
a lot I have one complaint though and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.900 
a lot I have one complaint though and
that's<00:03:12.840> just<00:03:13.140> how<00:03:13.380> much<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.950> Hat<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.400> tilted

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
that's just how much the Hat is tilted

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.730 
that's just how much the Hat is tilted
downward<00:03:15.450> over<00:03:15.600> here<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.230> makes<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.530> kind<00:03:16.650> of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
downward over here it makes it kind of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.590 
downward over here it makes it kind of
hard<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.010> see<00:03:17.220> his<00:03:17.370> face<00:03:17.640> he<00:03:18.300> does<00:03:18.450> have

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
hard to see his face he does have

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.790 
hard to see his face he does have
articulation<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.380> could<00:03:19.500> tilt<00:03:19.680> his<00:03:19.770> head

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
articulation so you could tilt his head

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.280 
articulation so you could tilt his head
up<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.310> little<00:03:20.580> bit<00:03:20.790> more<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.720> that's<00:03:21.900> pretty

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
up a little bit more so that's pretty

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.830 
up a little bit more so that's pretty

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
figure just awesome I think the paint

over<00:04:15.239> there<00:04:15.420> typically<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.140> find<00:04:16.229> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
over there typically I find the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.259 
over there typically I find the
articulation<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.160> DCU<00:04:17.489> see<00:04:17.700> figures<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.120> be<00:04:18.239> a

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
articulation in DCU see figures to be a

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.820 
articulation in DCU see figures to be a
bit<00:04:18.479> inferior<00:04:18.810> especially<00:04:19.470> compared<00:04:19.799> to

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
bit inferior especially compared to

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.400 
bit inferior especially compared to
Marvel<00:04:20.250> Legends<00:04:20.519> but<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.510> guy<00:04:21.750> actually<00:04:21.989> has

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
Marvel Legends but this guy actually has

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.440 
Marvel Legends but this guy actually has
a<00:04:22.620> great<00:04:23.100> amount<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.610> articulation<00:04:24.300> so

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
a great amount of articulation so

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.060 
a great amount of articulation so
starting<00:04:24.780> with<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.960> head<00:04:25.110> joint<00:04:25.380> he's<00:04:25.950> on

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
starting with the head joint he's on

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.340 
starting with the head joint he's on
this<00:04:26.190> ball<00:04:26.669> peg<00:04:26.940> right<00:04:27.150> here<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.660> head<00:04:27.900> itself

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
this ball peg right here the head itself

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.719 
this ball peg right here the head itself
doesn't<00:04:28.710> have<00:04:28.830> its<00:04:28.979> own<00:04:29.160> point<00:04:29.669> of

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
doesn't have its own point of

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.940 
doesn't have its own point of
articulation<00:04:29.970> but<00:04:30.870> it's<00:04:31.050> in<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.410> neck<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.860> it

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
articulation but it's in the neck and it

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.130 
articulation but it's in the neck and it
connects<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.790> torso<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.780> could<00:04:33.930> see

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
connects to the torso so you could see

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.010 
connects to the torso so you could see
this<00:04:34.290> ball<00:04:35.130> peg<00:04:35.729> you<00:04:36.150> know<00:04:36.180> going<00:04:36.570> right<00:04:36.870> into

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
this ball peg you know going right into

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.050 
this ball peg you know going right into
his<00:04:37.260> chest<00:04:37.620> like<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.580> can't<00:04:38.790> move<00:04:38.910> it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
his chest like that so you can't move it

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.330 
his chest like that so you can't move it
down<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.540> can<00:04:39.750> move<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.169> forward<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.039> get<00:04:41.250> it

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
down you can move it forward and get it

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.770 
down you can move it forward and get it
tilt<00:04:41.640> up<00:04:41.789> so<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.030> looks<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.300> little<00:04:42.419> bit<00:04:42.600> more

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
tilt up so it looks a little bit more

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.630 
tilt up so it looks a little bit more
even<00:04:43.140> a<00:04:43.200> candling<00:04:43.590> back<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> little<00:04:44.039> bit<00:04:44.220> it

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
even a candling back a little bit it

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.500 
even a candling back a little bit it
does<00:04:44.820> get<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> little

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
does get a little

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.600 
does get a little
wobbly<00:04:46.020> though<00:04:46.200> after<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.560> while<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:47.100> he<00:04:47.400> can

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
wobbly though after a while and he can

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.580

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.650 
know it's like a belly button joint not
quite<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.220> diaphragm<00:05:02.730> joint<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.120> he<00:05:03.480> has<00:05:03.630> a

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
waist joint down here too so that's

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.370 
waist joint down here too so that's
great<00:05:06.300> even<00:05:06.540> though<00:05:06.630> it's<00:05:06.780> not<00:05:06.930> totally

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380

one or the other

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.580 
one or the other
