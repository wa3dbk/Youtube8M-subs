00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
this would be a difficult thing to do

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
this would be a difficult thing to do
since<00:01:47.549> there<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:47.970> an<00:01:48.090> explosion<00:01:48.270> leaving

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
most of the books burnt but maybe some

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.760 
most of the books burnt but maybe some
people<00:01:51.270> brought<00:01:51.630> books<00:01:51.810> into<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> fault<00:01:52.560> I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
like this or maybe the book wasn't

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
everything would have been totally

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.940 
everything would have been totally
destroyed<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.409> picked<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> right

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
location and then he says that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.990 
location and then he says that
newspapers<00:02:01.619> would<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.070> good<00:02:02.369> addition<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
newspapers would be a good addition and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.490 
newspapers would be a good addition and
he<00:02:03.119> kind<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> mentions<00:02:03.689> how<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.990> says<00:02:04.170> like

the<00:02:06.119> vault<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:07.350> would<00:02:07.500> add<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.829> depth<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190

certainly<00:03:01.239> guilty<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.019> but<00:03:02.290> it's

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
certainly guilty of that but it's

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.369 
certainly guilty of that but it's
something<00:03:02.560> i<00:03:02.739> do<00:03:02.799> want<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.159> get<00:03:03.340> into<00:03:03.489> um

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
something i do want to get into um

computers in fallout like i said are

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.460 
computers in fallout like i said are
probably<00:03:07.329> where<00:03:07.480> most<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.810> lore<00:03:07.959> has<00:03:08.260> been

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
probably where most of the lore has been

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.229 
probably where most of the lore has been
stored<00:03:08.799> I've<00:03:09.159> just<00:03:09.489> been<00:03:09.609> kind<00:03:09.849> of<00:03:09.879> doing<00:03:10.000> my

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
now obviously every game needs its

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.149 
now obviously every game needs its
invisible<00:03:40.989> walls<00:03:41.229> to<00:03:41.560> show<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:41.859> there<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.129> a

me you're walking along a mountain and

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.640 
me you're walking along a mountain and
you<00:04:01.239> just<00:04:01.449> hit<00:04:01.629> this<00:04:01.720> invisible<00:04:02.260> wall<00:04:02.290> and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
you just hit this invisible wall and

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.860 
you just hit this invisible wall and
it's<00:04:02.949> a<00:04:03.040> clear<00:04:03.280> rock<00:04:03.549> you<00:04:03.760> can<00:04:03.909> climb<00:04:04.180> over<00:04:04.599> or

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
it's a clear rock you can climb over or

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.860 
it's a clear rock you can climb over or
you<00:04:05.019> can<00:04:05.199> walk<00:04:05.439> up<00:04:05.680> or<00:04:06.280> on<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.299> side<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.720> or

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
you can walk up or on the side of it or

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.140 
you can walk up or on the side of it or
something<00:04:08.370> but<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.489> game<00:04:09.639> will<00:04:09.819> let<00:04:10.030> you

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
something but the game will let you

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.929 
something but the game will let you
because<00:04:10.449> of<00:04:10.569> its<00:04:10.689> various<00:04:11.019> invisible<00:04:11.439> walls

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
because of its various invisible walls

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.839 
because of its various invisible walls
obviously<00:04:12.939> this<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.359> something<00:04:13.509> that<00:04:13.659> we<00:04:13.989> can

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
obviously this is something that we can

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.310 
obviously this is something that we can
fix<00:04:15.849> based<00:04:16.269> off<00:04:16.509> the<00:04:16.659> fact<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.079> world's

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
fix based off the fact that the world's

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.170 
fix based off the fact that the world's
will<00:04:17.409> be<00:04:17.530> bigger<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:18.099> going<00:04:18.820> over<00:04:19.060> these

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
will be bigger so going over these

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.149 
will be bigger so going over these
mountains<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.690> stuff<00:04:19.870> won't<00:04:20.229> be<00:04:20.409> as<00:04:20.650> limited

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
mountains and stuff won't be as limited

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.570 
mountains and stuff won't be as limited
for<00:04:21.789> example<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:23.200> you<00:04:23.380> take<00:04:23.409> Skyrim<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.520> know

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
for example if you take Skyrim you know

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.120 
for example if you take Skyrim you know
you<00:04:24.669> can<00:04:24.909> they<00:04:25.900> literally<00:04:26.289> didn't<00:04:26.650> put<00:04:26.830> n

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
you can they literally didn't put n

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.130 
you can they literally didn't put n
real<00:04:27.700> invisible<00:04:28.000> walls<00:04:28.420> you<00:04:28.630> could<00:04:28.780> jump<00:04:29.020> on

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
real invisible walls you could jump on

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.570 
real invisible walls you could jump on
top<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.410> buildings<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:30.040> could<00:04:30.250> go<00:04:30.340> wherever

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
top of buildings you could go wherever

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.840 
top of buildings you could go wherever
you<00:04:30.790> wanted<00:04:31.270> aside<00:04:32.200> from<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.590> corners<00:04:33.430> of<00:04:33.460> the

you let Bethesda know so they can take
notes<00:06:55.860> someone<00:06:56.790> said<00:06:57.000> that<00:06:57.350> it's<00:06:58.350> going<00:06:58.440> to<00:06:58.530> be

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
notes someone said that it's going to be

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.110 
notes someone said that it's going to be
a<00:06:58.620> shame<00:06:58.860> that<00:06:58.890> it<00:06:59.160> doesn't<00:06:59.490> won't<00:06:59.610> see<00:06:59.790> any<00:06:59.970> of

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
a shame that it doesn't won't see any of

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.550 
a shame that it doesn't won't see any of
these<00:07:00.270> but<00:07:00.780> when<00:07:00.900> you<00:07:00.960> really<00:07:01.050> think<00:07:01.200> about<00:07:01.410> it

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
these but when you really think about it

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.870 
these but when you really think about it
I<00:07:01.710> think<00:07:01.800> they'll<00:07:02.040> take<00:07:02.220> note<00:07:02.400> of<00:07:02.430> the<00:07:02.610> little

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
I think they'll take note of the little

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.880 
I think they'll take note of the little
things<00:07:03.090> like<00:07:03.240> the<00:07:03.390> control<00:07:03.810> changes<00:07:04.110> and<00:07:04.740> the

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:04.890 
things like the control changes and the

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.040 
things like the control changes and the
weather<00:07:05.130> changes<00:07:05.730> and<00:07:05.910> stuff<00:07:06.000> like<00:07:06.270> that<00:07:06.330> but

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
weather changes and stuff like that but

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.750 
weather changes and stuff like that but
so<00:07:07.500> don't<00:07:07.680> think<00:07:07.920> that<00:07:08.040> your<00:07:08.130> comments<00:07:08.610> are

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
so don't think that your comments are

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.280 
so don't think that your comments are
