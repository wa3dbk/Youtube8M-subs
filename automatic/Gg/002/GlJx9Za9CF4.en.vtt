00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 quick 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.060
 in that reality we are here in the presentation of the new screens 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.499
 wanted by Esteve employers 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.959
 and we are with lap 32 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.269
 the product manager of the brand that he appeared more television 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.839
 for well we are presenting in the new product line bags 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.710
 i at this moment we are presenting the technology that revolutionizes the color 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.269
 which is called 4 methyl 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.609
 the TV that is about 4 I put vih from the start of the color television 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.570
 a mixture of three primary colors red green and blue has been handled 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.229
 although there has not been a great evolution so far 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.819
 sears has bothered to be a revolution cure in color 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.990
 and we add a fourth color to the accomplice him to improve the color palette 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.030
 a thousand times 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.590
 if we can see that the screen has this faithful side of the system 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.580
 traditional 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.700
 of three primary colors we have the red 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.520
 green and blue 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.809
 i this palette this technology company allows us a color palette of that 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.130
 total year 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.100
 what we do as sharp 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.020
 include a hole 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.550
 one more yellow element with which 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.430
 we manage for a hundred 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.970
 red green blue and yellow in a pixel therefore the color palette grows 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.730
 a thousand times and we can reproduce colors that could not be 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.160
 possible r form on a TV so far colors like yellow 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.870
 colors like gold 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.580
 photo merchants 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.790
 then this technology is now presented percent with the two televisions 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.950
 to corner 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.140
 and also good include technologies with a tenth generation panel and the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.490
 Ultra rhinebeck technology in combination with a device 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.259
 the chest me that helps us save energy we have a combination 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.890
 color 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.070
 resolution 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.940
 and energy saving then 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.310
 percent is 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.610
 we also load an innovative stylized design a 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.090
 no product your interesting mind the new coastline did however keep 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.250
 this gene as the statutes and the ecology restrictions in their 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.179
 televisions Navarrese as the strictest falls for aesthetic challenge 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.769
 photos of requirements with those who buy television is art yes of course 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.899
 sears cares 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:18.169
 use less resources in the making of a television 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.169
 because this TV consumes less energy when you enjoy it 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:25.639
 and at the end of its life cycle that is totally recyclable and some of the 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.089
 delegated elements speak 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.540
 then the ecological elements of hosting are 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.540
 throughout the life cycle when we are using the product 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.239
 there is a the imi you have united states that he feels 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:39.759
 the anp 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:43.749
 what a pity of the barometer protecting them and what is called geneticist this 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:44.709
 Program 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.030
 will kill certain consumption restrictions by size 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.289
 then the new line to power complies with version 4 of January and be that 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.759
 is that the strictest standard 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.809
 which restricts energy consumption 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:02.579
 on the screens therefore it guarantees you an energy consumption and this 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.210
 be good 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.190
 translates into a choir of the environment we also have a 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.060
 called technology offer 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.030
 the leeds device kof n is monitoring the brightness in the room not 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.259
 you are watching TV 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:18.019
 was going to regulate the brightness of the screen depending on the amount of light 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.049
 you have a very bright room promotes the overall brightness of the screen 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.049
 and if for example it is not a movie in a very dark room the general brightness 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.819
 of the low screen does not cause you fatigue but above all it reduces the consumption 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.019
 also energy 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.660
 then accumulated all these technologies 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.989
 percent 4 a hamlet traven 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.399
 pa negre tenth generation and is that kof sent pc 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:39.689
 we have 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.420
 great image quality and consumption of mejia your dog egota yota passed very 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.620
 important that you thirty as a sound system 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.599
 just as good and good the same quality as the image you can give us 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.129
 count the audio system of the four 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.400
 the whole system of doubts that supports them with four 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.959
 percent include stereo speaker system 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.739
 of 20 watts but something very interesting from these models is being 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.899
 integrating supposed the with 15 4 power within the same interesting screen 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.579
 and pere true internet connection 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.139
 if the whole line of data she-wolf 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.430
 has internet connectivity 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.970
 Internet connectivity is called nets what you allow access to 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.059

 us as saad we have plans to introduce 3d in the second half of the 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.319
 year however at this time 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.309
 lack of content to enjoy a television 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:19.949
 in third dimension 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.479
 and as all technology has to be a little time to mass 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.220
 I know but hey 3d technology is present 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.460

 history and how much they will cost more or less 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.200
 look at this game approximately in the series l 810 50 inches of 25 thousand 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.770
 weights approximately 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.910
 and the interesting thing is good, we start with sizes from 40 to 60 inches and 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.910
