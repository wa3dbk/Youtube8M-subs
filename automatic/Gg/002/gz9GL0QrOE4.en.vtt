00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.880
 hi everyone i'm super 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.790
 happy to meet you today 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.560
 to make you a safe topten but 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 favorite nail polish for spring and yes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.310
 spring has come back he has 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.289
 installed it's super cool we'll be able 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 take out the skirts the little dresses 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.939
 and the party picnics and the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.749
 umbrellas and it's going to be too awesome that's 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.279
 really I believe the the period that I 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.120
 prefers that is to say when I come out of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.039
 my hibernation 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.359
 when winter is over the sun 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.649
 come back and we see the little ones 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.629
 buds the little flowers that 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.960
 come out that's what we come from 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.030
 spring 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.320
 so here I stop blabbing I'm going 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.179
 show you my top ten so these are 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 only kiko varnishes and varnishes 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.890
 essie since these are my favorite so 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 Here in hues that's 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.629
 are for me the most beautiful so for 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.649
 me spring it rhymes with pastel ne 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.140
 do not know about you but for me it's 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.920
 that's why I chose mainly 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 pastel polish 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.400
 we start right away with the most 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.700
 beautiful green water varnish in the world I 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.159
 thought 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.070
 finally one of the most beautiful in any case 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 is the number 3 189 from kiko so 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.770
 I'm going to put you swatch just to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.720
 side because I do not think that the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.399
 colors will come out correctly at the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.479
 camera so it looks like this 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:28.100
 it's a beautiful glass of water 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:31.920
 absolutely superb is the number 3 189 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.560
 then we will stay in the blues 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.329
 green the stuff like that so another 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 nail polish which this time this is the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.210
 number 340 and that is a sky blue to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.820
 fall on the ground 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.579
 so here he is really very very 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.909
 clear very pastel and I love it is a 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:57.060
 killing then that's a very bright green 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.799
 then is not that is not late verdigreen 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.930
 it's a clear glass you'll see it's 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.460
 the number 2 197 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.740
 so me green is my color 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.289
 favorite so I had to put 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.209
 a glass of teeth here it is too much 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:15.130
 too beautiful then had the number 355 which 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.270
 is it a very bright yellow then there I 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.670
 I have the impression that on camera he 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.150
 really really very very dark spring 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.530
 very flash but in reality it is 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.840
 much more pastel than it was going 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.570
 so much clearer so here it is 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.570
 really very very beautiful too then 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.390
 we have the number 3 159 which is a 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.760
 clear orange orange really that pulls 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.510
 on the apricot it's really a superb 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.060
 orange 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.790
 so here it is one of my favorite it 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:53.350
 is really very very beautiful and that's the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:54.850
 number 3 159 then had a really pink 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.070
 this one and the flash is not the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.550
 pastel is a rostrum and flash that pulls 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.230
 on the raspberry coral 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.170
 finally I do not know he's really very 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.850
 very beautiful is the number 2 181 so 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.170
 here it is really very flash but there 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.390
 you see it a lot darker than this 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.980
 that he is I think finally I do not know 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.990
 Anyway, I'll put the swatch 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.160
 next door 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.360
 here it is really very beautiful it is the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.400
 281 then a beautiful bed that is 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.530
 the number 3 130 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.180
 so here you see it really really 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.670
 well it is very very clear it is 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.300
 really gorgeous 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.240
 and yes I have the ten lots right between 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:39.490
 then this one it stays in shades 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.930
 a little lilac lavender blue I'm going to you 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.280
 show both so you can 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.709
 make the difference but here it is 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.000
 so with the lead here you see 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.070
 it's really not at all the same 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.840
 color but but it has purple tones 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.950
 in that it's not all in all I 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.350
 will show you in relation to the blues 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.950
 that I showed you just now 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:03.490
 see he's no longer violating like at 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.720
 unless the clear legate then he 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.880
 remains two varnishes and therefore the g 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.500
 I opted for polish and if I love 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.540
 also varnishes and if they are really 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.970
 tip top and besides there are many 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.930
 who have gone out who have to turn off 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.340
 really not the one I find 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.630
 beautiful and that I would like to have so 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.220
 I may be investing in 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.830
 vernier so soon but so that 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.570
 here is a sparkling rose called jam 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.840
 ndjili is the number 29 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.130
 and so it's a very fuchsia pink 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.930
 very peppy dark with full of micro 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.870
 blue glitter is full of reflections 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.670
 he really very beautiful this one and 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.250
 on the nails and opaque in one layer 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.670
 so is really great so here's the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.210
 djia mendjeli from home and 6 and the last 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.180
 which is also a varnish essie this one 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:59.150
 it's pale pink pastel pink baby 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:02.270
 perfect for me it's number 767 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.430
 and it's called raise the way and so 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.440
 I will put you in info bar all 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.480

 such opaque in one layer 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.850
