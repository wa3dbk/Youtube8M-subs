00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.190
 today in graphics 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.030
 you will say in a fast way 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.240
 nice result 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.250
 I get the question I want more and more often 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.850
 a natural product to my face 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.950
 to clean 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.190
 well what natural product can you do 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.080
 especially as older than use 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.420
 by for tomorrow 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.070
 and especially not the Italians imploring 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.289
 just do the pasta but you can do it 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.390
 also use as a facial 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.969
 walking so far swears by it and they say 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.609
 that they go through all for such a wonderful 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.109
 skin has not quite likely 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.239
 because you see in joke that it is a and 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.300
 other thing about her beautiful face 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.210
 done but I certainly should agree with that 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.010
 making had now wants to cleanse your skin 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.289
 be sentenced on two bottoms then 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.269
 you drink in the water to a small 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.999
 get a little fuller and then you can 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.940

 skin type suitable you have a very oily 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.030
 skin would not advise to go anywhere 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.340

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.240

 that's an advice 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.140
 who does not want to give what oil is 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.530
