hello everybody I like to welcome you to
a<00:00:06.029> new<00:00:06.420> project<00:00:06.660> I'm<00:00:07.140> going<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.860> be<00:00:08.010> making<00:00:08.460> a

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
a new project I'm going to be making a

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.930 
a new project I'm going to be making a
aluminum<00:00:09.809> core<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> tiger<00:00:11.219> face<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.730> this

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
aluminum core to a tiger face in this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.850 
aluminum core to a tiger face in this
video<00:00:12.270> and<00:00:12.619> I<00:00:13.619> use<00:00:14.719> this<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.930> great<00:00:16.199> value<00:00:16.619> I

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
video and I use this is great value I

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.080 
video and I use this is great value I
get<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.340> from<00:00:17.460> Walmart

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
get it from Walmart

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.870 
get it from Walmart
it's<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:19.230> heavy-duty<00:00:19.529> kind<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.190> recommend

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
it's the heavy-duty kind I recommend

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.430 
it's the heavy-duty kind I recommend
always<00:00:21.150> using<00:00:21.300> heavy<00:00:21.810> duty<00:00:21.840> because<00:00:22.200> it's

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
always using heavy duty because it's

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.860 
always using heavy duty because it's
easier<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> shape<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> we'll<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.390> using<00:00:24.540> some

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.870 
easier to shape and we'll be using some

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.850 
easier to shape and we'll be using some
masking<00:00:25.080> tape<00:00:27.170> I'm<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.470> setting<00:00:28.650> up

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
masking tape I'm going to be setting up

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.440 
masking tape I'm going to be setting up
my<00:00:28.950> work<00:00:29.160> area<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.910> bit<00:00:30.030> different<00:00:30.420> that

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
my work area a little bit different that

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.990 
my work area a little bit different that
what<00:00:30.690> you're<00:00:30.810> used<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> seeing<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.910> I'm

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
what you're used to seeing so what I'm

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.270 
what you're used to seeing so what I'm
going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.570> I'm<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> build<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
going to do is I'm going to build this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.639 
going to do is I'm going to build this
core<00:00:35.820> out<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.179> aluminum<00:00:36.929> foil<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.379> time-lapse

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
core out of aluminum foil in time-lapse

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.849 
core out of aluminum foil in time-lapse
so<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.249> can<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.609> me<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.659> this<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> end

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
so you can see me do this and at the end

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.049 
so you can see me do this and at the end
of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> video<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.609> to<00:00:41.670> show<00:00:41.819> you<00:00:41.909> how<00:00:42.030> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
of the video I'm going to show you how I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.520 
of the video I'm going to show you how I
have<00:00:42.239> everything<00:00:42.719> set<00:00:42.899> up

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
have everything set up

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.739 
have everything set up
I<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:44.100> basically<00:00:44.249> want<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> set<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.629> an

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
I just basically want to set it up at an

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:48.139 
I just basically want to set it up at an
angle<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.920> where<00:00:47.069> it's<00:00:47.309> more<00:00:47.519> comfortable<00:00:48.030> for

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
angle to where it's more comfortable for

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.270 
angle to where it's more comfortable for
me<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.949> build<00:00:49.949> on<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.249> face<00:00:51.920> first<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.069> tear

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
me to build on this face first I tear

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
me to build on this face first I tear
off<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.489> bunch<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> good-sized<00:00:54.390> sheets<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.960> foil

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
off a bunch of good-sized sheets of foil

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.529 
off a bunch of good-sized sheets of foil
and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.979> I<00:00:56.100> want<00:00:56.370> each<00:00:56.579> sheet<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:57.120> into<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and then I want each sheet up into a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.799 
and then I want each sheet up into a
ball<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.639> unwanted<00:00:59.639> into<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.179> flat<00:01:00.510> sheet

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
ball and then unwanted into a flat sheet

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.889 
ball and then unwanted into a flat sheet
again<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.859> dis<00:01:02.129> organizes<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.179> surface<00:01:03.659> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
again this dis organizes the surface and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.380 
again this dis organizes the surface and
it<00:01:04.260> becomes<00:01:04.620> a<00:01:04.799> greater<00:01:05.129> bulking<00:01:05.790> agent<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it becomes a greater bulking agent this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
it becomes a greater bulking agent this
way<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:07.020> how<00:01:07.110> much<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.530> bulky<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.040> looks

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
way see how much more bulky that looks

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
way see how much more bulky that looks
compared<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.180> how<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> first<00:01:09.870> torn

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
compared to just how when I first torn

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.830 
compared to just how when I first torn
out<00:01:10.550> telling<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.300> helps<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
out telling it really really helps to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.930 
out telling it really really helps to
bulk<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:16.370> needed<00:01:17.370> to<00:01:17.520> create<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
bulk this out I needed to create a

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.210 
bulk this out I needed to create a
three-dimensional<00:01:18.360> shape<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.560> simulate<00:01:19.800> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
three-dimensional shape to simulate the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.080 
three-dimensional shape to simulate the
snout<00:01:21.230> basically<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.440> mound<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.250> thought<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
snout basically a mound I thought the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.730 
snout basically a mound I thought the
best<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.480> go<00:01:24.690> about<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
best way to go about this is just to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
best way to go about this is just to
make<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.100> round<00:01:26.340> disks<00:01:26.910> of<00:01:27.060> different<00:01:27.600> sizes

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
make some round disks of different sizes

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.970 
make some round disks of different sizes
and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:29.130> stack<00:01:29.490> them<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.820> top<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.060> each<00:01:30.300> other

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
and then stack them on top of each other

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.410 
and then stack them on top of each other
figured<00:01:31.980> I'd<00:01:32.070> make<00:01:32.220> more<00:01:32.400> sense<00:01:32.700> than<00:01:32.910> just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
figured I'd make more sense than just

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.790 
figured I'd make more sense than just
watering<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.050> a<00:01:34.140> bunch<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.440> foil<00:01:34.740> aimlessly

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
watering up a bunch of foil aimlessly

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.940 
watering up a bunch of foil aimlessly
basically<00:01:37.800> I<00:01:38.010> built<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.730> in<00:01:38.850> layers<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.950> then

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
basically I built it in layers and then

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.840 
basically I built it in layers and then
I<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.190> add<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> little<00:01:41.790> more<00:01:42.980> foil<00:01:43.980> as<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.640> go

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
I just add a little more foil as I go

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.200 
I just add a little more foil as I go
and<00:01:45.120> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.230> is<00:01:46.440> your<00:01:47.370> you<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.060> got

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and a lot of this is your you just got

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.390 
and a lot of this is your you just got
to<00:01:48.330> do<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.450> by<00:01:48.660> eye<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:49.650> can<00:01:49.830> keep<00:01:50.010> in<00:01:50.160> mind

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
to do it by eye you can keep in mind

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.230 
to do it by eye you can keep in mind
that<00:01:50.760> you<00:01:51.570> want<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.130> decor<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.460> armature<00:01:53.940> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that you want the decor the armature to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.440 
that you want the decor the armature to
be<00:01:54.420> smaller<00:01:54.870> than<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.160> actual<00:01:56.640> finished

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
be smaller than what the actual finished

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690 
be smaller than what the actual finished
result<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:59.310> by<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> time

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
result is going to be just by the time

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.970 
result is going to be just by the time
you<00:01:59.850> get<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.090> clay<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.570> there<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.650> going<00:02:01.890> to

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
you get that clay on there it's going to

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.370 
you get that clay on there it's going to
start<00:02:02.940> taking<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.330> some<00:02:03.480> space<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.050> why<00:02:04.200> not

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
start taking up some space and a why not

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
start taking up some space and a why not
being<00:02:04.590> larger<00:02:04.950> than<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.220> think<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:06.240> going

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
being larger than you think it's going

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
being larger than you think it's going

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
clay really using aluminum foil is one

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.180 
clay really using aluminum foil is one
of<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:11.970> best<00:02:12.150> ways<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.390> go<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:13.620> working<00:02:14.069> with

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
of the best ways to go with working with

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.460 
of the best ways to go with working with
polymer<00:02:14.460> clay<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:15.180> pretty<00:02:15.390> expensive

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
polymer clay it's pretty expensive

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.460 
polymer clay it's pretty expensive
and<00:02:16.560> here<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.490> finished<00:02:17.910> core<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.350> I'll

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and here is the finished core that I'll

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
and here is the finished core that I'll
now<00:02:19.680> tape<00:02:19.980> down<00:02:21.860> okay<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> part

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
now tape down okay this is the part

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.370 
now tape down okay this is the part
where<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> was<00:02:23.790> saying<00:02:24.150> where<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.660> was<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.320> to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
be doing it a little different this is

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.670 
be doing it a little different this is
just<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.990> board

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
just a board

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.430 
just a board
I<00:02:28.710> got<00:02:29.040> leaning<00:02:29.520> against<00:02:29.820> my<00:02:30.060> wall<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.540> it's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
I got leaning against my wall and it's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.350 
I got leaning against my wall and it's
taped<00:02:31.800> down<00:02:32.160> at<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.820> bottom

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
taped down at the bottom

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.200 
taped down at the bottom
what's<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.320> masking<00:02:34.800> tape<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.280> put<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> screw

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
what's the masking tape I put a screw

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.120 
what's the masking tape I put a screw
right<00:02:36.420> here<00:02:36.560> because<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.860> recently

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
right here because I just recently

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.470 
right here because I just recently
discovered<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.060> my<00:02:39.770> my<00:02:40.770> turntable<00:02:41.490> can<00:02:42.360> be

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
discovered that my my turntable can be

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.990 
discovered that my my turntable can be
hung<00:02:42.720> like<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.930> picture<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.490> could<00:02:44.700> work<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
hung like a picture so I could work on a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.570 
hung like a picture so I could work on a
mask<00:02:45.360> or<00:02:45.750> face<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.980> thought<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.280> was<00:02:47.460> like

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
mask or face and I thought I was like

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.199 
mask or face and I thought I was like
well<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.240> really<00:02:48.510> awesome<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:50.030> will<00:02:51.030> be

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
well this is really awesome I will be

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.360 
well this is really awesome I will be
making<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.690> video<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:52.050> how<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.530> make<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.340> of

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
making a video on how to make one of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.660 
making a video on how to make one of
these<00:02:53.720> turntables<00:02:55.100> probably<00:02:56.100> next<00:02:56.370> video

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
these turntables probably next video

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.490 
these turntables probably next video
because<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> lot<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.570> people<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.959> been<00:02:58.050> asking

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.050 
in the middle and start taping that down
onto<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.630> wax<00:03:12.870> paper<00:03:13.170> all<00:03:13.650> around<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.820> can

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
onto the wax paper all around so I can

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.960 
onto the wax paper all around so I can
build<00:03:15.300> my<00:03:17.360> face<00:03:18.360> here<00:03:18.840> out<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.950> at<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.610> when

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
build my face here out and at the when

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.729 
build my face here out and at the when
I'm<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.300> done<00:03:21.330> all<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> have<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.500> cut

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.310 
I'm all done all I have to do is cut
around<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:24.239> should<00:03:24.450> come<00:03:24.660> away<00:03:24.900> free

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
around it and it should come away free

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.220 
around it and it should come away free
because<00:03:26.160> it's<00:03:26.489> just<00:03:26.760> wax<00:03:27.030> paper<00:03:27.330> on<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.870> you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
because it's just wax paper on this you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.130 
because it's just wax paper on this you
know<00:03:28.380> there's<00:03:28.860> no<00:03:28.980> stickiness<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:30.140> that's

do<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.480> want<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.870> get<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.140> set<00:03:34.350> up<00:03:34.500> right<00:03:34.530> here

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
do I want to get this set up right here

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.060 
do I want to get this set up right here
this<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.269> an<00:03:36.420> excellent<00:03:36.989> foundation<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.950> be

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
this is an excellent foundation to be

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.000 
this is an excellent foundation to be
building<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.870> will<00:03:40.050> take<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:40.739> most

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
building on and this will take up most

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.320 
building on and this will take up most
of<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.340> bulk<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.890> actual<00:03:44.400> piece<00:03:45.150> we're

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
of the bulk of the actual piece we're

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.490 
of the bulk of the actual piece we're
going<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.540> be<00:03:45.630> doing<00:03:45.780> here<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.459> save<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.640> play

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
going to be doing here and save on play

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.350 
going to be doing here and save on play
as<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:50.220> well<00:03:50.790> know<00:03:50.820> if<00:03:51.180> you've<00:03:51.330> been

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
following the channel I have two pounds

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.930 
following the channel I have two pounds
of<00:03:53.310> mixed<00:03:53.820> clay<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.420> work<00:03:54.660> with<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.940> I'm

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
of mixed clay to work with and I'm

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.710
