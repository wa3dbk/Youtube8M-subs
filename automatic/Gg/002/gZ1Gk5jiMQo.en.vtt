00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
I've spent a lot of hours in the dental

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.849 
I've spent a lot of hours in the dental
chair<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:05.330> everyone's<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.480> very<00:00:07.140> fearful<00:00:07.440> root

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
chair and everyone's a very fearful root

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.500 
chair and everyone's a very fearful root
canals<00:00:08.160> because<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> first<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.000> had<00:00:09.210> many

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
canals because the first one I had many

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.360 
canals because the first one I had many
years<00:00:09.690> ago<00:00:09.809> after<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.590> got<00:00:10.710> my<00:00:10.830> two<00:00:10.889> front<00:00:11.190> teeth

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
years ago after I got my two front teeth

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.759 
years ago after I got my two front teeth
knocked<00:00:11.670> out<00:00:11.929> was<00:00:12.929> very<00:00:13.170> painful

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
knocked out was very painful

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.950 
knocked out was very painful
yeah<00:00:13.980> well<00:00:14.370> root<00:00:14.639> canals<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> stigma<00:00:15.570> with

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
yeah well root canals have a stigma with

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.500 
yeah well root canals have a stigma with
them<00:00:16.320> especially<00:00:16.590> because<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
them especially because of the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.810 
them especially because of the
anesthetics<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.350> used<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.859> used<00:00:20.039> we've

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
anesthetics that used to be used we've

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.880 
anesthetics that used to be used we've
come<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> long<00:00:21.420> way<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.710> call

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
come a long way and we have what we call

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.740 
come a long way and we have what we call
now<00:00:23.039> ended<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.670> us<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.210> our<00:00:24.330> root<00:00:24.510> canal

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
now ended on us that our root canal

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080 
now ended on us that our root canal
specialist<00:00:25.320> that's<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.730> root

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
specialist that's all we do is root

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.790 
specialist that's all we do is root
canals<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> told<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.500> when<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.710> were

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
canals so and I told you when you were

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.349 
canals so and I told you when you were
doing<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> from<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.269> gonna

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
doing it from here on out I was gonna

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.820 
doing it from here on out I was gonna
say<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> everyone<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.109> home<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.500> you're<00:00:31.679> gonna

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
say to everyone at home if you're gonna

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740 
say to everyone at home if you're gonna
get<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.040> root<00:00:32.250> canal<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.759> highly<00:00:33.270> recommend

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
get a root canal I highly recommend

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
get a root canal I highly recommend
getting<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.620> done<00:00:34.739> by<00:00:34.950> an<00:00:35.010> endodontist

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
getting it done by an endodontist

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.520 
getting it done by an endodontist
because<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.809> that's<00:00:37.290> always

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
because it's what you do that's always

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.180 
because it's what you do that's always
and<00:00:37.739> that's<00:00:37.860> it

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and that's it

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.459 
and that's it
that's<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.640> no<00:00:39.059> cosmetics<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:40.050> root<00:00:40.200> canals

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that's it no cosmetics just root canals

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.850 
that's it no cosmetics just root canals
so<00:00:40.710> everyone<00:00:41.520> wants<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> root

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
so everyone wants to know what is a root

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740 
so everyone wants to know what is a root
canal<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:44.879> animation<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.570> want

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
canal and we have an animation I want

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
canal and we have an animation I want
you<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.930> explain<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.500> everyone<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you to explain to everyone because a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.970 
you to explain to everyone because a
root<00:00:47.430> canal<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.079> go<00:00:49.079> ahead<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.379> talk<00:00:49.829> us

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
root canal is go ahead and talk us

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
root canal is go ahead and talk us
through<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.789> root<00:00:51.629> canal<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.899> usually

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
through this so a root canal is usually

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.049 
through this so a root canal is usually
needed<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:52.770> there's<00:00:52.949> decay<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.520> infection

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
needed when there's decay or infection

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.020 
needed when there's decay or infection
inside<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.930> roots<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.879> we

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
inside the roots the way we do it is we

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.180 
inside the roots the way we do it is we
drill<00:00:57.329> through<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> tooth<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.980> down

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
drill through the tooth and we get down

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
drill through the tooth and we get down
into<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.789> roots<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.750> animation<00:01:01.199> will<00:01:01.350> show

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
into the roots the animation will show

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.100 
into the roots the animation will show
that<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.370> here's<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> nerve<00:01:03.090> inside<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that so here's the nerve inside the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.140 
that so here's the nerve inside the
tooth<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:04.619> become<00:01:05.010> infected<00:01:05.400> that's<00:01:05.970> why

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
tooth that's become infected that's why

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.640 
tooth that's become infected that's why
we<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.450> root<00:01:06.659> canal<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.049> we'll<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
we do root canal so we'll go in and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
we do root canal so we'll go in and
we'll<00:01:07.830> use<00:01:08.040> files<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:09.360> clean<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
we'll use files to clean out the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560 
we'll use files to clean out the
infection<00:01:10.290> within<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.460> roots<00:01:11.700> inside<00:01:12.330> where

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
infection within the roots inside where

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
infection within the roots inside where
the<00:01:12.659> nerves<00:01:12.869> used<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.310> pack<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.850> in

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the nerves used to be then we pack it in

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.179 
the nerves used to be then we pack it in
with<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.450> filling<00:01:16.439> material<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:16.979> called

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
with a filling material that's called

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
with a filling material that's called
gutta-percha<00:01:17.460> basically<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> same<00:01:18.659> thing<00:01:18.869> as

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
gutta-percha basically the same thing as

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
gutta-percha basically the same thing as
latex<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> plastic<00:01:20.880> material<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:21.540> we

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
latex it's a plastic material then we

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.679 
latex it's a plastic material then we
plug<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> top<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.890> either<00:01:23.790> leave<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
plug up the top and either leave the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.020 
plug up the top and either leave the
filling<00:01:25.080> or<00:01:25.290> put<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> crown<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.490> cosmetic

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
filling or put a crown or a cosmetic

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.999 
filling or put a crown or a cosmetic
filling<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> stay<00:01:28.710> over<00:01:28.920> there

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
filling over that and stay over there

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.289 
filling over that and stay over there
because<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:29.670> an<00:01:29.970> x-ray<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
because we have I think an x-ray of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.859 
because we have I think an x-ray of
before<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> after<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:32.390> what<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.780> on

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
before and after of what was going on

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
before and after of what was going on
with<00:01:34.079> my<00:01:34.229> own<00:01:34.259> root<00:01:34.530> canal<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.400> know

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
with my own root canal because I know

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
with my own root canal because I know
what<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.860> at

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
what I was right so here but here at

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620 
what I was right so here but here at
Travis's<00:01:38.430> root<00:01:38.670> canals<00:01:38.939> these<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.270> his<00:01:39.420> two

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
Travis's root canals these are his two

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.810 
Travis's root canals these are his two
front<00:01:39.840> teeth<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.890> has<00:01:41.009> had<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> crown<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.670> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
front teeth one has had a crown on it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
front teeth one has had a crown on it
one<00:01:42.030> doesn't<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> root<00:01:43.530> canal

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
one doesn't and you see the root canal

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
one doesn't and you see the root canal
which<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.729> gutta-percha<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> was

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
which is the the gutta-percha that I was

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.880 
which is the the gutta-percha that I was
explaining<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> filling<00:01:46.799> material

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
explaining to you the filling material

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.830 
explaining to you the filling material
doesn't<00:01:47.520> go<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.880> way<00:01:48.060> down<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> very

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
doesn't go all the way down to the very

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
doesn't go all the way down to the very
tip<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> root<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.860> where<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> root

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
tip of the root this is where the root

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
tip of the root this is where the root
ends<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.180> where<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> root<00:01:51.810> canal

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
ends this is where the root canal

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.630 
ends this is where the root canal
filling<00:01:52.350> ends<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.100> haven't<00:01:53.280> cleaned

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
filling ends so they haven't cleaned

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.130 
filling ends so they haven't cleaned
about<00:01:53.909> two<00:01:54.149> millimeters<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.899> two

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
about two millimeters here two

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
about two millimeters here two
millimeters<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> an<00:01:55.860> endodontist<00:01:56.399> is

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
millimeters to an endodontist is

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.300 
millimeters to an endodontist is
equivalent<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> two<00:01:57.780> football<00:01:58.229> fields<00:01:58.310> every

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
equivalent to two football fields every

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
equivalent to two football fields every
millimeter<00:01:59.790> counts<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.600> don't<00:02:00.750> clean

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
millimeter counts so if you don't clean

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.929 
millimeter counts so if you don't clean
all<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> very<00:02:01.770> tip<00:02:02.009> you'll<00:02:02.729> have

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
all the way to the very tip you'll have

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.630 
all the way to the very tip you'll have
the<00:02:03.030> region<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:04.229> chronic<00:02:04.890> infection<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.490> their

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the region a chronic infection in their

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.639 
the region a chronic infection in their
action<00:02:06.060> exactly<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.659> an<00:02:06.930> after<00:02:07.259> x-ray

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
action exactly do we have an after x-ray

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.559 
action exactly do we have an after x-ray
I'm<00:02:07.829> not<00:02:07.979> sure<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.489> if<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.179> I'll<00:02:09.360> show

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
I'm not sure if we do if we do I'll show

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.140 
I'm not sure if we do if we do I'll show
you<00:02:09.660> guys<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.830> see<00:02:11.129> here's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.760> one

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
you guys and you can see here's a one

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.790 
you guys and you can see here's a one
root<00:02:12.330> canal<00:02:12.599> goes<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:13.080> down<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
root canal goes right down to the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.650 
root canal goes right down to the
very<00:02:13.920> tip<00:02:14.130> here's<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.060> other<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.390> goes<00:02:15.570> right
