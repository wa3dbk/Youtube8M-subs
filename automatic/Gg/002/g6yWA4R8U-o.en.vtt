one<00:03:54.010> thing<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.340> really<00:03:54.370> interested<00:03:55.030> me<00:03:55.090> is

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
one thing that really interested me is

one thing that really interested me is
he<00:03:56.170> asked<00:03:56.709> why<00:03:57.070> we<00:03:57.640> don't<00:03:57.910> have<00:03:58.330> more<00:03:58.630> focused

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
he asked why we don't have more focused

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.800 
he asked why we don't have more focused
on<00:03:59.260> racing<00:03:59.860> why<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.760> big<00:04:01.060> focus<00:04:01.480> on<00:04:01.630> your

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
on racing why is the big focus on your

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.830 
on racing why is the big focus on your
ear<00:04:02.380> racing<00:04:03.130> time<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.790> not<00:04:04.030> on<00:04:04.209> who<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:04.540> beat

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
ear racing time and not on who you beat

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.140 
ear racing time and not on who you beat
and<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.100> chance<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:06.670> were<00:04:06.790> talking<00:04:06.940> about

rounds or three rounds of qualifying you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.170 
rounds or three rounds of qualifying you
just<00:04:33.260> add<00:04:33.380> up<00:04:33.620> your<00:04:33.650> your<00:04:34.160> round<00:04:34.400> scores<00:04:34.790> you

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
just add up your your round scores you

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.330 
just add up your your round scores you
know<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.360> got<00:04:35.540> a1<00:04:35.840> a3<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.290> a5<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.950> sounds

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
know you got a1 a3 and a5 that sounds

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.460 
know you got a1 a3 and a5 that sounds
like<00:04:37.460> nine<00:04:37.640> points<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.210> me<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.110> you'd<00:04:39.290> be

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
like nine points to me and so you'd be

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.140 
like nine points to me and so you'd be
you<00:04:39.800> know<00:04:39.920> you'd<00:04:40.160> be<00:04:40.190> too<00:04:40.460> qualified<00:04:40.610> ahead<00:04:41.060> of

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
you know you'd be too qualified ahead of

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.250 
you know you'd be too qualified ahead of
someone<00:04:41.360> with<00:04:41.450> 10<00:04:41.660> points<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.050> you'd<00:04:42.200> be

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
someone with 10 points and you'd be

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.900 
someone with 10 points and you'd be
qualified<00:04:42.650> behind<00:04:42.980> someone<00:04:43.250> with<00:04:43.370> eight<00:04:43.550> and

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
qualified behind someone with eight and

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.570 
qualified behind someone with eight and
I<00:04:44.870> would<00:04:45.110> still<00:04:45.320> take<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.590> race<00:04:45.770> times<00:04:46.190> you

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
I would still take the race times you

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.730 
I would still take the race times you
know<00:04:46.730> your<00:04:47.000> your<00:04:47.030> standard<00:04:47.870> eight<00:04:48.200> laps<00:04:48.470> in

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
know your your standard eight laps in

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.010 
know your your standard eight laps in
five<00:04:48.980> minutes<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.370> 10<00:04:49.580> seconds<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.210> would<00:04:50.840> take

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
five minutes and 10 seconds I would take

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.500 
five minutes and 10 seconds I would take
those<00:04:51.230> and<00:04:51.470> use<00:04:51.680> them<00:04:51.830> as<00:04:51.920> a<00:04:51.980> tiebreaker<00:04:52.610> but<00:04:53.480> I

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
those and use them as a tiebreaker but I

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.000 
those and use them as a tiebreaker but I
think<00:04:53.660> it'd<00:04:53.870> be<00:04:53.900> really<00:04:54.170> interesting<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:54.740> run

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
think it'd be really interesting to run

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.400 
think it'd be really interesting to run
an<00:04:55.130> event<00:04:55.490> with<00:04:56.060> essentially<00:04:56.690> reedy<00:04:56.960> style

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
an event with essentially reedy style

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.050 
an event with essentially reedy style
qualifying<00:04:58.370> what<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.090> what<00:04:59.330> happens<00:04:59.810> is<00:05:00.050> that

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
qualifying what and what happens is that

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.550 
qualifying what and what happens is that
everybody<00:05:02.060> going<00:05:02.420> this<00:05:02.570> race<00:05:02.930> has<00:05:02.960> an

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
identical to if all that matters is who

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.920 
identical to if all that matters is who
I<00:05:06.470> be<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:07.010> my<00:05:07.190> heat<00:05:07.400> race<00:05:07.640> then<00:05:08.390> suddenly<00:05:08.810> if

I be in my heat race then suddenly if

you know through the ten races or if it

everyone is racing with different people
each<00:05:35.840> time<00:05:37.390> but<00:05:38.390> I<00:05:38.600> think<00:05:38.840> it'd<00:05:38.930> be<00:05:38.960> just<00:05:39.080> a

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
each time but I think it'd be just a

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.370 
each time but I think it'd be just a
fascinating<00:05:39.850> fascinating<00:05:40.850> waited<00:05:41.540> to<00:05:41.900> race

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
fascinating fascinating waited to race

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.890 
fascinating fascinating waited to race
and<00:05:42.650> I<00:05:43.070> think<00:05:43.130> that<00:05:43.340> such<00:05:43.730> a<00:05:43.760> system<00:05:44.270> could

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
and I think that such a system could

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.410 
and I think that such a system could
maybe<00:05:45.260> get<00:05:45.740> us<00:05:45.860> back<00:05:46.100> to<00:05:46.340> running<00:05:46.580> nationals

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
maybe get us back to running nationals

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.330 
maybe get us back to running nationals
