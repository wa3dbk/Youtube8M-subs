 change by two from the sheet yesterday 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.320
 but it was unfortunately due to the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.550
 court case that ep viseu made 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.559
 counterpoint to Tony 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.660

 multiplayer mw2 né personal i saw that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
 many people and no comments are 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.489
 commenting that they are not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 I can follow the steps 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.229
 correctly the registration system does not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.720
 is functional giving the conef serves hosp 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.100
 It's very unique is that the name including 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.780
 available on the channel 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 the alternative even holy method 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 antônio but does not give to health is 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.960
 definitely the sectors were 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.689
 closed therefore you can not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.830
 have access to stunned cars you do not 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.840
 Will you be able to connect? 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.759
 but with time and points of mw2 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.460
 provide an alternative method with 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.009
 Sorry for you to play 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.299
 so as soon as it came to my 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.100
 knowledge of these methods were 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.110
 functional I did a range of tests 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 several tests for later police to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 you are not having an understanding 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.840
 future you speak with affection 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.090
 comments that are not functional 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.220
 are close to what is very important 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.869
 What is the video tutorial? 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.360

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.760
 description of video in one minute video 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.530
 ew mw average 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.730
 ring you can use part of the medium that 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.860
 in the opinion of the best sites of 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.690
 file sharing 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.430
 this personal file you can to 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.340
 create the servers for other people 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.560
 played if you do not have a dedicated set and 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.960
 second file is the first in case I 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.060
 I think but the police were to play I went w4 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.910
 plate is an alternative method for you 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.080

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 So first you 'll find 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.380
 otavio neves erva and later will 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.550
 being past and w4 was train near 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.420
 2003 well I can finish downloading the 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.100
 files 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.180
 it will be saved in folder 16 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.150
 directory handle your downloads 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.140
 because even if they go well compacted 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.300
 you may be using the program 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.460
 close to unpack another 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.460
 do the same functionality I have 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.700
 no way 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.530
 boring already maintains stable first 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.050
 you will open a compressed file and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.330
 w net service you will open this folder 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.670
 and will drag all the actors present 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.640
 in the compressed file to the directory 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.050
 then your mw2 since I dragged 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.110
 I will not speak, I will not do it again. 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.270
 with segmentation is doing here is 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.239
 Imaginary way you do not get a race 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.209
 This is where you are asked to replace you. 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.300
 replaces staff comes after copying 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.360
 ws the files point serves shave 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.910
 director of the series 2 possible to take care 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.940
 my 4 play pet did not accept open there 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.010
 gave this is what came then you go 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.769
 open the folder again and give four 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.530
 perfect 2003 will drag these files 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.600
 aac for gaming folder 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.230
 recapping personal and w9 is for 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.910
 do you make a cable insurance ew play 4 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.620
 play is a server 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.420
 so the customer is that you just go 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.460
 have multiplayer session and you will have 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.250
 access to 13 is easier 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.020
 in the game with a seriously personal one 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.730
 game is already fully functional 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.200
 according to an alternative method for 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.410
 10 mw 12 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.260
 well I'll go after this farm that 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.090
 I give this this theoretical explanation 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.100
 We'll get practice from here. 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.290
 is recording a program already 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.170
 specify the game screenshot already 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.690
 that the pitcher I choose does not support 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.450
 fine for games that have full screen 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.060
 the staff but they will open for the one here 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.370
 w four years are double-click that will 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.790
 loading that bid is usually 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:29.090
 Equally, it is the color of the United 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.980
 kiss but we tried then, game 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.680
 you need a non-personal record 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.500
 on the virtual page called w chat 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.260
 configuration click here they w4 play 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.510
 configuration you will run and acne 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.940
 and you're going to trade the Olympian down 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.770
 if you do not need to change anything that the 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.230

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.540

 features unlike force 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.060
 autonomous but it is provisional and 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.910
