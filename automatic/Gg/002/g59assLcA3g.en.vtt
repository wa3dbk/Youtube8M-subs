00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
I've always heard that too but I have

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
I've always heard that too but I have
cooked<00:02:06.350> honestly<00:02:07.350> I've<00:02:07.530> cooked<00:02:07.740> hundreds<00:02:08.100> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
cooked honestly I've cooked hundreds of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.219 
cooked honestly I've cooked hundreds of
pounds<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.519> being<00:02:08.729> working<00:02:09.540> on<00:02:09.660> these<00:02:09.810> recipes

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
pounds of being working on these recipes

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.760 
pounds of being working on these recipes
because<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:10.979> wanted<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.579> it<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.880> right<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
because I wanted to get it all right and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.229 
because I wanted to get it all right and
I<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.340> haven't<00:02:14.489> found<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.849> difference

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
I really haven't found a difference

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.990 
I really haven't found a difference
either<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.290> psalter<00:02:16.680> without<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.129> song

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
either with the psalter without the song

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.850 
either with the psalter without the song
yeah<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:19.440> won't<00:02:19.590> make<00:02:19.770> them

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
yeah so this is what won't make them

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.770 
yeah so this is what won't make them
tougher<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.460> anything<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:20.850> no<00:02:21.150> no<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
tougher or anything like no no and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.510 
tougher or anything like no no and
though<00:02:21.870> they<00:02:22.260> seem<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.620> cook<00:02:22.950> about<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.370> same

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
though they seem to cook about the same

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.820 
though they seem to cook about the same
length<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.910> time<00:02:23.970> either<00:02:24.390> way<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.770> you

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
length of time either way and so you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.070 
length of time either way and so you
just<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:27.060> how<00:02:27.270> it's<00:02:27.450> ready<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.780> go<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.020> you

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
just then how it's ready to go and you

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.420 
just then how it's ready to go and you
can<00:02:28.260> either<00:02:28.350> cook<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:28.770> low<00:02:28.830> or<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.250> can

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
can either cook it on low or you can

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.360 
can either cook it on low or you can
cook<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:29.730> high<00:02:29.930> fact<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.110> my<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.590> my<00:02:31.650> recipes

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
soaked or not soak because people have

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.350 
soaked or not soak because people have
preferences<00:02:37.100> absolutely<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:39.150> is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
preferences absolutely and so this is

preferences absolutely and so this is
nice<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.080> what<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.320> do<00:02:40.440> here<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:40.980> cook

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
nice and what I do here is just cook

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.320 
nice and what I do here is just cook
them<00:02:41.520> till<00:02:41.760> they're<00:02:41.880> soft<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.970> is

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
them till they're soft and and that is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.770 
them till they're soft and and that is
where<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.230> my<00:02:46.770> bada<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.400> my<00:02:47.640> principal<00:02:48.360> my

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
where is my bada it's my principal my

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.420 
where is my bada it's my principal my
beginning<00:02:49.290> principle<00:02:49.770> with<00:02:49.920> using<00:02:50.250> slow

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
beginning principle with using slow

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.810 
beginning principle with using slow
cookers<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.970> because<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.950> what<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.580> want<00:02:53.760> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
cookers is because you what you want to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.030 
cookers is because you what you want to
do<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.150> find<00:02:54.450> out<00:02:54.630> with<00:02:54.780> your<00:02:54.989> cooker<00:02:55.470> how<00:02:55.770> long

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
do is find out with your cooker how long

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.240 
do is find out with your cooker how long
it<00:02:56.250> takes<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.640> cook<00:02:56.940> your<00:02:57.540> beans<00:02:57.840> soft<00:02:58.380> okay

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
it takes to cook your beans soft okay

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.880 
it takes to cook your beans soft okay
yeah<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.730> your<00:02:59.880> joke<00:03:00.209> also<00:03:01.020> cookers<00:03:01.380> are<00:03:01.590> not

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
yeah and your joke also cookers are not

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.430 
yeah and your joke also cookers are not
created<00:03:02.400> equally<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:03.360> really<00:03:03.630> aren't<00:03:04.020> and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
created equally they really aren't and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.400 
created equally they really aren't and
it<00:03:04.860> took<00:03:05.040> me<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> while<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.459> figure<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.150> out

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
it took me a while to figure this out

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.280 
it took me a while to figure this out
but<00:03:07.670> I've<00:03:08.670> divided<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.600> into<00:03:09.780> average

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
but I've divided it up into average

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020 
but I've divided it up into average
cookers<00:03:10.709> fast<00:03:11.010> cookers<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.580> extra<00:03:11.850> fast

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
cookers fast cookers and extra fast

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.880 
cookers fast cookers and extra fast
cookers<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.450> an<00:03:12.750> average<00:03:13.140> cooker<00:03:13.530> will<00:03:13.709> click

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
faster and they're going to take about

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.610 
faster and they're going to take about
eight<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.510> eight<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.870> half<00:03:21.900> hours<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.470> cook

it's<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.430> make<00:03:32.489> what<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.790> call<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:33.060> fast

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
it's going to make what I call a fast

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.460 
it's going to make what I call a fast
cooker<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.080> take<00:03:34.230> eight<00:03:34.410> to

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
cooker and it's going to take eight to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.259 
cooker and it's going to take eight to
eight<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.860> half<00:03:34.890> hours<00:03:35.130> one<00:03:35.610> hour<00:03:35.640> lesson

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.770 
that they work differently it ok just
really<00:04:11.579> made<00:04:11.760> it<00:04:11.880> easy<00:04:12.060> because<00:04:12.420> now<00:04:12.570> you<00:04:12.630> can

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
really made it easy because now you can

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.180 
really made it easy because now you can
know<00:04:13.049> when<00:04:13.350> your<00:04:13.500> food<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.680> going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.980> be<00:04:14.070> ready
