hello YouTube I'm back with a yet one
other<00:00:04.950> version<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.640> disco<00:00:06.060> floor<00:00:06.410> another

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
other version of the disco floor another

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.950 
other version of the disco floor another
you<00:00:07.770> another<00:00:08.429> user<00:00:08.730> wanted<00:00:09.179> me<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.389> make<00:00:09.599> an<00:00:09.809> 8

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
you another user wanted me to make an 8

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.640 
you another user wanted me to make an 8
by<00:00:10.139> 16<00:00:10.200> 1<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.330> my<00:00:12.570> first<00:00:12.929> attempt<00:00:13.530> at

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
by 16 1 and this is my first attempt at

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.150 
by 16 1 and this is my first attempt at
it<00:00:14.150> it's<00:00:15.150> not<00:00:15.509> one<00:00:15.870> hundred<00:00:16.049> percent<00:00:16.260> perfect

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
it it's not one hundred percent perfect

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.279 
it it's not one hundred percent perfect
but<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.789> hard<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.180> make<00:00:18.330> anything<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:19.020> big

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
but it's hard to make anything this big

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.710 
but it's hard to make anything this big
one<00:00:19.590> hundred<00:00:19.830> percent<00:00:19.859> perfect<00:00:23.269> yeah<00:00:24.269> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
one hundred percent perfect yeah it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720 
one hundred percent perfect yeah it
wasn't<00:00:25.289> once<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.740> gets<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.400> pretty

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
wasn't once it gets going it's pretty

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.359 
wasn't once it gets going it's pretty
hard<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.199> pretty<00:00:28.199> hard<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.529> tell<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.980> it's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
hard to pretty hard to tell that it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.860 
hard to pretty hard to tell that it's
bad<00:00:29.789> anyway<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.330> when<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> turn<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:32.870> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
bad anyway so when you turn it on the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.500 
bad anyway so when you turn it on the
way<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> goes<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:36.480> took<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.870> good<00:00:37.530> hour<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
way it goes and this took a good hour to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
way it goes and this took a good hour to
make<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:42.390> I'll<00:00:42.600> briefly<00:00:43.230> explain<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
make and I'll briefly explain the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.029 
make and I'll briefly explain the
circuitry<00:00:44.640> inside<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> we've<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:48.980> we've<00:00:49.980> got

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
circuitry inside so we've got we've got

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
circuitry inside so we've got we've got
the<00:00:50.399> repeaters<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.210> Redstone<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.780> along

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the repeaters in the Redstone all along

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
the repeaters in the Redstone all along
the<00:00:52.559> outside<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> inside<00:00:54.149> we've<00:00:54.570> got

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the outside and on the inside we've got

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.069 
the outside and on the inside we've got
all<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> torches<00:00:55.559> wind<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.910> basically<00:00:57.899> we

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
all the torches wind up and basically we

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.360 
all the torches wind up and basically we
do<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> same<00:00:58.559> thing<00:00:58.770> again<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
do the same thing again with the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.639 
do the same thing again with the
repeaters<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.629> make<00:01:00.840> these<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.350> layers

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
repeaters and we make these just layers

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.179 
repeaters and we make these just layers
of<00:01:02.039> repeaters<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.699> stuff<00:01:03.680> inside<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> do

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
of repeaters and stuff inside and you do

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.820 
of repeaters and stuff inside and you do
it<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:05.580> time<00:01:05.930> like<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
it one more time like that and then I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
it one more time like that and then I
think<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.250> believe<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.970> way<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> bit<00:01:09.600> more

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
think I believe this way is a bit more

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.859 
think I believe this way is a bit more
compact<00:01:10.260> than<00:01:10.439> my<00:01:10.680> other<00:01:10.710> versions<00:01:11.689> but<00:01:12.689> as

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
compact than my other versions but as

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.330 
compact than my other versions but as
you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.040> hook<00:01:14.189> up

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you can see then you just like hook up

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.039 
you can see then you just like hook up
all<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> other<00:01:14.880> stuff<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> outside<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
all this other stuff to the outside to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.560 
all this other stuff to the outside to
each<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.560> each<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.729> your<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.030> zones<00:01:18.299> here

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
each of each of your little zones here

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.440 
each of each of your little zones here
so<00:01:18.810> each<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.500> goes<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.240> one

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so each that one goes up and this one

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.219 
so each that one goes up and this one
goes<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> second<00:01:22.979> row<00:01:24.049> that's<00:01:25.049> how<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
goes up to the second row that's how you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.399 
goes up to the second row that's how you
do<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:27.200> yeah<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.500> i<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
do it and yeah so i think it's it's a

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.050 
do it and yeah so i think it's it's a
pretty<00:01:31.409> successful<00:01:31.890> first<00:01:32.280> attempt<00:01:32.820> i<00:01:32.880> mean

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
pretty successful first attempt i mean

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.539 
pretty successful first attempt i mean
it<00:01:33.210> looks<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> can't<00:01:35.100> tell<00:01:35.400> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it looks you know you can't tell that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.179 
it looks you know you can't tell that
anything's<00:01:36.030> wrong<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.040> that's<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
anything's wrong with that and that's a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.460 
anything's wrong with that and that's a
huge<00:01:38.460> disco<00:01:38.909> floor<00:01:39.119> anyway<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.540> unless<00:01:40.259> your

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
huge disco floor anyway so unless your

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.960 
huge disco floor anyway so unless your
servers<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:41.130> good<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> bring<00:01:41.880> it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
servers really good is going to bring it

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.840 
servers really good is going to bring it
on<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> lag<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:46.399> that's<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.820> far

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
on the lag so if that's it so far

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
on the lag so if that's it so far
another<00:01:48.240> user<00:01:48.600> challenged<00:01:49.350> me<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.500> make<00:01:49.890> one

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
another user challenged me to make one

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.200 
another user challenged me to make one
this<00:01:51.119> big<00:01:51.450> i<00:01:52.189> honestly<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.369> no<00:01:53.610> idea<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:54.090> i'll

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this big i honestly have no idea if i'll

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.200 
this big i honestly have no idea if i'll
ever<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.170> dock<00:01:55.610> hit<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.939> don't<00:01:57.119> know

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
ever get that dock hit it I don't know

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.940 
ever get that dock hit it I don't know
why<00:01:57.390> anyone<00:01:57.689> would<00:01:57.930> need<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> disco<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
why anyone would need a disco for that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.340 
why anyone would need a disco for that
big<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> first<00:01:59.610> place<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:01.049> one

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
big in the first place that was this one

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.160 
big in the first place that was this one
was<00:02:01.590> took<00:02:02.520> long<00:02:02.790> enough<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:04.020> is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
was took long enough to do that that is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.609 
was took long enough to do that that is
just<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.560> monster<00:02:05.210> on<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> side<00:02:06.600> note<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.380> no

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
just a monster on a side note I have no

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.440 
just a monster on a side note I have no
idea<00:02:07.770> why<00:02:08.160> there's<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.580> many<00:02:08.700> villagers<00:02:09.209> here

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
idea why there's so many villagers here
