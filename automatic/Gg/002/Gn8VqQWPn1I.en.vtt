00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.630

 pace 100 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.460
 especially in the area of ​​the highest 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.980
 torque is the passage tremendous 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.229
 nevertheless the english he is grand 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.119

 captivates by perfect proportions and 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.390
 strict discipline on macho was done 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.770
 as well as waived 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.240
 Effectively lettering and what 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:38.610
 says matthias to british 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:40.440
 understatement in the cockpit delight the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.619
 superbly shaped leather seats 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.399
 less like that no 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 Control instruments for oil pressure and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.580
 temperature can be found 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.070
 in a sports car of this caliber 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.390
 actually obligatory 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.729
 In addition, the plastic lever and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.000
 switch easily in this classy environment 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.000
 out of place 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.240
 Has 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.130
 what's the matter with a dare 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.640
 Leatherworking could be better 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.290
 and that in understands that at the aston 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.210
 martin installs the buttons of one 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.700
 normal in front of you here for example without 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.860
 also with amazon here so it's the v12 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.540
 motor as you can see is the really 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.410
 big engines that makes the car too 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.590
 amounts of falls at the engine a lot 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:57.250
 Torque red out because photos are pills 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.320
 and inject 5 142 newton meters stabs 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.580
 the first on the wave but only at 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.370
 5,000 tours 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.230
 there are 306 km h topspeed and 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.230
 scored paddles in the formula 1 team 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.220
 what I like when downshifting is 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.340
 that he's going with intergas 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.700
 switched that makes very clean and 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.700
 juice 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.230
 stay out 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.650
 you want a printer a little better 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.370
 do 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.370
 in my view 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.000
 the hallways are hollow to my other 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.000
 long 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.020
 but you can bank for 7000 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.960
 turn up the turns and at a 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.400
 v12 suction motor this inferno one should 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.400
 have experienced at least once 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.480
 The border area in this car starts 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.440
 late then but you need for lack of esp 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.440
 good reflexes 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.620
 I want to say next picture 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.340
 too soft and you fall you do not have that 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.790
 right feeling he's in a curve because 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:38.070
 in the picture to be swarmed handlebar steering 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.170
 the more and more to a normal market the 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.150
 Steering could give more feedback 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.580
 above all, English conveys one thing 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.580
 I am a very heavy car 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:02.730
 something more direct is the true 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.650
 only for the race track in the normal 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.890
 operation, the steering poses no problem 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.890
 is 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.350
 Driving behavior is I thought to be 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.320
 sports car but first after picture too 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.320
 sluggish and too soft for the pension of 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.060
 English is a gran turismo with the 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.650
 you are very comfortable and very powerful 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.139
 can go on a big tour 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.699
 However, on a wet road is prudent 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.449
 and careful performance 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.449
 required 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.730
 You realize you keep a lot of dare 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.810
 then weighs when braking and the customer 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.810
 you realize that all dare 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.370
 announce the vehicle in front of the car 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.470
 Dare is very nice for the race track 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.120
 is not very suitable because he is 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.490
 just way too heavy too slow 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.260
 the engine does not pull out from below 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.310
 Do not live the walks really well 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:18.410
 symbol too long 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.700
 as the car, well you can not 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.920
 forget that mathias lauda 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.200
 Superdirector and agile racing cars 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.020
 we are used to the grandson 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:31.390
 real understatement offers apart 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.390
 maybe from the ford mondeo make
