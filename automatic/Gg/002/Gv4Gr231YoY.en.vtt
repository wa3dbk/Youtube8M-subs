00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
just code AOL which whatever then you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.130 
just code AOL which whatever then you
also<00:02:20.099> need<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.430> corresponding<00:02:21.239> half<00:02:21.930> inch

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
wide o or not alright so you take one of

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.140 
wide o or not alright so you take one of
them<00:02:28.109> well<00:02:28.739> guess<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.609> really<00:02:29.700> doesn't<00:02:29.909> matter

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150

them well guess it really doesn't matter
which<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.569> use<00:02:30.689> this<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.230> front<00:02:31.730> right

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
which one you use this to front right

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.309 
which one you use this to front right
okay<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.680> stick<00:02:34.889> them<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.129> this<00:02:36.319> and

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
okay so you stick them like this and

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.309 
okay so you stick them like this and
then<00:02:38.359> and<00:02:39.359> again<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.750> doesn't<00:02:39.900> matter<00:02:40.139> which

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
then and again it doesn't matter which

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.920 
then and again it doesn't matter which
way<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.530> stick<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> nut<00:02:41.549> or<00:02:41.700> bolt<00:02:41.819> on<00:02:42.180> but

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
because they don't stick out or anything
