00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.770
 my readers are viewers 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.069

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.069

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.849

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.849
 even take straight play hockey 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.429
 really will say no washer this 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.029
 stealing 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 remove the cover 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.000
 that's actually their headset in the complex 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.410
 condition 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.160
 at the same time it is the most 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.270
 Korolchuk does not affect and is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.740
 a kind of charging station 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.630
 that's actually 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.750
 can you see what kind of a smith is here 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.220
 In general, remembering the old brand itself 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.630
 such are 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.630
 sunbathing light indicator 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.200
 charging went 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.610
 what to say about the device itself 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 near the bus stop like this 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.170
 reports about what you need 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.880
 lower country 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.710
 here on contacts we are convinced a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.770
 to sense 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.110
 magnet in operation 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 Three-time Turks McGee Man 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.140
 now actually how it all works well 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.420
 bye hands for naturally jsc bank 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.540
 but in the media is always so what is the main 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.530
 and 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.640
 in my opinion 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.050
 although the headset was a success and 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.600
 pretty old 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.990
 but we can still see how 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.190
 here is played up 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.980
 let's topic 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.590
 in various fields 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.750
 I do not know what you like best 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.170
 and you can talk about others 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.330
 let's say 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.250
 microphone foot 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.520
 that he often went to the conscience 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.610
 very reliable 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.250
 very cool i like that better 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.840
 there is a piston 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 Then I do not know such a solid sound 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.099
 only in opinion 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.559
 so generally very 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.929
 percent single button 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.549
 there was no hand decree 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.809
 call answer 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.849
 completion 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 Well, actually in this way we take 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:30.929
 we post it 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.419
 science 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.019
 I personally talk 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.829
 I wonder what else 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.269
 cat wool past 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.009
 I would like to note the following 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.449
 here let's say one serves we become 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.939
 designer companies company would not be 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.379
 sp did not come up with designers 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.359
 interesting 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.479
 enough solution and in general it is obvious 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.989
 the shape of the headset is 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.619
 what can you 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:00.789
 no problem 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.789
 establish an official about this dispute 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.559
 that is, here it is based 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.559
 respectively speaker 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.129
 so already begin to fall 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.129
 so who is worth 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.579
 very beautiful stuff stuff ice with 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.540
 tiger good transmission quality 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.379
 speech but in most situations I will say this 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.239
 concrete on the street 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.629
 here but nonetheless 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.040
 as a device it is clear that very 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.029
 expensive 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:33.899
 and as far as I know official Russia 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:34.159
 not supplied
