00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.220
 with a lime and what the first thing 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.410
 we have to do is buy the armor 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.820
 since at the time of forming and that we 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.999
 they take away many lives and come more 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.260
 enemies or minions because let's say I'll 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.330
 remove 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.600
 and it's a character very rarely that what 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.480
 we buy in runes and also the five 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.840
 francs of life and vision that is very 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.060
 important as it takes out Cali is one is 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.310
 a character that moves very slow and 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.550
 we do not have attack speed and 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.379
 etc 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.809
 what I have to do to avoid this 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.690
 and that you do not notice much is that 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.840
 minutes and the minions both work and 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.410
 when the tail is all active 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.650
 the one you have chosen 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.780
 Here we see how Cali learns to the last 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.930
 that would be the last movement the r 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.840
 would be if the war I do not know that this way 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.140
 this movement or this sample of receives 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.440
 for 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.110
 move from skipping distances 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.910
 towards an enemy that many others 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.640
 covers and there fast where 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.850
 transported and you get that enemy that 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.690
 you are law and point does that the is just you 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.940
 takes more than half a life but more than half 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.920
 and then you do it again and in what 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.659
 same and not faults 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.659
 and now I'm going to show you the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.850
 the deaths with this one with this new one with 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.289
 this new one and I'm going to show you some 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.829
 deaths that say no in general 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.829
 questions 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.020
 the last one that I'm going back 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.850
 to have more rank for later 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.229
 chase him for the last one if he killed him 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.229
 very, very fast 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.280
 here I buy boots and to go faster 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.810
 because since when we go to 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.140
 make us more had the time to go back 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.570
 so that he did not get socially fast 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.340
 bought to go a little faster cousin 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.379
 list that does not bother much 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.900
 here I am buying the speed is 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.730
 which to form many reach 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.370
 maximum level and to kill 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.640
 enemies faster than is the speed 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.430
 of attack 45 percent 40 that's that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.060
 more than enough to kill very fast 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.060
 Now I'm going to show you 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.610
 Well I hope you liked us 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.250
 liked we served that listed learning 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.010
 to use analysis and in these steps they were going to 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.560
 always make the victory 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.709
 now they are much more about the level more 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.709
 Quick 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.260
 thank you very much it 's a first time that in 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.260
