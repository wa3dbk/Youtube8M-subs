here's<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.250> small<00:00:02.550> version<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.360> ice<00:00:03.540> chest

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
here's a small version of the ice chest

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.769 
here's a small version of the ice chest
area<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.589> made<00:00:05.400> for<00:00:05.580> my<00:00:05.670> wife<00:00:05.879> she<00:00:06.330> likes<00:00:06.540> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
chased around the house put a little

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.830 
chased around the house put a little
latch<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:44.180> that's<00:00:45.180> my<00:00:45.390> theme<00:00:45.600> right

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
latch on it and that's my theme right

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.209 
latch on it and that's my theme right

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.520 
240-watt amplifier Wow how long has it
been<00:00:55.500> since<00:00:55.620> you've<00:00:55.920> seen<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> good<00:00:56.520> amplifier

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
been since you've seen a good amplifier

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.959 
been since you've seen a good amplifier
these<00:00:58.530> amplifiers<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.340> bad<00:00:59.550> problem<00:00:59.820> with

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
these amplifiers have a bad problem with

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.119 
these amplifiers have a bad problem with
engine<00:01:00.719> noise<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.230> whatnot<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.710> since<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
engine noise and whatnot but since this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.380 
engine noise and whatnot but since this
ice<00:01:02.309> chest<00:01:02.550> doesn't<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:02.940> engine<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
ice chest doesn't have an engine I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.939 
ice chest doesn't have an engine I
really<00:01:04.019> didn't<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> problem<00:01:04.530> using<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
really didn't have a problem using it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.539 
really didn't have a problem using it
and<00:01:05.390> it's<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.600> efficient<00:01:07.470> gives<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.250> two

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and it's very efficient gives these two

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.620 
and it's very efficient gives these two
little<00:01:08.930> two<00:01:09.930> little<00:01:10.200> uh<00:01:10.970> little<00:01:11.970> marine

speakers one on each side gives them

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.600 
speakers one on each side gives them
enough<00:01:15.030> juice<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:16.560> power<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.220> I've<00:01:17.460> had

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
enough juice and a power this I've had

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690 
enough juice and a power this I've had
several<00:01:17.850> options<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.630> now<00:01:19.700> it's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
several options but right now it's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
several options but right now it's
powering<00:01:21.090> off<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:22.220> can<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> focus<00:01:24.350> it's<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
powering off I can get to focus it's the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.270 
powering off I can get to focus it's the
one<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.799> those<00:01:25.920> works<00:01:27.770> works<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.950> weedeater

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
one of those works works a weedeater

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.380 
one of those works works a weedeater
batteries<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.500> 18<00:01:31.500> volt<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.390> know

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
batteries it's actually a 18 volt I know

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.050 
batteries it's actually a 18 volt I know
video<00:01:33.920> amplifiers<00:01:34.920> rated<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.490> least<00:01:35.549> 14

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
video amplifiers rated for at least 14

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.230 
video amplifiers rated for at least 14
so<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:37.140> works<00:01:37.320> well<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> switch

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so it works well and I have the switch

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
so it works well and I have the switch
power<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> remote<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> cord

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
power to the remote I have the cord

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
power to the remote I have the cord
coming<00:01:41.610> from<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:43.500> amplifier<00:01:44.360> inputs<00:01:45.380> through

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
coming from the amplifier inputs through

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
coming from the amplifier inputs through
the<00:01:46.530> hole<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:48.829> oh<00:01:49.829> yeah<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.759> into

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the hole here and oh yeah right into

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.590 
the hole here and oh yeah right into
that<00:01:51.409> so

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
that so

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.679 
that so
and<00:01:54.020> that's<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.409> Oh<00:01:54.909> next<00:01:55.909> video<00:01:56.119> I'll<00:01:56.420> show

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
and that's that Oh next video I'll show

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.530 
and that's that Oh next video I'll show
you<00:01:56.780> some<00:01:56.960> sound<00:01:57.229> on<00:01:57.409> it
