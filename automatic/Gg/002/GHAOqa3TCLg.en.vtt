00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.290
 hart does not know what the jury is made possible by van cz 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.070
 and her sister 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 In this episode of beautiful TV he searches for a shard vest 23 33 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.189
 If necessary 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.510
 Welcome to Active TV We really had to earn your living with the press release 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.020
 He is thus introducing a training monitor 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.460
 After the summer, shocking news from the brand is known for the scenes 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.500
 and focuses on it for graphic professionals 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.970
 Now a completely different mph market is sharpening inner field with money in both 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.520
 the last time in episodes were spent on 2hs screens from dell and as 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.460
 This is actually intended for professional use on ice too 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.210
 being qualified 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.820
 and the parents have a lot of work and you can imagine and become carrots 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.269
 said 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.350
 it is a bit of understanding for the other hits of 19 20 by 1080 so common 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.789
 tidy for the ecb is really no problem at all and that for one 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.420
 number of things and he would have a handle for easy hunting 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.830
 take to lanparty 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.180
 but that's also done is one the votes it devices out for one 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.750
 remote control so you can only change your win settings with jasper 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.000
 and so not on the device they will have committed the murder we may have decided 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.100
 working entrepreneurs would not fit the first team 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.160
 yes and that is not for nothing of the studio settings in May what advantage with it 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:31.780
 can make 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.170
 yes because they have and we very often have products while the imports keep that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.210
 by the manufacturer if there is one thing to be labeled but by which he 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.850
 the colleague immediately picked up catfish against normal product by poachers 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.670
 to sell 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.470
 and so has really added new features of a monitor 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.550
 with special thinking for beginners and then you mainly read on two things 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.530
 smart plus a lunch in and smart inside I let myself be that smartimage loesje 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 because that would 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.720
 the details must improve the images of this decision reflects of 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.850
 a stand and where they address the matter not very revolutionary 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.410
 applications that are being pushed through 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.280
 but it is a sharpening claim that actually and of course is television 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.989
 that's you too 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.810
 So there is a lot of strength and hope for bakers who immediately what it 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.519
 effect is it appears transitions between low contrast and high 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:20.759
 contrast which makes you just 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.659
 see the objects earlier after the gp as we will see on the example 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.049
 i dont think myself it is very unnatural but its the money 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.530
 indeed because of things that are standard it is striking that they overhang too small 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:35.809
 Roundel it earlier to pick out yes because the band aspects that dr comes to an enemy 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.689
 arrives just to offer 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.349
 suit contrast in the men's stand out than normal and can be seen among other things 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.030
 when it will come just deliver 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.459
 there is also the other three I don't know anyone on the darts market inside 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.560
 yes I have a bit of feeling for myself this is for the smartness you or you sit 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.469
 Sutherland was basically doing the dark parts of the screen 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.479
 make the pieces lighter and so if you later 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.899
 or in one in one and wild fear of this idea in curves and the specs 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:08.489
 specially dark in this there are also can not see what happens 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.340
 on a first person shooter someone enters a dark alley and we see the more 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.540
 then with that technique therefore presents the number and looks like the princesses 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.189
 the trees by the pvv 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.189
 I have to say those athletes so I like it but I don't think so myself 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.949
 were more than you get annoyingly figuring out what is this really 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.649
 added value on the bike what you say 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.410
 the midtones and deed with the highlights of images are left alone 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.750
 but everything that is dark is also imposed so that you simply get better and better 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.640
 sees what's in there that the bank is in the shadows with the project 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.639
 is what you say you wouldn't see at first 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:39.610
 m yes 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.520
 is it site 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.970
 I have I would say no because it is the touch he gives audio what already out 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.120
 the video card comes on that which on other too bit never to bite the cut so compact 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.120
 that promised contrast away that was thereby ensuring that the contrast still 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.110
 keep looking good 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.670
 but that is that those dark parts will come for a while yes it is not something 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.010
 what you do not do with other documents never remains just a bit nicer 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.460
 Yes 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.420
 Another special feature of this screen is that it uses a PPP panel 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.260
 we will think a lot of people of those who say psp link in the motogp you 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.370
 always that that pias is very good for colorful time in front of the viewing angle 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.779
 strong for the photo shoppers 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.779
 two 18 number one tn panel because that is much faster 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.479
 but it has actually succeeded in creating a panel with very good ones 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:20.459
 image quality 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.640
 nevertheless it could get there quickly yes it is not as fast as the fastest complexion 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.500
 screens although that should be fine there are our measurements sing at 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.650
 if the platform's overdrive function is on 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.900
 they were black white black also pink 11 milliseconds and misery div 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.660
 persuading cyclists themselves would have been violated even easier 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.480
 fine but then there are many tourists are better 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.809
 more than five hundred food mean nothing wrong with that 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.600
 the team from Driebergen 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.000
 perhaps it is that they played under his can be with the growers that are under the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.280
 six choirs worked for both consists of knowing what I want with it 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.690
 say 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.020
 but the advantage of that is just how because the viewing angle both at such 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.810
 big screen 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.430
 the three are still separate anyway 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.169
 this will not look exactly at all levels, it will be 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.610
 More importantly this year there were still all in those dark parts of it 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.770
 to see details, you no longer have to play with a better view of it 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.889
 real advantage so it is a bit disappointing 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.349
 hey the result is also good it is not it is certainly not both strong water 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.919
 away to work about his person 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.409
 how good engine but thereby the press engines were seeing that significantly better 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.620
 choice rate notes in that area is better than 12 every tm oil tot gartner 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.129
 the uncertain party head and that is also that the center of gravity what kind of 3d too 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.099
 we all look almost 180 degrees in one day 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.759
 nevertheless there were around 130 mortar documentaries and not to try with them 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.330
 familiar and screen you also always have when you move up and down with you there 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.910
 put other things is in terms of came wetering especially in dark score 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.039
 dark it can be a useful guess that he is very calm day anyway 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.330
 by sleet 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.770
 yes, it is ultimately an engine that couples fell on one hundred percent 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.289
 when he knows that the good word ears excellent service excellent technology but also 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.319
 a he is that it generally does not make you very happy 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.900
 the fact that its comeback 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.339
 yes it costs around 320 euros 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.549
 yes the target it is real money for being private is the bar had been hit 

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:05.409
 lands a screen and with good game features a cup of coffee 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:06.330
 team 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.389
 and after the other side want to borrow becomes more expensive is not just the 6 7 to euros that 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.520
 still a whole working day it is really not psv but good that psv that is so me 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.729
 that also from when I saw the screen no press at barcelona that way 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.129
 I have been here five hundred and we must go with the clear requirements 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:22.869
 not too bad in that regard 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:26.639
 I saw a bit of feeling the best of two worlds hand would make normal 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.999
 achieve divorce thinking and and if you are serious with spacey what a suit 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:32.159
 nice is no longer 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.400
 And this is not a be for the stabbing chairman neighborhood if you like everything 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:39.300
 what does and i get as much experience as possible is that dare not say 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.969
 the best of both worlds that very good of both worlds between the 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.240
 clock ahead for both goals was specifically even better ever by 

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:46.770
 to find 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.560
 but this is a very good all-rounder 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.409
 after fine thus sana most decide this episode 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.520
 all episodes we are back on monday wednesday 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.509
 he Friday 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.819
 thanks good look 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:00.110
 never again 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.960
 So there will be a charging point on both sides of the car to the 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.479
 if you are almost right in the neighborhood do not get in the press in your car 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.009
 if you would be in the right direction if you were 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:10.910
 unplug the power cord into a normal power outlet
