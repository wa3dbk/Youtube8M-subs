s<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.119> great<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.630> get<00:00:18.779> amazing<00:00:19.020> colors<00:00:19.619> from

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
s are great you get amazing colors from

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.330 
s are great you get amazing colors from
the<00:00:20.760> lighting<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.590> there's<00:00:22.590> low<00:00:22.830> heat<00:00:23.100> that

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the lighting and there's low heat that

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.950 
the lighting and there's low heat that
emits<00:00:23.730> from<00:00:23.910> these<00:00:24.090> light<00:00:24.300> bulbs<00:00:24.480> which<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
emits from these light bulbs which is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.040 
emits from these light bulbs which is
very<00:00:25.170> nice<00:00:25.880> halogen<00:00:26.880> lighting<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.390> amazing

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
very nice halogen lighting is amazing

very nice halogen lighting is amazing
the<00:00:28.140> growth<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.680> spectacular<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:29.970> that's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the growth is spectacular I think that's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.209 
the growth is spectacular I think that's
the<00:00:30.330> best<00:00:30.539> growth<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.070> with

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the best growth you can get is with

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.270 
the best growth you can get is with
halogen<00:00:32.640> lighting<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:34.130> requires<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
halogen lighting but it requires a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.979 
halogen lighting but it requires a
chiller<00:00:35.640> along<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> system<00:00:36.660> because

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
chiller along with the system because

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.290 
chiller along with the system because
halogen<00:00:37.590> lighting<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.520> hot<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
halogen lighting is so hot it's going to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.270 
halogen lighting is so hot it's going to
cook<00:00:39.480> your<00:00:39.660> tank<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> brings<00:00:41.040> us<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
cook your tank so that brings us to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
cook your tank so that brings us to
temperature<00:00:41.820> these<00:00:42.239> aquariums<00:00:42.540> need<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
temperature these aquariums need a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.319 
temperature these aquariums need a
stable<00:00:43.500> temperature<00:00:44.000> fluctuations<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.180> more

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
stable temperature fluctuations of more

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
stable temperature fluctuations of more
than<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.629> degrees<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.590> take<00:00:46.770> out<00:00:46.950> some

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
than two degrees can take out some

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069 
than two degrees can take out some
species<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.730> coral<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.690> need<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> make<00:00:49.050> sure

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
species of coral so we need to make sure

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.130 
species of coral so we need to make sure
that<00:00:49.260> stable<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> chiller<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> heater<00:00:51.420> so

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that stable with a chiller and heater so

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.590 
that stable with a chiller and heater so
that'll<00:00:52.500> keep<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.829> stable<00:00:53.280> between<00:00:53.730> 75<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.270> 80

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
that'll keep it stable between 75 and 80

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.110 
that'll keep it stable between 75 and 80
depending<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.940> specimens<00:00:56.940> you're

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
depending on what specimens you're

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
depending on what specimens you're
keeping<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.930> let<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> fluctuate<00:00:58.620> more<00:00:58.739> than

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
keeping don't let it fluctuate more than

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.580 
keeping don't let it fluctuate more than
two<00:00:59.039> degrees<00:00:59.219> there<00:00:59.809> next<00:01:00.809> brings<00:01:01.020> us<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
two degrees there next brings us to the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
two degrees there next brings us to the
chemistry<00:01:02.010> phosphates<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.000> nitrates<00:01:03.480> we

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
chemistry phosphates and nitrates we

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
chemistry phosphates and nitrates we
want<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> keep<00:01:04.260> those<00:01:04.470> extremely<00:01:04.949> low<00:01:05.250> with

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
want to keep those extremely low with

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.890 
want to keep those extremely low with
living<00:01:06.450> coral<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:08.340> comes<00:01:08.610> into

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
living coral so that comes into

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.840 
living coral so that comes into
filtration<00:01:09.900> maintenance<00:01:10.680> water<00:01:11.340> changes

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.190 
filtration maintenance water changes
things<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.689> maintain<00:01:12.810> those

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
things like that to maintain those

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.090 
things like that to maintain those
levels<00:01:14.659> calcium<00:01:15.659> magnesium<00:01:16.100> carbonate

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.980 
hardness those need to be regularly
boosted<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> watched<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:21.390> can't<00:01:21.630> let<00:01:21.810> those

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
boosted and watched you can't let those

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.920 
boosted and watched you can't let those
levels<00:01:22.409> drop<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:22.920> sway<00:01:23.250> too<00:01:23.310> much<00:01:23.930> that'll

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
levels drop or sway too much that'll

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.260 
levels drop or sway too much that'll
really<00:01:25.710> affect<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.250> corals<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.939> want<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
really affect your corals you want to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.010 
really affect your corals you want to
keep<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> rich

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
keep it rich

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.319 
keep it rich
so<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> corals<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.799> use<00:01:29.009> those<00:01:29.280> nutrients<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
so the corals can use those nutrients to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
so the corals can use those nutrients to
grow<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:31.470> might<00:01:31.619> find<00:01:31.770> yourself<00:01:31.950> having<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
grow you might find yourself having to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.730 
grow you might find yourself having to
add<00:01:32.700> those<00:01:32.939> daily<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:34.079> keep<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.409> corals

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
add those daily to keep your corals

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.660 
add those daily to keep your corals
happy<00:01:35.689> corals<00:01:36.689> need<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:37.020> water<00:01:37.259> flow<00:01:37.670> they

happy corals need good water flow they

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
happy corals need good water flow they
need<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> vigorous<00:01:39.240> water<00:01:39.540> flow<00:01:39.810> depending<00:01:40.380> on

need a vigorous water flow depending on
what<00:01:40.650> corals<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:42.829> make<00:01:43.829> sure<00:01:43.860> your<00:01:44.130> water<00:01:44.250> flow

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
what corals so make sure your water flow

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.570 
what corals so make sure your water flow
is<00:01:44.670> strong

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
is strong

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.520

those<00:01:45.850> are<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.090> basics<00:01:46.510> on<00:01:46.630> how<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.170> keep

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
those are the basics on how to keep

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.850 
those are the basics on how to keep

coral staying in a regular routine with
it<00:01:51.040> really<00:01:51.490> seems<00:01:51.730> to<00:01:51.820> help

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
it really seems to help

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.680 
it really seems to help
not<00:01:52.600> allowing<00:01:52.930> big<00:01:53.320> fluctuations<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.690> between
