 despite these World Rally Championship titles are not proven 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.919
 not very well known to us 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.959
 it is not for lack of proposing products with strong personality 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.480
 I was called a liar 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.420
 gilbert pla boxer that is to say ciudad proposed for still almost 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.650
 systematically the all-wheel drive 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.220
 in fact the big problem of his baroud europe was not to propose 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.340
 diesel engines a gap filled a few months ago with a brand new 2 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.930
 liters also observe 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.780
 inaugurated with legacy 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.670
 and when the pacs 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.670
 and that we find today under the hood of the fort is order 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.820
 born in 1947 of fire feuters between bands apart in the landscape 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.150
 automotive 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.670
 halfway between and follow and team this model which displays a 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 beautiful versatility adopts the technical standards of the brand 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.180
 in Paris here is little the current version is more pleasant more dynamic 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 although ultimately showing no particular facial features to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.410
 inside we discover a well finished interior but also a lot of 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.000
 hard plastics remain economists to heal and 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.770
 equipment 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.210
 to benefit for example the traditional facilities and 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.830
 electric multifunction steering wheel many storage years that 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.670
 come with the inevitable while the couple woerth or take 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.440
 12 volts and other auxiliary skins housed in a central console itself 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.340
 raise in the armrest 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.700
 at the back the modular chest 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.580
 It incorporates accessories such as electric hooks and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.170
 shelters under its floor a spare wheel 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.390
 framed by storage spaces 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.950
 note also this dj images of windshield wipers integrate at the base of the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.960
 windshield 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.490
 the executive finish and that was ours has moreover 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.150
 kyyate dressing in the keyless access system with start-up 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.240
 pushbutton 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.060
 version 10 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.549
 but it is distinguished externally with its imposing entrances of planted air 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.830
 on the hood 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.750
 under it the light and compact of liters whose power was brought 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.800
 here at 147 horses instead of 150 for the legacy and outback 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.750
 on the other hand the forestois benefited from the first manual six-speed 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.289
 Brand reports 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.299
 in addition to generating only a few vibrations this boxer motor with the 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.219
 center of gravity what is supposed to play in favor of the road behavior 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.750
 one thing is that it will soon be confirmed once in action in the same way 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.749
 that two other qualifiers of this powertrain will come to light 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.010
 among them a generous couple an availability of every moment 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:35.229
 voluntary and displaying that a remarkable smooth running this engine 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.429
 confirms all the good that we had already thought of him by discovering it 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.009
 with the legacy 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.139
 the new box that is attached to it they also deserve thunderstorms 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.179
 when a staggering of seven reports however commands and handling but one 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:48.539
 not sing so much 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:52.019
 served by a very firm lock commanded it because of 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.359
 slowly compose the movements during the reports 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.359
 kimani too quickly we tend to approach easily 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.139
 in terms of small disappointments in motorcycle2 this is a direction that we 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:03.629
 published 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.429
 to participate 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:08.049
 his own stock this debt 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.999
 freighter cargo jump of 2 115 millimeters 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.109
 to venture off the beaten path 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.679
 he enjoys remarkable dynamic behavior both on and off the road 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 all in a comfort that remains bona law in all cases 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:24.499
 a series of things that will no doubt make this forest family appear 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.399
 here already condemned we really started his career
