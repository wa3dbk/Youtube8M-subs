I think people despite the rhetoric of

I think people despite the rhetoric of

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
people want to talk about it but the way

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.140 
people want to talk about it but the way
we<00:00:20.460> talk<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.970> now

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
we talk about it now

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.509 
we talk about it now
is<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> context<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.410> scandal<00:00:22.920> you're

is in the context of scandal you're

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.279 
is in the context of scandal you're
absolutely<00:00:23.850> right<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.480> ricocheted<00:00:25.050> from

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
absolutely right so we ricocheted from

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.990 
absolutely right so we ricocheted from
one<00:00:25.500> race<00:00:25.710> scandal<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> another<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.760> another

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
one race scandal to another to another

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.529 
one race scandal to another to another
it's<00:00:27.180> Don<00:00:27.420> Imus<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.289> Michael<00:00:28.680> Richards<00:00:29.099> it's

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
it's Don Imus it's Michael Richards it's

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.680 
it's Don Imus it's Michael Richards it's
yeah<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.949> that's<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.030> mechanism<00:00:33.600> we

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
yeah and that's the the mechanism we

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.400 
yeah and that's the the mechanism we
have<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> kind<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> escape<00:00:34.559> valve<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> we

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
have the kind of escape valve and and we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.780 
have the kind of escape valve and and we
we<00:00:37.860> don't<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.250> any<00:00:38.550> progress

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
we don't really make any progress

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.000 
we don't really make any progress
instead<00:00:39.210> people<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.500> rehearse<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
instead people are kind of rehearse the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
instead people are kind of rehearse the
same<00:00:41.280> old<00:00:41.550> arguments<00:00:42.090> over<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.510> over<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
same old arguments over and over and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.170 
same old arguments over and over and
over<00:00:42.960> again<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.469> each<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.789> scandal

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
over again and each time the scandal

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180 
over again and each time the scandal
comes<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.719> same<00:00:45.930> people<00:00:46.200> trot<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
comes up the same people trot out and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
comes up the same people trot out and
they<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> same<00:00:48.149> arguments<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.930> then

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
they make the same arguments and then

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.200 
they make the same arguments and then
they<00:00:49.379> trot<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.829> home<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.399> nothing<00:00:50.879> changes

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
they trot back home and nothing changes

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
they trot back home and nothing changes
so<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> would<00:00:54.030> hope<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.379> we

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so I really what I would hope is that we

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
so I really what I would hope is that we
could<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.250> away<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> toward<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
could get away from that and toward the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.150 
could get away from that and toward the
kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> more<00:00:58.050> substantive<00:00:58.530> discussion<00:00:59.070> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
kind of more substantive discussion of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.639 
kind of more substantive discussion of
these<00:00:59.250> problems<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.879> you're<00:01:00.030> suggesting

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
these problems that you're suggesting

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.280 
these problems that you're suggesting
when<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.920> face<00:01:02.449> racial<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.600> justices<00:01:04.110> where

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
when we face racial and justices where

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.690 
when we face racial and justices where
there's<00:01:04.439> no<00:01:04.589> obvious<00:01:04.799> bigot<00:01:06.020> right<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.700> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
there's no obvious bigot right now the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.200 
there's no obvious bigot right now the
tendency<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.330> still<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.960> say<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
tendency is still to say to have the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.149 
tendency is still to say to have the
finger<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.750> blame<00:01:12.780> involved<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
finger of blame involved and I think a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.320 
finger of blame involved and I think a
lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> reason<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:14.939> otherwise

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
lot of the reason is because otherwise

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
lot of the reason is because otherwise
people<00:01:15.509> don't<00:01:15.900> pay<00:01:16.200> attention<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:17.040> don't<00:01:17.280> have

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
people don't pay attention we don't have

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.800 
people don't pay attention we don't have
a<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:17.729> way<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.000> talking<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.720> without

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
a good way of talking about them without

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
a good way of talking about them without
the<00:01:19.170> finger<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> blame<00:01:19.619> involved<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.460> not

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the finger of blame involved so it's not

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.149 
the finger of blame involved so it's not
to<00:01:21.030> condemn<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:22.200> people<00:01:22.470> who<00:01:22.560> are<00:01:22.650> doing<00:01:22.799> this

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
to condemn the people who are doing this

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.590 
to condemn the people who are doing this
this<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> discourse<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.119> we're<00:01:24.390> stuck

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
this is the discourse that we're stuck

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.350 
this is the discourse that we're stuck
with<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.400> if<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.670> could<00:01:26.820> break<00:01:27.000> away<00:01:27.180> from

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
with but if we could break away from

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
with but if we could break away from
that<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.200> some<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.530> these<00:01:28.619> problems

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that and think of some of these problems

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.940 
that and think of some of these problems
as<00:01:29.250> collective<00:01:29.729> problems<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.270> pollution

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
as collective problems like pollution

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.580 
as collective problems like pollution
what<00:01:31.950> greater<00:01:32.340> crisis<00:01:32.970> confronts<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.930> planet

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
what greater crisis confronts the planet

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
what greater crisis confronts the planet
now<00:01:34.740> than<00:01:35.009> global<00:01:35.310> warming<00:01:35.540> than

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
now than global warming than

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.210 
now than global warming than
environmental<00:01:37.170> decay<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.740> yet<00:01:37.860> everyone

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
environmental decay and yet everyone

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.830 
environmental decay and yet everyone
understands<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> collective

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
understands that this is a collective

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.940 
understands that this is a collective
problem<00:01:40.229> that's<00:01:40.350> got<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.680> solved

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
problem that's got to be solved

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.440 
problem that's got to be solved
collectively<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> matter<00:01:42.299> of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
collectively it's not a matter of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.940 
collectively it's not a matter of
pointing<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.810> finger<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.290> blame<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.890> the

everyone but it's a matter of thinking
through<00:01:53.369> collectively<00:01:53.909> how<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.390> fix<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
through collectively how can we fix the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.130 
through collectively how can we fix the
problem<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.530> don't<00:01:55.710> leave<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:57.140> sauna

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
problem so that we don't leave a sauna

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.929 
problem so that we don't leave a sauna
to<00:01:58.530> our<00:01:58.649> children<00:01:59.100> rather<00:01:59.280> than<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> habitable

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
to our children rather than a habitable

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.850 
to our children rather than a habitable
planet<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:01.200> need<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.469> say<00:02:01.619> something

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
planet and we need to say something

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.370 
planet and we need to say something
similar<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.460> race<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.719> that's<00:02:03.960> what<00:02:04.259> I'm

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
similar about race so that's what I'm

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.310 
similar about race so that's what I'm
hoping<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:05.219> could<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.659> how<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
hoping we could do how to do it in the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.000 
hoping we could do how to do it in the
context<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.950> media<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:09.739> obsessed<00:02:10.739> with

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
context of a media that obsessed with

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.170 
context of a media that obsessed with
with<00:02:12.629> spectacle<00:02:13.629> is<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.769> difficult<00:02:15.670> question

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
with spectacle is a difficult question

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.030 
with spectacle is a difficult question
and<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.319> agree<00:02:18.030> but<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> think<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:20.470> know<00:02:20.920> we

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
and I agree but I think you know we

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.130 
and I agree but I think you know we
could<00:02:21.220> make<00:02:21.400> some<00:02:21.670> progress<00:02:22.180> by<00:02:22.629> starting<00:02:23.049> to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
could make some progress by starting to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.780 
could make some progress by starting to
refigure<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.799> discourse<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:24.610> way

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
refigure the discourse in this way

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.940 
refigure the discourse in this way
because<00:02:25.269> for<00:02:25.420> instance<00:02:25.689> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.500> get<00:02:26.680> people

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
because for instance you can get people

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.119 
because for instance you can get people
to<00:02:27.069> talk<00:02:27.220> about<00:02:27.370> global<00:02:27.610> warming<00:02:28.620> that's<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
to talk about global warming that's and

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.160 
to talk about global warming that's and
and<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:31.569> one<00:02:32.470> last<00:02:32.709> thing<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:34.170> state-level

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
and the one last thing that state-level

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.530 
and the one last thing that state-level
things<00:02:35.829> like<00:02:36.010> school<00:02:36.250> finance<00:02:36.730> reform<00:02:37.120> for

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
things like school finance reform for

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.240 
things like school finance reform for
instance<00:02:37.870> are<00:02:38.019> being<00:02:38.319> picked<00:02:38.560> up<00:02:38.709> by<00:02:38.769> people

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
instance are being picked up by people

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.550 
instance are being picked up by people
in<00:02:39.489> state<00:02:39.700> legislatures<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.510> by<00:02:40.629> by

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
in state legislatures and by by

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.069 
in state legislatures and by by
litigation<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.370> state<00:02:42.609> courts<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.450> you

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
litigation in state courts and so you

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.240 
litigation in state courts and so you
know<00:02:44.200> sometimes<00:02:44.440> these<00:02:44.799> issues<00:02:45.129> are

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
know sometimes these issues are

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.500 
know sometimes these issues are
beginning<00:02:45.609> to<00:02:45.700> be<00:02:45.790> addressed<00:02:46.120> even<00:02:46.420> if

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
beginning to be addressed even if

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.699 
beginning to be addressed even if
they're<00:02:46.629> not<00:02:46.780> addressed<00:02:47.079> at<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.260> national

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
they're not addressed at a national

00:02:47.709 --> 00:03:03.430 
they're not addressed at a national
level<00:02:47.739> which<00:02:48.099> gives<00:02:48.760> me<00:02:48.970> some<00:02:49.239> hope

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.500
