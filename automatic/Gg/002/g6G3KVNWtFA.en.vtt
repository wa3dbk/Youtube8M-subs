00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
that it's just a quick once-over so it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.999

play around with folding things because

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.409 
play around with folding things because
at<00:03:54.190> first<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.519> thought<00:03:54.669> these<00:03:54.849> bins<00:03:55.090> weren't

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
at first I thought these bins weren't

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.360 
at first I thought these bins weren't
going<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.629> work<00:03:55.780> for<00:03:56.290> like<00:03:57.010> some<00:03:57.159> of<00:03:57.250> her

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370

going to work for like some of her
clothes<00:03:57.669> but<00:03:57.940> then<00:03:58.120> if<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.359> fold<00:03:58.659> them<00:03:58.780> a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
clothes but then if you fold them a

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.869 
clothes but then if you fold them a
different<00:03:59.019> way<00:03:59.250> the<00:04:00.250> clothes<00:04:00.459> will<00:04:00.639> fit<00:04:00.669> in

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
different way the clothes will fit in

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:01.920 
different way the clothes will fit in
there<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.209> just<00:04:01.329> play<00:04:01.510> around<00:04:01.540> with<00:04:01.870> different

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
there so just play around with different

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.830 
there so just play around with different
ways<00:04:02.199> to<00:04:02.409> fold<00:04:02.590> clothes<00:04:03.329> that's<00:04:04.329> another<00:04:04.599> tip

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.490 
I don't I think this was from Ikea and I
had<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.329> from<00:04:10.479> when<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.659> got<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.900> dresser<00:04:11.349> from

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.899 
hopefully you guys can see in here it
just<00:04:23.529> looks<00:04:23.650> like<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.099> it's<00:04:24.669> not<00:04:24.760> the

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 
just looks like this it's not the

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:25.860 
just looks like this it's not the
prettiest<00:04:25.270> down<00:04:25.419> here

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
prettiest down here

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.530 
prettiest down here
but<00:04:26.590> it's<00:04:27.040> functional<00:04:27.760> for<00:04:27.940> right<00:04:28.060> now<00:04:28.090> so

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
but it's functional for right now so

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.790 
but it's functional for right now so
when<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.690> left-hand<00:04:29.080> side<00:04:29.229> errs<00:04:29.410> have<00:04:29.620> some

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
when the left-hand side errs have some

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.730 
when the left-hand side errs have some
shoe<00:04:30.070> boxes<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.729> in<00:04:30.790> there<00:04:30.940> she<00:04:31.150> has<00:04:31.620> just<00:04:32.620> one
