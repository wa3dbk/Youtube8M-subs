00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.000
 Speak up , people, beauty here. 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.810
 the ex-bbb was bringing another video to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.240
 you 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.410
 This time I'll bring one more. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.930
 it's worth playing this time from the forum 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.630
 2 Why is not no I did not sign no 3 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.850
 still does not have a formed opinion 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.250
 and no basis to start talking about 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.860
 if it's 3 we do not know 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.840
 can evaluate a game for the simple fact that the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.270
 people have played earlier if it were so 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.760
 all presidents alive in note 10 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.610
 and that is not the case let's talk about kissing 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.390
 it was 1 and 2 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.050
 it will be a third person shooter 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:01.079
 focus is on action 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.100
 focused on the action and dynamics of the game is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.170
 focused on cover systems 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:15.240
 popularized really genius is shooting in 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:17.520
 third person who simply this 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.920
 type of game are the shooting games in 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 third person as well as devil may cry 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:29.400
 I did with the following games, take us to a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.890
 dynamics and greater realism 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.640
 although I will follow a 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.369
 trajectory is a story and has no 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.979
 nothing to do with reality 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.229
 The shooting mode of the game is based on 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.149
 release the list because it is a system of 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.659
 cuba then for you to take you now 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.670
 is not more exposed deny in Rambo 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.110
 front of your enemy now you have to 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:02.490
 answer find even better position 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:05.340
 place the water over the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.799
 protection in order to kill enemies is 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 an action game that has elements 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.150
 are the cover systems 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.700
 quoted in quotation marks that your 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.400
 really 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.560
 action and action from beginning to end you 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.269
 You will get too excited about this story. 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.230
 with the history of the strong visual has a 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:27.069
 simply the time when the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.080
 planet earth is no longer inhabited 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.709
 they moved to another planet 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.380
 called these was due to lack of resources 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.230
 on land and during a war the beginning 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.239
 was released burst exploded planets 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.080
 was and they discovered that the planet did not 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:50.500
 was uninhabited but there were others 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.420
 residents on the planet that crazy in 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.360
 interior of the planet and so begins a 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.060
 new hot war the gays are the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.650
 humans and the bis as I say are the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.829
 soldiers and those who want to regain power 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.959
 of the serious planet and how the population 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:13.209
 has more to go from human focus on 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.639
 save the planet and also the people 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.010
 kidnapped by this game is one of the 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.109
 The best I 've ever played in life is 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.799
 simply very good gameplay 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.239
 game 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.239
 charts 1 and 2 for the current I think 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:36.910
 which leaves a little to be desired but in 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:38.889
 technical aspects to when the date 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.079
 when graphics were released they were 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.370
 excellent but today you can say 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.290
 that we are a little drawn however 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.389
 for the three and the beginning that I played 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.709
 I could see that the graph is increasing 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:55.989
 gave an improved monster 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.359
 the gameplay is great said the graphics 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.910
 are good 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.609
 the story is also very good innovation 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.950
 game had as it said in this system of 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:09.819
 that has been added to the game and 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.410
 brought a new era to the cinema a new 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.230
 segment to shooting games in third 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.380
 person is a play that I recommend for 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.060
 and you here on the channel earned a 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:27.210
 note 9 11 12 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:30.580
 just remembering that two already had problems 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.280
 of some of the people to relate 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.150
 with some elements belonging to 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.360
 other games and there are movies in case it is 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.949
 feel this in the hummingbird 2 playing well 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.319
 it was only 2 you will realize that it has 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.319
 many elements of the film Lord of the 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:49.330
 rings especially when you go up to 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.039
 actor that I will not talk to the author who is 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.900
 not to spoil the surprise but you 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.900
 have to in the enemy matone 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.699
 you remember a lot from when the 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:07.569
 frodo is coming to the fashion mountain right? 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.849
 love to be able to destroy the ring is another 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.220
 which may be related to functions 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:16.150
 of rings is the first game of the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.509
 Hummingbird 2 also in which the voice that 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.590
 background is very similar if you do not 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:26.469
 almost equal to that of the beginning of the film the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.990
 lord of the rings but removing that 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:32.050
 game is simply epic is worth a lot 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.000
 Worth to play now stay with tile 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.710
 I hope you have enjoyed it and do not 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.659
 Forget to write on the channel 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.659
 Thanks, he said until then. 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.500
 who sleeps in machico 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.960
 Look like that, I do not think I got caught. 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:05.270
 the junk out there, the biggest love death to look for 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.520
 bring down my voice from the night 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.520
 Afternoon are medals.
