vintage collection for now and don't
worry<00:00:51.789> about<00:00:51.819> that<00:00:52.179> Hasbro<00:00:52.719> is<00:00:52.899> not

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
worry about that Hasbro is not

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.419 
worry about that Hasbro is not
cancelling<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.890> vintage<00:00:54.190> collection

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
cancelling the vintage collection

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.069 
cancelling the vintage collection
they're<00:00:54.940> just<00:00:55.149> putting<00:00:55.359> it<00:00:55.479> on<00:00:55.539> hold<00:00:55.839> for<00:00:55.929> a

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
they're just putting it on hold for a

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.110 
they're just putting it on hold for a
couple<00:00:56.229> years<00:00:56.589> I<00:00:56.800> believe<00:00:57.519> that<00:00:57.760> they<00:00:57.879> said

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
couple years I believe that they said

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.840 
couple years I believe that they said
that<00:00:58.269> they<00:00:58.390> want<00:00:58.659> to<00:00:59.190> return<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.249> the<00:01:00.519> vintage

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
that they want to return to the vintage

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.360 
that they want to return to the vintage
collection<00:01:01.120> in<00:01:01.510> two<00:01:02.499> to<00:01:02.649> three<00:01:02.829> years<00:01:03.039> if<00:01:03.219> I'm

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
collection in two to three years if I'm

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.280 
collection in two to three years if I'm
correct<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.210> don't<00:01:04.449> worry<00:01:04.570> about<00:01:04.690> that<00:01:04.870> the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
correct so don't worry about that the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.749 
correct so don't worry about that the
veget<00:01:05.590> collection<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.040> not<00:01:06.190> ending<00:01:06.549> is<00:01:06.700> just

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
veget collection is not ending is just

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.690 
veget collection is not ending is just
being<00:01:07.180> put<00:01:07.360> on<00:01:07.479> hold<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.770> this<00:01:09.040> last<00:01:09.250> wave<00:01:09.520> of

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
being put on hold so this last wave of

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.370 
being put on hold so this last wave of
