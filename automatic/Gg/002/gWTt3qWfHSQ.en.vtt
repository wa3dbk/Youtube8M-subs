00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.599
 Good morning about polishing the founder is a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 half-point version with and also author 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.779
 of the electronic book bes it slim of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.449
 turn 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.850
 I want to talk about bone health or 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.210
 speak also in the great lode of today 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.340
 here is our well-known and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.070
 revered wheat usually 20% were 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.879
 calories that there is an average person eats 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 comes from wheat or bread-based pasta 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.770
 except flour everything that comes from wheat 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 It's too much and in the wheat trio today. 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670
 practically everywhere 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.460
 Until then we can not imagine that it is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 now focus on only one part 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.710
 the benefits of wheat in relation to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.100
 bone health that is our next 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.820
 body of acid balance a clip of ph 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.230
 right 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.969
 our body to function 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.159
 perfectly that all the enzymes 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.310
 body work perfectly is necessary 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.350
 have a balanced pH and there was a 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.220
 small variation of a small variation 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.530
 spa hn skipped alkaline populated steel and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.520
 if pointer here it will occur that you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.950
 go 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.189
 That's right you 're going to go to the light. 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.659
 You 're going to die because your yours. 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.640
 enzymes and other mechanisms of the body 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.640
 stop working because I need the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.990
 stable acidity environment 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.119
 That's why I draw pointer here. 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.729
 can see that it is stable 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.799
 is a stable point he is now the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.390
 next many foods we eat 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.759
 they can be alkaline 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.950
 ie as opposed to accidents or 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.470
 relying on the people eat when we 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.689
 eat acid foods my body do 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 to balance this here by putting some 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.060
 alkaline thing parts the pointer continues 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.130
 stable in the middle and it 's good to have can not go 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.729
 plus your pointer will vary 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.829
 Are you going to sir, depending on what? 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.200
 you believe so you have to keep 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.030
 this balance the body needs to maintain 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.390
 this stable balance that the level of 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.950
 ph of acidity the ph of the body just for you 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.440
 to know 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.020
 7.4 then this point of pointing 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.740
 27.4 always 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.690
 is always stable in that position 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.120
 any food you eat that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.120
 tends to play up a pointer there on the spot 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.350
 the body needs to act in a way 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.970
 counteract's right to leave 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.590
 stable pointer 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.480
 now what wheat has to do with 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.930
 history sure matters if you ask the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.360
 wheat is an extremely acidic food 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.240
 that all grains and everything else is the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.050
 more acidic food and 20% calories 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.320
 that an average person as per day comes from 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.790
 wheat that almost nobody knows what the 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.370
 references all that I'm talking about here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.930
 have an article you see below what 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.680
 House curiosity 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.720
 so when eating the wheat they cover wheat pasta 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.600
 integral or refined in by 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.060
 wheat the wheat will always do wheat 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.620
 with which this pointer tends to bind 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.110
 A little bit so if the pointer 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.360
 will try to change your body here 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.690
 need to make an effort to try 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.490
 arrange back and leave the pointer 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.860
 I was back so that you did not 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.820
 a hill of the body continues 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.160
 working 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.320
 now any way with which the body 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.060
 does to try to counterbalance this 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.190
 pointer when will jump from the star 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.590
 when you eat wheat and do it 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.630
 releasing an alkaline substance from 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.790
 bones who are what is the total chaos of 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.450
 Simple way to tell you that it's over 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.600
 releasing calcium from the bones to try 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.050
 play these pointer back to the ph 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.940
 stable 6.43 that happens when you 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.010
 eat food that plays the body 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.110
 for acidic organisms and for 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.080
 somehow find a way back and 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.680
 if pointer ready alkaline grandson ie 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.900
 the point was here in our knots 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.820
 speedometer here and in the way you 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.250
 he does this by using the bones he 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.530
 the calcium in the bones and alkaline it goes 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.630
 balancing and if this tendency to 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.030
 be with our young people only to 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.190
 rebuild his 18 years or so and 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.650
 then the rest of the life in which it only uses 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.320
 they are a great stock of 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.220
 Calcium in the body is very much 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.350
 nothing else there 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.540
 only over the years decades have 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.010
 you have a food you have to 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.800
 to be racist mainly because of the 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.639
 wheat is the main factor in this case the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.520
 your 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.289
 will start to end is this stock of 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.870
 cause right then so you're hungry 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.029
 osteopenia and osteoporosis people 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.979
 so science shows that everyone 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:41.439
 Are you going to have yours for one day? 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.969
 regardless of age is younger 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.590
 the older one digit will not have 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.330
 because the car is really going to be 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.370
 freed from bones 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.710
 now it's up to you to step up or not this 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.979
 process you accelerate the process of 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.680
 wear bone eating eg 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.620
 wheat that is a major impact factor 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.629
 on the question of bone health then 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.710
 this message today is the training 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:07.840
 is rossi with feeds acid that goes 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.969
 try to play tip skipped astro 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.550
 body and body needs to balance 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.460
 releasing calcium from the bones to 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.680
 that the pointer returns to the normal 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.610
 I was and you continue happy and 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.409
 healthy 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.930
 so this is avoiding if the wheat you 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.849
 also has great chances of postponing 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.979
 then this problem only if in his old age 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.689
 for you have an active healthy old age 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.120
 and happy that is what everyone who is 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:33.159
 Okay, so I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.169
 see the full article in the language the link 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.639
 below all different and everything else 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.639
 if you have not yet submitted your amendment 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.379
 slim down veja.com walax the mail and that 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.659
 we focus on the same science as 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:46.300
 it really works without balela the question 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.430
 investment health and beauty beauty 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.599
 then the rodrigo stayed here and until 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.599
 the next video has more
