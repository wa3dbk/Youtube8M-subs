this<00:00:04.370> week<00:00:04.609> we<00:00:04.790> continued<00:00:05.330> with<00:00:05.510> more<00:00:05.750> water

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
this week we continued with more water

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.210 
this week we continued with more water
and<00:00:06.170> foam<00:00:06.380> comparison<00:00:07.040> test<00:00:07.370> flights<00:00:09.220> the

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
and foam comparison test flights the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.800 
and foam comparison test flights the
Rockets<00:00:10.520> the<00:00:10.640> same<00:00:10.820> one<00:00:10.970> as<00:00:11.090> we<00:00:11.240> used<00:00:11.450> in<00:00:11.630> day

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:11.810 
Rockets the same one as we used in day

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.520 
Rockets the same one as we used in day
143<00:00:13.180> this<00:00:14.180> time<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.600> pressure<00:00:14.780> regulator<00:00:15.140> was

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
143 this time the pressure regulator was

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.130 
143 this time the pressure regulator was
set<00:00:15.769> at<00:00:15.950> 120<00:00:16.640> psi<00:00:16.789> for<00:00:17.119> all<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:17.630> fluff<00:00:17.869> lights

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
set at 120 psi for all the fluff lights

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.960 
set at 120 psi for all the fluff lights
for<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:18.980> first<00:00:19.190> launch<00:00:19.460> we<00:00:19.670> used<00:00:19.850> the

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
for the first launch we used the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.120 
for the first launch we used the
nine-millimeter<00:00:20.539> nozzle<00:00:20.930> and<00:00:21.110> only<00:00:21.590> water

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.850 

the<00:00:25.130> rocket<00:00:25.490> went<00:00:25.699> up<00:00:25.789> to<00:00:25.930> 361<00:00:26.930> feet<00:00:27.170> which<00:00:27.680> was

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
the rocket went up to 361 feet which was

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:42.969 
the rocket went up to 361 feet which was
close<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:28.369> what<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.699> simulators<00:00:41.800> we<00:00:42.800> then

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
close to what the simulators we then

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.619 
close to what the simulators we then
switched<00:00:43.249> over<00:00:43.429> to<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.819> 22<00:00:44.359> millimeter

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
switched over to the 22 millimeter

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.540 
switched over to the 22 millimeter
nozzle<00:00:45.199> and<00:00:45.409> again<00:00:45.739> flew<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.129> rocket<00:00:46.399> with

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
nozzle and again flew the rocket with

00:00:46.550 --> 00:01:10.190 
nozzle and again flew the rocket with
water<00:00:46.819> only

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.740 

I<00:01:10.490> 4<00:01:11.490> 3<00:01:12.329> 2<00:01:12.960> 1<00:01:13.590> go<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:16.670> rocket<00:01:17.670> went<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:17.969> to<00:01:18.090> 403

feet<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.439> closely<00:01:19.920> matched<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> simulator

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
feet which closely matched the simulator

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:38.660 
feet which closely matched the simulator
predictions<00:01:36.950> we<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.159> repeated<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
predictions we then repeated the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.059 
predictions we then repeated the
experiment<00:01:39.270> by<00:01:39.509> adding<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.289> 30<00:01:40.619> mils<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
experiment by adding about 30 mils of

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.969 
experiment by adding about 30 mils of
foam<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.819> water<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.349> filled<00:01:43.349> it<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.560> rest

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
foam to the water and filled it up rest

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.589 
foam to the water and filled it up rest
to<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.459> fifteen<00:01:44.849> hundred<00:01:45.179> mils<00:01:45.390> of

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
to make up fifteen hundred mils of

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:53.839 
to make up fifteen hundred mils of
liquid<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:52.770> flew<00:01:53.039> it<00:01:53.099> first<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> nine

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
liquid we flew it first with a nine

00:01:53.849 --> 00:02:00.710 
liquid we flew it first with a nine
millimeter<00:01:54.030> nozzle<00:01:59.119> this<00:02:00.119> time<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.569> rocket

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
millimeter nozzle this time the rocket

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:40.410 
millimeter nozzle this time the rocket
reached<00:02:01.159> 494<00:02:02.159> feet

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720 

for<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> last<00:02:41.349> launch<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.010> rocket<00:02:42.310> was<00:02:42.430> again

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
for the last launch the rocket was again

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.030 
for the last launch the rocket was again
reconfigured<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.599> use<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> 23<00:02:44.620> millimeter

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
reconfigured to use a 23 millimeter

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:56.910 
reconfigured to use a 23 millimeter
nozzle<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.610> also<00:02:46.390> was<00:02:46.540> flown<00:02:46.810> with<00:02:47.050> foam<00:02:55.920> this

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
nozzle and also was flown with foam this

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:11.309 
nozzle and also was flown with foam this
time<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.400> rocket<00:02:57.550> went<00:02:57.880> up<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.230> 535<00:02:59.230> feet<00:03:10.319> in

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
time the rocket went up to 535 feet in

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.570 
time the rocket went up to 535 feet in
these<00:03:11.560> tests<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.130> rocket<00:03:12.400> went

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
these tests the rocket went

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.550 
these tests the rocket went
approximately<00:03:13.209> 36%<00:03:13.750> higher<00:03:14.080> with<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
approximately 36% higher with the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.040 
approximately 36% higher with the
nine-millimeter<00:03:15.160> nozzle<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.700> foam<00:03:16.019> for<00:03:17.019> the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
nine-millimeter nozzle and foam for the

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.800 
nine-millimeter nozzle and foam for the
22<00:03:17.590> millimeter<00:03:17.800> nozzle<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.549> went<00:03:18.760> about<00:03:18.940> 32%

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
22 millimeter nozzle it went about 32%

22 millimeter nozzle it went about 32%
higher<00:03:19.840> with<00:03:20.260> foam<00:03:20.560> than<00:03:21.100> with<00:03:21.310> water<00:03:21.580> alone
