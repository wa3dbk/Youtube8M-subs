almost<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.979> same<00:02:09.160> they<00:02:09.369> just<00:02:09.399> painted<00:02:09.940> them<00:02:10.030> a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
almost the same they just painted them a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.630 
almost the same they just painted them a
different<00:02:10.240> color<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.860> these<00:02:12.100> work<00:02:12.370> great

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
different color but these work great

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
different color but these work great
because<00:02:13.090> they<00:02:13.300> do<00:02:13.360> not<00:02:13.709> retract<00:02:14.709> at<00:02:15.040> all<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:16.569> if

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
because they do not retract at all so if

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.559 
because they do not retract at all so if
you<00:02:16.750> find<00:02:16.900> one<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.170> those<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:19.330> you're<00:02:19.450> gonna

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
you find one of those then you're gonna

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.470 
you find one of those then you're gonna
need<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.900> get<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.050> quarter-inch<00:02:20.560> thick<00:02:21.480> steel

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
need to get a quarter-inch thick steel

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.860 
need to get a quarter-inch thick steel
rod<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.230> would<00:02:23.890> go<00:02:23.980> with<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.250> four<00:02:24.520> feet<00:02:24.870> long

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
rod I would go with the four feet long

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.710 
rod I would go with the four feet long
forty-eight<00:02:26.380> inch<00:02:26.560> long<00:02:26.770> variety<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.480> first

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
forty-eight inch long variety the first

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.240 
forty-eight inch long variety the first
one<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:28.959> made<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.350> made<00:02:29.380> with<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.709> three-foot<00:02:30.220> long

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
one I made I made with a three-foot long

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.420 
one I made I made with a three-foot long
variety<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.530> after<00:02:32.530> making<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.250> was

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
variety and after making it it was

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.690 
variety and after making it it was
barely<00:02:33.880> enough<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:35.130> activate<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.310> brake

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
pedal on a standard car so a truck that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.390 
pedal on a standard car so a truck that
might<00:02:40.690> have<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> steering<00:02:41.530> wheel<00:02:41.560> farther<00:02:42.190> away

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
might have a steering wheel farther away

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.040 
might have a steering wheel farther away
from<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.820> pedals<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.360> wouldn't<00:02:43.870> even<00:02:43.900> work

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
from the pedals it wouldn't even work

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.650 
from the pedals it wouldn't even work
without<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.650> block<00:02:45.010> underneath<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.090> I'm

without a block underneath of it so I'm

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.690 
without a block underneath of it so I'm
making<00:02:46.870> another<00:02:47.500> one<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:47.830> I'll<00:02:47.920> have<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.340> I'll

little galvanized one and the way this

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.270 
little galvanized one and the way this
is<00:03:18.190> constructed<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.500> take<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.860> caulking

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
is constructed is you take the caulking

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.960 
is constructed is you take the caulking
gun<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.510> basically<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.890> pull<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.610> pull

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
gun and basically you pull it you pull

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.470 
gun and basically you pull it you pull
the<00:03:25.090> rod<00:03:25.239> out<00:03:25.269> of<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:25.870> then<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.530> take<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
the rod out of it and then you take the

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.039 
the rod out of it and then you take the
section<00:03:28.930> where<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.970> tube<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.420> caulking<00:03:31.810> tube

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
section where the tube the caulking tube

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.940 
section where the tube the caulking tube
would<00:03:32.230> sit<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:34.470> you're<00:03:35.470> just<00:03:35.590> taking<00:03:35.739> a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
would sit and you're just taking a

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.259 
would sit and you're just taking a
hacksaw<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.400> you're<00:03:36.640> cutting<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.060> off

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
hacksaw and you're cutting this off

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.080 
hacksaw and you're cutting this off
flush<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.739> you're<00:03:39.549> going<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.730> be<00:03:39.820> left<00:03:40.000> with

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
flush so you're going to be left with

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.240 
flush so you're going to be left with
the<00:03:40.269> handle<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.170> rear<00:03:41.410> part<00:03:41.799> everything

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
the handle and this rear part everything

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.020 
the handle and this rear part everything
here<00:03:42.730> forward<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.299> going<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.690> be<00:03:43.780> removed<00:03:45.030> and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
here forward is going to be removed and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.650 
here forward is going to be removed and
then<00:03:46.900> after<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.680> remove<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.549> take<00:03:49.000> your

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
then after you remove that you take your

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.160 
then after you remove that you take your
rod<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:51.820> place<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.239> this

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.509 

the<00:03:56.170> rod<00:03:56.349> that's<00:03:56.620> already<00:03:56.829> in<00:03:57.010> there<00:03:57.219> to<00:03:57.370> push

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
the rod that's already in there to push

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.360 
the rod that's already in there to push
the<00:03:57.700> caulking<00:03:58.060> out<00:03:58.469> in<00:03:59.469> place<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.069> rod

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
the caulking out in place of that rod

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.270 
the caulking out in place of that rod
you're<00:04:00.760> going<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.180> insert<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.500> quarter<00:04:03.129> inch

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
you're going to insert the quarter inch

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.530 
you're going to insert the quarter inch
rod<00:04:03.519> because<00:04:03.969> both<00:04:04.269> rods<00:04:04.599> are<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> quarter<00:04:05.319> inch

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
rod because both rods are a quarter inch

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.569 
rod because both rods are a quarter inch
so<00:04:07.540> you'll<00:04:07.689> get<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.019> in<00:04:08.079> there<00:04:08.439> and<00:04:09.370> if<00:04:09.459> you

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
so you'll get that in there and if you

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.520 
so you'll get that in there and if you
have<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.730> vise<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.420> makes<00:04:10.689> it<00:04:10.900> easier<00:04:11.260> because

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
have a vise it makes it easier because

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.470 
have a vise it makes it easier because
you<00:04:11.709> can<00:04:11.829> hold<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.189> rod<00:04:12.639> in<00:04:12.879> place<00:04:12.909> while<00:04:13.420> you

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
you can hold the rod in place while you

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.390 
you can hold the rod in place while you
do<00:04:13.719> this<00:04:13.930> if<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:14.200> don't<00:04:14.349> have<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.650> vices

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
do this if you don't have a vices

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.550 
do this if you don't have a vices
not<00:04:16.209> really<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.539> big<00:04:16.750> deal<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:17.079> can<00:04:17.169> set<00:04:17.350> it<00:04:17.440> on

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
not really a big deal you can set it on

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.289 
not really a big deal you can set it on
a<00:04:17.620> table<00:04:17.949> and<00:04:18.039> set<00:04:18.220> something<00:04:18.459> heavy<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.000> top

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
a table and set something heavy on top

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.550 
a table and set something heavy on top
of<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:19.630> it<00:04:19.810> won't<00:04:19.870> move

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
of it so it won't move

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.020 
of it so it won't move
but<00:04:21.280> you've<00:04:22.150> only<00:04:22.240> got<00:04:22.479> two<00:04:22.630> hands<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.880> is

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
but you've only got two hands so this is

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.089 
but you've only got two hands so this is
a<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.780> know<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.080> takes<00:04:26.289> a<00:04:26.380> little<00:04:26.500> patience<00:04:26.949> to

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
a you know it takes a little patience to

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.200 
a you know it takes a little patience to
get<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.340> done<00:04:27.610> but<00:04:27.910> once<00:04:28.840> you<00:04:29.849> get<00:04:30.849> the<00:04:31.030> rod

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
get this done but once you get the rod

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.390 
get this done but once you get the rod
inserted<00:04:31.960> back<00:04:32.289> in<00:04:32.470> through<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.800> springs

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
of the rod and you're going to thread it

of the rod and you're going to thread it
and<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.919> need<00:04:42.099> a<00:04:42.479> die<00:04:43.479> in<00:04:44.110> order<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.530> do<00:04:44.710> that

I believe later on the video I'll tell

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.850 
I believe later on the video I'll tell
you<00:04:52.449> exactly<00:04:52.690> but<00:04:53.169> I<00:04:53.199> believe<00:04:53.500> that's<00:04:53.650> what<00:04:53.830> it

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
you exactly but I believe that's what it

you exactly but I believe that's what it
is

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
is

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.070 
is
and<00:04:54.910> you're<00:04:55.060> just<00:04:55.210> going<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.419> thread<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.870> rod

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
and you're just going to thread the rod

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.589 
and you're just going to thread the rod
back<00:04:56.430> roughly<00:04:57.430> about<00:04:57.759> an<00:04:57.880> inch<00:04:58.090> inch<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.479> a

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
back roughly about an inch inch and a

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.159 
back roughly about an inch inch and a
half<00:04:59.909> after<00:05:00.909> you<00:05:01.240> thread<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.690> rod<00:05:01.870> back

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
half after you thread the rod back

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.250 
half after you thread the rod back
you'll<00:05:03.010> just<00:05:03.449> put<00:05:04.449> on<00:05:04.570> a<00:05:04.690> quarter<00:05:05.020> inch<00:05:05.169> nut

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
you'll just put on a quarter inch nut

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.529 
you'll just put on a quarter inch nut
all<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.099> way<00:05:06.190> back<00:05:06.370> until<00:05:06.639> it<00:05:06.760> stops<00:05:07.090> where<00:05:07.449> it

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
all the way back until it stops where it

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.240 
all the way back until it stops where it
hits<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.930> UH<00:05:07.960> threaded<00:05:08.500> part<00:05:08.650> it<00:05:08.830> will<00:05:08.949> stop

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
hits the UH threaded part it will stop

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.310 
hits the UH threaded part it will stop
and<00:05:09.639> then<00:05:10.300> you're<00:05:10.449> going<00:05:10.539> to<00:05:10.630> take<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.080> little

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
and then you're going to take the little

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.100 
and then you're going to take the little
end<00:05:11.680> that<00:05:12.370> it's<00:05:12.550> one<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.909> caulking<00:05:13.419> gun<00:05:13.659> rod

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
end that it's one the caulking gun rod

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.170 
end that it's one the caulking gun rod
itself<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:14.949> pushes<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.460> caulk<00:05:15.729> out<00:05:15.940> this

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
itself that pushes the caulk out this

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.420 
itself that pushes the caulk out this
little<00:05:16.449> round<00:05:16.570> end<00:05:17.139> right<00:05:17.470> here<00:05:17.680> there's<00:05:18.340> a

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
little round end right here there's a

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.629 
little round end right here there's a
nut<00:05:18.669> holding<00:05:19.030> this<00:05:19.210> on<00:05:19.830> you'll<00:05:20.830> take<00:05:21.070> that<00:05:21.310> end

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
nut holding this on you'll take that end

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.930 
nut holding this on you'll take that end
and<00:05:21.970> you'll<00:05:22.870> place<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.320> over<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:24.070> new

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
and you'll place it over the new

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.580 
and you'll place it over the new
threaded<00:05:25.389> rod<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.960> then<00:05:26.169> you'll<00:05:26.349> take<00:05:26.530> a

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
threaded rod and then you'll take a

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.580 
threaded rod and then you'll take a
small<00:05:27.130> washer<00:05:27.699> put<00:05:28.659> over<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.349> then<00:05:29.440> I

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
small washer put over that and then I

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.800 
small washer put over that and then I
finally<00:05:30.250> another<00:05:30.759> quarter<00:05:31.120> inch<00:05:31.240> nut<00:05:31.479> put

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
finally another quarter inch nut put

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.180 
finally another quarter inch nut put
over<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.050> and<00:05:32.320> that<00:05:32.440> will<00:05:32.620> make<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.949> end

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
over that and that will make the end

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.790 
over that and that will make the end
that<00:05:33.610> presses<00:05:34.090> against<00:05:34.479> your<00:05:34.630> pedal<00:05:34.960> the

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
that presses against your pedal the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.450 
that presses against your pedal the
other<00:05:35.979> side<00:05:36.370> of<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.699> ride<00:05:36.880> because<00:05:38.250> it<00:05:39.250> will

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
other side of the ride because it will

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.029 
other side of the ride because it will
slide<00:05:40.000> completely<00:05:40.630> off<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:40.810> there<00:05:41.139> you<00:05:41.889> need

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
slide completely off of there you need

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.670 
slide completely off of there you need
to<00:05:42.130> put<00:05:42.280> a<00:05:42.310> bend<00:05:42.669> in<00:05:42.880> it<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.240> I<00:05:44.110> guess<00:05:44.440> you<00:05:44.590> can

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
to put a bend in it and I guess you can

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.820 
to put a bend in it and I guess you can
see<00:05:44.860> this<00:05:44.979> it's<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.610> I<00:05:46.150> don't<00:05:47.110> know<00:05:47.289> roughly<00:05:47.740> a

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
see this it's a I don't know roughly a

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.460 
see this it's a I don't know roughly a
45<00:05:48.130> degree<00:05:48.639> angle<00:05:48.849> Bend<00:05:49.389> that<00:05:50.020> you're<00:05:50.229> putting

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
45 degree angle Bend that you're putting

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.189 
45 degree angle Bend that you're putting
in<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.949> what<00:05:51.340> that<00:05:51.520> will<00:05:51.820> do<00:05:52.090> is<00:05:52.419> prevent<00:05:52.960> this

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
in and what that will do is prevent this

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.670 
in and what that will do is prevent this
from<00:05:54.159> sliding<00:05:54.729> off<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.900> it'll<00:05:56.139> hold<00:05:56.259> your<00:05:56.500> tool

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
from sliding off so it'll hold your tool

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.950 
from sliding off so it'll hold your tool
in<00:05:56.860> place

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
in place

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.260 
in place
and<00:06:00.139> then<00:06:01.139> you'll<00:06:01.289> have<00:06:01.440> it<00:06:01.590> other<00:06:01.860> than

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
and then you'll have it other than

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.210 
and then you'll have it other than
putting<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.479> u-bolt<00:06:03.930> in<00:06:04.169> this<00:06:04.320> in<00:06:04.560> this<00:06:04.949> side

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
putting the u-bolt in this in this side

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.610 
putting the u-bolt in this in this side
here<00:06:05.639> or<00:06:05.820> either<00:06:06.210> side<00:06:06.479> of<00:06:06.539> the<00:06:06.630> top<00:06:06.840> side<00:06:07.380> or

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
here or either side of the top side or

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.990 
here or either side of the top side or
bottom<00:06:07.740> there<00:06:08.039> are<00:06:08.070> already<00:06:08.250> holes<00:06:08.639> there<00:06:08.970> I

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
bottom there are already holes there I

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.240 
bottom there are already holes there I
had<00:06:09.270> to<00:06:09.389> drill<00:06:09.660> them<00:06:09.840> out<00:06:09.960> just<00:06:10.110> one<00:06:11.039> hole

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
had to drill them out just one hole

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.760 
had to drill them out just one hole
slightly<00:06:11.850> bigger<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.479> the<00:06:12.630> u-bolt<00:06:13.380> would<00:06:13.560> fit

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
slightly bigger so the u-bolt would fit

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.080 
slightly bigger so the u-bolt would fit
through<00:06:14.009> it<00:06:14.130> if<00:06:14.250> you<00:06:14.370> went<00:06:14.550> with<00:06:14.580> a<00:06:14.699> smaller

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
through it if you went with a smaller

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.600 
through it if you went with a smaller
you<00:06:15.360> both<00:06:15.600> you<00:06:16.470> may<00:06:16.800> not<00:06:16.979> even<00:06:17.070> have<00:06:17.190> to<00:06:17.400> drill

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
you both you may not even have to drill

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.249 
you both you may not even have to drill
it<00:06:17.759> the<00:06:18.120> hole<00:06:19.080> up<00:06:19.259> anything<00:06:19.889> larger<00:06:21.050> but<00:06:22.050> I<00:06:22.080> got

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
it the hole up anything larger but I got

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:23.719 
it the hole up anything larger but I got
that<00:06:22.440> one<00:06:22.620> there<00:06:22.770> I<00:06:22.800> didn't<00:06:23.039> want<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.400> threads

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
that one there I didn't want the threads

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.279 
that one there I didn't want the threads
on<00:06:23.910> the<00:06:24.000> u-bolt<00:06:24.330> to<00:06:24.509> scratch<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.960> steering

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
on the u-bolt to scratch the steering

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.700 
on the u-bolt to scratch the steering
wheel<00:06:25.470> so<00:06:25.860> that<00:06:26.280> is<00:06:26.490> where<00:06:26.699> I<00:06:26.729> slipped<00:06:27.300> this

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
wheel so that is where I slipped this

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.770 
wheel so that is where I slipped this
section<00:06:28.710> of<00:06:28.800> fuel<00:06:28.979> hose<00:06:29.190> over<00:06:29.970> it<00:06:30.090> and<00:06:30.300> it's

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
section of fuel hose over it and it's

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.029 
section of fuel hose over it and it's
the<00:06:30.870> one<00:06:30.990> there<00:06:31.110> nice<00:06:31.259> and<00:06:31.289> tight<00:06:31.530> and<00:06:31.860> so<00:06:32.009> I

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
the one there nice and tight and so I

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.409 
the one there nice and tight and so I
don't<00:06:32.280> have<00:06:32.370> to<00:06:32.430> worry<00:06:32.550> about<00:06:32.669> coming<00:06:32.940> off<00:06:33.210> and

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
don't have to worry about coming off and

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.629 
don't have to worry about coming off and
it<00:06:33.509> won't<00:06:33.660> scratch<00:06:34.139> up<00:06:34.410> prevent<00:06:35.160> the<00:06:35.280> steering

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
it won't scratch up prevent the steering

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.310 
it won't scratch up prevent the steering
wheel<00:06:35.849> or<00:06:36.030> cut<00:06:36.240> into<00:06:36.509> it<00:06:36.599> at<00:06:36.690> all<00:06:38.479> so<00:06:39.479> just<00:06:39.509> hang

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
wheel or cut into it at all so just hang

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:49.790 
wheel or cut into it at all so just hang
tight<00:06:40.560> and<00:06:40.770> you'll<00:06:40.889> see<00:06:41.070> how<00:06:41.160> this<00:06:41.250> is<00:06:41.400> me

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.860
