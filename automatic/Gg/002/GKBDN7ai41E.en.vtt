00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello to everyone here in sing pear 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.410
 He has already left the new version of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.840
 minecraft the 1.5 so I'm going to bring you 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.029
 some tutorials to explain how 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.790
 install the most important mods in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.430
 this case is going to be the minimum race well 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.580
 that we're going to visit a minecraft for 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.289
 the saddlebag and the minimum race is worth 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.019
 description of the video I'll leave the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.760
 links to these two for is so that 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.699
 do the download so let's go 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.620
 start I have here a clean version 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.370
 Minecraft I'll run you see 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 minecraft 1.5 I'm going to move so that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.080
 you see that everything is fine and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.890
 then I will install for 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.570
 that you see that you see minecraft 1.5 is worth 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.760
 I will continue from here that is what 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.579
 we would do the first windows search 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.930
 programs we would put app data percentage 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.810
 we love percentage 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.080
 and here we would have our folder point 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.920
 minecraft val we would enter into it this 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.140
 is the aspect that has the 1.5 there 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.160
 some things that are new but good 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.380
 the important thing 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.320
 to install this mode would be to go to the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.500
 bin folder this minecraft click we would 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.180
 right button and we would have good in 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.660
 this case that I have the winrar but 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.030
 may be worth other programs such as 7 z 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.360
 or the zip is worth so I'm going to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.510
 open I'm going to put it here and now I would open 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.700
 the minecraft forge 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.430
 first we are going to take from the main craft 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.970
 Forge all its elements and we will 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.840
 drag here 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.940
 are already being copied we would accept 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.300
 to replace some file that there is and 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.150
 let's delete this meta folder 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.790
 we say yes 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.340
 very well we can close this and 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.700
 this also right now I'm going to get 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.170
 I'm going to execute the minecraft again 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.800
 so that the folders are created here 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.800
 of the mods 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.380
 beige halloween and up to here Jorge 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.110
 downloading all files 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.110
 needed and creating the new folders 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 It may take a while but it's not good 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.230
 a lot of time 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.330
 here we can see they have appeared 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.330
 some of cosmos 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.010
 ok briefcase would already be 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.709
 Okay we are already as we can see the Ford 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.170
 gm minecraft forge has already been loaded 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.080
 puts three loaded and active modes here 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.480
 ok I'll follow me through the game and 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.909
 now if we have the minimum race we would do 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.549
 a control with the entire folder 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.519
 compressed and the copy we would do in this 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.410
 Mods folder is worth it, it would be like this already 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.890
 from simple we have already installed the race 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.599
 minimum 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.290
 now we could run again 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.189
 Minecraft 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.189
 we would give again 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.860
 now this is going to load much faster 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.860
 because you have already downloaded the files 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.690
 and now yes 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.490
 well as you can see it puts minecraft 1.5 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.220
 and 4 loaded modes that are filled forge and 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:47.150
 the minimum race of single player I'm going to 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.690
 create a world for example xiamen king in 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.970
 creative way and to create you see that 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.520
 it has not been difficult to install the mod is 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.010
 pretty simple but good for the 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.010
 that you did not know well 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.530
 it seems that it has already been charged to be 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.570
 attentive also these days because I'm going to 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:13.620
 upload a video worth before leaving for 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.850
 install the optimum and also for 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.850
 install the nes vale 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.810
 as you can see above on the right 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:22.730
 the map appears 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.180
 and I will explain quickly the 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.830
 most important options is worth the first 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.590
 everything if we give the letter x for 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.419
 defect we get that map but in large 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.840
 we will be able to see all the details 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.480
 better good again x we ​​would remove it if 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.510
 we give you the letter we get this 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.910
 edition of to name different 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.760
 sites for example that we found a 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.990
 mine we would put mine here and we would give 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.760
 although you see that a point appears and 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.460
 marks us the distance 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.920
 that we want to modify the name of 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.510
 that we have put to it we want to erase it or 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.230
 we do not want to appear well and 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:08.490
 we would give the letter m this letter m us 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.500
 pull out the minimum root menu well here 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.200
 you see that he puts the waypoints we could 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.990
 this mine we could have it active that 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.790
 I would be putting lion or deactivating it in 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.970
 off you have already seen that disappeared and 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.040
 again it is activated or deactivated separately 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.530
 we could add a new point by giving it 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.530
 a beam that would be to add or remove a point 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.930
 with oar that would be removed worth more 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.550
 things are minimal reid enable wants 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.200
 say it's active 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.020
 here are different type options for 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.580
 rendering and so on and we also have 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.400
 here another tab that is the 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.980
 configuration of the default keys 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.710
 the letter m as it has been commented takes us out 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.130
 the menu the letter z zooms in on this 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.840
 minimapa la x makes us the big map 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.680
 that we have taught and does it allows us 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.720
 put or name the sites 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.570
 we can do one of the ones that is that I 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.180
 the first thing is to put on this top the 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.120
 enable and we put for example the letter o 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.160
 What is he going to do for us? 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.320
 Once we give the letter or we will 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:16.280
 disable the beige minimap 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:18.139
 at our will so very useful 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.970
 you know that you can put what you want 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:25.240
 ok this just keeps playing a 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.240
 little but good as I tell you the lyrics 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.700
 z you see is zooming in on the 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.729
 minimap these are the ones that by default 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.939
 so nothing comments 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:41.639
 said said all these things that are 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:43.319
 the most important ones I hope there 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.620
 be clear if you have any questions 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.639
 you tell me in the comments 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.110
 I hope you liked it and how you 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.599
 I say pay attention to the following 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.240
 videos that I will also explain how 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:57.240
 install both the optical and the mail 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.559
 it's worth it so we see nothing in the 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.559
 next video see you later
