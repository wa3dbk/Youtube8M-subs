and<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.060> 12c<00:00:21.540> is<00:00:21.780> to<00:00:22.050> tame<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.860> this<00:00:23.100> car<00:00:23.340> is

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
and the 12c is to tame in this car is

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.870 
and the 12c is to tame in this car is
just<00:00:24.060> right<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.870> the<00:00:25.110> 650s<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.190> spider<00:00:26.520> is

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
convertible design-wise well it takes

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.759 
convertible design-wise well it takes
inspiration<00:00:35.399> from<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.149> p1<00:00:36.539> and<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> 12c

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:38.900 
inspiration from the p1 and from the 12c
from<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> front<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> looks<00:00:38.339> exactly<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
from the front it looks exactly like a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.849 
from the front it looks exactly like a
p1<00:00:39.239> pretty<00:00:39.480> much<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.839> distance<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.589> you

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
p1 pretty much in the distance if you

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.340 
p1 pretty much in the distance if you
squint<00:00:41.219> from<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.789> back<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.420> all<00:00:42.600> 12<00:00:42.929> seen<00:00:43.170> in

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
squint from the back it's all 12 seen in

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.750 
squint from the back it's all 12 seen in
the<00:00:43.410> middle<00:00:43.679> it<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.249> of<00:00:44.339> splits<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the middle it kind of splits the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.239 
the middle it kind of splits the
difference<00:00:44.989> under<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> hood<00:00:46.260> well<00:00:46.769> actually

it's<00:00:47.579> behind<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.120> seats<00:00:48.359> because<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.749> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it's behind the seats because it's a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.099 
it's behind the seats because it's a

the button on the steering wheel and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
the button on the steering wheel and
that<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:11.730> actually<00:01:11.880> drop<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:12.690> rear<00:01:12.840> spoiler

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that will actually drop the rear spoiler

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140 
that will actually drop the rear spoiler
to<00:01:13.560> give<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.800> more<00:01:13.980> straight<00:01:14.280> line<00:01:14.430> speed<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to give you more straight line speed and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.220 
to give you more straight line speed and
when<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.330> hit<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.510> brake<00:01:15.690> it<00:01:15.840> will<00:01:15.930> flip<00:01:16.080> up

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
when you hit the brake it will flip up

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.230 
when you hit the brake it will flip up
again<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.860> give<00:01:16.980> you<00:01:17.070> more<00:01:17.190> downforce<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
again to give you more downforce this is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.330 
again to give you more downforce this is
automatic<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.320> minute<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> text<00:01:20.190> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
automatic so the minute of the text that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.610 
automatic so the minute of the text that
you<00:01:20.370> need<00:01:20.730> extra<00:01:21.570> slipperiness<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
you need extra slipperiness in a

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.380 
you need extra slipperiness in a
straight<00:01:22.890> line<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.760> drop<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> spoiler

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
straight line it will drop the spoiler

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.640 
straight line it will drop the spoiler
slightly<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.050> when<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.230> hit<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.440> brake

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
slightly but when you hit the brake

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.920 
slightly but when you hit the brake
they'll<00:01:26.160> come<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.460> even<00:01:27.090> more<00:01:27.180> downforce<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
they'll come up even more downforce and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.290 
they'll come up even more downforce and
help<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.260> get<00:01:28.380> around<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.740> corner<00:01:29.300> the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
help you get around that corner the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.420 
help you get around that corner the
interior<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.050> 650<00:01:31.530> s<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.920> actually<00:01:32.220> really

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
interior of a 650 s is actually really

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.070 
interior of a 650 s is actually really
interesting<00:01:33.090> I've<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.600> inside<00:01:33.750> it

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
interesting I've just got inside it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.290 
interesting I've just got inside it
right<00:01:34.230> now<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:35.430> makes<00:01:35.640> me<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
right now and it makes me think it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.330 
right now and it makes me think it
offers<00:01:36.630> better<00:01:36.930> performance<00:01:37.650> than<00:01:37.860> some
