00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.110
 hello very good 89 we are a little 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 admonished we will continue with the 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.180
 supercopa and for that we are going to start the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 superbowl modality 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.580
 let's see if we enter well that I've 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.580
 left to enter 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.869
 is here the supercopa we have passed 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.039
 what is the anchorage modality and now 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.099
 we are going to launch with the modality 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.039
 superbowl in this modality we are going to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.759
 changing pokemon team really is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.550
 the same team but instead of carrying 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
 to this we take her to draco to vale 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 we change this which is our timing 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.089
 by a degree it is called drag what the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.010
 others are all the same this teaches us 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.600
 in the first video is worth it so is that more or 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.300
 least you will have to have an idea of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.219
 what is the team we started the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.179
 first battle that is against a charge 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.699
 today little bugs and one of fire and 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.679
 one normal type good with so much 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.149
 bichito let's take out chorizos I do not know 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.789
 if it came out in other videos 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.860
 but you always told me 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.869
 Chorizos stops taking out the rest of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.280
 pokemon so it's the first one that 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.310
 it comes out if it is against throwing half 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.720
 well, poor char million, what else am I going to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.990
 also put adra wow 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.760
 and as a last option, it does not matter 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.270
 who we get is that they will not go out 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.710
 let's take environment by taking it da 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.710
 the same is not going to be necessary I think 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.870
 our first pokemon is chorizo 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.940
 today he joined us to make 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.470
 a kind of hermit crab with a 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.930
 parasite on the back that is the one 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.659
 handles the entire flamethrower to 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.689
 stop 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.710
 to see has the name in lowercase or goes 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.930
 to change maybe not get my lion 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.200
 we'll see 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.790
 there is a charme and lyon or tea 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.000
 you're facing your daddy bad 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.240
 good thing our good char 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.940
 is that you have an option an attack for 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.140
 take away enough life to throw my lion 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.960
 although it 's been a fire attack what 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.179
 that the state made them enough not 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.090
 there has been little that has taken him away but 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.140
 we have an earthquake and he does not have wings like that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.490
 is that or levitate or dies this we can 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.110
 it has only been weakened because 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.690
 we have killed two hits well what 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.209
 we have killed we have finished with the two 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.500
 blows to see what bug gets us out now 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.720
 because nothing else that will remain 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.930
 bugs or a chiqui peace never crib over 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.810
 it's green 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.330
 it's a very weird cradle has come out of the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.060
 nose of some big pokemon don 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.730
 Safe wailers is a cradle of the nose 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.800
 of waylon good, I do not know why not 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.780
 take shots and who in their right mind 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.300
 takes out although he accumulates in a fight against 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.819
 a chorizo I'm against a chorizo 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.920
 on this one do not sterilize the chorizo I 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.319
 I would not take a crib in fact I would take 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.150
 a cradle in my team is very good 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.840
 nice here you like bugs voucher 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.650
 It will be very nice 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.510
 but the crib is a little useless it has very 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.760
 few attacks alien to those that the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:15.450
 being of weeden and strength is not very 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.670
 useful to be said 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.670
 and see if to get hold 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.370
 no, not the whole fight has been won by 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.610
 chorizo ​​alone 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.720
 well a perfect double to the matches in 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.220
 those who do not mind in life I'm going to 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.599
 call perfect double from now 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.040
 so we 've got a double 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.810
 perfect 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.269
 the poor dragon who could not get out 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.489
 God has swollen lips it has 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.079
 operated or has been put to silicone iu 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.359
 or something can be put silicone in the 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.050
 mouth and it's good we continue with the 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:51.370
 second fight that already madness 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.880
 I love my combat style against 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.230
 tim broker 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.450
 or have little less than psychic earth 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.520
 get everything we go to climber which 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.270
 first I want you to see it 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.800
 the second is going to be an action more than 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.740
 nothing because he has a psychic and he has 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.330
 poison which ecofin rarer and has 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.730
 numbers in the names of their pokemon and 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.580
 they're all weird color this one 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.170
 drug or something like last option I'll 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.170
 to put me to be spain by various 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.010
 let's see what was your choice because 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.910
 I do not care what I take out 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.060
 look is floating in nothing against 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.920
 hymns 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:42.390
 good to see how we attack her to go see 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.480
 could make them your eyes flare is 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.300
 that I do not see because I think it's going to fail 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.470
 let's hit him with lightning in case 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.660
 paralyze ok let's try draco ausol 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.120
 ray as you see is a pokémon with 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.770
 quite a variety of movements has 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.789
 for everyone here all very little 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.789
 hit head 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:10.180
 but I have stayed very little also what 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.370
 great is ours from which no longer alone 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.990
 by size but for what it holds good 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.449
 Well, let's try ice beam to see 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.460
 If I want to surf, I changed the names 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.000
 to the attacks I do not know which the son that was 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.150
 take away the son 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.150
 and not one and the critical group 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.510
 no confusion 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.800
 it's like I confuse you amen but no no 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.530
 no no no this does not do almost anything 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.560
 Water is a pokémon that holds a lot 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.300
 there you are seeing it so you can see that 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.040
 a person that apparently can be 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.620
 good a person a being for example a 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.570
 magical that may seem useless or a 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.310
 person in this case imagine that 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.160
 someone who has always appeared 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.050
 useless or little thing that people do not 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.780
 have valued how you have to value it 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.720
 then over time it can change and 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.980
 become the opposite or all 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.729
 what others had not seen that 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.499
 I really had 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.529
 you have to know how to value people and now 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:12.889
 the beings are worth the little hills and 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:16.819
 kittens are also beings let's go let's 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:18.409
 change let's take out some is not that I 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.210
 love this pokemon I love in 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.249
 youtube I do not like is the minute 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.289
 of pokemon green leaf that is from the barça 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:25.460
 we get very bad and it's a bit over 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.349
 with shy so when I say 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.509
 Youtube confusions era as it says there 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.400
 one that I do not know that I'm very requested 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.280
 so no, I do not get along with it 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:38.030
 on youtube destructor 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.570
 muscat nukak six good and all have 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.570
 numbers 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.550
 me to my pokemon so I used to 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:50.800
 the cements put him type m1 m2 m3 something 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.800
 so it's good to differentiate them 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.230
 so that it is not method is the same or a 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.050
 just hit 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:01.440
 obvious is half pink inside it has 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:04.200
 eaten something god has remains of nests 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.639
 that we have seen that we have caught you 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.860
 we have caught a lot 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.860
 Paul and everyone an act 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.890
 if you do not see it 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.690
 this would be good with the water system 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.550
 and how will I load it and it's back 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.820
 behind 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.280
 solar rays is lightning that is to say I am going to 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.450
 draw water to make the lightning do not 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.710
 agreement or what attacks have my 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:32.830
 pokemon because the videos do not show 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.140
 very very followed and I do not remember everything 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:39.690
 and that's why I often say digits that 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.690
 I had this because I do not remember 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.940
 and well it has not been a perfect double but 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.770
 yes that is a perfect because we 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.570
 we take the continue look look at what 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.430
 face of wish is happy is smiling 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.560
 that's the closest thing you'll see to 

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.050
 a smile on youtube 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.940
 perfect the time that can not with me 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.400
