00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.666
- Okay, so you are--
- I'm Angie.

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.666
- Angie.
- And Michelle.

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.400
- And Michelle.
Okay, and, uh,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.333
this picture was taken when
and for what reason?

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.300
- 1983.
It's a dance photo.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.700
I was four, she was six.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.966
- And it is the
worst photo ever.

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.800
- It's--you--four and six?
- Yes.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
- And you were in dance class
together?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.366
- Right.
- Wow.

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.800
- Are you related?
- We're sisters.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.133
- Oh, you're sisters. Okay.
- Yeah.

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.600
And so, do you still
dance to this day?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.133
- Did you continue?
- No.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.666
- No.
- No?

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.700
Was it because
of this picture?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.933
- It possibly could have been,
yes.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.266
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- All right, let's see.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.533
And then we'll discuss
what happened.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.600
All right.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
[laughter]

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:44.433
[cheers and applause]

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.533
Oh, no.

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.833
That's--shame.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:54.333
So, these are wigs
you're wearing?

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.800
- No, no.
- No.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.500
- No? Your hair?
- It's real hair.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.200
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.500
- So a fan of "Annie," maybe?
- Absolutely. I was, yes.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.733
- So you were influenced
by "Annie"

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.866
and you decided
to get perms?

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.900
- Yes, well, part of it was
that we always cried

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.233
when our mom
brushed our hair,

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.333
so she decided to cut it off
and perm it,

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.500
so she wouldn't have to
brush it anymore.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.033
- Ah, I see.
- Apparently a pick was easier.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.700
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I see.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.400
And the outfits, is that
something that everyone

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.966
in the class wore, or was that
special for you two?

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.233
- No, it was everyone
in the class.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:23.966
- Everyone in the class
had outfits like that.

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.033
- Yes.
- They didn't have the perm.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.466
- They did not have the perm.
- No.

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.500
- 'Cause yeah,
without the perm

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.466
- it's just so subtle.
- Yeah.

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.000
- Okay, so tell us
about this.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
- Okay, so when I was little
my mom put me in dance

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.300
with my twin sister.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.033
She said it would help
me be limber with baseball.

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:44.966
And then, this photo, like,
she didn't tell me

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.700
what the costume was
because she knew

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.800
that I wouldn't wear it.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.833
So she shoved me in a room.

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.066
She put the costume on me,

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.500
and then she took
the picture.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.700
- All right, Michael,
let's take a look and see.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.766
And how old?

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.766
[laughter and applause]

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.466
What is that?
Like, a fox?

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:07.933
- I'm a wolf.
- A wolf? Okay.

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.633
- Yeah.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.466
The scene was
the enchanted forest.

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:12.666
- I see.
- I guess they needed a wolf.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.300
- The one male character.
- I see. Wow.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.500
- Yeah.
- Well, and you committed to it.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.233
You weren't unha--I thought
I was going to see you

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:19.566
- crying or something like that.
- I always smile in front

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:21.066
- of a picture.
- Well, good for you.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.666
- So I had to fight through it.
- Yeah. Good for you.

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:24.100
- Thank you.
- All right, how long did you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.800
- dance after that?
- Another year.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800
- Okay.
- I couldn't take much.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.600
- Did it make you limber
in baseball?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.566
- I did the splits once
when I was at first base.

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:32.733
- Good.
- I was catching a ball.

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:33.966
- See, so she was right.

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.900
What's happening here?
What age were you?

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.833
- I was seven years old,
eight years old, Ellen.

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.666
I'm biracial.
My sweet, white mother,

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.666
this was her idea of making
my hair look great

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:44.966
for picture day.

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:47.366
- Okay.
So you were seven, you said?

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:48.633
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Seven.

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:50.733
So your mother,
by the time you're seven,

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:52.433
should have figured out
how to do your hair.

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:54.200
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Your white mother.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.300
Okay.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.366
All right.

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:00.966
[laughter]

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.900
Wow.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.066
[applause]

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:09.100
- Erin.
- It was the after pic.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.066
- Yeah.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.533
Their mother would have
loved you.

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:14.833
You could have--

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:17.766
you could have lived
with them for a while.

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:19.666
All right, well,
everything else is good.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.100
That's a cute little dress,
and, um,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.733
it's, I mean, that's heavy
to hold your head up like that

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:25.833
at that age.

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.600
You could have been
tilting down.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.133
And you didn't like
the afro?

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:32.000
- It, well, I was used to it.
- Yeah.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.066
- This is how I went
to school a lot.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:35.900
- Yeah.
- A lot.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.966
- How much more
did it grow before it--

00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:41.866
- Similar to this?
Like a couple of years, Ellen.

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:43.033
- A couple of years?
- Until it got so big,

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:44.700
and then it kinda
just sagged on it's own.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.433
- Sagged?
- Oh, obviously. Obviously.

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:49.500
- That's the picture
I want to see.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.866
All right.
So you figured out how to do--

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:53.833
- that--is that your real hair?
- No, Ellen, no.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.800
- That's a lot of--yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.633
- That's--that's long.
It would be like that.

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:03.000
It would be, like, you gotta
walk through doors like...

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.433
So, Erin, somebody's
in the audience

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:06.066
who actually went to school
with you.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:07.566
Where's Chris?
Where are you?

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:09.533
- Oh, hey, Chris.
- Hey, Ellen. Erin.

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:11.200
- Did you know--
you remember Chris?

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.166
- I do, I do.
- Come on down here, Chris.

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:15.066
- Okay, so, Chris, hi.
- Hi.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.333
- How are you? Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:19.566
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Wow.

00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:21.433
- Wow.

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:23.166
- Do you remember this?
- I do, actually.

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.000
I sat behind Erin
in grade school.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.433
- Oh.
[laughter]

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.733
- I had a hard time
seeing the chalk board at times.

00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:30.233
- Yeah. Wow.

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:31.366
She looks a little different,
right?

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:32.800
- She does. She looks great.
- Yeah.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.333
- And--and--yeah.
- As does he. He looks great.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:38.033
He does. He does.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:41.033
[cheers and applause]

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.266
Wow.

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:48.066
- All right. Well, while you two
get to know each other again,

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:50.333
first of all,
thanks for sharing these,

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:51.533
and you're all
gonna go home

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:55.666
with a 55" TCL Roku TV
for sharing that.

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:57.866
[cheers and applause]
