one night to kill a zombie so you would

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
be getting 140 points which is an option

points<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.600> biggest<00:01:33.840> disadvantage<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.860> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
points the biggest disadvantage to this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.160 
points the biggest disadvantage to this
strategy<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.630> too<00:01:36.840> greedy
