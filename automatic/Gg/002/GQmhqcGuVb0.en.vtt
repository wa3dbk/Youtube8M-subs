00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.460
 good asked on the internet there are 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.110
 something to own and have 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.490
 some question to them sent a 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.410
 I'll try to answer some questions. 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 now let's get started 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.490
 clÃ¡udia marins wants to know about football and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.910
 music the emotion is the same 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.130
 Claudia asks very hard, I already cried. 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.330
 with both with both things I've cried 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.010
 the football game 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 Brazil and Chile was my last time in 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.179
 world cup and I've already cried with music 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.720
 show includes another day here at the voice 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.669
 Brazil 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.090
 I was equally moved by both 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.800
 things to work for 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.149
 football is different because when I 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.710
 I'm making the center of the cup to the globe. 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.230
 sport the game is over 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.030
 so I'm trying to refine what 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.250
 happened in the game we do 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.309
 exciting reports but the game already 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.960
 been here non-voice quoted during the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.000
 event happening there are songs are 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.879
 sung live I'm there on time 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.250
 So here it moves, it moves more than 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.219
 to present a sports program 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.369
 beatriz moral physics is to know you were 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.700
 good student at school beatriz sa 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.010
 I think you're at and the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.729
 on twitter a message every day to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.229

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.330
 Kiss, I really like you, thank you. 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.049
 for the usual affection and you already know the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.119
 answer 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.150
 You see that humiliating me was lousy. 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.009
 student is very bad and the worst is not my 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.570
 class in high school got the third 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.880
 operation in everything except English 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 physical education but it was everything everything everything 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.259
 I just screwed up I think I just spent in the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.640
 third high school because one day I have 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.020
 knew that I got here that I wanted 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.180
 pursue a career in journalism, so I 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.250
 already had a college so defined 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.100
 what I was going to do and the coordinator knew 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.619
 and 2 is the swimmer in the class because I 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.149
 I think it looks and the decision came out on 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.490
 I think they gave me 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.770
 anyone very very bad hated everything 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 hated physical or chemical java liked 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 math but I was bad 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.530
 Finally, he was a terrible student in high school. 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.020

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 father of santo who made you conquer 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.680

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.299

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.650
 need now only choose sensuality 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.020
 quickness of reasoning a charm does not know 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.960

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.440
 inelegant but rest my head 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.550
