new Amazonian clay 12-hour shimmering
blushes<00:02:44.460> overall<00:02:45.460> I<00:02:45.730> think<00:02:45.820> I'm<00:02:46.210> not<00:02:46.390> as

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
blushes overall I think I'm not as

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.030 
blushes overall I think I'm not as
impressed<00:02:46.930> with<00:02:47.110> these<00:02:47.260> as<00:02:47.500> with<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
impressed with these as with the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.760 
impressed with these as with the
original<00:02:48.460> formula<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.180> think<00:02:49.840> because<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
original formula I think because of the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.530 
original formula I think because of the
shimmers<00:02:51.130> inside<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.880> formula<00:02:52.270> for<00:02:52.450> these

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
shimmers inside the formula for these

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.650 
shimmers inside the formula for these
four<00:02:52.960> is<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.470> lot<00:02:53.890> dustier<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.330> shimmers

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
four is a lot dustier and the shimmers

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.320 
four is a lot dustier and the shimmers
just<00:02:55.930> fly<00:02:56.410> all<00:02:56.740> over<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.400> place<00:02:57.460> I<00:02:58.000> noticed

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
just fly all over the place I noticed

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.230 
just fly all over the place I noticed
while<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.810> was<00:02:58.840> watching<00:02:59.470> them<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.430> you're

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
while I was watching them so you're

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.840 
while I was watching them so you're
going<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.780> get<00:03:01.900> shimmer<00:03:02.340> everywhere<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.610> your

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
going to get shimmer everywhere on your

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.330 
going to get shimmer everywhere on your
clothes<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.170> dresser<00:03:05.560> wherever<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.250> is

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860
