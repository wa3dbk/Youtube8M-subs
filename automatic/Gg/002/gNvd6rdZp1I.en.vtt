00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.700 
find out that the sizes of the rings are
varies<00:01:16.830> from<00:01:17.220> country<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.229> United

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
varies from country so if in United

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.370 
varies from country so if in United
States<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.700> measure<00:01:20.940> our<00:01:21.270> wings<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
States we measure our wings with the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.420 
States we measure our wings with the
size<00:01:22.650> six<00:01:23.130> seven<00:01:23.790> eight

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
size six seven eight

size six seven eight
in<00:01:26.430> Europe<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.060> Russia<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.690> mirrors

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
in Europe in Russia we mirrors

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.010 
in Europe in Russia we mirrors
differently<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.300> in<00:01:30.570> Russia<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
differently so it's like in Russia I

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.920 
differently so it's like in Russia I
know<00:01:31.230> it<00:01:31.410> says<00:01:31.650> 15<00:01:32.640> 16<00:01:33.480> 17<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.660> so<00:01:36.660> we

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
know it says 15 16 17 and so on so we

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.100 
know it says 15 16 17 and so on so we
came<00:01:37.230> to<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.860> little<00:01:38.010> problem<00:01:38.930> when<00:01:39.930> my

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
came to the little problem when my

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
came to the little problem when my
customers<00:01:40.350> ordering<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.340> Rings<00:01:41.550> we<00:01:41.940> don't

the right way to measure the Rings and
that<00:01:52.290> way<00:01:52.920> looks<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> most<00:01:54.300> common<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
that way looks like the most common and

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.610 
that way looks like the most common and
I<00:01:56.220> got<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.580> good<00:01:56.880> feedback<00:01:57.390> from<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.140> customers

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.759 

and<00:02:20.830> with<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.950> simple<00:02:22.220> ruler<00:02:23.439> of<00:02:24.439> course

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
and with the simple ruler of course

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.100 
and with the simple ruler of course
it'll<00:02:25.310> be<00:02:25.459> much<00:02:25.700> better<00:02:25.730> if<00:02:26.299> they've<00:02:26.569> got<00:02:26.870> the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
it'll be much better if they've got the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.119 
it'll be much better if they've got the
millimeters<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.989> measure<00:02:30.159> inside<00:02:33.129> inside

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
millimeters and measure inside inside

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.649 
millimeters and measure inside inside
diameter<00:02:34.849> of<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.720> ring<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.610> if<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.970> see<00:02:38.209> the

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
diameter of the ring so if you see the

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.869 
diameter of the ring so if you see the
inside<00:02:38.930> diameter<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:39.829> ring<00:02:40.159> is<00:02:40.549> around

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
inside diameter of this ring is around

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.280 
inside diameter of this ring is around
16<00:02:41.420> millimeters<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:43.540> they<00:02:44.540> need<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.810> provide

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
16 millimeters so they need to provide

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.960 
16 millimeters so they need to provide
you<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.530> exactly<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.640> same<00:02:47.980> number<00:02:48.980> if<00:02:49.760> they

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
you with exactly the same number if they

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.059 
you with exactly the same number if they
will<00:02:50.150> send<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.689> request<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.530> need<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.859> ring

size<00:02:52.750> 16<00:02:53.750> millimeters<00:02:54.349> inside<00:02:54.799> then<00:02:55.579> it'll<00:02:56.090> be

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
size 16 millimeters inside then it'll be

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.390 
size 16 millimeters inside then it'll be
much<00:02:56.390> easier<00:02:56.599> for<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.109> create<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:58.159> right

measuring<00:03:20.510> inside<00:03:21.260> diameter<00:03:22.069> of<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.819> ring

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.259 

for<00:03:26.449> example<00:03:26.569> I<00:03:27.139> get<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.160> order<00:03:28.519> for<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:29.000> size

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
for example I get the order for the size

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.150 
for example I get the order for the size
19<00:03:29.870> 20<00:03:30.519> yes<00:03:31.519> it's<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.879> little<00:03:32.030> bit<00:03:32.329> big<00:03:33.160> the

here<00:03:53.630> is<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.870> 20<00:03:54.230> millimeters

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.699 

let's<00:03:59.360> take<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.690> look<00:03:59.989> ahead<00:04:00.760> this<00:04:01.760> link<00:04:02.709> we're

let's take a look ahead this link we're

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.530 
let's take a look ahead this link we're
getting<00:04:04.099> inside<00:04:08.890> any<00:04:09.890> measuring<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.640> that'll

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
getting inside any measuring and that'll

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.320 
getting inside any measuring and that'll
be<00:04:12.160> sixteen<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.430> half<00:04:13.459> seven<00:04:14.150> two

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
be sixteen and a half seven two

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.530 
be sixteen and a half seven two
millimeters<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.400> know<00:04:16.459> that<00:04:16.729> this<00:04:16.970> size<00:04:17.209> is

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
millimeters and I know that this size is

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.940 
millimeters and I know that this size is
the<00:04:17.799> 1716<00:04:18.799> 1/2<00:04:19.040> 17<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.810> it's<00:04:21.049> fits<00:04:21.350> perfectly

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
the 1716 1/2 17 and it's fits perfectly

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.800 
the 1716 1/2 17 and it's fits perfectly
