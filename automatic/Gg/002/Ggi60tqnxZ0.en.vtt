now gives him the best chance to be that

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.880 
now gives him the best chance to be that
next<00:01:23.890> level<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.310> wire<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.659> he's<00:01:26.560> very

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
next level of wire and so he's very

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.609 
next level of wire and so he's very
receptive<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.759> them<00:01:27.909> why<00:01:28.450> he<00:01:29.229> could<00:01:29.409> still

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
receptive to them why he could still

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.889 
receptive to them why he could still
rush<00:01:29.799> for<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.009> thousand<00:01:30.399> yards<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.819> pass<00:01:31.060> for

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
rush for a thousand yards and pass for

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.950 
rush for a thousand yards and pass for
the<00:01:31.929> 708<00:01:32.619> in<00:01:32.740> Russia<00:01:33.009> that<00:01:33.700> would<00:01:33.880> be<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.810> know

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
the 708 in Russia that would be you know

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.499 
the 708 in Russia that would be you know
that<00:01:35.469> being<00:01:35.710> said<00:01:36.009> who<00:01:36.189> knows<00:01:36.369> who<00:01:37.090> knows<00:01:37.119> I

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
that being said who knows who knows I

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:38.849 
that being said who knows who knows I
mean<00:01:37.630> things<00:01:37.869> could<00:01:37.929> change<00:01:38.079> as<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.530> season

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
mean things could change as the season

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.919 
mean things could change as the season
goes<00:01:38.950> on<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.369> he<00:01:39.399> may<00:01:39.759> run<00:01:39.969> but<00:01:40.539> I've<00:01:40.719> the

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
goes on and he may run but I've the

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.809 
goes on and he may run but I've the
likelihood<00:01:41.469> of<00:01:41.499> him<00:01:41.710> rushing<00:01:41.920> when<00:01:42.609> he<00:01:42.670> rushed

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
likelihood of him rushing when he rushed

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.629

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.699 
yet because I haven't coached up in our
office<00:01:51.729> but<00:01:52.389> he<00:01:52.569> certainly<00:01:52.840> has<00:01:53.109> next<00:01:53.409> level

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
office but he certainly has next level

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.949 
office but he certainly has next level
skills<00:01:54.009> there's<00:01:54.729> based<00:01:55.509> on<00:01:55.659> what<00:01:55.810> I've<00:01:55.929> seen

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
skills there's based on what I've seen

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.840 
skills there's based on what I've seen
on<00:01:56.259> tape<00:01:56.530> he<00:01:56.740> definitely<00:01:57.100> has<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.340> as<00:01:57.789> a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
on tape he definitely has that as a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.300 
on tape he definitely has that as a
quarterback<00:01:58.209> possibly<00:01:58.959> possibly<00:01:59.139> and<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.130> lot

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
quarterback possibly possibly and a lot

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.669 
quarterback possibly possibly and a lot
of<00:02:00.340> people<00:02:00.670> would<00:02:00.819> say<00:02:01.029> well<00:02:01.389> you<00:02:02.079> know<00:02:02.170> they

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
of people would say well you know they

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.649 
of people would say well you know they
didn't<00:02:02.950> think<00:02:03.130> Michael<00:02:03.520> Vick<00:02:03.700> well<00:02:04.479> he's

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
didn't think Michael Vick well he's

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.690 
didn't think Michael Vick well he's
about<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.439> same<00:02:05.619> height<00:02:05.889> as<00:02:06.130> Michael<00:02:06.520> Vick

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
about the same height as Michael Vick

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.120 
about the same height as Michael Vick
and<00:02:06.729> he's<00:02:06.969> probably<00:02:07.149> faster<00:02:07.959> so<00:02:08.709> now<00:02:08.950> it

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
and he's probably faster so now it

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.889 
and he's probably faster so now it
becomes<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.580> matter<00:02:09.759> developing<00:02:10.360> his<00:02:10.450> passing

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
becomes a matter developing his passing

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.120 
becomes a matter developing his passing
skills<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.319> prove<00:02:11.500> he<00:02:11.620> can<00:02:11.740> play<00:02:11.860> at<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.099> next

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
skills to prove he can play at the next

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.160 
skills to prove he can play at the next
level<00:02:12.400> because<00:02:12.910> he<00:02:13.120> has<00:02:13.330> those<00:02:13.630> other<00:02:13.840> things

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
level because he has those other things

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.680 
level because he has those other things
those<00:02:14.709> other<00:02:14.980> things<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.550> can't<00:02:15.880> go<00:02:16.060> you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
those other things that you can't go you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.930 
those other things that you can't go you
can't<00:02:16.720> script<00:02:17.410> 40<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.130> 50<00:02:18.459> yard

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
can't script 40 and 50 yard

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.640 
can't script 40 and 50 yard
don't<00:02:19.940> do<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.140> I'm<00:02:21.140> not<00:02:21.349> hurting<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
don't do that I'm not hurting the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.339 
don't do that I'm not hurting the
quarterbacks<00:02:22.040> do<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:22.959> now<00:02:23.959> because<00:02:24.319> a

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
quarterbacks do that so now because a

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.020 
quarterbacks do that so now because a
matter<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.709> shoring<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.430> other<00:02:25.640> parts<00:02:25.970> of
