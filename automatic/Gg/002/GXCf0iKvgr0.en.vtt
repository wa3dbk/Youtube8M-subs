00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.900 
half of the coupler and moving into the
picture<00:00:20.039> now<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.519> the<00:00:21.090> knuckle<00:00:21.300> itself<00:00:22.910> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
picture now is the knuckle itself and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.579 
picture now is the knuckle itself and
then<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.869> bottom<00:00:25.529> half<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.640> closed<00:00:27.000> off<00:00:27.589> with

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
then the bottom half is closed off with

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.330 
then the bottom half is closed off with
this<00:00:29.310> part<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.910> last<00:00:33.270> four<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.600> half

this part and then last four and a half

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.029 
this part and then last four and a half
the<00:00:35.480> locking<00:00:36.480> ball<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.680> trouble

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
the locking ball a little trouble

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.500 
the locking ball a little trouble
getting<00:00:38.070> off<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> tweeters<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.360> because

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
getting off the tweeters here because

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.500 
getting off the tweeters here because
it's<00:00:39.629> oh<00:00:39.870> let's<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.010> off<00:00:41.160> good<00:00:41.510> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it's oh let's get right off good that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.400 
it's oh let's get right off good that
makes<00:00:43.079> up<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.289> whole<00:00:43.500> whole<00:00:44.309> mechanism

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.220 

okay<00:00:49.410> assembly<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.949> straightforward<00:00:51.230> just

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
okay assembly is straightforward just

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.939 
okay assembly is straightforward just
small<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.609> see<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.120> tweezers<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
small you can see these are tweezers and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
small you can see these are tweezers and
this<00:00:55.949> measurement<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.239> these<00:00:57.719> grids<00:00:58.410> are

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
this measurement here these grids are

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.669 
this measurement here these grids are
half-inch<00:00:59.039> grids<00:00:59.660> to<00:01:00.660> give<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.929> some<00:01:01.469> sense

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
half-inch grids to give you some sense

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.420 
half-inch grids to give you some sense
of<00:01:01.859> scale<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.510> there's<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.600> finger<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:05.250> get

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
of scale and there's a finger to get

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.469 
of scale and there's a finger to get
some<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:05.640> sense<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:06.030> scale

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
some more sense of scale

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.410 
some more sense of scale
I<00:01:06.509> have<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.560> measured<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.070> ball<00:01:08.420> but

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
I have not measured this ball but

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.640 
I have not measured this ball but
suffice<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.439> say<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.710> tiny<00:01:11.810> but<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
suffice it to say it's tiny but that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
suffice it to say it's tiny but that
said<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.850> hard<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.299> handle

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
said it's really not that hard to handle

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.560 
said it's really not that hard to handle
so<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.049> gonna<00:01:16.140> grab<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.409> my<00:01:16.470> tweezers<00:01:16.830> here

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
so I'm gonna grab with my tweezers here

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.280 
so I'm gonna grab with my tweezers here
and<00:01:18.570> drop<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> into<00:01:19.579> this<00:01:20.579> cavity<00:01:21.890> good<00:01:24.290> next

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and drop it into this cavity good next

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.020 
and drop it into this cavity good next
time<00:01:25.530> put<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> knuckle<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.329> shank

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
time put the knuckle on to the shank

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.060 
time put the knuckle on to the shank
grab<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> position<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> lowered

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
grab in a position I can get it lowered

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:41.719 
grab in a position I can get it lowered
onto<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.670> pivot

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.130 

here<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.719> go<00:01:43.909> he's<00:01:44.909> beyond<00:01:45.240> there<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.659> was

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
here we go he's beyond there I was

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.440 
here we go he's beyond there I was
amazing<00:01:46.500> how<00:01:46.740> he<00:01:46.799> says<00:01:47.130> act<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.729> works<00:01:48.149> not

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
amazing how he says act that works not

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.139 
amazing how he says act that works not
not<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> say<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.079> gonna<00:01:49.170> stay<00:01:49.439> there<00:01:49.469> but<00:01:50.149> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
not to say it's gonna stay there but it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.039 
not to say it's gonna stay there but it
seems<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.899> fairly<00:01:52.200> easily<00:01:53.810> all<00:01:54.810> right

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
seems to go on fairly easily all right

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.529 
seems to go on fairly easily all right
tricky<00:01:55.469> part<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.689> to<00:01:57.689> put<00:01:58.289> the<00:02:00.710> cover<00:02:01.710> on

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
tricky part is to put the cover on

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.800 
tricky part is to put the cover on
making<00:02:03.539> everything<00:02:03.720> else<00:02:03.899> fall<00:02:04.259> apart<00:02:04.590> so

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.250 

that<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.049> it<00:02:10.110> needs<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:11.900> enough<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.019> wet<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that all it needs just enough to wet it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.680 
that all it needs just enough to wet it
so<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.280> got<00:02:14.370> two<00:02:14.549> things<00:02:14.580> lined<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.330> got<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so we got two things lined up we got the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.479 
so we got two things lined up we got the
index<00:02:16.349> pin<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.780> pivot<00:02:18.989> pin<00:02:19.340> I'm<00:02:20.340> gonna

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
index pin and the pivot pin I'm gonna

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.390 
index pin and the pivot pin I'm gonna
start<00:02:20.819> with<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.120> pivot<00:02:21.480> pin<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.920> got<00:02:23.190> that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
start with the pivot pin so I got that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:32.229 
start with the pivot pin so I got that
okay<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.290> press<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.950> index<00:02:29.220> pin<00:02:29.849> in<00:02:30.030> place

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.110 

okay<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:34.190> don't<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.489> quite<00:02:35.610> settle

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
okay I don't think it's quite settle

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.120 
okay I don't think it's quite settle
away<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.660> gotta<00:02:38.150> get<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.239> final<00:02:39.599> press

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
away so I gotta get the final press

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.110 
away so I gotta get the final press
actually<00:02:41.130> Devin<00:02:42.000> up<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.049> right<00:02:43.170> place<00:02:43.200> cuz

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
actually Devin up in the right place cuz

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.729 
actually Devin up in the right place cuz
you<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.390> top<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.660> my<00:02:45.959> knuckle<00:02:46.920> shine

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
you see the top of my knuckle shine

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.960 
you see the top of my knuckle shine
there<00:02:49.739> we<00:02:49.829> go

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.100 

just<00:02:56.970> take<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.209> look<00:02:57.360> at<00:02:57.480> from<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.660> side<00:02:57.750> make

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
just take a look at from the side make

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.960 
just take a look at from the side make
sure<00:02:58.140> everything's<00:02:58.500> seated<00:02:58.920> properly<00:02:59.069> looks

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
sure everything's seated properly looks

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.339 
sure everything's seated properly looks
like<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:03.590> got<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> simple<00:03:04.860> coupler<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.989> to

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
like it is got a simple coupler and to

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.930 
like it is got a simple coupler and to

and grab a pencil to make sure he is in

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
at dropping into the chamber and you saw

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.289 
at dropping into the chamber and you saw
that<00:03:38.670> already<00:03:38.819> opened<00:03:39.239> up<00:03:41.209> there<00:03:42.209> we<00:03:42.269> go<00:03:43.160> one

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
that already opened up there we go one

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:53.089 
that already opened up there we go one
done

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.759 

the<00:03:53.640> last<00:03:53.939> step<00:03:54.269> is<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:55.019> mount<00:03:55.379> it<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
the last step is to mount it to the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.539 
the last step is to mount it to the
coupler<00:03:56.069> box<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:58.769> can<00:03:59.129> be<00:03:59.280> kind<00:03:59.430> of

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
coupler box and this can be kind of

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.199 
coupler box and this can be kind of
tricky<00:04:00.950> because<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.340> requires<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:03.120> you

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
tricky because it requires do you

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.780 
tricky because it requires do you
playing<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.540> small<00:04:03.870> spring<00:04:04.379> which<00:04:04.859> I<00:04:05.250> showed

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
playing that small spring which I showed

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.140 
playing that small spring which I showed
in<00:04:05.819> one<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.269> other<00:04:06.359> videos<00:04:07.760> ok<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.879> spring

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
in one of the other videos ok the spring

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.699 
in one of the other videos ok the spring
is<00:04:09.269> intended<00:04:09.659> to<00:04:09.750> give<00:04:09.989> some<00:04:10.230> friction

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
is intended to give some friction

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.129 
is intended to give some friction
between<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:13.069> couple<00:04:14.069> shank<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:15.599> pivot

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
between the couple shank and the pivot

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.879 
between the couple shank and the pivot
so<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.739> doesn't<00:04:16.949> just<00:04:16.979> flop<00:04:17.130> back<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.699> forth

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
so it doesn't just flop back and forth

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.890 
so it doesn't just flop back and forth
you<00:04:19.889> know<00:04:19.919> that's<00:04:20.509> it's<00:04:21.509> different<00:04:21.780> from

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
you know that's it's different from

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.779 
you know that's it's different from

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
Katie Katie has a centering spring so

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
that couple is always centered this

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.960 
that couple is always centered this

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
but I don't know if we really call that

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.620 
but I don't know if we really call that
bingo<00:06:27.640> cuz<00:06:27.820> I<00:06:27.910> take<00:06:28.090> that<00:06:28.240> took<00:06:28.420> a<00:06:28.480> little

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
bingo cuz I take that took a little

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.780 
bingo cuz I take that took a little
longer<00:06:28.810> than<00:06:28.930> expected<00:06:29.220> but<00:06:30.220> there<00:06:30.400> you<00:06:30.490> go<00:06:30.610> so

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
longer than expected but there you go so

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.930 
longer than expected but there you go so
that's<00:06:31.000> this<00:06:31.240> is<00:06:31.450> more<00:06:31.630> or<00:06:31.690> less<00:06:31.720> complete

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
that's this is more or less complete

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.330 
that's this is more or less complete
couple<00:06:33.940> box<00:06:34.150> will<00:06:34.390> go<00:06:34.510> on<00:06:34.660> top<00:06:34.870> of<00:06:35.020> this<00:06:35.340> again

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
couple box will go on top of this again

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.760 
couple box will go on top of this again
it's<00:06:36.460> ready<00:06:36.610> to<00:06:36.670> melt<00:06:37.200> this<00:06:38.200> gives<00:06:38.530> us<00:06:38.620> some

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
it's ready to melt this gives us some

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.110 
it's ready to melt this gives us some
friction<00:06:39.160> once<00:06:39.400> it's<00:06:39.550> in<00:06:39.670> here<00:06:39.880> it's<00:06:40.000> actually

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
friction once it's in here it's actually

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.710 
friction once it's in here it's actually
a<00:06:40.330> little<00:06:41.070> it's<00:06:42.070> kind<00:06:42.280> of<00:06:42.370> stable<00:06:42.760> doesn't

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
a little it's kind of stable doesn't

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
tend one jump out too easily but again

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.920 
tend one jump out too easily but again
that<00:06:46.540> slows<00:06:46.870> it<00:06:47.110> down<00:06:47.140> slow<00:06:47.980> motion<00:06:51.750> and<00:06:52.750> he's

that slows it down slow motion and he's

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.320 
that slows it down slow motion and he's
