00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
guard let's just put that to one side

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.819 
guard let's just put that to one side
you<00:02:09.640> get<00:02:09.820> your<00:02:09.940> little<00:02:10.119> lapel<00:02:10.780> wind<00:02:11.500> guard

you get your little lapel wind guard
right<00:02:12.459> there<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:13.660> fits<00:02:13.840> over<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.140> end

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
right there that just fits over the end

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.140 
right there that just fits over the end
of<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.470> microphone<00:02:14.920> then<00:02:15.730> you've<00:02:15.880> got<00:02:16.060> your

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
of the microphone then you've got your

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.199 
of the microphone then you've got your
actual<00:02:16.890> microphone<00:02:17.890> clip<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.000> microphone

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
actual microphone clip so the microphone

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.080 
actual microphone clip so the microphone
goes<00:02:19.600> in<00:02:19.840> there<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.530> if<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.579> just<00:02:21.609> do<00:02:21.910> that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
goes in there and if we just do that

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.809 
goes in there and if we just do that
there<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:22.420> go<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.140> got<00:02:23.260> like<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.440> little

notch here is where you can put the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.580 
notch here is where you can put the
cable<00:02:30.819> just<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.239> bit<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.660> neater

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
cable just for a bit of a neater

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.559 
cable just for a bit of a neater
you<00:02:33.040> know<00:02:33.160> finish<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.060> then<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.359> course

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
you know finish and then of course

you know finish and then of course
you've<00:02:34.750> got<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> microphone<00:02:35.319> itself<00:02:35.680> so

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
you've got the microphone itself so

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.330 
you've got the microphone itself so
let's<00:02:38.260> see<00:02:38.500> we've<00:02:38.680> got<00:02:38.739> this<00:02:38.859> little<00:02:39.040> velcro

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
let's see we've got this little velcro

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.280 
let's see we've got this little velcro
strap<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.060> keep<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.299> all<00:02:40.450> nice<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.660> neat<00:02:40.930> with

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
strap to keep it all nice and neat with

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.530 
strap to keep it all nice and neat with
a<00:02:41.410> roll<00:02:41.590> go<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.160> there<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.639> here<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.209> so

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
a roll go on there and here it is so

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.699 
a roll go on there and here it is so
this<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:45.000> trrs<00:02:47.700> 3.5<00:02:48.700> millimeter<00:02:49.269> jack<00:02:49.709> so

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
this is a trrs 3.5 millimeter jack so

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.410 
this is a trrs 3.5 millimeter jack so
obviously<00:02:51.549> this<00:02:51.730> will<00:02:51.850> work<00:02:52.000> with<00:02:52.150> mobile

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
obviously this will work with mobile

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.449 
obviously this will work with mobile
phone<00:02:52.630> because<00:02:52.780> it's<00:02:53.019> TRS<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.040> won't<00:02:54.220> work

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
phone because it's TRS but it won't work

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.620 
phone because it's TRS but it won't work
with<00:02:55.120> anything<00:02:55.600> else<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:56.470> me<00:02:56.739> I<00:02:57.100> use<00:02:58.090> one

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
with anything else so for me I use one

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.910 
with anything else so for me I use one
of<00:02:58.750> these<00:02:58.900> I'll<00:02:59.079> just<00:02:59.200> move<00:02:59.350> this<00:02:59.470> out<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.739> way

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
of these I'll just move this out the way

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.099 
of these I'll just move this out the way
I<00:03:00.190> use<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> zoom<00:03:02.920> h4n<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.930> it's

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
I use this this is a zoom h4n and it's

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.930 
I use this this is a zoom h4n and it's
what<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> do<00:03:05.440> all<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> audio<00:03:05.920> recorded<00:03:06.340> on<00:03:06.459> so

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
what I do all the audio recorded on so

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.849 
what I do all the audio recorded on so
this<00:03:07.239> microphone<00:03:07.780> won't<00:03:08.049> actually<00:03:08.260> be

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
this microphone won't actually be

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.039 
this microphone won't actually be
compatible<00:03:09.340> with<00:03:09.639> that<00:03:10.060> because<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.930> its

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
compatible with that because of its

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.089 
compatible with that because of its
connection<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:12.750> yes<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:14.349> will<00:03:14.500> need<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.890> get

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
connection so yes you will need to get

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.000 
connection so yes you will need to get
one<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.610> these<00:03:16.230> obviously<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.349> doesn't<00:03:17.590> come

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
one of these obviously this doesn't come

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.440 
one of these obviously this doesn't come
with<00:03:18.489> your<00:03:18.610> microphone

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
with your microphone

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.220 
with your microphone
but<00:03:19.720> this<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.170> called<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.650> road<00:03:21.480> sc3<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.930> what

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
but this is called the road sc3 and what

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.710 
but this is called the road sc3 and what
this<00:03:23.319> does<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:23.920> converts<00:03:24.130> your<00:03:24.430> TRS<00:03:25.330> signal

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
this does is it converts your TRS signal

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.820 
this does is it converts your TRS signal
in<00:03:26.290> there<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> TRS<00:03:28.239> signal<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.230> then<00:03:29.709> you

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
in there to a TRS signal and then you

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.210 
in there to a TRS signal and then you
can<00:03:29.980> use<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.280> with<00:03:30.400> things<00:03:30.580> like<00:03:30.989> your<00:03:32.220> DSLR

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
can use it with things like your DSLR

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.000 
can use it with things like your DSLR
camera<00:03:33.640> or<00:03:33.910> whatever<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.690> use<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.770> my

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
zoom h4n like you saw earlier so yes

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.690 
zoom h4n like you saw earlier so yes
