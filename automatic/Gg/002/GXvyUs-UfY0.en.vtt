00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
inside the Technodrome water tank I

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.839 
inside the Technodrome water tank I
don't<00:00:21.070> know<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:24.070> right<00:00:24.220> I<00:00:24.400> just<00:00:24.609> happen<00:00:24.789> to

fluffy thing did and what cheese room

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.620 
fluffy thing did and what cheese room
for<00:00:35.950> he<00:00:36.250> is<00:00:36.430> referring<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:37.000> is<00:00:37.120> this<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.600> here

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
for he is referring to is this in here

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.630 
for he is referring to is this in here
and<00:00:38.079> if<00:00:38.500> you<00:00:38.620> notice<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:39.100> goes<00:00:39.220> up<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:39.579> down

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
and if you notice it goes up and down

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.590 
and if you notice it goes up and down
it's<00:00:40.630> a<00:00:40.810> float<00:00:41.230> as<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.850> water<00:00:43.060> discipline

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
it's a float as the water discipline

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.150 
it's a float as the water discipline
goes<00:00:43.780> down<00:00:44.020> here<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.470> water<00:00:44.650> goes<00:00:44.890> through

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
goes down here the water goes through

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.270 
goes down here the water goes through
here<00:00:45.790> into<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.420> boiler<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.100> water

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
here into the boiler as the water

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.670 
here into the boiler as the water
dissipates<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.000> goes<00:00:49.120> down<00:00:49.390> this<00:00:50.080> float<00:00:50.410> goes

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
dissipates and goes down this float goes

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.720 
dissipates and goes down this float goes
down<00:00:51.240> shutting<00:00:52.240> off<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:52.900> heating<00:00:53.590> element<00:00:54.130> so

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
down shutting off the heating element so

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.450 
down shutting off the heating element so
it<00:00:54.880> doesn't<00:00:55.150> burn<00:00:55.240> up<00:00:55.650> so<00:00:56.650> if<00:00:56.710> there's<00:00:56.890> nice<00:00:57.130> so

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
it doesn't burn up so if there's nice so

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.580 
it doesn't burn up so if there's nice so
if<00:00:57.550> there's<00:00:57.730> water<00:00:57.910> in<00:00:58.120> there<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:59.200> float<00:00:59.440> is

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
if there's water in there the float is

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.310 
if there's water in there the float is
up<00:00:59.740> it<00:01:00.520> pushes<00:01:00.730> up<00:01:01.000> there<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.690> pushes<00:01:02.080> a<00:01:02.110> button

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
up it pushes up there it pushes a button

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.829 
up it pushes up there it pushes a button
on<00:01:02.530> this<00:01:02.680> micro<00:01:03.100> switch<00:01:03.479> makes<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.570> heating

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
on this micro switch makes a heating

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.350 
on this micro switch makes a heating
element<00:01:04.930> come<00:01:05.409> on<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:06.520> when<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:06.759> goes<00:01:06.880> down<00:01:06.909> it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
element come on and when it goes down it

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.140 
element come on and when it goes down it
disengages<00:01:08.049> who<00:01:09.009> was<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.729> clever<00:01:09.939> person

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
disengages who was the clever person

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.370 
disengages who was the clever person
that<00:01:10.420> thought<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.659> one<00:01:10.930> up<00:01:11.049> well<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.229> know

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
that thought that one up well you know

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.780 
that thought that one up well you know
that<00:01:11.650> makes<00:01:11.799> a<00:01:11.890> lot<00:01:12.010> of<00:01:12.040> sense<00:01:12.310> because<00:01:12.460> we

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
that makes a lot of sense because we

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.490 
that makes a lot of sense because we
just<00:01:12.970> leave<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.360> power<00:01:13.600> button<00:01:13.900> on<00:01:14.020> on<00:01:14.260> ours

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
just leave the power button on on ours

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.400 
just leave the power button on on ours
yes<00:01:15.190> we<00:01:15.400> use<00:01:15.550> this<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:15.820> much<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.210> okay<00:01:17.020> I<00:01:17.080> put

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
yes we use this so much and okay I put

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.080 
yes we use this so much and okay I put
it<00:01:17.500> in<00:01:17.560> so<00:01:17.770> much<00:01:17.950> water<00:01:18.160> it<00:01:18.550> started<00:01:18.970> like

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
it in so much water it started like

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.940 
it in so much water it started like
gurgling<00:01:19.420> up<00:01:19.750> oh<00:01:19.930> wait<00:01:20.200> wait<00:01:20.410> got<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.770> get<00:01:20.860> the

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
gurgling up oh wait wait got to get the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.970 
gurgling up oh wait wait got to get the
carafe<00:01:21.190> oh<00:01:21.400> yeah<00:01:22.180> right<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:23.260> was<00:01:23.380> hot<00:01:23.620> right

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
carafe oh yeah right it was hot right

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.060 
carafe oh yeah right it was hot right
yeah<00:01:24.480> so<00:01:25.480> this<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.680> while<00:01:26.860> we're<00:01:27.040> here

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
yeah so this is the and while we're here

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.240 
yeah so this is the and while we're here
this<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.909> inside<00:01:28.270> of<00:01:28.300> a<00:01:28.690> techno<00:01:29.170> form<00:01:29.380> so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
this is the inside of a techno form so

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.210 
this is the inside of a techno form so
the<00:01:30.460> water<00:01:30.640> goes<00:01:30.730> down<00:01:31.090> here<00:01:31.560> goes<00:01:32.560> inside

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
the water goes down here goes inside

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.330 
the water goes down here goes inside
this<00:01:33.730> cylindrical<00:01:34.770> section<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.010> center

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
this cylindrical section in the center

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.180 
this cylindrical section in the center
here<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.110> is<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.350> heating<00:01:38.560> element<00:01:39.040> on

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
here and this is the heating element on

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.030 
here and this is the heating element on
the<00:01:39.430> outside<00:01:39.880> heats<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.720> water<00:01:40.990> makes<00:01:41.830> it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
the outside heats that water makes it

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.040 
the outside heats that water makes it
boil<00:01:42.340> goes<00:01:42.909> up<00:01:43.090> through<00:01:43.300> here<00:01:43.540> up<00:01:43.780> through

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
boil goes up through here up through

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.050 
boil goes up through here up through
here<00:01:44.229> up<00:01:44.470> through<00:01:44.710> here<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.760> course<00:01:45.940> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
here up through here and of course the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.610 
here up through here and of course the
shower<00:01:46.300> arm<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.750> all<00:01:46.840> that's<00:01:47.080> missing<00:01:47.290> here

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
shower arm and all that's missing here

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.260 
shower arm and all that's missing here
but<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.040> goes<00:01:48.159> across<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.610> shower<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.060> down

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
but it goes across the shower and down

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:58.710 
but it goes across the shower and down
into<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.690> basket<00:01:49.870> so<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.120> was<00:01:57.420> shower<00:01:58.420> arm

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
into the basket so if it was shower arm

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.200
