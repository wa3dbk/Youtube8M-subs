 hello everyone with you alex PTT and today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.250
 10 part from the rubric of trading 24 to 7 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.230
 Well, or how to trade azimov in this 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.300
 parts will be a lot of surprises will be 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.610
 a lot of nice and interesting well in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.680
 general went and immediately decided 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.289
 try to exchange all things for keys 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.660
 but then I'll take it and for starters, I 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.430
 traded your ak-47 for 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.760
 water block slightly shabby 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.680
 plus ak-47 jaguar after field with two 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.680
 stick and key look 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.050
 Well , I read somewhere in three 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.750
 your blog watermark on two keys + block 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.270
 night which costs about 20 cents and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.520
 tec-9 red quartz which cost 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.520
 about 60 cents are watching 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.790
 but actually 1 bun when played 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.570
 fnatic against mauses 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.090
 I poured 3 consumer goods on mauz when 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.550
 coefficient they had 9 well and they dug 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.670
 I just put it on a small kf. 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.370
 this happens in theory I should have been 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.570
 give a half a dollar but here's this thing on 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.320
 trading costs 2 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.840
 in general, I threw them on women for big and 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.470
 thereby also bought a bit of their past 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.440
 bets 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.250
 Well, that's the next track, I traded my 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.850
 ak 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.000
 jaguar on 5 keys plus a sticker thinking 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.680
 which is worth a dollar slowly typing 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.680
 keys look further 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.610
 but then I changed my mq scary two 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.360
 key and p2000 amber gradient 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.370
 slightly worn further out trade 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.500
 became because I just really have these 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.170
 all p2000 stickers 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.300
 Well, in general, left only the keys to those 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.429
 the money that I sold bought one more 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.920
 the key in the end I got 14 keys 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.190
 Well, this is the one key that I bought 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.410
 can only be seen in a week 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.050
 Well, in general, I decided to try to start 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.900
 see azimov with 13 keys see what 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.209
 I could not not come to tradition 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.040
