00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
remove that from spotlight search but

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.320 
remove that from spotlight search but
it'll<00:02:12.330> also<00:02:12.420> help<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:12.959> battery

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
it'll also help your battery

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.900

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
because you're because your device won't

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
because you're because your device won't
be<00:02:16.120> like<00:02:16.360> constantly<00:02:17.110> trying<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.680> index<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
be like constantly trying to index the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.750 
be like constantly trying to index the
spotlight<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:21.250> kind<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.460> hard<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.670> explain

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
spotlight it's kind of hard to explain

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.600 
spotlight it's kind of hard to explain
but<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.360> does<00:02:22.720> help<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.050> battery<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> next

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
but it does help the battery so the next

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.330 
but it does help the battery so the next
one<00:02:24.760> down<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.060> accessibility<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:27.040> head<00:02:27.220> on

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
one down is accessibility going head on

one down is accessibility going head on
down<00:02:27.610> here<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.860> reduce<00:02:29.860> motion<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:31.980> turn<00:02:32.980> it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
down here to reduce motion and turn it

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.310 
down here to reduce motion and turn it
on<00:02:33.330> what<00:02:34.330> this<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.630> do<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.080> will<00:02:35.110> like

more<00:02:50.050> battery<00:02:50.350> life<00:02:50.380> I've<00:02:50.740> experimented<00:02:51.400> with

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
more battery life I've experimented with

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.820 
more battery life I've experimented with
this<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.090> my<00:02:52.120> iPhone<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:53.170> definitely<00:02:53.500> does

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
this on my iPhone and it definitely does

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.010 
this on my iPhone and it definitely does
help<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.640> always<00:02:54.910> turn<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:55.270> reduce<00:02:55.540> motion<00:02:55.750> I

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
help so I always turn on reduce motion I

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.170 
help so I always turn on reduce motion I
didn't<00:02:56.230> have<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.380> tox<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.800> forgot<00:02:57.070> about<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.370> but

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
didn't have a tox I forgot about it but

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.970 
didn't have a tox I forgot about it but
it<00:02:58.300> doesn't<00:02:58.540> really<00:02:58.630> like<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.200> does<00:02:59.440> also

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
it doesn't really like it does also

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.199 
it doesn't really like it does also
whenever<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.310> move<00:03:00.400> your<00:03:00.550> device<00:03:00.820> go<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.150> get

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
whenever you move your device go and get

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.410 
whenever you move your device go and get
the<00:03:01.330> parallax<00:03:01.930> effect<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.250> background<00:03:03.760> so

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
the parallax effect in the background so

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.990 
the parallax effect in the background so
that's<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:05.140> downfall<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:05.890> if<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.730> don't<00:03:06.880> only

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
that's a downfall but if you don't only

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.270 
that's a downfall but if you don't only
look<00:03:07.120> at<00:03:07.300> that<00:03:07.480> then<00:03:07.750> why<00:03:08.560> have<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.830> on<00:03:08.950> so

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
look at that then why have it on so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.060 
look at that then why have it on so
reduce<00:03:09.760> motion<00:03:12.690> next<00:03:13.690> one<00:03:14.260> down<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.470> privacy

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
reduce motion next one down is privacy

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.130 
reduce motion next one down is privacy
go<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.490> privacy<00:03:15.970> go<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.209> location<00:03:16.540> services

go to privacy go to location services

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.729 
go to privacy go to location services
