kit they call it the the flux beam kit
so<00:00:21.119> new<00:00:21.270> product<00:00:21.949> went<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.070> top<00:00:23.189> seven<00:00:23.580> just

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
so new product went with top seven just

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.259 
so new product went with top seven just
because<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.800> used<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.099> their<00:00:26.340> HID<00:00:26.730> kit<00:00:26.849> on

another<00:00:27.539> car<00:00:27.810> worked<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.349> pretty<00:00:28.529> well<00:00:28.650> but

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
another car worked out pretty well but

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.609 
another car worked out pretty well but
LEDs<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> future<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.689> I'm<00:00:31.260> gonna<00:00:31.410> go<00:00:31.560> ahead

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
LEDs the future so I'm gonna go ahead

the<00:01:01.170> top<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> box<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.920> store<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the top of the box to store you know the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
the top of the box to store you know the
old<00:01:03.270> bulbs<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.840> well<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.110> any<00:01:04.199> excess<00:01:04.589> wiring

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
old bulbs as well as any excess wiring

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
old bulbs as well as any excess wiring
you<00:01:05.100> might<00:01:05.280> may<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:05.970> may<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.150> need<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.110> let's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you might may or may not need so let's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.670 
you might may or may not need so let's
try<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> size<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.790> over<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.750> basically

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
try the size one over here so basically

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.490 
try the size one over here so basically
first<00:01:11.130> step<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.020> remove<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.260> original

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
first step is to remove the original

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
first step is to remove the original
ball<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.790> we're<00:01:14.909> gonna<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.180> ahead<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.509> take<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
ball so we're gonna go ahead and take a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.260 
ball so we're gonna go ahead and take a
look<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.380> got<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> back<00:01:17.270> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
look here we got to the back the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
look here we got to the back the
headlight<00:01:18.600> assembly<00:01:19.189> most<00:01:20.189> bulbs<00:01:20.460> move

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
headlight assembly most bulbs move

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730 
headlight assembly most bulbs move
either<00:01:21.090> by<00:01:21.299> turning<00:01:21.659> clockwise<00:01:21.930> or

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
either by turning clockwise or

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620 
either by turning clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.909> about<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
counterclockwise just about like a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.830 
counterclockwise just about like a
quarter<00:01:25.320> inch<00:01:25.470> turn<00:01:26.030> nothing<00:01:27.030> too<00:01:27.360> crazy<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
quarter inch turn nothing too crazy and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
quarter inch turn nothing too crazy and
you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.680> matter<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> twenty

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you can see it a matter of twenty

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.149 
you can see it a matter of twenty
seconds<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> remove<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> original<00:01:31.070> just<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
seconds you remove the original just a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.149 
seconds you remove the original just a
quick<00:01:32.369> note<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:33.270> find<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.720> easier<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.740> remove

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
quick note we find it easier to remove

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.620 
quick note we find it easier to remove
the<00:01:35.460> power<00:01:35.670> harness<00:01:35.909> from<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the power harness from the back of the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
the power harness from the back of the
bulb<00:01:36.810> base<00:01:37.020> before<00:01:37.500> trying<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> remove<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
bulb base before trying to remove the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
bulb base before trying to remove the
bulb<00:01:38.400> base<00:01:38.600> probably<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> good<00:01:39.780> idea<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.110> in

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
bulb base probably a good idea just in

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
bulb base probably a good idea just in
case<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> give<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> an<00:01:41.009> extra<00:01:41.220> tug<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.670> might

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
case you give it an extra tug you might

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.630 
case you give it an extra tug you might
damage<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.840> original<00:01:43.229> wiring<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.829> we

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
damage the original wiring so we

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.859 
damage the original wiring so we
definitely<00:01:44.790> recommend<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
definitely recommend that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.959 
definitely recommend that
so<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.189> LED<00:01:47.399> bulb<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
so you can see the LED bulb and the

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.209 
so you can see the LED bulb and the
driver<00:01:48.210> come<00:01:48.659> already<00:01:49.140> pre-wired<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.950> nothing

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
driver come already pre-wired so nothing

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.149 
driver come already pre-wired so nothing
to<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.460> there<00:01:51.350> really<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.619> take<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.039> out

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
to do there really just take it out

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.990 
to do there really just take it out
install<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.179> then<00:01:55.310> reinstall<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
install it and then reinstall what I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.249 
install it and then reinstall what I
would<00:01:57.210> recommend<00:01:57.569> though<00:01:57.659> before<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.990> put<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
would recommend though before we put it

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.050 
would recommend though before we put it
back<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.859> a<00:01:58.890> quick<00:01:59.100> bench<00:01:59.399> test<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.909> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
back in is do a quick bench test of it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
back in is do a quick bench test of it
oh<00:02:00.210> okay<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.159> verify

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
oh okay just because you want to verify

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.690 
oh okay just because you want to verify
it's<00:02:02.729> gonna<00:02:02.850> fit<00:02:03.119> before<00:02:03.439> just<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.560> case<00:02:04.829> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
it's gonna fit before just in case you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.399 
it's gonna fit before just in case you
know<00:02:05.819> it's<00:02:06.090> more<00:02:06.539> difficult<00:02:06.869> than<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> on

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
know it's more difficult than it is on

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.300 
know it's more difficult than it is on
my<00:02:07.679> car<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:10.289> install<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> bulb<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.220> we're

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
my car to to install the bulb so we're

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.800 
my car to to install the bulb so we're
going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.549> into<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.879> quick<00:02:12.120> test<00:02:12.360> Boop<00:02:12.629> there

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
going to go into a quick test Boop there

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.180 
going to go into a quick test Boop there
you<00:02:12.900> go<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.230> good<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> go<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.040> got<00:02:14.160> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
you go and good to go so we got a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.270 
you go and good to go so we got a
thumbs-up<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.879> test<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> bulb<00:02:16.280> now

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
thumbs-up on that test to the bulb now

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.460 
thumbs-up on that test to the bulb now
we'll<00:02:17.519> just<00:02:17.640> go<00:02:17.760> ahead<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.269> quickly<00:02:18.840> install

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
we'll just go ahead and quickly install

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.610 
we'll just go ahead and quickly install
it<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.709> place<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.190> OEM<00:02:20.489> bulb<00:02:21.319> just<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.410> quick

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it in place of the OEM bulb just a quick

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.069 
it in place of the OEM bulb just a quick
point<00:02:23.400> we're<00:02:23.849> at<00:02:24.090> about<00:02:24.329> two<00:02:24.540> minutes<00:02:24.690> to

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
point we're at about two minutes to

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.100 
point we're at about two minutes to
remove<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> original<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.160> install<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.730> LED

remove the original and install the LED
on<00:02:28.110> one<00:02:28.349> side<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:28.920> hopefully<00:02:29.099> we<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.400> keep

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
on one side so hopefully we can keep

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.030 
on one side so hopefully we can keep
that<00:02:29.730> pace<00:02:29.940> up<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.079> put<00:02:31.349> put<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.799> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
that pace up so I put put it in I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.400 
that pace up so I put put it in I
twisted<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.430> back<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.120> secured<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.349> two
