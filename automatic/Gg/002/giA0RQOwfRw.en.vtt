00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.480
 new episode 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.940
 Today there is information and a 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.090
 recipe around the pages or as in 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.460
 this even bio page fall seitan is 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.640
 otherwise than from the wheat out 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.170
 washed glue the wheat protein 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.509
 so-called blood and is natural with it 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.670
 a very high quality and very good 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.570
 protein source side really sits 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.320
 packed with egg whites 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.969
 On the other hand, it works 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.460
 Not for the people with one 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.260
 gluten intolerance speak to the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.780
 cow or not for people who are 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.550
 generally want to feed blood 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.489
 just a little less of the crowd 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.800
 take yourselves otherwise is three days one 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.090
 really great thing not only that it 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.289
 just as I said that a good 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.879
 it also serves as the source of protein 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.949
 incredibly easy to process and 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.660
 really only this powder and can 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.369
 process with water with vegetable stock 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.950
 with whatever you want and get 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.240
 depending on the mixing ratio 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.880
 really right meat like 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.499
 Textures and it works since 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.600
 next to it very well so everything in 

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:17.060
 Direction meat should give whether stakes 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.979
 gyros whether it be burger patties 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.649
 Whatever you do for sausage 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.539
 wanted schnitzel steak website 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.579
 This works very well 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.549
 very very easy as a really good one 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.229
 Product trap beginner in vegan or 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.119
 but for all the people who are looking for new ones 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.579
 Recipes search pages is really one 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.889
 great thing so what am I doing today 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.349
 I sausage with you and that 

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:41.630
 a sausage in a pepper coat and for that 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.219
 do you need of course is in addition to the then 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.009
 a few other products than there 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.749
 For example, the agave dicksaft would be something 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.810
 still sweet and then about it 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.789
 In addition, a little more yeast salt smoked 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.130
 paprika black pepper chili powder 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.109
 mustard garlic powder onion over 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.059
 I already have all this in the left 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.759
 schÃ¤lchen mixed there is something else 

00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:03.880
 bad luck is of course water ketchup liquid 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.950
 smoke and a little one 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.590
 Still shot of beautiful Spanish 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.170
 liquid tabasco eg works too 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.730
 some vegan variants of it 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.980
 with the spices could ultimately 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.840
 Look like you have the ministers for you 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.739
 make the sausage so after this recipe 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.489
 will be very piquant enough talked 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.620
 I start the spices at the beginning 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.080
 to fail and to flake the spice 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.540
 then give her some spice mix 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.459
 water along with some liquid the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.069
 ketscher the agave thick juice one 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.290
 shot still from tabasco and stirs that 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.360
 All of that comes together again to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.370
 mail mix and then with the hand mixer 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.590
 stir through for a few minutes 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.880
 a nice solid mass is that could 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.690
 then go well with a hand to a sausage 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.780
 form and then I give the thrust 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.790
 pepper mixture at a glance 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.099
 whole I should then properly for sausage 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.160
 together then the turn comes in 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.780
 a bug almond and this bug mankel 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.200
 I then close each one to the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.670
 The end should be neatly together 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 closes properly and then comes into 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.980
 water bath for about three quarters 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.170
 hour 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.299
 if only then cut off that 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.670
 water what i do not sleep but 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.680
 caught on the outside has something drain 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.680
 leave and that was it done 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.110
 the salami is ready now we have seen 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.090
 have so it looks that at least one 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.560
 piece of it looks like that on the one hand 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.819
 very nice to see the pepper 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.170
 Coat again with the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.270
 Mustard seeds also in it 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.280
 very nice again the mustard seeds and 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.280
 to see the spices as a fine 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.290
 very piquant very suddenly so 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.910
 if you want to do that more often you 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.250
 quiet times a two times the birth 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.900
 assemble a two people I 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.900
 know already say a bit spicy 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.830
 I personally like something coming through and 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.410
 already known 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.180
 So you let yourself taste and how 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.900
 always applies if you follow them 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.090
 want to scroll down www 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.920
 then you will see your own e book there 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.190
 area you can then recipes 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.920
 download question, namely feedback 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.209
 inform me about the video or etc writes 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.859
 send me an email to markus vegan idea 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.519
 the measure and then until the last time 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.519
 bye 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.340
 Here I am again renting myself now 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.700
 I just noticed that I was at the end 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.680
 probably until the last time said that 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.180
 of course, complete nonsense so afford 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.250
 Until next time 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.200
 like you see it 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.790
 video cut almost like cooking 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.230
 here and there something goes wrong but 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.090
 Ultimately, it does not really work 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.290
 crooked because you always learn it 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.410
 next time to do better again 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.770
 So accordingly until the next 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.330
 times 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.330
 but really cute
