00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.770
 ae 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:25.310
 senac pb please but you do not do this 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.310
 with respect you call godfather 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.670
 It's just me who will do what I think 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:01:00.010
 that the only one I know not what 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:03.010
 so that's it, my best came to hi 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.010
 beauty 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.590
 The console that we received here was the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.790
 supaboy a super nintendo laptop from 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.380
 rai beijing 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.950
 it is large screen medium works with 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.660
 cartridges is not just a video game that rolls 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
 with an emulator game then you 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.090
 can put your super cartridges 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.480
 including the Japanese and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.390
 so for a $ 70 video game 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.600
 it is well finished up more people see 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.810
 so glaring faults in the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 finish here on the side the edges not the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.940
 fittings are not very well aligned have 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.220
 a led light to ask up because that is 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.380
 horrible 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.240
 it works on battery is not with 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.340
 piles an advantage but for you 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.160
 access the compartment you need 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.649
 open a philips key the directional is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.740
 big but he's drunk 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.530
 but otherwise the abx buttons that are 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.230
 very good you do not leave to be desired 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.120
 You can play a good game until it's clear and he 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.830
 has these two inputs for control 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.450
 also for you to use original from 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.610
 penezzi turn on the tv 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.410
 with this output one thing that went well 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.700
 cool since we got him 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.100
 in all the tests that we did him 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.560
 ran the games with a fx chip and ran 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.840
 games with the special capcom chip and 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.700
 ran various types of games in our 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.000
 Testing had trouble with a super game 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.230
 mario rpg which is a game that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.970
 is known to give rise to a problem 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.970
 emulator gets very difficult 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.560
 but overall so it went well 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.240
 surprising both his reaction is the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.800
 people had a little problem because the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.420
 Most of our cars are dirty 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.180
 so sometimes it seemed that the game would not go 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.150
 not work, but attempts to clean the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.709
 chip and test again normally 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.720
 they all worked without 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.060
 problem the advantage of using the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.120
 logical control is to use the motor 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.730
 original and turn off the TV more by the sound 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.030
 because the original sound coming out of these 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.310
 two small speakers there is very 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.050
 weak is very bad even distorted the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.430
 volume is not obvious the output to have a 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.100
 composite output as supermax era 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.019
 original at the time did not exist at most 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.660
 in this video he has not left this 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.519
 video but if you have a cable if you only flea and 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.860
 play there on tv, you can play 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.989
 usually what is good is that you can 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.480
 drop on your property place on tv 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.300
 and it was already living a console was 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.780
 amazing to see that a mega man x3 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.060
 Lord be good fox games 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.650
 they all worked very fast 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.570
 good 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.570
 is different from others 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:05.430
 this premise of being an emulator 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.670
 and it 's cool to compare it with 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.170
 things like a jingle 11 whiskey 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.269
 other laptops as soon as they are 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.709
 emulation you take care of sd that 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.440
 usually they have frame problem 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.269
 rate he has trouble even with a way of 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.549
 super on these things so they end up 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.350
 having some problems even performance 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.430
 of frame rate until response delay 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.960
 of controls 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.370
 Unfortunately, here we do not 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.370
 faced any of these problems 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.539
 we have another version of a console 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.020
 portable version of the pfc mobile ranking 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:43.440
 two it is resident of the nintendinho 8 bits 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.690
 the biggest improvement over this version 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.590
 was on the screen this line that is 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.599
 two and a half inches and it's not just 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.300
 small but she is very bad 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.080
 the pictures are made the colors are not 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.300
 faithful 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.520
 something that is worth mentioning in 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.620
 compared to fc mobile is that while 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.229
 this week the neighborhood has a straight format 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.380
 no flu has no footprint the footprint of 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.410
 his role is better he has a one 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.990
 texture but the aspirant is much better 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.849
 to hold the sweat does not bother you so much 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.289
 for having a good game time 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.570
 are small details as soon as the 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:21.539
 supaboy corrected in relation to the others 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.970
 portable computers in that cafe that 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.300
 previously launched the 3-inch screen and 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.240
 sock is the same as psp 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.400
 She is not very sharp, maybe by the 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.860
 the overall quality of the components 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.259
 that they use to and until that date today 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.509
 in days the psb itself has had three 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.430
 different versions of the screen then 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.409
 and all have been improving a bit for 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.479
 a super nintendo laptop does not 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:49.050
 compromises nor can you play but the colors 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:51.300
 they are half washed do not compromise me much 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.139
 the guy who just wants to remember a little 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.139
 from games to people 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.239
 in general my opinion is that i suppose 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.089
 It's worth a lot of investment so for who 

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:07.939
 wants a super nese that is what is something 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.949
 other than panels used for 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:13.279
 What happened when you will endure? 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.719
 apparently supaboy is a good 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:16.639
 a good investment can not know if 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.919
 it will hold six months one year 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.080
 because they are fans for six months to a year 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.429
 to do constantly analyzing not 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.429
 It's okay, I'm not much of a fan. 

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:26.979
 these consoles which use emulation by 

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:30.860
 the more you can put your 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:33.469
 cartridges on it I think nothing beats 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.539
 you play on the original hardware this 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:39.019
 here is a type of website that is standard and 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:41.539
 works on multiple consoles such the 

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:45.830
 girl will never be 100% but she looks like 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:48.949
 100% you have some problems in 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:52.399
 70 dollar sound cars I think one 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:55.519
 little heavy yet if you 40 on the 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:59.829
 maximum 50 bursting I would even consider 

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:59.829
 more for 70 I can not recommend 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.280
 Look at your cartridges carefully. 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.680
 first super mario rpg here not 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:33.370
 it even worked but another copy that 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:35.880
 we got it worked and it worked well 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.880
 good 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.470
 It was a shock to us, it was a shock.
