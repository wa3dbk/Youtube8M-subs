 description is in any case everything 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.790
 in there and then I tell you is the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.000
 prerequisite for this are best in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 the e-mail comes in and that's her

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.899
 a minecraft recording somehow no 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.789
 idea 1 minute or so at least 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.440
 a minute in any case a maximum of two 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.809
 I should minutes too short not 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 Too long and he does not necessarily have to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.020
 may be minecraft also some 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.180
 else can still be as live video 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.340
 or just another game no idea 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.079
 In any case, there should be a bit 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.049
 what about you talk also important is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.900
 for the e mail so wat in the e-mail 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.780
 Rhein is supposed to be your ingame name and you 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.080
 Might not have an embossed minecraft there 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.479
 must be the purchased version and you 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.860
 should be best given to your person 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.890
 make interests hobbys age of origin 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.780
 he was so stuff and yes best 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880
 it would be if you in the topic 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.439
 you are interested in us then 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.720
 like to chat volts also announces 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.060
 suggest that because he then in the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.930
 So talk a little bit about the session 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.030
 was talking about it and yes what actually 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.790
 as with any application actually too 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.470
 That's why we should be right now 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.049
 take you as a guest 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 then it's always like that 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.950
 main question because many people apply 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.390
 a matter we should just you 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.219
 take it with you and if you build wat 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.950
 want us on the servers because I 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.590
 yes thinks then make you a planner 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.890
 Remember, you only have four parts 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.129
 So just an hour to build so 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.580
 such not to be over the top and 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.260
 Yes 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.880
 we make it out to those with the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.100
 That's exactly what materials are made of 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.500
 our own existence there we would be yes 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.130
 no difference or so there you have to 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.620
 then even a little bit 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.750
 Consider that we take ours 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.490
 Stock light completely empty makes me mine 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.060
 is also bad within one 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.690
 hour 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.460
 So write best with no 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.720
 I think I need half a double 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.170
 crate full of cable is his and still 66 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.440
 wood or so far in the art that 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.650
 she then tells us what we are telling you 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.230
 about to provide and so on 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.160
 definitely has everything on a temporal basis 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.420
 The recording date is correct 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.760
 basically Sundays is always 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.260
 Sunday 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.030
 Unfortunately , we can not exception 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.470
 because the recording day 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.330
 Sundays is whether we never record otherwise 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.270
 and if we chose you 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.100
 then we will answer you 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.620
 as soon as possible and then tell me 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.959
 let me know when 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.480
 So changes I know no other stands 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.250
 then I write an e-mail 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.690
 what i do not know 28 january 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.600
 15 o'clock somehow so far then stands then 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.510
 In any case, in the answer trainer 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.430
 should you then receive no answer 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.860
 Unfortunately ours does not fulfill that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.870
 Criteria and yes I hope that is 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.489
 then understandable that soon 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.620
 anyone can take in because I 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.140
 think that's really very much 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.739
 Many people are going to do it now 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.070
 bewerbung and yes that was actually so 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.200
 so far summarized again 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.410
 The e- mail address is minecraft point 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.390
 trickster et so without parents between 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.780
 again minecraft point winner at 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:05.410
 Make gmail.com and a little video 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:08.200
 with content to your person euro 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.870
 hobbys interests suggestion for 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.790
 talked about why 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.380
 we should take you as a guest and 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.900
 want to build water and how you for 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.540
 materials out that's actually 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.590
 Everything so you can stop in the video 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.360
 roughly everything soma washed off and then 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.009
 maybe other info just as well 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.979
 so do not have to write an e-mail 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:33.880
 as in the video you can also split 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.620
 that's not a thing he has such a 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.030
 so far that's all 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.139
 did the same thing as I just 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.180
 have said 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.280
 stands between and in the video 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.720
