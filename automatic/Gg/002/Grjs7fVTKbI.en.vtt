00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.429
 of ecology and telecommunications as a server asks that the defaulter 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.500
 as you know we try every week to share with you theme 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 interesting related to the world technology and telecommunications 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.480
 The first thing that we are going to share with you is the one that is 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.910
 telephone espionage telephone espionage usually rite as a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.500
 myth with a mystery because it has to do hidden collection and without 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.869
 authorization to carry out the monitoring and evaluation of calls 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.130
 private telephone of people 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.170
 Telephone espionage can be done in multiple ways because it exists 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.670
 a lot of technology and how to do it 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.620
 it will depend if it is carried out from a wired network 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.870
 of those that are in the offices not in the house that arrives 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.609
 percent telephone service through a cable 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.850
 it was appreciated wired that is the case of cell phones 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.540
 telephone espionage to the real america is still playing the league is 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.060
 basic first generally the wire lines I think nothing 2 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.300
 a place where all those lines are concentrated 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.330
 real to the telephone for that place where they are concentrated they are 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.340
 some cabins that usually fly 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.250
 where all the telephone numbers of that area are identified 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.380
 there is that it leaves on the cable to the place of destination the house or the office 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.650
 there is a person who is dedicated to making telephone espionage connect a 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.350
 monitoring or recording system to the number you are interested in recording we can 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.180
 give him all the recording gone touched of the conversation that interests him that he 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.980
 make that name 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.860
 matÃ­as with the new efe law and some other regulations are made with 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.870
 the jurist option from the same telephone company 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.210
 there I cry for some devices of this nor can have conversations 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.030
 that are carried out and that goes for security purposes is affirmed 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.050
 application scientist 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.130
 also the wire line the cable that goes to the office can already be 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.100
 intercepted 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.310
 and a connection is made 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.910
 that goes to small and yes the mobiles that usually has the company that 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.180
 is dedicated to this and there also installs equipment 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.759
 of the cell phone or wireless the espionage is done with a computer that 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.650
 fear where the person concerned thinks he is interested in knowing what the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.520
 another set picket installed you set up near share and every time the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.490
 person who has the cell phone maya matador that equipment registers it if he can 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.230
 record everything that makes also cites the fashion we tell it in the lines 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.280
 wired to do it from the same telephone company 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.779
 tired by 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.209
 or the matica espionage is extremely complex 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.260
 since in countries like ours that are given hello I look for political and 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.249
 follow up personal matters that have nothing to do with the nature of doing it 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.859
 to fight crime and various crimes or person can 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.139
 commit and regrettable that you have a country and is that they use it for blackmail 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.480
 already arias in a proper dream 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.209
 of equity logical tecpa 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.209
 thank god the technology also provides tools 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.999
 until tinelli delage telephone for example in the case of cell phones c 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.059
 if what you know is him 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.750
 which is a device that connects to the cell phone 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.290
 i makes the flame and s dictated 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.100
 and prevents it from being intervened or monitored from its affiliation that 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.889
 one is not being monitored or that his private call to be used country 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.859
 again appropriate 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.359
 the cultivation issue that we are going to share with you decide 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.420
 to a question that people usually ask themselves 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.199
 and is that which is the best judge of the court 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:37.309
 recently this year the world technology congress was held because 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:39.659
 is the technology or European standard 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.639
 more developed in the digital area in the case of Alava 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.919
 where a model of the samsung brand was selected 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.429
 the s &amp; p 500 as the best tournament as they are the world's 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:53.859
 the same has amazing features examples can not record 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.419
 60 minutes of video if that interesting device that change in five or by some 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:04.969
 digital camera of that trade several megapixel entities olga resolution 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.099
 has a built-in flash 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.259
 he also understands the position of Milan Turin in single reading 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.660
 and a set of characteristics that make it 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.310
 it had its moment 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.420
 What a novelty that interesting 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.230
 and gives us the idea 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.459
 of the institutions 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.979
 he liked that they can have cell phones facing the future 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.779
 with this we conclude had this week its cyt technology section and 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.940
 telecommunications following its policy 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.730
 agenda program I talk to you and leave that until next week
