00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.490 
dr. defects I guess that's how you say
it<00:02:10.580> but<00:02:11.030> here's<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.330> UM<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.050> other<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:12.350> which

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
it but here's the UM the other one which

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.440 
it but here's the UM the other one which
is<00:02:12.620> my<00:02:12.800> favorite<00:02:13.340> cuz<00:02:13.970> optimal<00:02:14.570> really<00:02:14.870> solve

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
is my favorite cuz optimal really solve

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.380 
is my favorite cuz optimal really solve
so<00:02:17.450> we<00:02:17.630> did<00:02:17.810> look<00:02:17.960> like<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:20.330> don't

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
so we did look like this and I don't

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.840 
so we did look like this and I don't
know<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.900> know<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.800> more<00:02:22.010> softer<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
