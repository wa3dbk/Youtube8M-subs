00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
low-end response and finger noise now

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.230 
low-end response and finger noise now
we'll<00:01:57.710> move<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.010> mic<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.460> it's<00:01:58.730> directly

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
we'll move the mic so that it's directly

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.360 
we'll move the mic so that it's directly
in<00:01:59.360> front<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.050> sound<00:02:00.290> hole<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.770> ten

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.649 

this<00:02:29.040> position<00:02:29.610> will<00:02:29.879> reproduce<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.450> most

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
this position will reproduce the most

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.600 
this position will reproduce the most

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
base response from the guitar because

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.339 
base response from the guitar because
it's<00:02:32.790> pointed<00:02:33.120> directly<00:02:33.239> into<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> sound

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349
