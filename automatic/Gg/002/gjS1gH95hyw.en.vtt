sometimes of sucks because I look at
this<00:02:25.530> TBR<00:02:25.980> pile<00:02:26.190> behind<00:02:26.519> me<00:02:26.610> which<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.180> know

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
this TBR pile behind me which I know

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.940 
this TBR pile behind me which I know
this<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.690> lot<00:02:27.840> smaller<00:02:28.140> than<00:02:28.260> most<00:02:28.500> people's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this is a lot smaller than most people's
