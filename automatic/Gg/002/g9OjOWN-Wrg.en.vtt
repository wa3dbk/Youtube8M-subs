00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
them out they come out one at a time if

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.270 
them out they come out one at a time if
you<00:01:40.000> notice<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.390> air<00:01:40.510> flow<00:01:40.780> on<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.260> one<00:01:41.500> the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
you notice the air flow on this one the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.850 
you notice the air flow on this one the
arrow<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.670> pointing<00:01:43.030> up<00:01:43.350> which<00:01:44.350> means<00:01:44.590> the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
arrow is pointing up which means the

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.410 
arrow is pointing up which means the
factory<00:01:45.220> installed<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.700> filter<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:46.030> upside

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
factory installed the filter is upside

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.680 
factory installed the filter is upside
down<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:48.040> should<00:01:48.070> indeed<00:01:48.580> go<00:01:48.850> with<00:01:49.600> the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
down they should indeed go with the

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.469 
down they should indeed go with the
arrow<00:01:49.869> facing<00:01:50.170> down<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.890> I<00:01:51.820> proved<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.240> by

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
arrow facing down and I proved that by

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.940 
arrow facing down and I proved that by
sticking<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.840> piece<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.140> paper<00:01:53.260> in<00:01:53.530> there<00:01:53.680> and

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
sticking a piece of paper in there and
