00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
what we do once a year so that we can

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.830 
what we do once a year so that we can
get<00:00:31.260> their<00:00:31.830> CAE<00:00:32.279> tested<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.450> make<00:00:33.570> sure<00:00:33.719> that

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
get their CAE tested to make sure that

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.780 
get their CAE tested to make sure that
they're<00:00:34.020> still<00:00:34.140> negative<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:34.980> ours<00:00:35.579> have

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
they're still negative which ours have

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.130 
they're still negative which ours have
been<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.120> years<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
been for years but we just like to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.799 
been for years but we just like to
confirm<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.149> get<00:00:39.270> their<00:00:39.390> pregnancy

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
confirm it and to to get their pregnancy

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.590 
confirm it and to to get their pregnancy
tests<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.399> their<00:00:41.969> due<00:00:42.180> dates<00:00:42.390> because

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
tests so we know their due dates because

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.479 
tests so we know their due dates because
it's<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.079> helpful<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:44.070> cycle

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it's really helpful to know which cycle

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.200 
it's really helpful to know which cycle
they<00:00:44.610> took<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.219> anticipate

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
they took on and so we can anticipate

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
they took on and so we can anticipate
when<00:00:49.079> they're<00:00:49.230> gonna<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.500> their<00:00:49.620> babies<00:00:49.950> so

panini who is a buck and Bucks tend to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
panini who is a buck and Bucks tend to
be<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.619> difficult<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> can

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
be a little more difficult and you can

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
be a little more difficult and you can
see<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.450> takes<00:01:18.600> me<00:01:18.869> quite<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.259> while<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
see that it takes me quite a while to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
see that it takes me quite a while to
actually<00:01:19.770> find<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> vein<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.540> able<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
actually find the vein to be able to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.840 
actually find the vein to be able to
pull<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.369> bit<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> heads

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
pull it so just a little bit of a heads

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.700 
pull it so just a little bit of a heads
up<00:01:24.090> all<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> haven't<00:01:25.530> already

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
up all you do is if you haven't already

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.140 
up all you do is if you haven't already
shaved<00:01:26.009> them<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.520> shave<00:01:26.759> their<00:01:26.939> necks

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
shaved them you just shave their necks

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.499 
shaved them you just shave their necks
so<00:01:27.420> you've<00:01:27.540> got<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> nice<00:01:29.119> easier<00:01:30.119> way<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> be

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
so you've got a nice easier way to be

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
so you've got a nice easier way to be
able<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:30.990> where<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> vein<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.070> then

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
able to see where the vein is and then

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.190 
able to see where the vein is and then
you<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.210> hold<00:01:33.450> there<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.869> help<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you just kind of hold there to help the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.450 
you just kind of hold there to help the
vein<00:01:34.409> bulge<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.009> bit<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
vein bulge out a little bit and just

when you want to put the needle in you

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.080

want to go slightly up at an angle and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.490 
want to go slightly up at an angle and
not<00:01:45.270> directly<00:01:45.780> into<00:01:45.960> their<00:01:46.079> neck<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
not directly into their neck so that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.840 
not directly into their neck so that
you're<00:01:46.740> sure<00:01:46.770> you're<00:01:47.070> staying<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> vein

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
you're sure you're staying in the vein

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
you're sure you're staying in the vein
and<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.659> usually<00:01:48.780> go<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.259> about<00:01:49.380> 5<00:01:49.649> cc's<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and we usually go for about 5 cc's of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
and we usually go for about 5 cc's of
blood<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.329> don't<00:01:51.509> need<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.810> many

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
blood you really don't need that many

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660 
blood you really don't need that many
but<00:01:52.259> since<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.799> doing<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.280> want<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> make

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
but since I'm doing it I want to make

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.090 
but since I'm doing it I want to make
sure<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.750> enough<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
sure that I have enough and I just do it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.480 
sure that I have enough and I just do it
once

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
once

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.789 
once
also<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.570> tubes<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.170> get<00:01:58.350> are<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> red

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
also the tubes that we get are the red

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.340 
also the tubes that we get are the red
top<00:01:59.040> tubes<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.329> google<00:02:00.630> those<00:02:00.810> just

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
top tubes you can just google those just

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.139 
top tubes you can just google those just
Google<00:02:01.619> red<00:02:01.829> top<00:02:02.040> tubes<00:02:02.369> for<00:02:02.670> blood<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Google red top tubes for blood and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.480 
Google red top tubes for blood and
you'll<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.290> able<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.590> find<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.860> supplier<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.369> buy

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you'll be able to find a supplier we buy

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.430 
you'll be able to find a supplier we buy
them<00:02:05.729> 100

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
them 100

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.620 
them 100
I<00:02:06.470> think<00:02:06.800> they<00:02:06.890> cost<00:02:07.070> like<00:02:07.340> $25<00:02:08.180> or<00:02:08.330> something

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
I think they cost like $25 or something

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.170 
I think they cost like $25 or something
like<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.990> so<00:02:09.619> it's<00:02:10.010> really<00:02:10.400> not<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.670> difficult

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
like that so it's really not a difficult

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.910 
like that so it's really not a difficult
procedure<00:02:11.330> will<00:02:12.170> show<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.440> how<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:12.830> done

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
procedure will show you how it's done

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.840 
procedure will show you how it's done
and<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:14.150> hope<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.350> clears<00:02:16.040> everything<00:02:16.400> up<00:02:16.610> for

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
and I hope that clears everything up for

00:02:16.850 --> 00:03:40.490 
and I hope that clears everything up for
you<00:02:16.970> thanks<00:02:47.320> yeah<00:02:49.120> baggage<00:02:50.120> car<00:02:50.360> by<00:02:50.830> sexy<00:02:51.830> girl

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.990 

so<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.590> can<00:03:41.739> see<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.250> really<00:03:42.610> wasn't<00:03:42.790> that

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
so you can see that really wasn't that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.180 
so you can see that really wasn't that
hard<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.269> get<00:03:43.450> blood<00:03:43.690> all<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.440> do<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.920> once

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
hard to get blood all you do is once

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.560 
hard to get blood all you do is once
you're<00:03:45.340> done<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.670> put<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.120> red<00:03:46.360> top

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
you're done is put it in the red top
