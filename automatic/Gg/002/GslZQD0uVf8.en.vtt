00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.589 

ghost<00:00:08.010> movement<00:00:08.580> has<00:00:08.730> always<00:00:08.970> been<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> most

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
ghost movement has always been the most

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.410 
ghost movement has always been the most
complex<00:00:10.170> part<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.740> pac-man<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.969> original

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
complex part of pac-man in the original

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.839 
complex part of pac-man in the original
game<00:00:12.690> each<00:00:12.990> ghost<00:00:13.469> had<00:00:13.740> its<00:00:13.889> own<00:00:14.040> algorithm

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
game each ghost had its own algorithm

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.180 
game each ghost had its own algorithm
and<00:00:15.000> pattern<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.470> would<00:00:16.590> dictate<00:00:16.800> its

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
and pattern that would dictate its

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.859 
and pattern that would dictate its
behavior<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> maze<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.480> they<00:00:18.630> would<00:00:18.750> also

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
behavior in the maze and they would also

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.810 
behavior in the maze and they would also
go<00:00:19.140> through<00:00:19.380> phases<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.369> wandering

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
go through phases of just wandering

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390 
go through phases of just wandering
around<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.330> chasing<00:00:21.600> after<00:00:21.840> pac-man<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.619> of

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
around and chasing after pac-man all of

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400 
around and chasing after pac-man all of
that<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> bit<00:00:24.060> more<00:00:24.390> complex<00:00:24.960> than<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that is a bit more complex than the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.620 
that is a bit more complex than the
scope<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.890> these<00:00:26.010> videos<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.730> we're<00:00:27.480> just

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
scope of these videos so we're just

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.060 
scope of these videos so we're just
going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> settle<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.170> having<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> ghosts

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
going to settle for having the ghosts

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
going to settle for having the ghosts
randomly<00:00:29.580> wander<00:00:29.760> about<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:31.050> since<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.439> have

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
randomly wander about but since we have

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.370 
randomly wander about but since we have
separate<00:00:32.160> objects<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:33.000> each<00:00:33.239> ghost<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.230> can

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
separate objects for each ghost you can

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.139 
separate objects for each ghost you can
tweak<00:00:34.739> what<00:00:34.980> we're<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
tweak what we're going to do here and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.600 
tweak what we're going to do here and
give<00:00:36.750> them<00:00:36.989> individual<00:00:37.620> personalities<00:00:38.430> in

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
give them individual personalities in

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
give them individual personalities in
your<00:00:38.820> own<00:00:38.969> game<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> want<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.620> don't

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
your own game if you want now we don't

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
your own game if you want now we don't
just<00:00:40.950> want<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> give<00:00:41.370> them<00:00:41.610> completely<00:00:42.480> random

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
just want to give them completely random

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.270 
just want to give them completely random
movement<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.590> don't<00:00:43.890> want<00:00:44.070> them

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
movement because we don't want them

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
movement because we don't want them
turning<00:00:44.789> around<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.270> backwards

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
turning around and going backwards

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.779 
turning around and going backwards
we<00:00:46.320> only<00:00:46.469> want<00:00:46.739> them<00:00:46.920> moving<00:00:47.219> forwards

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
we only want them moving forwards

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.209 
we only want them moving forwards
throughout<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> maze<00:00:48.590> now<00:00:49.590> there<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> sort<00:00:50.160> of

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
throughout the maze now there is sort of

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.549 
throughout the maze now there is sort of
an<00:00:50.340> established<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.270> doing<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
an established way of doing this but I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.590 
an established way of doing this but I
ran<00:00:52.980> into<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:53.430> problems<00:00:53.579> trying<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
ran into some problems trying to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
ran into some problems trying to
implement<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.140> through<00:00:55.379> drag-and-drop<00:00:55.879> which

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
implement it through drag-and-drop which

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.270 
implement it through drag-and-drop which
would<00:00:57.180> cause<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.629> ghosts<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.770> randomly

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
would cause the ghosts to just randomly

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.119 
would cause the ghosts to just randomly
go<00:00:59.609> back<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.000> forth<00:01:00.270> before<00:01:00.780> moving<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.530> for

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
go back and forth before moving on for

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.549 
go back and forth before moving on for
some<00:01:02.280> reason<00:01:02.670> luckily<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> discovered<00:01:04.290> another

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
some reason luckily I discovered another

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.960 
some reason luckily I discovered another
way<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.920> doing<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.280> which<00:01:05.519> i<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:05.880> is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
way of doing this which i think is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270 
way of doing this which i think is
pretty<00:01:06.119> clever<00:01:06.799> basically<00:01:07.799> when<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> ghost

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
pretty clever basically when the ghost

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.550 
pretty clever basically when the ghost
comes<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.850> an<00:01:08.939> intersection<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.810> calculates<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
comes to an intersection it calculates a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
comes to an intersection it calculates a
number<00:01:10.950> based<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.850> which<00:01:12.090> pathways<00:01:12.689> before<00:01:13.200> it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
number based on which pathways before it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.370 
number based on which pathways before it
are<00:01:13.500> open<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> assuming<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> ghost<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.049> coming

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
are open so assuming a ghost is coming

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.830 
are open so assuming a ghost is coming
in<00:01:16.500> horizontally<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> wall

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
in horizontally if there is not a wall

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
in horizontally if there is not a wall
in<00:01:19.170> front<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> we'll<00:01:20.070> give<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> space<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
in front of it we'll give that space a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.390 
in front of it we'll give that space a
value<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.420> 3<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.960> there's<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> wall<00:01:23.070> below

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
value of 3 if there's not a wall below

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.340 
value of 3 if there's not a wall below
it<00:01:23.580> we'll<00:01:23.850> give<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.210> value<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> 1<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it we'll give that a value of 1 and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.550 
it we'll give that a value of 1 and
above<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.640> give<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> value<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.360> 5<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.409> it's

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
above it will give a value of 5 so it's

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.859 
above it will give a value of 5 so it's
going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> add<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> numbers<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
going to add up all the numbers of the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.960 
going to add up all the numbers of the
spaces<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.590> open<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.130> move<00:01:32.460> according

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
spaces that are open and move according

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.210 
spaces that are open and move according
to<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.020> example<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.619> only<00:01:34.950> forward

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
to that so for example if only forward

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.240 
to that so for example if only forward
is<00:01:35.520> open<00:01:35.939> we'll<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> number<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.990> 3<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.500> only

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
is open we'll get a number of 3 if only

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.300 
is open we'll get a number of 3 if only
down<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.729> number<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.270> 1<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.750> will<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> number<00:01:41.009> 5

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
down a number of 1 up will be a number 5

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.539 
down a number of 1 up will be a number 5
if<00:01:41.780> forward<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.020> down<00:01:43.200> are<00:01:43.470> available<00:01:44.100> we'll

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
if forward and down are available we'll

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.330 
if forward and down are available we'll
get<00:01:44.729> 4<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> forward<00:01:46.619> are<00:01:46.860> available

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
get 4 if up and forward are available

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.940 
get 4 if up and forward are available
we'll<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.640> 8<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.119> only<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.409> down<00:01:49.500> are

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
we'll get 8 if only up and down are

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.310 
we'll get 8 if only up and down are
available<00:01:50.430> we'll<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.729> 6<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.170> them

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
available we'll get 6 and if all of them

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.770 
available we'll get 6 and if all of them
are<00:01:52.439> available<00:01:52.560> we'll<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.280> 9<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.790> none<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
are available we'll get 9 if none of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
are available we'll get 9 if none of
them<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.170> available<00:01:55.259> we'll<00:01:55.979> get<00:01:56.130> 0<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
them are available we'll get 0 and the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.959 
them are available we'll get 0 and the
ghost<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:57.960> back<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> way<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> came

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
ghost will just go back the way it came

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:05.660 
ghost will just go back the way it came
so<00:01:59.969> open<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> object<00:02:00.750> ghost<00:02:01.380> parent<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:04.670> this

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so open the object ghost parent and this

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.600 
so open the object ghost parent and this
is<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.240> include<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:07.020> lot<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.740> actions<00:02:08.310> so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
is going to include a lot of actions so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.400 
is going to include a lot of actions so
I'm<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> make<00:02:09.179> heavy<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.750> comments

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I'm going to make heavy use of comments

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.589 
I'm going to make heavy use of comments
the<00:02:11.069> first<00:02:11.280> thing<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.580> need<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> do<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.180> make<00:02:12.480> an

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
the first thing we need to do is make an

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.500 
the first thing we need to do is make an
alarm<00:02:12.959> that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
alarm that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.869 
alarm that
is<00:02:13.599> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.959> reset<00:02:14.470> our<00:02:14.500> ghost<00:02:14.980> either<00:02:15.640> at

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
is going to reset our ghost either at

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.580 
is going to reset our ghost either at
the<00:02:15.970> beginning<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.569> level<00:02:16.720> or<00:02:17.049> when<00:02:17.470> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the beginning of the level or when it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.440 
the beginning of the level or when it
changes<00:02:17.980> from<00:02:18.099> an<00:02:18.280> afraid<00:02:18.579> ghost<00:02:18.909> into<00:02:19.239> a

changes from an afraid ghost into a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.440 
changes from an afraid ghost into a

close the object message now we'll set

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.199 
close the object message now we'll set
up<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.530> framework<00:03:14.799> for<00:03:15.159> making<00:03:15.400> our<00:03:15.760> ghosts

up the framework for making our ghosts
move<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:17.200> let's<00:03:17.349> add<00:03:17.500> an<00:03:17.620> event<00:03:18.239> step<00:03:19.239> and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
move so let's add an event step and

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.319 
move so let's add an event step and
we're<00:03:20.530> going<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.769> choose<00:03:20.949> end<00:03:21.220> step<00:03:21.699> every

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
we're going to choose end step every

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.300 
we're going to choose end step every
step<00:03:22.359> game<00:03:22.870> maker<00:03:23.169> tries<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.709> do<00:03:23.829> all<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.099> the

step game maker tries to do all of the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.059 
step game maker tries to do all of the

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
actions that it can in a specific order

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.490 
actions that it can in a specific order
by<00:03:27.790> telling<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.299> go<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.840> end<00:03:29.049> of<00:03:29.379> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
by telling it to go to the end of the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.470 
by telling it to go to the end of the
step<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.129> is<00:03:30.310> putting<00:03:30.549> all<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.030> actions

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
step this is putting all of the actions

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.559 
step this is putting all of the actions
here<00:03:31.900> after<00:03:32.680> most<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.370> other<00:03:33.579> events<00:03:34.419> have

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
here after most of the other events have

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.839 
here after most of the other events have
been<00:03:34.900> calculated<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:36.220> first<00:03:36.400> thing<00:03:36.609> we<00:03:36.699> need

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
been calculated the first thing we need

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.339 
been calculated the first thing we need
to<00:03:36.879> do<00:03:37.090> before<00:03:37.239> we<00:03:37.449> move<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.930> make<00:03:38.169> sure<00:03:38.199> that

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
to do before we move is make sure that

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.050 
to do before we move is make sure that
we're<00:03:38.590> aligned<00:03:38.889> to<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.099> grid<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.879> we

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
we're aligned to the grid and that we

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.920 
we're aligned to the grid and that we
can<00:03:40.359> actually<00:03:40.810> move<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.379> come<00:03:42.160> check<00:03:42.400> grid<00:03:42.930> set

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
can actually move so come check grid set

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.099 
can actually move so come check grid set
this<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.230> 32<00:03:44.650> by<00:03:44.859> 32<00:03:45.750> then<00:03:46.750> we'll<00:03:46.900> test

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
this to 32 by 32 then we'll test

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.140 
this to 32 by 32 then we'll test
variable<00:03:47.590> see<00:03:48.370> if<00:03:48.519> global<00:03:49.389> dot<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:51.250> move<00:03:51.790> is

variable see if global dot can move is
equal<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.959> true<00:03:53.169> we're<00:03:53.799> going<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.949> bring<00:03:54.099> in

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
equal to true we're going to bring in

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.189 
equal to true we're going to bring in
some<00:03:54.400> blocks<00:03:54.669> and<00:03:54.940> because<00:03:55.750> there<00:03:55.900> are<00:03:55.930> going

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
some blocks and because there are going

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.229 
some blocks and because there are going
to<00:03:56.290> be<00:03:56.349> a<00:03:56.590> lot<00:03:56.919> of<00:03:57.069> actions<00:03:57.549> in<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:57.849> event

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
to be a lot of actions in this event

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.020 
to be a lot of actions in this event
with<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:58.959> lot<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.260> blocks<00:03:59.769> I'm<00:04:00.489> going<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.849> make

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
with a lot of blocks I'm going to make

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.430 
with a lot of blocks I'm going to make
heavy<00:04:01.239> use<00:04:01.329> of<00:04:01.449> comments<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.109> we<00:04:02.169> don't<00:04:02.349> get

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
heavy use of comments so we don't get

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.930 
heavy use of comments so we don't get
confused<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:02.980> I'm<00:04:03.040> going<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.220> drag<00:04:03.400> one<00:04:03.609> in<00:04:03.730> now

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
confused so I'm going to drag one in now

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.599 
confused so I'm going to drag one in now
and<00:04:04.269> just<00:04:05.019> say<00:04:05.260> that<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.680> is<00:04:05.949> the<00:04:06.159> end<00:04:06.370> of

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
and just say that this is the end of

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.159 
and just say that this is the end of
everything

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
everything

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.349 
everything
then<00:04:08.169> I'm<00:04:08.440> going<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.859> update<00:04:09.609> its<00:04:09.819> movements

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
then I'm going to update its movements

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.129 
then I'm going to update its movements
so<00:04:10.510> come<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.810> move<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.729> move<00:04:12.729> free<00:04:13.120> put<00:04:13.989> that

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
so come to move and move free put that

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.830 
so come to move and move free put that
above<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.500> end<00:04:14.650> all<00:04:15.000> we<00:04:16.000> will<00:04:16.209> set<00:04:16.750> the

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
above the end all we will set the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.020 
above the end all we will set the
direction<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.440> its<00:04:17.620> current<00:04:18.310> direction<00:04:18.880> and

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
direction to its current direction and

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.620 
direction to its current direction and
its<00:04:19.359> speed<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:20.039> ghost<00:04:21.039> speed<00:04:21.489> whenever<00:04:22.360> you

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
its speed to ghost speed whenever you

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.230 
its speed to ghost speed whenever you
use<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.169> move<00:04:23.500> fixed<00:04:23.979> or<00:04:24.130> move<00:04:24.310> free<00:04:24.669> it<00:04:24.849> sets

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
use the move fixed or move free it sets

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.500 
use the move fixed or move free it sets
that<00:04:25.419> direction<00:04:25.930> and

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
that direction and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.960 
that direction and
speed<00:04:26.750> as<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.260> constant<00:04:27.860> meaning<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:28.820> will

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
speed as a constant meaning that it will

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.670 
speed as a constant meaning that it will
not<00:04:29.060> change<00:04:29.480> unless<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.930> put<00:04:30.260> in<00:04:30.380> another

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
not change unless you put in another

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.670 
not change unless you put in another
action<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.370> update<00:04:31.730> it<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:33.080> every<00:04:33.350> step

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
action to update it and so every step

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.620 
action to update it and so every step
we're<00:04:33.920> going<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.160> be<00:04:34.340> updating<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.480> make

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
we're going to be updating that to make

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.050 
we're going to be updating that to make
sure<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:36.650> we<00:04:36.860> are<00:04:37.010> moving<00:04:37.370> as<00:04:37.490> we<00:04:37.700> should<00:04:37.760> be

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
sure that we are moving as we should be

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.440 
sure that we are moving as we should be
we<00:04:38.600> also<00:04:38.780> want<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.110> reset<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.330> mechanism<00:04:41.330> that

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
we also want to reset the mechanism that

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.450 
we also want to reset the mechanism that
I<00:04:41.510> talked<00:04:41.780> about<00:04:41.900> earlier<00:04:42.050> with<00:04:42.830> choosing<00:04:43.250> our

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
I talked about earlier with choosing our

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.790 
I talked about earlier with choosing our
direction<00:04:43.730> so<00:04:44.000> come<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.390> control<00:04:44.800> set

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
direction so come to control set

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.900 
direction so come to control set
variable<00:04:46.280> we'll<00:04:47.180> set<00:04:47.890> which<00:04:48.890> way<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:51.140> zero<00:04:51.910> so

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
variable we'll set which way to zero so

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.880 
variable we'll set which way to zero so
now<00:04:53.060> every<00:04:53.390> step<00:04:53.660> it'll<00:04:53.840> have<00:04:54.170> a<00:04:54.200> clean<00:04:54.560> slate

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
now every step it'll have a clean slate

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.190 
now every step it'll have a clean slate
for<00:04:54.950> calculating<00:04:55.760> but<00:04:56.300> to<00:04:56.420> get<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.810> proper

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
for calculating but to get the proper

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.720 
for calculating but to get the proper
calculation<00:04:57.410> we<00:04:57.920> have<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.190> determine<00:04:58.460> if

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
calculation we have to determine if

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.450 
calculation we have to determine if
we're<00:04:58.880> moving<00:04:59.000> horizontally<00:04:59.270> or<00:04:59.900> vertically

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
we're moving horizontally or vertically

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.620 
we're moving horizontally or vertically
so<00:05:01.460> I'm<00:05:01.520> going<00:05:01.640> to<00:05:01.700> bring<00:05:01.790> in<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:01.970> comment<00:05:02.420> and

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
so I'm going to bring in a comment and

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.120 
so I'm going to bring in a comment and
this<00:05:03.380> is<00:05:03.500> going<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.770> be<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.070> beginning<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.580> the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
this is going to be the beginning of the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.150 
this is going to be the beginning of the
horizontal<00:05:07.540> movement<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:08.720> to<00:05:09.590> determine<00:05:09.920> if

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
horizontal movement and to determine if

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.560 
horizontal movement and to determine if
we<00:05:10.280> are<00:05:10.310> moving<00:05:10.700> horizontally<00:05:10.820> we'll<00:05:11.420> bring

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
we are moving horizontally we'll bring

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.910 
we are moving horizontally we'll bring
in<00:05:11.720> a<00:05:11.810> test<00:05:12.020> variable<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:12.670> we<00:05:13.670> will<00:05:13.820> test<00:05:14.030> V

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
in a test variable and we will test V

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.060 
in a test variable and we will test V
speed<00:05:16.060> being<00:05:17.060> equal<00:05:17.480> to<00:05:17.510> zero<00:05:17.840> because<00:05:18.800> if

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
speed being equal to zero because if

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.770 
speed being equal to zero because if
there<00:05:19.220> is<00:05:19.310> no<00:05:19.550> vertical<00:05:19.790> speed<00:05:20.240> then<00:05:20.480> we<00:05:20.600> must

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
there is no vertical speed then we must

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.350 
there is no vertical speed then we must
be<00:05:20.870> moving<00:05:21.200> horizontally<00:05:21.460> we'll<00:05:22.460> also<00:05:22.640> set<00:05:23.120> a

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
be moving horizontally we'll also set a

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.200 
be moving horizontally we'll also set a
comment<00:05:23.780> as<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:24.740> placeholder<00:05:25.070> for<00:05:25.430> when<00:05:25.820> we<00:05:25.970> do

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
comment as a placeholder for when we do

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.660 
comment as a placeholder for when we do
our<00:05:26.240> vertical<00:05:26.810> movement<00:05:27.380> code<00:05:27.590> but<00:05:28.520> now<00:05:28.610> to

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
our vertical movement code but now to

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.790 
our vertical movement code but now to
determine<00:05:28.970> if<00:05:29.360> we're<00:05:29.480> moving<00:05:29.750> vertically<00:05:30.140> we

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
determine if we're moving vertically we

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.190 
determine if we're moving vertically we
don't<00:05:30.980> have<00:05:31.130> to<00:05:31.340> set<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.820> test<00:05:32.180> for<00:05:32.450> H<00:05:32.750> speed

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
don't have to set a test for H speed

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.440 
don't have to set a test for H speed
being<00:05:33.380> equal<00:05:33.770> to<00:05:33.860> zero<00:05:34.100> we<00:05:34.880> can<00:05:35.000> just<00:05:35.150> use<00:05:35.300> this

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
being equal to zero we can just use this

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.570 
being equal to zero we can just use this
one<00:05:35.510> right<00:05:35.840> here<00:05:36.200> because<00:05:36.860> in<00:05:37.040> this<00:05:37.250> test

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
one right here because in this test

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.550 
one right here because in this test
there<00:05:37.790> are<00:05:37.820> only<00:05:38.090> two<00:05:38.390> outcomes<00:05:38.630> either<00:05:39.170> V

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
there are only two outcomes either V

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.800 
there are only two outcomes either V
speed<00:05:39.920> is<00:05:40.070> equal<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.520> zero<00:05:40.760> or<00:05:41.060> it<00:05:41.420> isn't<00:05:41.540> and

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
speed is equal to zero or it isn't and

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.450 
speed is equal to zero or it isn't and
if<00:05:42.410> it<00:05:42.560> isn't<00:05:42.860> then<00:05:43.010> we<00:05:43.160> are<00:05:43.280> moving

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
if it isn't then we are moving

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.210 
if it isn't then we are moving
vertically<00:05:44.110> so<00:05:45.110> we'll<00:05:45.230> just<00:05:45.410> come<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:45.920> use<00:05:46.040> an

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
vertically so we'll just come and use an

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.040 
vertically so we'll just come and use an
else<00:05:46.430> to<00:05:47.150> tell<00:05:47.360> us<00:05:47.480> that<00:05:47.630> we<00:05:47.750> are<00:05:47.840> moving

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
else to tell us that we are moving

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.650 
else to tell us that we are moving
vertically<00:05:48.790> okay<00:05:49.790> so<00:05:49.850> now<00:05:50.120> we<00:05:50.180> need<00:05:50.330> to<00:05:50.390> draw

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
vertically okay so now we need to draw

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.200 
vertically okay so now we need to draw
some<00:05:51.020> blocks<00:05:51.560> underneath<00:05:51.920> the<00:05:52.430> vertical

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
some blocks underneath the vertical

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.960 
some blocks underneath the vertical
speed<00:05:53.390> test<00:05:53.860> I'm<00:05:54.860> also<00:05:55.160> going<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:55.490> put<00:05:55.700> in<00:05:55.790> a

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
speed test I'm also going to put in a

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.150 
speed test I'm also going to put in a
comment<00:05:56.240> to<00:05:57.110> tell<00:05:57.140> me<00:05:57.350> that<00:05:57.560> this<00:05:57.710> is<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:57.890> end

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
comment to tell me that this is the end

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.840 
comment to tell me that this is the end
of<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:59.390> horizontal<00:05:59.660> movement<00:06:00.170> and<00:06:00.730> for<00:06:01.730> right

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
of the horizontal movement and for right

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.970 
of the horizontal movement and for right
now<00:06:01.880> I'm<00:06:02.180> just<00:06:02.210> going<00:06:02.570> to<00:06:02.660> comment<00:06:03.020> out<00:06:03.380> the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
now I'm just going to comment out the

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.770 
now I'm just going to comment out the
various<00:06:04.370> actions<00:06:04.910> that<00:06:05.210> we<00:06:05.330> will<00:06:05.480> have<00:06:05.630> to

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
various actions that we will have to

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.120 
various actions that we will have to
check<00:06:05.960> for<00:06:06.170> so<00:06:06.350> the<00:06:06.440> first<00:06:06.620> thing<00:06:06.800> we<00:06:06.890> need<00:06:07.010> to

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
check for so the first thing we need to

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.480 
check for so the first thing we need to
look<00:06:07.250> for<00:06:07.550> is<00:06:08.440> whether<00:06:09.440> or<00:06:09.650> not<00:06:09.740> there<00:06:10.070> is<00:06:10.100> an

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
look for is whether or not there is an

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.570 
look for is whether or not there is an
open<00:06:10.850> position<00:06:11.030> so<00:06:12.010> this<00:06:13.010> will<00:06:13.190> be<00:06:13.280> where<00:06:13.460> we

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
open position so this will be where we

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.880 
open position so this will be where we
check<00:06:13.910> for<00:06:14.210> an<00:06:14.300> open<00:06:15.550> position<00:06:17.770> after<00:06:18.770> we've

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
check for an open position after we've

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.370 
check for an open position after we've
done<00:06:18.920> that<00:06:19.130> and<00:06:19.520> calculated<00:06:20.480> our<00:06:20.720> whichway

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
done that and calculated our whichway

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.500 
done that and calculated our whichway
total<00:06:21.830> we<00:06:21.950> then<00:06:22.130> need<00:06:22.340> to<00:06:22.370> check<00:06:22.730> what<00:06:23.330> that

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
total we then need to check what that

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.880 
total we then need to check what that
number<00:06:23.810> is<00:06:24.020> so<00:06:24.380> let's<00:06:24.530> bring<00:06:24.680> in<00:06:24.830> another

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
number is so let's bring in another

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.010 
number is so let's bring in another
comment<00:06:25.520> after<00:06:25.850> this<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:26.270> this<00:06:26.570> is<00:06:26.720> where<00:06:26.900> we

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
comment after this and this is where we

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.150 
comment after this and this is where we
will<00:06:27.340> check<00:06:28.630> which<00:06:29.630> way<00:06:29.900> so<00:06:30.710> now<00:06:30.800> we<00:06:30.860> just<00:06:31.070> need

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
will check which way so now we just need

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.070 
will check which way so now we just need
to<00:06:31.340> think<00:06:31.490> about<00:06:31.700> the<00:06:31.970> various<00:06:32.360> possibilities

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
to think about the various possibilities

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.600 
to think about the various possibilities
that<00:06:33.590> this<00:06:33.710> can<00:06:33.980> result<00:06:34.550> in<00:06:34.910> so<00:06:35.320> we<00:06:36.320> can<00:06:36.470> have

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
that this can result in so we can have

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:46.030 
that this can result in so we can have
for<00:06:38.610> word<00:06:38.820> being<00:06:39.180> open<00:06:40.130> we<00:06:41.130> could<00:06:41.310> have<00:06:42.200> down

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.760 

up

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
up

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:56.200 
up
we<00:06:49.770> could<00:06:49.950> have<00:06:52.250> forward<00:06:53.250> and<00:06:53.460> down

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
we could have forward and down

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:06.130 
we could have forward and down
we<00:06:57.210> could<00:06:57.360> have<00:06:58.070> forward<00:06:59.070> and<00:06:59.340> up<00:07:02.570> up<00:07:03.570> and<00:07:03.960> down

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140 
we could have forward and up up and down

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.080 
we could have forward and up up and down
we<00:07:07.140> could<00:07:07.290> have<00:07:07.500> our<00:07:07.950> three-way<00:07:08.670> intersection

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
we could have our three-way intersection

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.470 
we could have our three-way intersection
and<00:07:09.830> there's<00:07:10.830> a<00:07:10.890> possibility<00:07:11.340> that<00:07:11.700> none<00:07:12.450> of

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
and there's a possibility that none of

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.200 
and there's a possibility that none of
them<00:07:12.720> will<00:07:13.260> be<00:07:13.380> open<00:07:13.710> we<00:07:14.310> won't<00:07:14.550> focus<00:07:14.730> on<00:07:15.060> the

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
them will be open we won't focus on the

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.760 
them will be open we won't focus on the
vertical<00:07:15.510> stuff<00:07:15.870> right<00:07:16.080> now<00:07:16.140> because<00:07:16.620> we'll

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
vertical stuff right now because we'll

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.350 
vertical stuff right now because we'll
pretty<00:07:16.980> much<00:07:17.160> just<00:07:17.460> copy<00:07:17.790> and<00:07:18.030> paste

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
pretty much just copy and paste

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.080 
pretty much just copy and paste
everything<00:07:18.810> that<00:07:18.960> we<00:07:19.050> do<00:07:19.170> here<00:07:19.790> but<00:07:20.790> now<00:07:20.910> we've

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
everything that we do here but now we've

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.420 
everything that we do here but now we've
laid<00:07:21.330> out<00:07:21.480> the<00:07:21.660> framework<00:07:21.960> for<00:07:22.890> everything

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
laid out the framework for everything

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.370 
laid out the framework for everything
that<00:07:23.610> we<00:07:23.700> need<00:07:23.850> to<00:07:23.880> test<00:07:24.180> for<00:07:24.450> since<00:07:25.170> that's

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 
that we need to test for since that's

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.870 
that we need to test for since that's
going<00:07:25.590> to<00:07:25.680> be<00:07:25.770> a<00:07:25.800> bit<00:07:26.010> of<00:07:26.100> a<00:07:26.160> long<00:07:26.340> video<00:07:26.700> I

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 
going to be a bit of a long video I

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.730 
going to be a bit of a long video I
think<00:07:27.120> we<00:07:27.390> can<00:07:27.510> pause<00:07:27.720> it<00:07:27.750> here<00:07:28.110> and<00:07:28.290> we'll

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
think we can pause it here and we'll

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.850 
think we can pause it here and we'll
pick<00:07:28.890> it<00:07:28.950> up<00:07:29.100> in<00:07:29.310> the<00:07:29.460> next<00:07:29.670> one
