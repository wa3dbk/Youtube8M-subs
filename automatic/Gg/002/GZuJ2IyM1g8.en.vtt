00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.169 

hi<00:00:01.199> I'm<00:00:01.380> Kelly<00:00:01.680> at<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.920> getty<00:00:02.159> museum<00:00:02.340> and<00:00:02.939> i'm

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hi I'm Kelly at the getty museum and i'm

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.260 
hi I'm Kelly at the getty museum and i'm
going<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.419> show<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:03.600> how<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.870> draw<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> tree

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
going to show you how to draw a tree

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.909 
going to show you how to draw a tree
okay<00:00:06.270> first<00:00:06.810> I'm<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.259> start<00:00:07.560> with<00:00:07.859> the

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
okay first I'm going to start with the

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.860 
okay first I'm going to start with the
trunk<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:09.860> then<00:00:12.019> move<00:00:13.019> up<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.469> branches

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
trunk and then move up to the branches

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.570 
trunk and then move up to the branches
so<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.929> get<00:00:16.080> towards<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> top<00:00:16.680> branches<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
so I get towards the top branches the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.490 
so I get towards the top branches the
lines<00:00:17.820> get<00:00:18.090> lighter<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.660> thinner<00:00:21.500> doesn't

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
lines get lighter and thinner doesn't

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.720 
lines get lighter and thinner doesn't
really<00:00:22.619> matter<00:00:22.830> where<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> branches<00:00:23.519> go

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
really matter where the branches go

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
really matter where the branches go
because<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.420> covered<00:00:24.750> by<00:00:24.900> leaves<00:00:30.439> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
because they are covered by leaves and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:42.920 
because they are covered by leaves and
then<00:00:31.529> I'll<00:00:31.679> color<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
then I'll color that and I'm going to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
then I'll color that and I'm going to
blow<00:00:43.170> some<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> extra<00:00:44.040> chocolate<00:00:44.520> dust

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
blow some of the extra chocolate dust

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.290 
blow some of the extra chocolate dust
off<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.300> paper<00:00:46.520> now<00:00:47.520> I'll<00:00:47.700> look<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> top

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
off the paper now I'll look at the top

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.670 
off the paper now I'll look at the top
of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.600> tree<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.500> start<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.850> generally

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
of the tree and start very generally

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.369 
of the tree and start very generally
making<00:00:52.680> shaded<00:00:53.670> area<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.750> same<00:00:55.020> shape

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
making shaded area in the same shape

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.869 
making shaded area in the same shape
because<00:00:55.590> all<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> branches<00:00:59.809> on<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.989> side

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
because all the branches on this side

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.190 
because all the branches on this side
doesn't<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.390> perfect

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.040 

and<00:01:08.200> then<00:01:08.320> I'll<00:01:08.410> just<00:01:08.440> show<00:01:08.800> you<00:01:09.390> holy<00:01:10.390> French

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
and then I'll just show you holy French

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:21.780 
and then I'll just show you holy French
area<00:01:16.590> I'll<00:01:17.590> take<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.800> Kleenex<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:19.230> blend<00:01:20.790> all

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
area I'll take a Kleenex and blend all

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:35.160 
area I'll take a Kleenex and blend all
the<00:01:21.850> branch<00:01:22.240> areas

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.289 

and<00:01:36.170> again<00:01:36.439> I'll<00:01:36.679> blow<00:01:36.950> off<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:38.060> extra

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
and again I'll blow off the extra

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.459 
and again I'll blow off the extra
charcoal<00:01:38.899> dust<00:01:40.840> now<00:01:41.840> i'll<00:01:42.049> look<00:01:42.200> for<00:01:42.439> the

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
charcoal dust now i'll look for the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.410 
charcoal dust now i'll look for the
negative<00:01:42.950> space<00:01:43.100> in<00:01:43.579> between<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.240> branches

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
negative space in between the branches

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.990 
negative space in between the branches
of<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.899> trees<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.679> i'm<00:01:46.250> going<00:01:46.459> to<00:01:46.520> use<00:01:46.700> a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
of the trees and i'm going to use a

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.609 
of the trees and i'm going to use a
kneaded<00:01:47.569> eraser<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:50.329> take<00:01:50.630> away<00:01:50.899> some<00:01:51.439> of<00:01:51.469> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
kneaded eraser to take away some of the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:04.480 
kneaded eraser to take away some of the
charcoal

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.999 

now<00:02:05.030> I'm<00:02:05.090> going<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.329> take<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.509> fresh<00:02:05.810> pencil<00:02:06.320> and

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
now I'm going to take a fresh pencil and

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.220 
now I'm going to take a fresh pencil and
go<00:02:07.159> back<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.840> add<00:02:09.770> some<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.340> details

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
go back in and add some of the details

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.550 
go back in and add some of the details
from<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.380> branches<00:02:12.709> underneath<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:14.239> then

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
from the branches underneath and then

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.339 
from the branches underneath and then
all<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:17.420> needles<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:18.739> top<00:02:19.930> just<00:02:20.930> using

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
all of the needles on top just using

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.309 
all of the needles on top just using
some<00:02:21.500> scratchy<00:02:21.890> lines<00:02:22.310> nothing<00:02:23.060> too<00:02:23.480> specific

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.410 

and<00:02:27.319> again<00:02:27.590> I'm<00:02:27.709> following<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.370> edge<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
and again I'm following the edge of the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.330 
and again I'm following the edge of the
tree<00:02:32.750> with<00:02:33.019> my<00:02:33.170> eyes<00:02:34.420> making<00:02:35.420> sure<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:35.870> to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
tree with my eyes making sure not to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.979 
tree with my eyes making sure not to
draw<00:02:37.340> over<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.880> negative<00:02:38.269> spaces<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:38.930> I

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
draw over the negative spaces that I

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.570 
draw over the negative spaces that I
just<00:02:39.319> read<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:44.049> few<00:02:45.049> extra<00:02:45.350> details<00:02:46.010> around<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
just read a few extra details around the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.890 
just read a few extra details around the
edges<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:51.590> touch<00:02:51.890> up<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.190> edges<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.660> that's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
edges just touch up the edges and that's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:09.430 
edges just touch up the edges and that's
it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.500 

you
