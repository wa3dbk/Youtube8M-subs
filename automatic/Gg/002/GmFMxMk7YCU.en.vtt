00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
in Assassin's Creed 3 stating that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.420 
in Assassin's Creed 3 stating that
Connor<00:02:02.570> should<00:02:02.840> visit<00:02:02.990> Paris<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:04.010> current

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
theory is that the assassin himself

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.339 
theory is that the assassin himself
maybe<00:02:06.920> Connor<00:02:07.460> going<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.030> Paris<00:02:08.420> while<00:02:09.200> this

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
maybe Connor going to Paris while this

maybe Connor going to Paris while this

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
theory is a fun idea is almost debunked

Connors work is actually still in

Connors work is actually still in
America<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:23.060> does<00:02:23.300> fall<00:02:23.569> in<00:02:23.720> line<00:02:23.930> with

their rebuilt in Connors name now the
second<00:02:51.319> theory<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.650> see<00:02:51.890> going<00:02:52.099> around<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.579> that

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
second theory I see going around is that

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.220 
second theory I see going around is that
we<00:02:52.819> are<00:02:52.940> somehow<00:02:53.120> going<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.480> get<00:02:53.660> Desmond<00:02:54.079> back

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
we are somehow going to get Desmond back

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.500 
we are somehow going to get Desmond back

because back in AC Brotherhood and once

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.120 
because back in AC Brotherhood and once
again<00:02:56.660> mentioned<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.319> finals<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.739> ac4

again mentioned in the finals in ac4
there<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> French<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.720> send<00:02:59.959> in<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.319> Des

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
there is a French to send in in Des

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.069 
there is a French to send in in Des
men's<00:03:00.799> bloodline<00:03:01.250> but<00:03:01.940> honestly<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.510> feel<00:03:02.930> that

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
men's bloodline but honestly I feel that

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.150 
men's bloodline but honestly I feel that
this<00:03:03.230> theory<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.650> coming<00:03:03.980> from<00:03:04.069> the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
this theory is coming from the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.699 
this theory is coming from the
uninformed<00:03:04.660> desmond<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.720> basically<00:03:06.200> done<00:03:06.379> and

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
uninformed desmond is basically done and

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.259 
uninformed desmond is basically done and
it<00:03:06.860> has<00:03:06.980> been<00:03:07.010> stated<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.640> they<00:03:07.790> have<00:03:07.910> all<00:03:08.090> of

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
it has been stated that they have all of

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.089 
it has been stated that they have all of
his<00:03:08.360> memories<00:03:08.540> downloaded<00:03:09.319> how<00:03:09.709> else<00:03:09.950> would

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
his memories downloaded how else would

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.160 
his memories downloaded how else would
we<00:03:10.250> live<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.579> life<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.849> edward<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.840> there

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
we live the life of edward so there

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.630 
we live the life of edward so there
could<00:03:12.470> be<00:03:12.500> another<00:03:12.860> french<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.310> send<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.579> in

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
could be another french to send it in

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.490 
could be another french to send it in
the<00:03:13.730> bloodline<00:03:14.180> but<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.810> really<00:03:15.049> doesn't<00:03:15.290> need

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the bloodline but it really doesn't need

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.289 
the bloodline but it really doesn't need
to<00:03:15.680> be<00:03:15.829> through<00:03:16.250> desmond<00:03:16.790> we<00:03:16.970> could<00:03:17.120> very

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
to be through desmond we could very

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.970 
to be through desmond we could very
easily<00:03:17.360> download<00:03:18.079> those<00:03:18.230> into<00:03:18.500> somebody<00:03:18.799> else

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
easily download those into somebody else

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.819 
easily download those into somebody else
just<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.549> we<00:03:19.700> just<00:03:19.970> did<00:03:20.090> with<00:03:20.329> Edward<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
just like we just did with Edward so the

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.199 
just like we just did with Edward so the
last<00:03:22.010> thing<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.370> want<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.670> bring<00:03:22.790> up<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.090> the

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
last thing I want to bring up is the

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.539 
last thing I want to bring up is the
fact<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.900> teaser<00:03:24.400> matches<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
fact that this teaser matches the

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.670 
fact that this teaser matches the
original<00:03:25.670> trailer<00:03:26.299> way<00:03:26.900> back<00:03:27.200> at<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.470> first

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680
