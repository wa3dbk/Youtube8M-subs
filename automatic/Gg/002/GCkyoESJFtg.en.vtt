 in the field this content 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.370
 in 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.090
 so even if I'm going to search 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.040

 in the sindh document 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.649
 in the folder the goal is to be able 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.549

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:35.970
 search 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.450
 the program 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.460
 so for a dose of this finds two programs microsoft hocus pocus does not know 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 and why but I also find 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.179

 the document relay 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.969
 who comes out of a year the library 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.429
 document 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.980
 you can record

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.779
 I do it 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.219
 recorded 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.870
 medical research for that to take 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.179
 six weeks ago 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.620
 and give him no name 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.759
 he is sincere 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.260
 he hears the favorites 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.100
 we see a search called m species 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.449
 for salt mines 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.340
 go to the start menu 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.680

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.859
 with him 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.740
 you too put the computer 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.070
 together they go 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.749
 change of face 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.230
 to restart 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.709
 put to sleep 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.709
 disconnected the user 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.060
 in a few hours in the morning 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.009
 it is possible that m klose 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.719
 and that updates arthur 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.550
 we do this 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.470
 by the smaller the drawing for installation 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.659
 there is on the button 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:16.489
 helped 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.119
 gold in this case 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:23.209
 it flickers the beta version or more sparks every lady 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.299
 in this case to produce then 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.039
 the several phases 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.239
 the course for them 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.040
 come 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 with five full actions of the computer 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.769
 I am now going to the process 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.569
 at the installation of dollars 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.059
 in the software 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:49.859
 it moves it sings leucate green leu sion for which can then 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:50.919
 distribute 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.279
 in 2002 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:54.879
 in driver 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.139
 people walked meters 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.419
 the different folders to find 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.099
 the installer better 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.199
 most 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.630
 there ap tim and 5 abstentions 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.759
 at worst 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.379
 yes you ask permission 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.459
 so the wants to give a name to the user 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.799
 the number 7 already registered 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.679
 even on the same support 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.090
 so the same thing thing for you 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.959
 the meaning m 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.959
 so normally 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.069
 while the standard installation anderlecht will go 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:28.259
 program 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.710

 cloudy rhymes 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.680
 in plain 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.979
 backup 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.289
 the challenge for fans has more weight 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.139
 the resort r 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.379
 of the thing 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.379
 on this corner 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.379
 here is the restoration 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.699
 the hair pursued 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.560
 normally the horns 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.479
 this term is even more 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.120
 normally for its part in the thousand doses gives a little message attention 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.730
 el juli 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.730
 the program has been correctly 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.889
 after installing programs 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.010
 I will go but not a baby 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.029
 in the taskbar 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.710
 the machine had been placed 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.419
 the start menu program 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.240
 the father at paris plage 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.909
 like this 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.139
 this program will always be a 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.250
 accessible 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.319
 without looking for them 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.200
 in the folder m 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.960
 scorer program merengue mark 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.599
 this is the program 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:30.710
 departure 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.460
 one if there is a small mistake nokia is a huge problem because gold but I 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.460
 override 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.789
 launching a program this country typically 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.509
 since dawn 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.059
 mua start 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:47.490
 but possible 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.870
 the program is contained 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.900
 mentally 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.070
 folder and it's not the lose a search option 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.550
 on several files find the program 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.599
 to repair a courier point a program one of the methods 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.120
 if both 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.520
 move it local or program from the start menu 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.419

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:07.569
 office 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.569
 he is therefore very strong at that time 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.689
 automatically to the race 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.689
 in clear the broker for a file to amplify 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.820
 selected the folder right click and in the menu 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.150

 the record created with his old name followed by death against six 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.960
 and on the record 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.960
 you have a small beach that has been apart 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.410
 to know the properties

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.939
 my program 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:45.330
 selected shortcut 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.500
 in the drop-down menu

 gives you information even on the own website 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:53.949
 the course 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.409
 he does not give 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:58.860
 the place could store the program 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.020
 to know the properties of the shortcuts 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.949

 the shortcut 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:17.069
 their placement 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.880
 and placido classified unemployment 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.300
 where is stored 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.449
 the 6 button run store

 he matches his race 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.349
 delete it 

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:30.409
 a shortcut
