honestly music doesn't affect my life in
that<00:06:14.099> way<00:06:14.160> so<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:14.849> can't<00:06:15.330> really<00:06:15.449> relate<00:06:15.840> to

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
that way so I can't really relate to

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.600 
that way so I can't really relate to
them<00:06:16.229> saying<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.710> music<00:06:16.949> saved<00:06:17.130> my<00:06:17.160> life<00:06:17.340> yes

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
them saying that music saved my life yes

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.640 
them saying that music saved my life yes
the<00:06:17.760> lyrics<00:06:18.030> might<00:06:18.240> relate<00:06:18.660> to<00:06:18.990> whatever<00:06:19.530> I'm

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
the lyrics might relate to whatever I'm

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.710 
the lyrics might relate to whatever I'm
going<00:06:19.919> through<00:06:20.190> but<00:06:20.370> it's<00:06:20.550> like<00:06:20.699> imagine<00:06:21.630> how

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
going through but it's like imagine how

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.810 
going through but it's like imagine how
many<00:06:21.870> other<00:06:22.050> people<00:06:22.169> relate<00:06:23.130> to<00:06:23.310> that<00:06:23.430> so<00:06:23.669> it's

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
many other people relate to that so it's

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.040 
many other people relate to that so it's
not<00:06:23.910> like<00:06:24.090> you<00:06:24.419> know<00:06:24.510> this<00:06:24.660> song<00:06:24.780> has<00:06:24.900> been

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
not like you know this song has been

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.719 
not like you know this song has been
written<00:06:25.260> for<00:06:25.380> me<00:06:25.590> kind<00:06:26.039> of<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.310> don't<00:06:26.370> know<00:06:26.610> I

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
written for me kind of I don't know I

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.240 
written for me kind of I don't know I
can't<00:06:26.940> even<00:06:27.030> explain<00:06:27.330> what<00:06:27.419> I'm<00:06:27.630> saying<00:06:27.840> but

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
can't even explain what I'm saying but

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.620 
can't even explain what I'm saying but
personally<00:06:29.250> it's<00:06:29.820> not<00:06:30.000> something<00:06:30.270> that<00:06:30.300> I<00:06:30.419> can

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
personally it's not something that I can

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.270 
personally it's not something that I can
relate<00:06:30.870> to<00:06:30.930> but<00:06:31.410> I<00:06:31.440> can<00:06:31.680> understand<00:06:32.099> how<00:06:32.250> other

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
relate to but I can understand how other

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.510 
relate to but I can understand how other
people<00:06:32.940> would<00:06:33.870> get<00:06:34.110> that<00:06:34.320> sort<00:06:34.590> of<00:06:34.680> you<00:06:35.490> know

people would get that sort of you know

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.670 
people would get that sort of you know
feeling<00:06:36.210> of<00:06:36.479> self-worth<00:06:37.200> from<00:06:37.380> music<00:06:38.039> and
