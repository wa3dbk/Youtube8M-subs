to get it done with solid-state devices
so<00:01:54.040> read<00:01:54.280> what<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.640> says<00:01:54.880> about<00:01:54.909> vacuum<00:01:55.780> tubes

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
so read what it says about vacuum tubes

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.160 
so read what it says about vacuum tubes
we<00:01:57.400> were<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.700> talking<00:01:58.510> about<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.840> British

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
we were just talking about the British

we were just talking about the British
called<00:01:59.590> vacuum<00:02:00.220> tubes<00:02:00.460> valves<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.680> a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
called vacuum tubes valves think of a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.130 
called vacuum tubes valves think of a
diode<00:02:03.040> at<00:02:03.460> either<00:02:03.700> less<00:02:03.970> current<00:02:04.360> flow<00:02:04.630> or<00:02:04.960> it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
diode at either less current flow or it

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.380 
diode at either less current flow or it
doesn't<00:02:05.710> let<00:02:05.979> current<00:02:06.310> flow<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:06.790> turns<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.270> on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
doesn't let current flow it turns it on

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.719 
doesn't let current flow it turns it on
or<00:02:07.600> turns<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.019> off<00:02:08.170> that's<00:02:08.769> what<00:02:09.039> a<00:02:09.069> valve<00:02:09.399> does

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
or turns it off that's what a valve does

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.760 
or turns it off that's what a valve does
well<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> British<00:02:10.479> referred<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.319> vacuum

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
well the British referred to vacuum

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
well the British referred to vacuum
tubes<00:02:12.010> as<00:02:12.310> valves<00:02:13.290> even<00:02:14.290> today
