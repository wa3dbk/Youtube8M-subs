00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.530
 Thank you in advance 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.040
 Though today's open game was over 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:18.030
 It was a wonderful victory, but what kind of impression do you have 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:24.340
 Because from it in person fighting season was to win yourself with d 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:27.270
 Is me to successfully support at senior around but I was nervous to head 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:32.169
 I wonder where was your play 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:37.449
 What did you care about when you entered the game ? 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.130
 Softening of Chau not turning square in his even after that and his first to a bad play 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.100
 so 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.910
 I think that I will finish first ply 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 I think I could 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:54.500
 It is expected to be the mainstay meaning that it will be the third turn this year from last year replacing the number 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.750
 I think there is a place but something 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.860
 I have a thought about it this year 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.730
 Is Tsuka Takadate correctly 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.300
 Kamikoyamacho 3 Gang 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.010
 Other team feeling came in and came up from below 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.060
 I have the third one but I do 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.210
 Still know is good also whether appear in person 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:23.659
 From the practice one volume appeals to you and if you have a little chance 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:29.290
 I think that I would like to do it with a feeling that I aim at the starting point 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.940
 Kedomo today began Tan to something reverse or rather challenges that appeared in today's game 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.450
 There is no one and say so 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.890
 Or Wattto from head chan 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.150
 Not good 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:44.310
 It is not a type with Aso Anmari technology 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:49.950
 It's not any easy mistakes kana was a little often 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.770
 That on April 22 in Anomata it this mother is next week 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.380
 I have welder before thrill but 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.500
 Can I say a word for the match there? 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.659
 If you remember the star 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.110
 Think of yourself like you 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.610
 Shinpei 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.970
 I also want to do Ippei as char upper part 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.270
ç§¦Last season I ended up with trammany 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:19.050
 I know that I may be jealous of saying enthusiasm for this season 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.620
 Nishikawa, as an individual 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.700
 Then I made a team by becoming a player who can get involved twice 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.500
 I want to aim for the absolute victory Japan 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.500
 Fire 3 has been r door 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500
 Hmm
