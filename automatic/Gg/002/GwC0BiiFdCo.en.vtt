00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.370
 ending for today means having one 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.970
 we still or better equal quite a lot 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.540
 the fighters for the creative chaos 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.560
 bonaparte live 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.930
 [Music] 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.060
 wild action fantastic costumes and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.400
 uninhibited lulls everything under 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.380
 imperial supreme command the ins 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 bonaparte the exact number of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.220
 Members is not defined 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.380
 However, that is from all over 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.250
 countries come and currently mostly in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.800
 live berlin 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.470
 the emperor left his exile 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.660
 and do again through Europe at this time 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:46.170
 but without arms if you say so 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.380
 different levels so in live on the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.680
 stage is collectively , so you have to be 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.010
 area of the patient are where he expected 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.330
 I do a lot of alone in the studio 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.200
 But there are always situations 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:04.799
 like somehow yesterday after this beautiful 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.450
 Angel's boy to my left then well 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.950
 another gate on it makes me over that 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 did not send that in still fits 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.439
 and it's been collectively but is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.820
 already holding out know from my 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.880
 madness outgrow 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:27.530
 Maybe you can say that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:30.240
 [Music] 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.000
 Bonaparte was already his time 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.640
 his rebirth stands in front of him 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.190
 Nothing is considered synergy by today 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 free organizational structures ping pong 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.280
 is a good example 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.260
 we all meet some stay 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.570
 others left for a while and come 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.600
 then back so creates a constant 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.490
 flow a flowing state of desires 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.799
 and we ourselves as a group generate one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.630
 Family feeling can always do this 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.580
 again new people come to this and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.820
 nevertheless, the same energy exists 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.790
 same far 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.790

 [Music] 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.950
 the similarities with the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.689
 However, French military leaders are 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.680
 more far-reaching than for the laity 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.680
 first to recognize 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.410
 Funnily, bonaparte was a person 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.280
 his army partly really chic 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.050
 was attracted 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.240
 which is pretty much for their enemies 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.480
 Worrying was what's the fuck 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:06.960
 is carnival feathers and so really funny 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.610
 member behind bars a grid 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.060
 dies glitter the weapons are so 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.160
 drew the goal then as today 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.440
 conquest so bonaparte see themselves too 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.440
 in the 21st century on a campaign 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.740
 it is actually very similar ok 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.420
 nobody dies people are hurt 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.280
 but nobody dies in ours 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.060
 slaughter but yes there really is 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.460
 similarities 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.810
 we also have to organize everything 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.420
 situations react 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.110
 Where do we meet? How do we do that? 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.110
 audience 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.360
 If you are afraid, you should cover up 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.890
 for the brave rest, osama is for one 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.810
 another battle with the bonner 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.000
 practical collective starting next week 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.740
