on<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.060> record<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.720> don't<00:01:42.200> work<00:01:43.009> on<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.340> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
on a record I don't work on it the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.580 
on a record I don't work on it the
matically<00:01:43.820> on<00:01:44.000> purpose<00:01:44.420> but<00:01:44.690> I<00:01:44.930> tend<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.500> have

matically on purpose but I tend to have

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.730 
matically on purpose but I tend to have
a<00:01:45.619> sort<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.789> field<00:01:47.660> of<00:01:47.810> ideas<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.530> as<00:01:48.710> I

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
a sort of a field of ideas and as I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.400 
a sort of a field of ideas and as I
really<00:01:49.700> think<00:01:49.910> about<00:01:50.000> what<00:01:50.360> I'm<00:01:50.479> gonna<00:01:51.140> write

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
really think about what I'm gonna write

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.080 
really think about what I'm gonna write
about<00:01:51.530> they<00:01:51.860> begin<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.250> orbit<00:01:52.670> around<00:01:52.820> a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
about they begin to orbit around a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.389 
about they begin to orbit around a
central<00:01:53.390> idea<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:54.110> happens<00:01:54.440> with<00:01:54.770> with

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
central idea and that happens with with

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.609 
central idea and that happens with with
every<00:01:55.729> record<00:01:55.910> and<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.899> lot<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.229> times<00:01:57.440> I'm

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
every record and so a lot of times I'm

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.620 
every record and so a lot of times I'm
trying<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:57.979> figure<00:01:58.490> out<00:01:58.700> what<00:01:58.910> is<00:01:59.060> this<00:01:59.210> idea

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
trying to figure out what is this idea

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.150 
trying to figure out what is this idea
orbiting<00:02:00.080> around<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:00.619> record<00:02:01.009> in

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
orbiting around and this record in

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.730 
orbiting around and this record in
particular<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:01.759> was<00:02:02.000> writing<00:02:02.300> about<00:02:02.740> something
