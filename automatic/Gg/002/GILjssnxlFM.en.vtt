time<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.370> act<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.790> cooking<00:00:14.940> protein<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.800> think

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
time the act of cooking protein I think

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
time the act of cooking protein I think
it<00:00:16.890> does<00:00:17.010> yes<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.460> think<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.850> everything<00:00:18.449> that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
it does yes I think that everything that

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.330 
it does yes I think that everything that
we<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.810> now<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.199> freeze<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.920> then

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
we do now is we freeze it and then

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.460 
we do now is we freeze it and then
reheat<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.210> cook<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:22.289> UD

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
reheat it and we cook it I think UD

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.990 
reheat it and we cook it I think UD
dates<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.769> some<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.010> protein<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> do<00:00:23.580> think

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
dates are some of the protein I do think

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.599 
dates are some of the protein I do think
that<00:00:24.060> also<00:00:24.920> this<00:00:25.920> has<00:00:26.039> been<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> question<00:00:26.490> to

that also this has been a question to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
that also this has been a question to
that<00:00:26.640> protein<00:00:27.359> powders<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.960> keep<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.140> a

it<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.770> he'd<00:00:43.980> actually

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it up I don't know if that he'd actually

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.010 
it up I don't know if that he'd actually
dangers<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.000> from<00:00:45.149> being<00:00:45.239> warm<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.809> i

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
dangers it just from being warm but i

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.959 
dangers it just from being warm but i
think<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> microwave<00:00:47.070> actually<00:00:47.460> does<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
think the microwave actually does and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.869 
think the microwave actually does and
there's<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> lot<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> people<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:50.070> cooking<00:00:50.610> with

cooking that did indonesia when you when

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.319 
cooking that did indonesia when you when
you<00:00:59.129> cook<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.609> could<00:00:59.760> bake<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you cook with it you could bake with it

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.540 
you cook with it you could bake with it
you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.289> add<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> any<00:01:01.770> foods<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> don't

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you can add it to any foods and I don't

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.799 
you can add it to any foods and I don't
remember<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.969> was<00:01:03.059> different<00:01:03.300> about<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
remember what was different about it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
remember what was different about it
there<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> plain<00:01:04.949> flavored<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
there was a plain flavored one that you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.130 
there was a plain flavored one that you
could<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.030> make<00:01:06.360> muffins<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> stuff

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
could actually make muffins and stuff

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.500 
could actually make muffins and stuff
but<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.710> think<00:01:08.159> most<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.210> foods

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
but I think most of the the foods

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
but I think most of the the foods
nowadays<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> think<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
nowadays and I think that's not just a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.380 
nowadays and I think that's not just a
protein<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.119> anything

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
protein think this is anything

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
protein think this is anything
vegetables<00:01:13.200> nowadays<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:14.280> necessary

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
vegetables nowadays not necessary

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
vegetables nowadays not necessary
nowadays<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.090> vegetables<00:01:15.590> anything<00:01:16.590> when

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
nowadays but vegetables anything when

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.140 
nowadays but vegetables anything when
you're<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.189> heating<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.640> cooking<00:01:18.030> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you're you're heating it and cooking it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.539 
you're you're heating it and cooking it
what<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> changes<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> DiMaggio<00:01:20.100> structure<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
what it changes the DiMaggio structure I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460 
what it changes the DiMaggio structure I
mean<00:01:20.700> onions<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.509> from<00:01:21.689> being<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
mean onions actually go from being you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.780 
mean onions actually go from being you

effect<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.380> cook<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> turns

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
effect and when you cook it it turns

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.160 
effect and when you cook it it turns
into<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.220> sugars<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.689> depends<00:01:33.990> on

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
into more sugars so it just depends on

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.899 
into more sugars so it just depends on
you<00:01:34.439> know<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.829> guess<00:01:35.340> how<00:01:35.490> long<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.820> cook

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you know I guess how long do you cook

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.080 
you know I guess how long do you cook
them<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.869> stuff<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.680> but

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
them for you know stuff like that but

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.850 
them for you know stuff like that but
any<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> foods<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.689> feel<00:01:39.930> something

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
any of the foods I feel something

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
any of the foods I feel something
changes<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.640> molecular<00:01:42.119> Lee<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.930> know

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
changes them molecular Lee that you know

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.230 
changes them molecular Lee that you know
affected<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.530> way<00:01:43.619> they're<00:01:43.770> absorbed

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
affected the way they're absorbed

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.569 
affected the way they're absorbed
busana<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.259> I<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:45.619> both<00:01:45.770> have<00:01:46.009> sushi<00:01:46.460> and

busana you and I we both have sushi and

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.740 
busana you and I we both have sushi and
I<00:01:46.729> do<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.090> think<00:01:47.329> absolutely<00:01:48.820> not<00:01:49.820> not<00:01:50.060> as<00:01:50.270> you

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
I do you think absolutely not not as you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.570 
I do you think absolutely not not as you
know<00:01:50.780> everyday<00:01:51.140> kind<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.619> meal<00:01:51.799> but<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.159> mean

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
know everyday kind of meal but I mean

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.219 
know everyday kind of meal but I mean
you<00:01:53.119> know<00:01:53.210> is<00:01:53.299> a<00:01:53.360> definite<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.869> better

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
you know is a definite a better

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.320 
you know is a definite a better
nutritional<00:01:54.830> profile<00:01:55.220> with<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.180> raw

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
nutritional profile with the the raw

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.660 
nutritional profile with the the raw
fish<00:01:56.390> as<00:01:56.899> opposed<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.409> cook<00:01:57.560> fish<00:01:57.770> well<00:01:58.640> I

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
fish as opposed to the cook fish well I

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.730 
fish as opposed to the cook fish well I
think<00:01:58.939> anything<00:01:59.659> in<00:01:59.780> its<00:01:59.930> purest<00:02:00.200> form<00:02:00.350> is

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
think anything in its purest form is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.560 
think anything in its purest form is
better<00:02:01.009> period<00:02:01.520> i<00:02:01.700> think<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:02.030> vitamin<00:02:02.420> wise

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
better period i think that vitamin wise

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.050 
better period i think that vitamin wise
if<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:03.320> can<00:02:03.530> eat<00:02:03.649> raw<00:02:03.860> vegetables<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.700> fruits

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
if you can eat raw vegetables in fruits

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.100 
if you can eat raw vegetables in fruits
and<00:02:05.270> stuff<00:02:05.330> like<00:02:05.539> that<00:02:05.600> they're<00:02:05.869> going<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:06.049> be

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
and stuff like that they're going to be

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.259 
and stuff like that they're going to be
better<00:02:06.229> than<00:02:06.320> if<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.590> was<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:07.549> was<00:02:07.700> cooked

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
better than if it was it was cooked

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.669 
better than if it was it was cooked
vegetables<00:02:08.780> or<00:02:08.899> steamed<00:02:09.050> vegetables<00:02:09.440> or<00:02:09.530> sent

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
vegetables or steamed vegetables or sent

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.040 
vegetables or steamed vegetables or sent
like<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.360> guess<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.660> would<00:02:11.720> go<00:02:11.870> for

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
like that and I guess that would go for

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.420 
like that and I guess that would go for
the<00:02:12.140> raw<00:02:12.349> meat<00:02:12.739> stupid<00:02:13.130> there's<00:02:13.250> not<00:02:13.340> many

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the raw meat stupid there's not many

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.160 
the raw meat stupid there's not many
meats<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.120> could<00:02:14.239> eat<00:02:14.360> wrong<00:02:14.599> you<00:02:15.080> know

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
meats that you could eat wrong you know

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.270 
meats that you could eat wrong you know
you're<00:02:15.290> not<00:02:15.349> going<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.620> brought<00:02:15.830> chicken<00:02:16.190> and

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
you're not going to brought chicken and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.830 
you're not going to brought chicken and
getting<00:02:16.430> assembling<00:02:16.790> salmonella<00:02:17.630> poisoning

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
getting assembling salmonella poisoning

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.900 
getting assembling salmonella poisoning
you<00:02:18.170> drop<00:02:18.380> dead<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.769> feel<00:02:19.459> like<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.700> were<00:02:19.790> going

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
you drop dead I feel like you were going

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.160 
you drop dead I feel like you were going
to<00:02:19.940> die<00:02:20.000> or<00:02:20.120> hope<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.720> die<00:02:20.840> when<00:02:21.049> you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
to die or hope that you die when you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.800 
to die or hope that you die when you
have<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.590> or<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.310> some<00:02:22.640> people<00:02:22.850> eat<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.000> steak

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
have it or like some people eat a steak

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.600 
have it or like some people eat a steak
tartare<00:02:24.170> which<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.650> raw<00:02:24.860> beef<00:02:25.100> it's

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
tartare which is like the raw beef it's

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.509 
tartare which is like the raw beef it's
not<00:02:25.730> bad<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.060> had<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.360> friend<00:02:27.010> who<00:02:28.010> actually<00:02:28.160> ate

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
not bad I had a friend who actually ate

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.670 
not bad I had a friend who actually ate
because<00:02:29.030> he<00:02:29.239> she's<00:02:29.870> um<00:02:30.049> collide<00:02:30.290> told<00:02:30.500> him

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
because he she's um collide told him

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.960 
because he she's um collide told him
this<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.130> i'm<00:02:31.190> not<00:02:31.280> sure<00:02:31.370> where<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.790> came<00:02:31.819> from

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
this and i'm not sure where it came from

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.770 
this and i'm not sure where it came from
suckle<00:02:32.870> told<00:02:33.080> him<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.290> raw<00:02:33.709> ground<00:02:34.190> beef

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
suckle told him that raw ground beef

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.539 
suckle told him that raw ground beef
works<00:02:35.780> better<00:02:36.110> than<00:02:36.410> cooked<00:02:36.860> piece<00:02:37.100> we<00:02:37.400> ate

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
works better than cooked piece we ate

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.820 
works better than cooked piece we ate
those<00:02:37.790> tubes<00:02:38.299> like<00:02:38.750> those<00:02:38.930> big<00:02:39.080> tubes<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.620> beef

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
those tubes like those big tubes of beef

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.520 
those tubes like those big tubes of beef
at<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.190> yeah<00:02:40.880> he<00:02:41.510> put<00:02:41.690> like<00:02:41.810> bacon<00:02:42.170> salt<00:02:42.349> on

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
at the yeah he put like bacon salt on

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.710 
at the yeah he put like bacon salt on
and<00:02:42.680> ate<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.099> out<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:43.910> he<00:02:44.480> did<00:02:44.630> get

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
and ate that out of that and he did get

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.720 
and ate that out of that and he did get
sick<00:02:44.959> no<00:02:45.319> okay<00:02:45.650> well<00:02:45.830> here<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.310> know<00:02:46.430> so

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
sick no okay well here you know so

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.000 
sick no okay well here you know so
obviously<00:02:47.180> his<00:02:47.840> body<00:02:48.049> can<00:02:48.380> handle<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.799> but<00:02:48.950> i

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
obviously his body can handle it but i

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.289 
obviously his body can handle it but i
probably<00:02:49.430> wouldn't<00:02:49.700> suggest<00:02:49.850> doing<00:02:50.180> that

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
probably wouldn't suggest doing that

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.099 
probably wouldn't suggest doing that
because<00:02:50.480> you're<00:02:50.660> going<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.840> get<00:02:50.900> sick

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
because you're going to get sick

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.319 
because you're going to get sick
probably<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:51.680> anything<00:02:52.579> that<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:53.150> most

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
probably but anything that the most

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.449 
probably but anything that the most
natural<00:02:53.540> purest<00:02:54.200> form<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:55.070> going<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.310> have<00:02:55.400> the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
natural purest form is going to have the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.460 
natural purest form is going to have the
most<00:02:55.549> amount<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.030> nutrition<00:02:56.359> in<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.780> period

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
most amount of nutrition in it period

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.039 
most amount of nutrition in it period
once<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.040> start<00:02:58.310> cooking<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.450> freezing

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
once you start cooking it and freezing
