00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
tactics week for out there today I think

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.550 
tactics week for out there today I think
I<00:01:13.409> was<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> very<00:01:13.770> difficult

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
I was a very difficult

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.679 
I was a very difficult
was<00:01:14.710> flying<00:01:14.979> around<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.460> obviously<00:01:16.240> works<00:01:16.479> we

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
was flying around and obviously works we

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.630 
was flying around and obviously works we
went<00:01:16.869> through<00:01:16.990> his<00:01:17.049> champion<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:18.100> think<00:01:18.520> if

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
went through his champion so I think if

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.249 
went through his champion so I think if
we<00:01:18.759> took<00:01:19.000> on<00:01:19.210> friday<00:01:19.360> but<00:01:19.750> i<00:01:19.780> think<00:01:20.049> it'd<00:01:20.170> be

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259

the three-pointers and the power play I

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.910 
the three-pointers and the power play I
think<00:01:43.780> they'll<00:01:44.020> quite<00:01:44.229> frustrated<00:01:44.740> with<00:01:44.829> the

think they'll quite frustrated with the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.929 
think they'll quite frustrated with the
way<00:01:44.950> we<00:01:45.039> were<00:01:45.250> playing<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.549> ball<00:01:45.759> around

about<00:01:50.229> fastener<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:50.979> there's<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.459> new<00:01:51.610> format

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
about fastener and there's a new format

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.719 
about fastener and there's a new format
and<00:01:52.240> deeper<00:01:53.200> fur<00:01:53.380> fastener<00:01:53.830> think<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.610> was<00:01:54.700> a

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
and deeper fur fastener think it was a

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.730 
and deeper fur fastener think it was a
former<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.270> definitely<00:01:55.539> don't<00:01:55.899> prefer<00:01:56.259> faster

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
former I definitely don't prefer faster

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.949 
former I definitely don't prefer faster
oh<00:01:57.130> no<00:01:57.789> he's<00:01:57.909> fine<00:01:58.149> but<00:01:58.390> it's<00:01:58.630> one<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.869> those

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
oh no he's fine but it's one of those

tuckpointing you look at all the Super

tuckpointing you look at all the Super
League<00:02:00.729> scores<00:02:01.060> at<00:02:01.209> halftime<00:02:01.390> from<00:02:01.840> last<00:02:02.049> year

League scores at halftime from last year
they're<00:02:02.560> very<00:02:02.770> close<00:02:03.069> and<00:02:03.280> 24<00:02:03.970> minutes<00:02:04.000> isn't

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
they're very close and 24 minutes isn't

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.089 
they're very close and 24 minutes isn't
a<00:02:04.569> lot<00:02:04.599> of<00:02:04.840> time<00:02:05.049> to<00:02:05.200> win<00:02:05.349> a<00:02:05.380> game<00:02:05.439> so<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:05.920> have

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
a lot of time to win a game so you have

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:07.980 
a lot of time to win a game so you have
to<00:02:06.250> be<00:02:06.369> really<00:02:06.610> composed<00:02:06.909> so<00:02:07.450> there's<00:02:07.630> parts

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
to be really composed so there's parts

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.419 
to be really composed so there's parts
of<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.110> game<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.530> really<00:02:08.709> helps<00:02:09.099> but

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
of the game that it really helps but

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.770 
of the game that it really helps but
it's<00:02:09.580> also<00:02:09.729> one<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:09.970> those<00:02:10.119> those<00:02:10.539> look

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
it's also one of those those look

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.390 
it's also one of those those look
against<00:02:11.080> well<00:02:11.349> if<00:02:11.470> someone<00:02:11.620> lands<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.160> couple

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
against well if someone lands a couple

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.680 
against well if someone lands a couple
of<00:02:12.459> three<00:02:12.640> points<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.090> they're<00:02:13.239> right<00:02:13.390> back<00:02:13.510> in

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
of three points as they're right back in

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.020 
of three points as they're right back in
the<00:02:13.780> mix<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.200> I'd<00:02:14.709> say<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.340> tougher<00:02:15.670> at<00:02:15.790> times

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
the mix so I'd say it's tougher at times

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.960 
the mix so I'd say it's tougher at times
and<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.810> still<00:02:17.019> prefer<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.530> real<00:02:17.680> netbook<00:02:18.099> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
and I still prefer the real netbook and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.910 
and I still prefer the real netbook and
then<00:02:19.239> do<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.989> think<00:02:20.140> faster<00:02:20.440> has<00:02:20.560> changed

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
then do you think faster has changed

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.700 
then do you think faster has changed
netball's<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.519> still<00:02:21.760> face<00:02:22.120> for

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
netball's I still face for

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.130 
netball's I still face for
I<00:02:23.770> think<00:02:24.520> as<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> Stephanie<00:02:25.330> I'm<00:02:25.480> still<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.900> place

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
I think as a Stephanie I'm still a place

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.300 
I think as a Stephanie I'm still a place
for<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.470> Burnett<00:02:26.740> while<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> think<00:02:27.160> that's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
for it Burnett while I think that's

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.070 
for it Burnett while I think that's
again<00:02:27.580> ever<00:02:27.820> we<00:02:27.940> all<00:02:28.060> know<00:02:28.210> we<00:02:28.420> all<00:02:28.540> love<00:02:28.690> what

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
again ever we all know we all love what

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.510 
again ever we all know we all love what
I<00:02:29.110> love<00:02:29.290> about<00:02:29.350> fastener<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.220> keeps<00:02:30.400> it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
I love about fastener is it keeps it

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.340 
I love about fastener is it keeps it
competitive<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.240> keeps<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.510> real<00:02:31.660> close<00:02:31.930> it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
competitive it keeps it real close it

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.720 
competitive it keeps it real close it
brings<00:02:32.590> different<00:02:32.770> aspects<00:02:33.280> into<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.580> game

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
brings different aspects into the game

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.070 
brings different aspects into the game
I'd<00:02:33.880> like<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.120> see<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.240> few<00:02:34.450> more<00:02:34.540> changes<00:02:34.960> where

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
I'd like to see a few more changes where

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.660 
I'd like to see a few more changes where
maybe<00:02:35.230> center<00:02:35.920> court<00:02:36.130> could<00:02:36.310> shoot<00:02:36.520> as<00:02:36.640> well

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
maybe center court could shoot as well

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.010 
maybe center court could shoot as well
because<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.120> would<00:02:37.210> change<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.540> dynamics

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
because that would change the dynamics

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.420 
because that would change the dynamics
but<00:02:38.410> it's<00:02:38.500> definitely<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.830> game<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.160> can<00:02:39.280> take

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
but it's definitely a game you can take

twenty20<00:02:41.710> cricket<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:42.100> keeps<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.490> crowd

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
twenty20 cricket it keeps a crowd

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
think teams could read and if ur entry's

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.660 
think teams could read and if ur entry's
could<00:02:47.350> come<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.590> board<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:48.340> play<00:02:48.520> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
could come on board and really play the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.790 
could come on board and really play the
game<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:48.970> actually<00:02:49.300> make<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.960> tactically<00:02:50.410> and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
game and actually make it tactically and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.310 
game and actually make it tactically and
different<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.880> game<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.120> network<00:02:52.420> as<00:02:53.080> if

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.790 
school I think the fascinate competition
definitely<00:02:58.510> helps<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.810> netbook<00:02:59.080> course<00:02:59.560> you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
definitely helps a netbook course you

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.650 
definitely helps a netbook course you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
know it's a different competition I know

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.970 
know it's a different competition I know

so many people that come along and love

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.380 
so many people that come along and love
the<00:03:03.100> fact<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.340> can<00:03:03.490> shoot<00:03:03.730> from<00:03:03.850> outside<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
the fact you can shoot from outside the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.910 
the fact you can shoot from outside the
circle<00:03:04.600> it's<00:03:04.930> one<00:03:05.050> of<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.200> biggest<00:03:05.380> questions

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
circle it's one of the biggest questions

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.470 
circle it's one of the biggest questions
you<00:03:06.010> get<00:03:06.130> asked<00:03:06.250> from<00:03:06.400> guys<00:03:06.640> what<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.330> come

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
you get asked from guys what you come

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
and shoot outside the circle so it's

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.440 
and shoot outside the circle so it's
quite<00:03:09.070> nice<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.460> do<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.970> power<00:03:10.180> play<00:03:10.420> is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
quite nice to do that the power play is

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.660 
quite nice to do that the power play is
again<00:03:10.780> keep<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.140> exciting<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
again keep it exciting and the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.070 
again keep it exciting and the
end-to-end<00:03:12.970> stuff<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.540> fact<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.900> team

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
end-to-end stuff the fact that the team

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.630 
end-to-end stuff the fact that the team
always<00:03:14.230> get<00:03:14.410> some<00:03:14.590> more<00:03:14.710> about<00:03:14.860> like<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.250> is

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
always get some more about like it is

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.220 
always get some more about like it is
different<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.450> think<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.750> keeps<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.050> crown

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
different and I think it keeps the crown
