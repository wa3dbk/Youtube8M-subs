okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.469> like<00:00:01.979> after<00:00:02.460> two<00:00:02.700> hours<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.090> trial

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
okay so like after two hours of trial

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.960 
okay so like after two hours of trial
and<00:00:03.600> error<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:04.049> trying<00:00:04.950> positive<00:00:05.430> stops<00:00:05.730> and

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
and error and trying positive stops and

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.330 
and error and trying positive stops and
hinges<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.480> everything<00:00:06.779> else<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.340> finally

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
hinges and everything else I finally

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.089 
hinges and everything else I finally
figured<00:00:08.610> out<00:00:09.320> while<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> was<00:00:10.530> looking<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
figured out while I was looking on the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.419 
figured out while I was looking on the
jointers<00:00:11.849> finished<00:00:12.240> part<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.750> project

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
jointers finished part of this project

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.939 
jointers finished part of this project
to<00:00:14.429> hold<00:00:14.990> boards<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.139> planing<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.770> could

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
to hold boards for planing that I could

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.500 
to hold boards for planing that I could
just<00:00:17.100> use<00:00:17.310> these<00:00:17.460> holdfasts<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.560> if<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:20.510> slide

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
just use these holdfasts and if I slide

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.900 
just use these holdfasts and if I slide
my<00:00:21.539> cheese<00:00:21.990> block<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.529> inside<00:00:22.949> here<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.820> I've

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
my cheese block up inside here and I've

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.359 
my cheese block up inside here and I've
drilled<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.449> passage<00:00:24.960> hole<00:00:25.170> through<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
drilled a passage hole through here and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.410 
drilled a passage hole through here and
if<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.640> reverse<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:28.160> holdfast<00:00:30.710> pound<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.890> in

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
if I reverse this holdfast pound it in

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.720 
if I reverse this holdfast pound it in
it<00:00:33.420> holds<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.809> solid<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.980> biggest<00:00:35.219> problem

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
it holds this solid my biggest problem

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
it holds this solid my biggest problem
or<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.329> biggest<00:00:36.630> problem<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.350> piece

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
or your biggest problem with this piece

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
or your biggest problem with this piece
is<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.550> has<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.090> solid<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> ended<00:00:40.260> up

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
is a it has to be on solid so I ended up

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.680 
is a it has to be on solid so I ended up
having<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.649> hinge<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.190> because<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.210> couldn't

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
having to hinge it on because I couldn't

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.200 
having to hinge it on because I couldn't
the<00:00:43.079> positive<00:00:43.500> stop<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:44.850> keep<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.120> from

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the positive stop here will keep it from

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.400 
the positive stop here will keep it from
going<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.570> way<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.989> wouldn't<00:00:46.170> keep<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
going this way but it wouldn't keep it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.529 
going this way but it wouldn't keep it
from<00:00:46.530> pulling<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.010> way<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> had<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> figure

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
from pulling that way so I had to figure

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.240 
from pulling that way so I had to figure
that<00:00:48.780> part<00:00:48.989> out<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.469> hinged<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> begin

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
that part out and I hinged it to begin

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.369 
that part out and I hinged it to begin
with<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.760> saw<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> guy<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.480> over<00:00:52.320> in

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
with because I saw a guy do that over in

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.529 
with because I saw a guy do that over in
the<00:00:52.440> UK<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.789> wanted<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the UK but I really wanted to make this

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.660 
the UK but I really wanted to make this
bench<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.920> completely<00:00:56.370> take

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bench so that you can completely take

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
bench so that you can completely take
this<00:00:56.820> stuff<00:00:57.059> off<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.230> back

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this stuff off of it and be right back

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.950 
this stuff off of it and be right back
down<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.789> an<00:00:59.940> English<00:01:00.210> saw<00:01:00.390> bench<00:01:00.660> again

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
down to like an English saw bench again

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290 
down to like an English saw bench again
so<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.219> gonna<00:01:02.340> allow<00:01:02.520> me<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
so this was gonna allow me to do that so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.520 
so this was gonna allow me to do that so
now<00:01:03.480> all<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.080> take<00:01:04.229> out<00:01:04.409> this

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
now all I have to do is take out this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
now all I have to do is take out this
cheese<00:01:04.860> block<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.850> lift<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
cheese block you can lift this up and it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.170 
cheese block you can lift this up and it
releases<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> whole<00:01:07.770> thing<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:09.030> can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
releases the whole thing so now we can

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.780 
releases the whole thing so now we can
pull<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.659> stuff<00:01:09.869> off<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> bench<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
pull all this stuff off the bench and

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.330 
pull all this stuff off the bench and
again<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> Saab<00:01:13.049> bench<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
again we have a Saab bench so that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.830 
again we have a Saab bench so that
holdfast<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> way<00:01:15.390> you're<00:01:15.509> gonna<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
holdfast is the way you're gonna have to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.300 
holdfast is the way you're gonna have to
do<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.470> put<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:16.860> cheese<00:01:17.070> block

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
do that and just put your cheese block

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.789 
do that and just put your cheese block
up<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:17.939> get<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.780> hole<00:01:19.110> drilled<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.710> an

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
up in there get your hole drilled at an

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
up in there get your hole drilled at an
angle<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> did<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.909> put<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.450> on

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
angle here all I did was put this up on

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.600 
angle here all I did was put this up on
here<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> even<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.280> start<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
here and even it up and I start the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
here and even it up and I start the
hinge<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> did<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.439> just

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
hinge on here when I did it and I just

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.080 
hinge on here when I did it and I just
drilled<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> pass<00:01:26.100> hole<00:01:26.400> through<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.000> an

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
drilled a pass hole through here at an

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.160 
drilled a pass hole through here at an
angle<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.570> direction

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
angle this direction

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.710 
angle this direction
about<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> 30<00:01:29.220> degree<00:01:29.369> angle<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
about a 30 degree angle and then it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.050 
about a 30 degree angle and then it
continued<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.490> hold<00:01:32.729> fast

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
continued it so that this hold fast

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.630 
continued it so that this hold fast
would<00:01:33.240> sit<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.659> hole<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.610> when<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
would sit in that hole and when I

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.940 
would sit in that hole and when I
parented<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.150> down<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:37.530> would<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.799> almost

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
parented it down it would be almost

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
parented it down it would be almost
keeping<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> bottom<00:01:38.909> or<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
keeping at the bottom or like this and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.560

saddle horse and this configuration and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.729 
saddle horse and this configuration and
we'll<00:03:34.580> do<00:03:34.700> lots<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.360> more<00:03:35.570> things<00:03:35.810> for<00:03:36.019> us<00:03:36.140> and

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
we'll do lots of more things for us and

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.320 
we'll do lots of more things for us and
then<00:03:36.860> we<00:03:36.950> also<00:03:37.130> have<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.580> drilled<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.239> we

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
then we also have it drilled so that we

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.180 
then we also have it drilled so that we
can<00:03:38.480> use<00:03:38.600> holdfasts<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.410> things<00:03:39.620> on<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.920> side

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
can use holdfasts and things on the side

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.180 
can use holdfasts and things on the side
of<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.700> bench<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.750> make<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:42.140> also<00:03:42.410> capable<00:03:42.950> of

being<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.580> joiners<00:03:44.030> bench<00:03:44.269> which<00:03:44.930> means<00:03:45.200> we<00:03:45.350> can

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
being a joiners bench which means we can

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.860 
being a joiners bench which means we can
do<00:03:45.709> more<00:03:46.190> complicated<00:03:46.640> furniture<00:03:47.360> making<00:03:47.570> and

do more complicated furniture making and
more<00:03:48.320> complicated<00:03:48.680> joinery<00:03:49.340> using<00:03:50.090> that

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
more complicated joinery using that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.380 
more complicated joinery using that
configuration<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.040> bench<00:03:52.280> now<00:03:53.060> I'd<00:03:53.209> like

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
configuration of the bench now I'd like

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.020 
configuration of the bench now I'd like
to<00:03:53.450> experiment<00:03:54.170> with<00:03:54.650> adding<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.610> few<00:03:55.790> other

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
to experiment with adding a few other

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.520 
to experiment with adding a few other
options<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.600> this<00:03:56.720> best<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.170> will<00:03:57.290> make<00:03:57.410> it

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
options to this best that will make it

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.920 
options to this best that will make it
even<00:03:57.739> more<00:03:57.769> versatile<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.480> wood

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
even more versatile so that the wood

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.600 
even more versatile so that the wood
craft<00:04:00.260> bets<00:04:00.590> when<00:04:00.830> I'm<00:04:00.920> finished<00:04:01.280> with<00:04:01.370> it

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
craft bets when I'm finished with it
