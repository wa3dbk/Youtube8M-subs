00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
mines down but no that didn't work so I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
mines down but no that didn't work so I
know<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> an<00:01:19.380> extent<00:01:19.740> there's<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.520> really

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
know to an extent there's not really

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.719 
know to an extent there's not really
much<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
much you can do about that because the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.010 
much you can do about that because the
publisher<00:01:23.729> does<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.150> quite<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> big<00:01:24.750> say<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
publisher does have quite a big say in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
publisher does have quite a big say in
what<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.860> how<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.060> when

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
what you do in how you do it and when

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.679 
what you do in how you do it and when
you<00:01:27.570> put<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> game<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.950> overall

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
you put the game out but I think overall

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.300 
you put the game out but I think overall
it's<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.990> been<00:01:31.200> too<00:01:31.380> bad<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.860> dice<00:01:32.040> it's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it's just been too bad for dice it's

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.890 
it's just been too bad for dice it's
just<00:01:32.490> been<00:01:32.670> really<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.150> bad<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.720> because

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
just been really really bad just because

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
just been really really bad just because
everything<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.009> battle<00:01:35.400> fours<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.880> be

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
just been going pretty pretty bad for

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.440 
just been going pretty pretty bad for
him<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.040> good<00:03:25.190> going<00:03:25.310> from<00:03:25.609> bad<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.819> worse<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
him is good going from bad to worse and

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.660 
him is good going from bad to worse and
I<00:03:26.540> don't<00:03:26.750> know<00:03:26.810> if<00:03:26.900> they<00:03:27.019> can<00:03:27.370> save<00:03:28.370> this

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
I don't know if they can save this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.599 
I don't know if they can save this
anyhow<00:03:29.329> I<00:03:29.859> really<00:03:30.859> think<00:03:31.040> they<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:31.340> can't

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
anyhow I really think they just can't

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.129 
anyhow I really think they just can't
there's<00:03:31.819> nothing<00:03:32.150> they<00:03:32.269> can<00:03:32.329> do<00:03:32.540> about<00:03:32.569> it<00:03:32.840> you

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
there's nothing they can do about it you

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.440 
there's nothing they can do about it you
just<00:03:33.290> that's<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:34.040> do<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:34.730> just<00:03:35.090> hope<00:03:35.420> for

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
just that's it do it and just hope for

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.140 
just that's it do it and just hope for
the<00:03:35.630> best<00:03:35.720> but<00:03:36.049> I<00:03:36.200> think<00:03:36.970> because<00:03:37.970> they've

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
the best but I think because they've

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.449 
the best but I think because they've
rushed<00:03:38.450> battle<00:03:39.049> for<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.530> battlefield<00:03:40.100> 3<00:03:40.310> was

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
rushed battle for and battlefield 3 was

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.430 
rushed battle for and battlefield 3 was
a<00:03:40.489> huge<00:03:41.060> success<00:03:41.359> but<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.019> have<00:03:42.139> to<00:03:42.290> remember

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
a huge success but you have to remember

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.640 
a huge success but you have to remember
that<00:03:42.739> he<00:03:42.980> has<00:03:43.160> been<00:03:43.459> five<00:03:44.209> or<00:03:44.450> six<00:03:44.690> years<00:03:44.840> since

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
that he has been five or six years since

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.440 
that he has been five or six years since
the<00:03:45.950> previous<00:03:46.160> battle<00:03:46.880> came<00:03:47.090> out<00:03:47.269> which<00:03:47.420> is

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the previous battle came out which is

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.470 
the previous battle came out which is
bad<00:03:47.780> fuel<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.200> when<00:03:48.380> he<00:03:48.470> came<00:03:48.650> out<00:03:49.480> 2006-2007

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
bad fuel to when he came out 2006-2007

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.569 
bad fuel to when he came out 2006-2007
something<00:03:50.930> like<00:03:51.049> that<00:03:51.230> so<00:03:51.410> it's<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:52.130> good<00:03:52.310> five

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
something like that so it's a good five

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.449 
something like that so it's a good five
six<00:03:52.880> years<00:03:52.970> since<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:54.139> previous<00:03:54.769> battle<00:03:55.250> game

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
six years since a previous battle game

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.009 
six years since a previous battle game
come<00:03:55.700> out<00:03:55.850> so<00:03:56.090> they<00:03:56.239> had<00:03:56.359> plenty<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.780> time<00:03:56.870> to

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
come out so they had plenty of time to

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.629 
come out so they had plenty of time to
get<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.410> working<00:03:57.560> playing<00:03:58.040> time<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.430> get<00:03:58.549> it

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
get it working playing time to get it

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.089 
get it working playing time to get it

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
and all that because they didn't really

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.590
