00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
campus in a year-around process I'd say

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
campus in a year-around process I'd say
the<00:00:55.469> biggest<00:00:55.500> change<00:00:56.010> will<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.059> able

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the biggest change will be will be able

out of the inclement weather year-round
and<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.559> will<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:04.920> benefit<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.030> student

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and that will really benefit the student

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
and that will really benefit the student
athletes<00:01:06.690> because<00:01:06.990> right<00:01:07.770> now<00:01:07.800> we<00:01:07.980> don't<00:01:08.160> have

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
athletes because right now we don't have

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
can use in the mornings we can't really

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380 
can use in the mornings we can't really
do<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.530> anymore<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:23.370> we're<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.270> get

do that anymore if we're going to get

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.790 
do that anymore if we're going to get
any<00:01:24.570> kind<00:01:24.660> of<00:01:24.870> practice<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.530> weather's

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
ridiculous we do have to go in some kind

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.900 
ridiculous we do have to go in some kind
of<00:01:28.500> an<00:01:28.620> indoor<00:01:28.950> facility<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.550> have<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.730> split

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
of an indoor facility they have to split

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.490 
of an indoor facility they have to split
our<00:01:29.970> teams<00:01:30.300> up<00:01:30.540> there's<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.930> much<00:01:31.260> room<00:01:31.440> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
our teams up there's not much room to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
our teams up there's not much room to
get<00:01:31.740> anything<00:01:32.070> done<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.970> through

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
get anything done we go through

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.820 
get anything done we go through
walkthroughs<00:01:33.750> rather<00:01:34.080> than<00:01:34.260> running<00:01:34.500> through

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
walkthroughs rather than running through

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.880 
walkthroughs rather than running through
right<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:35.270> it's<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.480> struggle<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.530> use

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
right now it's a struggle because we use

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.030 
right now it's a struggle because we use
multiple<00:01:38.880> surfaces<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.570> campus<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
multiple surfaces on campus and this is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.680 
multiple surfaces on campus and this is
going<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.250> give<00:01:41.460> us<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.970> function<00:01:42.450> one

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
going to give us one function one

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.110 
going to give us one function one
surface<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.370> we<00:01:44.670> won't<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.090> to

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
surface to go to and so we won't have to

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.440 
surface to go to and so we won't have to
ask<00:01:45.480> them<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.560> three<00:01:46.860> different<00:01:46.980> places

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
ask them to be at three different places

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
ask them to be at three different places
three<00:01:48.450> different<00:01:48.570> times<00:01:48.990> during<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.770> day<00:01:49.800> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
three different times during the day you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.470 
three different times during the day you
know<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.550> you<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> split<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.300> that

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
know when you have to split up like that

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.300 
know when you have to split up like that
it's<00:01:51.630> difficult<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:52.230> you<00:01:52.980> have<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> lot<00:01:53.280> of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's difficult because you have a lot of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
it's difficult because you have a lot of
guys<00:01:53.550> that<00:01:53.580> switches<00:01:54.360> back<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:54.750> forth<00:01:54.990> on

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
guys that switches back and forth on

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.470 
guys that switches back and forth on
scout<00:01:55.590> team<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.070> forth<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.940> can't<00:01:57.330> do

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
scout team so forth and you can't do

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.420 
scout team so forth and you can't do
that<00:01:57.630> when<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.900> have<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.170> hide

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
that when you have to hide

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.330 
that when you have to hide
across<00:01:58.670> campus<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.530> to<00:02:00.530> commute<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.980> guess<00:02:01.190> to
