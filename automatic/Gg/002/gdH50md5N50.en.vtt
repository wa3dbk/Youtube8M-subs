00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
amplifier in there just so I could be

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.490 
amplifier in there just so I could be
heard<00:00:29.310> help<00:00:30.300> me<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.539> door<00:00:30.929> get<00:00:31.320> me<00:00:31.439> a

let's<00:01:04.860> take<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> closer<00:01:05.430> look<00:01:08.090> I've<00:01:09.090> made<00:01:09.360> some

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
let's take a closer look I've made some

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.070 
let's take a closer look I've made some
changes<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> head

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
changes to the head

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.470 
changes to the head
if<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:11.770> see<00:01:11.950> over<00:01:12.070> here<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.580> put<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.030> rubber<00:01:13.390> band

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
if you see over here I put a rubber band

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.600 
if you see over here I put a rubber band
in<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.200> do<00:01:14.320> nothing<00:01:14.770> other<00:01:14.920> than<00:01:15.100> guide<00:01:15.370> the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
in to do nothing other than guide the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.730 
in to do nothing other than guide the
thumb<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.750> allows<00:01:16.990> me<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.200> control<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
thumb that allows me to control the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.650 
thumb that allows me to control the
thumb<00:01:17.920> normally<00:01:18.280> anyway<00:01:18.580> I<00:01:18.610> would<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.480> if<00:01:19.570> I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
thumb normally anyway I would but if I

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.530 
thumb normally anyway I would but if I
want<00:01:19.900> some<00:01:20.650> comes<00:01:20.860> round<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:22.300> volume

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
want some comes round and that volume

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.610 
want some comes round and that volume
goes<00:01:22.870> up<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.350> down<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.890> then<00:01:25.440> right<00:01:26.440> back

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
goes up and down and then right back

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.440 
goes up and down and then right back
inside<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:27.250> she'd<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.700> control<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.150> thumb

plugs<00:01:43.870> right<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.350> i<00:01:47.490> took<00:01:48.490> an<00:01:48.610> existing<00:01:48.850> voice

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
plugs right in i took an existing voice

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.050 
plugs right in i took an existing voice
amplification<00:01:50.050> system<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:51.340> i<00:01:51.400> disassembled

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
amplification system and i disassembled

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.670 
amplification system and i disassembled
it<00:01:52.120> a<00:01:52.390> little<00:01:52.900> bit<00:01:53.050> i<00:01:54.210> did<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.330> because<00:01:55.680> it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
it a little bit i did that because it

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.230 
it a little bit i did that because it
gave<00:01:56.860> me<00:01:57.010> about<00:01:57.190> four<00:01:57.520> inches<00:01:57.790> over<00:01:58.030> here

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
gave me about four inches over here

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.270 
gave me about four inches over here
which<00:01:58.540> allows<00:01:58.840> me<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.110> drop<00:01:59.290> my<00:01:59.440> chin<00:01:59.710> down<00:01:59.920> and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
which allows me to drop my chin down and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.249 
which allows me to drop my chin down and
have<00:02:00.430> better<00:02:00.670> field<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.119> vision<00:02:01.270> straight

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
have better field of vision straight

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.469 
have better field of vision straight
down<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.740> way<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.850> also<00:02:04.000> allowed<00:02:04.300> me<00:02:04.420> to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
down that way it also allowed me to

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.880 
down that way it also allowed me to
separate<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.990> batteries<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.619> gave<00:02:05.800> me

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
separate the batteries that gave me

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.880 
separate the batteries that gave me
better<00:02:06.070> weight<00:02:06.340> distribution<00:02:06.520> i<00:02:07.709> trimmed<00:02:08.709> off

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
better weight distribution i trimmed off

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.590 
better weight distribution i trimmed off
some<00:02:09.100> of<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.250> cone<00:02:09.490> which<00:02:09.940> cost<00:02:10.209> me<00:02:10.390> less<00:02:10.539> than

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
some of the cone which cost me less than

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.930 
some of the cone which cost me less than
10%<00:02:10.959> of<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.380> total<00:02:11.530> volume<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.670> gave<00:02:12.820> me

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
10% of the total volume but it gave me

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.340 
10% of the total volume but it gave me
an<00:02:13.030> additional<00:02:13.209> four<00:02:13.660> inches<00:02:14.020> which<00:02:14.320> is

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
an additional four inches which is

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.840 
an additional four inches which is
really<00:02:14.680> important<00:02:15.070> if<00:02:15.190> you're<00:02:15.310> bending<00:02:15.520> over

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
really important if you're bending over

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.560 
really important if you're bending over
at<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:15.970> waist

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
at the waist

down and get in the car mode all this

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.470 
down and get in the car mode all this
stuff<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.400> going<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> be<00:02:21.670> concealed<00:02:22.120> while<00:02:22.390> i'm

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
stuff is going to be concealed while i'm

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.430 
stuff is going to be concealed while i'm
in<00:02:22.570> robot<00:02:22.959> mode

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
in robot mode

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.410 
in robot mode
but<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.250> would<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.520> what<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> bottom<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.330> the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
but this would be what the bottom of the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.390 
but this would be what the bottom of the
car<00:02:25.660> would<00:02:25.780> look<00:02:26.020> like<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.530> i<00:02:26.739> was<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.010> car<00:02:27.190> mode

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
car would look like if i was in car mode

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.300 
car would look like if i was in car mode
so<00:02:27.940> right<00:02:28.360> now<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.570> car<00:02:28.989> would<00:02:29.950> be<00:02:30.070> facing

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
so right now the car would be facing

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.250 
so right now the car would be facing
straight<00:02:30.700> up<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.030> down<00:02:31.060> normally<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.080> course

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
straight up and down normally of course

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.600 
straight up and down normally of course
it<00:02:32.440> would<00:02:32.560> be<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.860> ground<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.459> would

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
it would be on the ground and that would

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.600 
it would be on the ground and that would
be<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:34.000> exposed<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.600> ground<00:02:35.610> pieces

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
be just exposed to the ground pieces

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.430 
be just exposed to the ground pieces
like<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:36.910> are<00:02:37.120> added<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.480> quite<00:02:38.380> a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
like this are added in quite a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.160 
like this are added in quite a
protective<00:02:38.920> shield

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.589 

I<00:02:42.260> chose<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.130> go<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.430> route<00:02:43.580> because<00:02:44.240> it'll

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
I chose to go that route because it'll

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.530 
I chose to go that route because it'll
pop<00:02:44.810> right<00:02:45.050> off<00:02:45.110> then<00:02:45.620> pop<00:02:45.830> back<00:02:45.860> on<00:02:46.340> again<00:02:46.640> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
pop right off then pop back on again and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.660 
pop right off then pop back on again and
that<00:02:48.200> means<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.650> can<00:02:48.860> replace<00:02:49.160> batteries

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
that means that I can replace batteries

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.280 
that means that I can replace batteries
with<00:02:49.790> these<00:02:49.970> yet<00:02:50.390> it's<00:02:50.540> still<00:02:50.630> shielded<00:02:51.200> it

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
with these yet it's still shielded it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.870 
with these yet it's still shielded it
