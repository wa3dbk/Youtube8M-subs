00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.480
 they saw their people replaced through 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.460
 of the movements that sergio made

 sheppard 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.720
 aaron brown and philip jones however 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 the Mexican cadre knew how to do things 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.190
 after the first half to give 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.710
 the joy to the public of tepic nayarit 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.840
 but let's say where we've been 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.220
 quite erratic in the fluidity of 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.020
 attack game in the attack game 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.330
 we have to try to play more fluid 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.820
 but good was expected already expected 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.450
 because players need to have better 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.039
 level 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.340
 the team reacted very well in the 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.200
 second quarter and second half the truth 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.390
 that the team won and that's important 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.610
 very grateful to the people always 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.590
 supporting that is good for the team 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.299
 to gain confidence and the wta that you 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.130
 thanks, I think we're all in a 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.850
 little nervous of the beginning of those 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.470
 things are natural but then they are was 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.000
 a very good team too and they are 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.250
 competitive so well 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.539
 you also have to give him credit I think that 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.310
 we should not be calm because 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.569
 as I say all the teams are very 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.000
 good and we have to be prepared 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.830
 for them and then you have to look no further 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.349
 the game is again and see what 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.870
 we did wrong and then we improved them we lost 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.569
 much the ball we are what I in 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.430
 my opinion I think and they are things that 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.650
 we can do I think the team 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.390
 national will rest this weekend 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.450
 restoring next Sunday 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.890
 facing bahamas that fell 88 by 72 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.890
