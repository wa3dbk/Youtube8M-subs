00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.099
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.430
 Product videos presented once today 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.789
 the anti-slip clutch from al-ko 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.560
 namely the model aks 1300 the 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.840
 model name can be found here in 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.720
 rear area directly stamped on 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.619
 See the anti-skid clutch here 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.789
 we are fine 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.910
 the aks 1300 schnitzlers 100 kilos 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.890
 permissible total weight up to 1360 kilo 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.250
 and down here the ski clear symbol 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.510
 starting followed by the 800 eleven 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.210
 number that it is the spare parts 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.930
 Identification number 811 120 in 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.629
 this case 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.430
 what is this if you have spare parts 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.110
 For example, you need reports in 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.420
 this red handle or you need 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.440
 new friction pads down here 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.190
 then these spare parts will help you 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.600
 Identification number 811 120 continues 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.780
 Today's video is about it 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.530
 how is the application how to use 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.480
 these are as 1300 of al-ko to it 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:17.030
 only three steps are needed 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.880
 Manufacturer has these three steps to 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.530
 by the way, hook up and uncouple here on the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.550
 handle immortalized so you can do it too 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.950
 can not forget 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.990
 There are three steps in coupling and 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.940
 There are three steps when decoupling 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:35.510
 first the Hitching the the Clutch 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.870
 handle then open the wheel at the side 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.300
 Turn the wheel, this one is here by the way 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.360
 and then close the red lever and 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.930
 when opening exactly the opposite 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.760
 red lever open the wheel and turn 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.280
 open the clutch handle 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.740
 how it looks in practice, I lead 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.290
 Introduce him now 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.050
 Suppose you want yours now 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.030
 trailer to take on your car 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.490
 let's say it's your car, I mean one 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.209
 ball bolts then they have once 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.989
 to open the clutch handle 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:13.299
 smith 1 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.639
 then along with these red levers 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.200
 They also have to couple that simulate 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.799
 I now in which I this ball 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.579
 bolt here a lead thereby snaps the 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.500
 Clutch handle already down and 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.689
 we also have the green indicator here 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.629
 that the ball bolt properly caught 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:34.930
 that is right in there and now 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.939
 what we do now is the 2 that 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.859
 is this wheel turning that can be 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.499
 turn in clockwise without 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.319
 Turn it out to turn on like it did 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:51.819
 pure and that's how far it's starting to get 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:53.739
 crack like the tank cap of your car 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.269
 he is nothing unless it then 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.139
 they can also stop cracking 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.599
 with turn then it is okay 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.299
 in fact, we have tension now 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.209
 given on the lateral pressure bolts 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.900
 and the last step is this one 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.139
 red lever strong with taste 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.909
 suppress 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.009
 this will put the last pressure on the 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.949
 given lateral pressure bolt and 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:21.150
 now the ball is left and right with 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:24.849
 The three occupy with the pressure bolt 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.709
 curious and that's exactly how we have it 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.709
 also done 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.870
 So we have the clutch handle 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.000
 then we have open on coupled 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.449
 the wheel reingedreht-clockwise 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.169
 and pressed down the red lever and 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.120
 to open 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.560
 we go the other way around before they 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.500
 perpendicular to the right side 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:49.599
 Pictured the red pry up 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.239
 the red council this time against the clock 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.400
 that's where the wheel comes in 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.769
 then here also something out solve it 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.040
 the pressure bolts turn and they turn 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.900
 as far up as it gets 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.150
 Here is your decision and now you can 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.780
 open the clutch handle and the 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:13.409
 trailer of iranian clutch 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.409
 disconnect it would be like that 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.090
 and I thank you a lot for looking this 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.090
 It was already thank you very much 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.560
