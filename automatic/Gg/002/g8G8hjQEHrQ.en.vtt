have<00:04:24.580> been<00:04:24.729> slightly<00:04:25.120> compromised<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.440> just

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
have been slightly compromised it just

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.420 
have been slightly compromised it just
doesn't<00:04:26.919> have<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.190> same<00:04:27.430> cheeky<00:04:27.970> character

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
doesn't have the same cheeky character

sadly<00:04:30.430> for<00:04:30.580> some<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:30.940> us<00:04:31.090> even<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:32.320> mini

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
sadly for some of us even the mini

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.969 
sadly for some of us even the mini
5-door<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.310> going<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.639> be<00:04:33.789> a<00:04:33.940> bit<00:04:34.210> too<00:04:34.510> mini<00:04:35.139> but

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
5-door is going to be a bit too mini but

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.770 
5-door is going to be a bit too mini but
overall<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.370> think<00:04:36.760> they've<00:04:36.880> taken<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.570> very

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
overall I think they've taken the very

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.300 
overall I think they've taken the very
