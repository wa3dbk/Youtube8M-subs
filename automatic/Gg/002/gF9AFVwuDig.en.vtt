fifth another guest page it's a fastball
and<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:36.060> one<00:03:36.450> could<00:03:37.410> be<00:03:37.920> doesn't<00:03:38.819> have<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
distinction no so we're gonna get at

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.300 
distinction no so we're gonna get at
