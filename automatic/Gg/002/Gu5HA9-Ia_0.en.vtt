00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.960
 nassetta happiness to know how much 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.360

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.619
 had to pass the wrong psg you never say 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.270
 clown ronaldo and messi are null 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.070
 never had to, so you have to say that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.900
 league 2 or league 1 guys are 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.220
 multiple but messi he is never read le 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 this is a scandal 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.789
 aulas can swing to balance balance 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.050
 besides the latest news these 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.400
 fevad islands on valves he would have had a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.449
 offer of charlie hebdo right now and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.109
 anyway and the world to find 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.700
 have to recruit 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 he even maybe because he loves me 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.610
 poems postulate I think because there is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.020
 still there he has style really 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.520
 dance goes in this street in his writing 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.840
 he can also I think they can 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.309
 apply to Cirque du Soleil 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.660
 because he knows how to do 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.860
 twirls and play the pip because 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.480
 excuse me I'm listening to you and everything to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 the time on the box and it was great 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.960
 when he swore that lacazette will leave 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 not I think if we had to if we 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.719
 had to put a team of all 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.860
 guys who should not leave and who are 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.940
 gone for it won league of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.250
 champions jean-michel aulas bad 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.620
 rebounds and he especially said that the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.969
 lawn was a trash then there the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.390
 excuse me yes so if he asked a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.129
 trash can 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.510
 ok but the lawn of geoffroy-guichard 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.670
 if it's a garbage can I look there 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.299
 had oranges bricks and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.060
 paper balls 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.170
 all in the same bin encircled 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.930
 but what are they called the greens he 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.299
 do not even have the sorting segal not 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.009
 possible you are so reveals the wall he 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.540
 must not sort through their trash it 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.220
 serves to undermine the green so I 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.390
 think the bresse pauwels and that's it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.650
 that if you see that he thinks the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.930
 lawn is a trash at least you 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.720
 tries td does it's the minimum 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.900
 and then we learned that ben arfa 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.700
 would not play with nice ah yes disgusted and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 we'll talk about it just now 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.130
 refuse a potential offer the real 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.200
 madrid the pretty girl capital 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.400
 short is that nice has tried everything pen 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 did not go down at all if for the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.790
 play but forget one last thing 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.680
 the last thing that would have walked in front of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.939
 any court is that the the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.979
 law is that you do not have the right to 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.659
 play with three football teams in the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.759
 same year but but let's not 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.200

 take their last 10 games 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.850
 bring to court but you win it's 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.899
 not at all a team of nice mistakes and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.920
 unfortunately they did not think 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.180
 and that's considered as a whole to 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.189
 Julian time 20:20 in a few 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.869

 dream qatar has to a 1,400 million euros 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.860
 that's how he put a shot of 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.910
 pressure in the match he said 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.080

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.690

 or the players irritations and I say 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.480
 bravo must do it because censor 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.860
 poker what he did live 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.440
 this is called doing carpet with 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.820
 1,2 and 1,7 in my camp are I know 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.400
 that everyone can play the guys I 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.750
 do carpet if we can win with that 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.900

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.800
 the year otherwise you know that so to the jet 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.900
 a month ago I still heard 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.890
 rumors of coaches nes to go back to 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.790
 paris and then 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.380
 but because I think that everything 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.370
 simply jedi has imposed on bastien 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.320
 he does not have the level for a club like 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.430
 bastia he needs playing time then 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.480
 the guys are saying we're going to lend it to 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.770
 paris saint germain the wrong they 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.390
 get tough are a little club 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.090

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.870
 makelele he failed to bastia too 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.090
 big clubs 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.220

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.600
 were not very comfortable with that 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.980
 because the football world compared to 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.910
