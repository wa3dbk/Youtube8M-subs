00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.130
 and me 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.680
 hi how are you I hope you are very 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.440
 Well, this time I'm going to 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.750
 show how I'm going to do my retouching on 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.080
 the set I already have a little bit of 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.210
 growth on my nails then this and 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.370
 how I wanted to change design I'm going 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.530
 take advantage to do the retouching what 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.100
 first thing I did was remove the pebbles 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.989
 that I had in my two fingers and now with 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.970
 my drill I will remove what is the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.870
 enamel and the third dimension 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:03.489
 I'm going to use the carbay tip for 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.399
 do this and start filing what 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.950
 It's all my nail as I say I 'm going to 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.649
 Remove all the decoration that I already had 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.820
 with enamel and it is also very important 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.369
 remove what is the brightness because as 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.539
 let's put another acrylic capita 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.539
 so that it adheres well 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.479
 everything that was the decoration that brought 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.700
 like pebbles and that's what I took them with 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.850
 some tiles that call them 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.740
 a nail clipper this nothing else presses 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.740
 a little bit and easy it comes out 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.160
 here since most of the enamel in 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.110
 my hands but I did not get to the 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.800
 cuticle area because I do not have it 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.380
 a lot of skill to the dril and the tip carbay 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.200
 then to avoid this any 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.410
 cut or something like I prefer not to get 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.650
 up to the cuticle area and I what 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.640
 I do is put my drill and lower and raise 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.340
 and I do it again and always 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.860
 I do this not in the same place if I do not go 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.380
 turning my finger this so it does not 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.350
 warm the tip by friction and I 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.980
 I'm going to warm up my girl and I can get there 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.650
 to burn there I changed these little barrels 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.570
 to be able to make the cuticle area 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.910
 since as I say this one I do not 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.760
 He grabbed his little hand well and I'm scared 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.330
 the tip to carvalho then I prefer 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.170
 use these sandpaper kegs in the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.170
 cuticle area 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.750
 since it removes well what is the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.930
 enamel here I show you that I do not have 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.090
 nothing rising that's why I'm going 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.069
 to do the retouching 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.080
 as you can see there and now with a lime 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.290
 180 I'm going to 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.600
 to remove the brightness of what my area is 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.170
 of cuticle to do again the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.170
 application 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.300
 since I took off the clean powder with 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:43.050
 a cotton quoted with alcohol and now I'm going 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.050
 to put my first in the cuticle area 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.049
 I'm going to start putting a little pearl 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.459
 acrylic glass and all my nails the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.110
 I will 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.300
 to retouch with acrylic glass since 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.199
 how am I going to put enamel on the part of 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.280
 up then the two nails that I have with 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:36.280
 acrylic color no 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.590
 I do not need you anymore, you can put it 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.090
 acrylic because I'm going to cover it with 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.370
 the enamel took a small pearl a 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.590
 little more humid than normal for 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.889
 can work well in the area of 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.419
 cuticle filling what is my 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.720
 growth and mud backwards I by 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:02.650
 the regular I hardly ever do a retouch 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.500
 in a set because most of the time 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.630
 I have a little bit of lifting and when 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.220
 I already have uprising I do not like 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.350
 touch up I know that if we put the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.900
 punta carvalho we can cut that 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.540
 bit that got up but to me in what 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.790
 I do not like that retouching 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.460
 I had a lift but in this case 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.210
 as I did not have anything uprising by 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.210
 I did that 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.449
 since I put my acrylic now I'm going to 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:42.330
 file to finish sealing well my 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.139
 cuticle area 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.180
 and if I stay some chubby like 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.060
 you know not all nails grow 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.400
 same for example I my two fingers 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.099
 thumbs these almost did not have 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.250
 lifting but the other fingers if 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:02.870
 they had forgiveness growth but the others 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.870
 fingers if they had a little more 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:09.649
 now dusted and clean with a 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.619
 gauze and alcohol and that's how it should be 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:15.259
 see you should not see the union between the 

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:16.729
 application that we already brought and the new 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.300
 application 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.669
 to see as if we had just put the 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.249
 Acrylic on the entire nail I'm going to 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.880
 use this enamel that is this brand 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:30.960
 in gel 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.500
 it's special for acrylic something like 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.650
 those of fantasy nice 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.260
 and I'm going to put it on all my nails the 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.210
 I really wanted something simple for 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:45.380
 that I decided nothing else to put them 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.380
 pure enamel 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:11.970
 and if for some reason I got to stain 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:15.090
 on the sides clean with acetone and so is 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.040
 how is my being does not finish it 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.530
 clean up but you already know 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.590
 that being enamel at the time we 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.450
 we wash our hands or we wet them because 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.940
 ends that fall that adheres to the 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.920
 I hope you like it, do not forget 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.850
 subscribe see you in the next 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.850
 video see you later 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.930
 but he was preparing everything wrong
