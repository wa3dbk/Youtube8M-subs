my neurons so I have both of those and I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.639 
my neurons so I have both of those and I
enjoy<00:01:52.399> using<00:01:52.639> them<00:01:52.969> both<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.479> think<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.319> key

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
enjoy using them both I think the key

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.649 
enjoy using them both I think the key
thing<00:01:54.679> to<00:01:55.039> remember<00:01:55.369> whenever<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.359> want<00:01:56.569> to

program<00:04:51.819> if<00:04:52.270> you<00:04:52.389> buy<00:04:52.569> it<00:04:52.629> for<00:04:52.930> one<00:04:53.169> user<00:04:53.439> is

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
program if you buy it for one user is

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.719 
program if you buy it for one user is
395<00:04:54.669> for<00:04:54.939> two<00:04:55.090> users<00:04:55.479> it's<00:04:56.050> 500<00:04:56.949> and<00:04:57.490> that's

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
395 for two users it's 500 and that's

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.700 
395 for two users it's 500 and that's
the<00:04:57.909> auditory<00:04:58.419> version<00:04:58.840> they<00:04:58.930> have<00:04:59.139> a<00:04:59.169> new<00:04:59.530> one

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
the auditory version they have a new one

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.830 
the auditory version they have a new one
out<00:04:59.860> called<00:05:00.219> insight<00:05:00.819> which<00:05:01.180> your<00:05:01.360> works<00:05:01.599> with

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
out called insight which your works with

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.260 
out called insight which your works with
the<00:05:01.990> visual<00:05:02.969> neurons<00:05:03.969> in<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.240> visual

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
the visual neurons in the visual

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.330 
the visual neurons in the visual
circuits<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.259> I'm<00:05:05.409> not<00:05:05.590> sure<00:05:05.830> what<00:05:06.009> the<00:05:06.099> price

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
circuits and I'm not sure what the price

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.430 
circuits and I'm not sure what the price
is<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.729> that<00:05:06.909> so<00:05:07.629> again<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.110> have<00:05:08.169> two

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
is on that so again you have two

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.230 
is on that so again you have two
different<00:05:08.740> approaches<00:05:09.190> to<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.430> same<00:05:09.669> process

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
different approaches to the same process

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.600 
different approaches to the same process
brain<00:05:10.840> fitness<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.469> enjoy<00:05:11.919> both<00:05:12.129> of<00:05:12.340> them<00:05:12.490> I

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
brain fitness I enjoy both of them I

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.499 
brain fitness I enjoy both of them I
like<00:05:12.849> them<00:05:13.060> both

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
like them both

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.240 
like them both
I<00:05:13.539> like<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.500> research<00:05:14.979> about<00:05:15.370> both<00:05:15.639> of<00:05:15.849> them

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
I like the research about both of them

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.119 
I like the research about both of them
so<00:05:18.250> well<00:05:18.819> goodbye<00:05:19.419> it's<00:05:19.629> Friday<00:05:19.870> afternoon
