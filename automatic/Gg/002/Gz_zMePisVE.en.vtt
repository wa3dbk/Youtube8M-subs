especially<00:00:14.490> when<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.030> nuclear's<00:00:15.420> i

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
especially when going for nuclear's i

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.090 
especially when going for nuclear's i
can<00:00:15.929> hit<00:00:16.049> fire<00:00:16.289> cuz<00:00:16.500> i'm<00:00:16.560> gonna<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.920> like

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
can hit fire cuz i'm gonna have like

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.010 
can hit fire cuz i'm gonna have like
tons<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.490> orbital<00:00:17.850> vsat<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.630> anyways

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
tons of orbital vsat is going up anyways

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
tons of orbital vsat is going up anyways
when<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> lot<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.070> orbital<00:00:20.490> vsat<00:00:20.609> is

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
when you have a lot of orbital vsat is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.519 
when you have a lot of orbital vsat is
going<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.570> pre<00:00:21.810> aim<00:00:21.990> around<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
going up you can just pre aim around the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.870 
going up you can just pre aim around the
corners<00:00:22.830> or<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.279> hit<00:00:23.400> far<00:00:23.609> like<00:00:23.789> i

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
corners or you can just hit far like i

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.460 
corners or you can just hit far like i
was<00:00:24.000> doing<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.240> i<00:00:24.359> did<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.660> guy<00:00:24.840> right<00:00:25.410> here

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
was doing like i did this guy right here

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.620 
was doing like i did this guy right here
and<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> pretty<00:00:26.369> quick<00:00:26.640> nuclear

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and this was a pretty quick nuclear

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.419 
and this was a pretty quick nuclear
three<00:00:27.900> minutes<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> map<00:00:28.590> raid<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.250> i<00:00:29.310> was

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
three minutes on the map raid and i was

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.740 
three minutes on the map raid and i was
just<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.699> balls<00:00:29.880> deep<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:30.420> kids<00:00:30.630> i

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
just going balls deep on these kids i

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.209 
just going balls deep on these kids i
mean<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.109> nothing<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.769> explained

also i want to give you guys some tips
for<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.410> nuclear<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.250> first<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
for going nuclear so first of all you

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
for going nuclear so first of all you
have<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> use<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.480> c4<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:36.930> using<00:00:37.530> non-lethal

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
have to use the c4 and using non-lethal

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.160 
have to use the c4 and using non-lethal
make<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> nuclear<00:00:39.030> ways<00:00:39.809> you're

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
make going for the nuclear ways you're

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.830 
make going for the nuclear ways you're
using<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.559> UAV<00:00:41.070> counter<00:00:41.399> orbital<00:00:41.879> UAV<00:00:42.570> helps

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
using that UAV counter orbital UAV helps

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
using that UAV counter orbital UAV helps
you<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> counter<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you get to the counter and then the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.410 
you get to the counter and then the
counter<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> course<00:00:44.730> helps<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
counter of course helps you get to the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.479 
counter of course helps you get to the
orbital<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.469> buy<00:00:46.590> known<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.280> do

orbital if you don't buy known if you do
not<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.879> by<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> UAV<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
not know by now if you have a UAV and a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.830 
not know by now if you have a UAV and a
counter<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.550> give<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.850> assist<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
counter up and give you assist so it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
ranked up really fast using this method

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
ranked up really fast using this method
this<00:01:09.180> wall<00:01:09.390> also<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.530> you're<00:01:10.650> using<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
this wall also when you're using this

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.590 
this wall also when you're using this
method<00:01:11.430> make<00:01:11.580> sure<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.880> try<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> cycle

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
method make sure you try to cycle

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.060 
method make sure you try to cycle
through<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.930> v<00:01:13.049> sets<00:01:13.290> make<00:01:13.770> sure<00:01:13.799> you're

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
through your v sets make sure you're

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
through your v sets make sure you're
calling<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.640> abs<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.360> counters

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
calling your you abs and your counters

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
calling your you abs and your counters
and<00:01:16.020> orbitals<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.710> soon<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.310> them

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and orbitals as soon as you get in them

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399 
and orbitals as soon as you get in them
because<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.090> seems<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.450> when<00:01:18.540> i<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.720> my<00:01:18.869> UAV

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
might die one awful orbital and then

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
might die one awful orbital and then
that<00:01:26.580> orbital<00:01:26.939> might<00:01:27.119> lead<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> dying<00:01:27.840> off
