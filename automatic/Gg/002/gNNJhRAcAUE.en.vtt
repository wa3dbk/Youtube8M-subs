00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.310 
wasn't just gonna slap the Suburbia line
on<00:01:47.970> any<00:01:48.149> old<00:01:48.329> game<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.810> knew<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.049> gonna<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
on any old game so I knew is gonna be a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.859 
on any old game so I knew is gonna be a
game<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> did<00:01:50.369> worry<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.240> maybe<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.750> would

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
game but I did worry that maybe it would

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.380 
game but I did worry that maybe it would
lose<00:01:52.140> some<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.560> its<00:01:52.710> personality<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> become

lose some of its personality and become

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.870 
lose some of its personality and become
a<00:01:54.420> little<00:01:54.630> bit<00:01:54.810> more<00:01:55.020> abstract<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.729> am

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
a little bit more abstract and I am

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.480 
a little bit more abstract and I am
happy<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> say<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.530> case<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
happy to say that is not the case at the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.999

I<00:02:44.580> was<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:44.910> happy<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.020> did<00:02:46.230> not<00:02:46.440> become

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
I was so happy that this did not become

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.100 
I was so happy that this did not become
drier<00:02:47.640> even<00:02:48.239> though<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.510> did<00:02:48.660> lose<00:02:48.840> some<00:02:48.870> of

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
drier even though it did lose some of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.630 
drier even though it did lose some of
the<00:02:49.200> personality<00:02:49.709> in<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.830> form<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.100> its<00:02:50.250> tiles

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the personality in the form of its tiles

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.610 
the personality in the form of its tiles
and<00:02:51.570> then<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.840> top<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.470> already

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
and then on top of that like I already

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.280 
and then on top of that like I already
said<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.430> gameplay<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.000> fantastic<00:02:54.269> there<00:02:55.170> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
said the gameplay is fantastic there is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.650 
said the gameplay is fantastic there is
so<00:02:55.620> much<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.040> think<00:02:56.250> about<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:57.120> much<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.450> brain

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
so much to think about so much the brain

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.750 
so much to think about so much the brain
burn<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.290> fact<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:58.739> anything<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.340> would<00:02:59.730> say

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
burn on in fact if anything I would say

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.430 
burn on in fact if anything I would say
subdivision<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.510> maybe<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.959> little<00:03:01.230> bit

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
subdivision is maybe a little bit

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.229 
subdivision is maybe a little bit
heavier<00:03:01.830> than<00:03:02.070> suburbia

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
heavier than suburbia

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.970 
heavier than suburbia
so<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.840> mean<00:03:03.959> at<00:03:04.019> least<00:03:04.110> I've<00:03:04.470> certainly<00:03:04.709> found

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
so I mean at least I've certainly found

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.030 
so I mean at least I've certainly found
gen<00:03:05.400> suffers<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:07.140> know<00:03:07.230> some<00:03:07.709> ap<00:03:10.040> outbursts

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
gen suffers you know some ap outbursts

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.509 
gen suffers you know some ap outbursts
in<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.489> game<00:03:11.700> more<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.330> suburbia<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
in this game more so in the suburbia and

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.100 
in this game more so in the suburbia and
it's<00:03:14.519> because<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.420> much<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.870> think

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
it's because there is so much to think

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.390 
it's because there is so much to think
about<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.950> game<00:03:17.190> has<00:03:17.370> such<00:03:17.700> an<00:03:17.910> incredible

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
about this game has such an incredible

about this game has such an incredible

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
but just it's a smart move if somebody

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.250

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
subdivision and then you take all the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.370 
subdivision and then you take all the
other<00:05:13.430> part<00:05:13.700> you<00:05:13.880> take<00:05:14.300> all<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.840> civic<00:05:15.169> zone

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380

tiles<00:05:15.680> out<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.370> game<00:05:16.580> so<00:05:17.120> you<00:05:17.180> won't<00:05:17.419> be

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
tiles out of the game so you won't be

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.210 
tiles out of the game so you won't be
able<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.630> build<00:05:17.810> any<00:05:17.990> other<00:05:18.139> parks<00:05:18.500> and

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
suddenly that creates an entirely new

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.140 
suddenly that creates an entirely new
interesting<00:05:21.889> puzzle<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.729> gets<00:05:22.910> layered

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
if you can see it you build a line of

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.580 
if you can see it you build a line of
lakes<00:05:32.240> that<00:05:32.389> literally<00:05:32.870> cuts<00:05:33.200> through<00:05:33.440> your
