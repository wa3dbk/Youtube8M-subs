are we've got a few different kinds I've
already<00:00:35.040> started<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> glitter

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
already started here with the glitter

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.600 
already started here with the glitter
ones<00:00:36.450> nice<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> girly<00:00:37.350> we've<00:00:38.100> gone<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
ones nice and girly we've gone for the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.669 
ones nice and girly we've gone for the
megabytes<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.539> the<00:00:39.989> crying<00:00:40.289> because<00:00:40.440> that's

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
megabytes on the crying because that's

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.599 
megabytes on the crying because that's
where<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.920> want<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.160> lot<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.429> volume<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:43.609> think

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
where we want a lot of volume I think

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.639 
where we want a lot of volume I think
because<00:00:45.449> their<00:00:45.629> hair<00:00:45.780> straight<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.230> fine

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
because their hair straight and fine

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
because their hair straight and fine
this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> give<00:00:47.429> her<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.640> effect<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
this is going to give her the effect of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.899 
this is going to give her the effect of
really<00:00:49.379> nice<00:00:49.530> points<00:00:49.949> of<00:00:50.100> hair<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:50.730> just

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
doing it slow for the first one but then

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.270 
doing it slow for the first one but then
we'll<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> wee<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:01.499> quicker<00:01:01.769> pop<00:01:02.069> of<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
we'll get a wee bit quicker pop of the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.070 
we'll get a wee bit quicker pop of the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
obviously if I kept them on a lot longer

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.520 
obviously if I kept them on a lot longer
be<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.210> whole<00:03:19.450> lot<00:03:19.480> more<00:03:19.810> movement<00:03:21.960> is<00:03:22.960> part

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
be a whole lot more movement is part

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.710 
be a whole lot more movement is part
you<00:03:24.160> can<00:03:24.280> even<00:03:24.400> twist<00:03:24.790> them<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.209> take<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.510> mind

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
you can even twist them to take the mind

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.970 
you can even twist them to take the mind
like<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.230> encourage<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.890> curd<00:03:27.130> okay<00:03:28.980> and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
like that to encourage the curd okay and

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.730 
like that to encourage the curd okay and
that<00:03:30.220> way<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.520> actually<00:03:31.060> really<00:03:31.720> easy

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.680 

again<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.490> is<00:03:37.670> only<00:03:37.790> after<00:03:38.210> a<00:03:38.240> few<00:03:38.510> minutes

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
again this is only after a few minutes

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.380 
again this is only after a few minutes
of<00:03:38.930> them<00:03:39.140> BNN<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:40.520> you<00:03:40.610> could<00:03:40.760> imagine<00:03:40.820> what

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
of them BNN so you could imagine what

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.930 
of them BNN so you could imagine what
the<00:03:41.630> recommend<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.230> time<00:03:42.470> would<00:03:42.680> do

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:04:03.900
