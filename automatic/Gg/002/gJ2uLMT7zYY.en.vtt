00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.270
 I want to share some singles 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.779
 tips to make your garden look better 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.779
 Come with me please 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.760
 The main advantages of having a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.190
 arranged garden are that it does much more 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.350
 nice a house so much for your 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.360
 inhabitants as for the people that you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.940
 visit and avoid animals 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.940
 unpleasant or dangerous live in it 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.720
 with this video I do not pretend that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.570
 replace the services of a gardener 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.090
 professional when needed but the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 regular maintenance is easy and cheap 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.570
 to do besides that it helps you 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.570
 develop patience 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.990
 as always, safety comes first 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.750
 and to avoid injuries or pickets of 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 plants or animals of preference 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.439
 thick leather gloves 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.450
 to make room for yourself you can start 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.270
 accommodating the trees or shrubs that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 have invaded the grass area either 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.930
 supporting them or holding the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.990
 if you are going to hold them you can use cardboard 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.120
 string and knife the cardboard will prevent 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.630
 the rope hurts the plant you're going to 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.630
 hold 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.340
 the plants are heavy make sure that the 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.700
 string resists the weight and hold it 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.119
 something firm like a fence wall or trees 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.119
 bigger 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.740
 now removes all the herbs that 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.720
 invade the grass area is better 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.840
 tear them with the hand that cut them 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.830
 because that will take more time before 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.830
 let them grow back 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.909
 also remove the stones that you could 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.909
 knock when mowing the lawn 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.680
 now yes using clipper scissors 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.680
 cut the grass 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.439
 again with the scissors or with a 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.890
 short brush cutter where the mower does not 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.890
 enters 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.290
 to delimit the grass uses a shovel 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.870
 of gardener who will serve as a knife 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.200
 on the banks of the garden and around 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.200
 the trees 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.700
 be careful near the trees not 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.900
 hits very deep because you could 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.900
 hurt the roots 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.050
 depending on the style of your garden 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.840
 you can replace the stones 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.760
 around the trees to delimit 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.760
 the grass and highlight the tree 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.780
 finally clean the roads around 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.780
 of the garden so that they look 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.630
 some gardeners recommend leaving the 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.240
 grass that was cut to serve as 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.370
 fertilizer to the new pasture others that 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.740
 raked to make it look neat 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.740
 immediately the option is yours 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.440
