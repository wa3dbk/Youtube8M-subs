00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.670 
me
so<00:00:35.000> first<00:00:36.000> refueling<00:00:36.600> that's<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.899> stage<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so first refueling that's a stage one is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.729 
so first refueling that's a stage one is
over<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.719> remember<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:40.200> down<00:00:40.500> the

over and remember not down the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.160 
over and remember not down the
kilometers<00:00:41.309> before<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.390> laid<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.989> that's

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
kilometers before if you laid so that's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.790 
kilometers before if you laid so that's
the<00:00:43.350> bill<00:00:43.500> 2001<00:00:44.250> 1<00:00:44.399> 24<00:00:45.000> 28<00:00:45.329> point<00:00:45.629> 4<00:00:46.320> 1<00:00:46.469> litres

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.410 
the bill 2001 1 24 28 point 4 1 litres
of<00:00:46.950> refueling<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:47.940> important<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
of refueling so it's very important to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.029 
of refueling so it's very important to
note<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> initial<00:00:49.110> kilometers<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
note the initial kilometers that is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.680 
note the initial kilometers that is
forty<00:00:50.969> three<00:00:51.000> thousand<00:00:52.460> 281<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
forty three thousand 281 so now the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.189 
forty three thousand 281 so now the
sensor<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> showing<00:00:56.129> full<00:00:56.430> fuel<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
sensor is showing full fuel because I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.220 
sensor is showing full fuel because I
have<00:00:58.469> refueled<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.280> now<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
have refueled it right now so now the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.850 
have refueled it right now so now the
stage<00:01:01.469> two<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> happen<00:01:02.730> that's<00:01:03.059> how

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
stage two is going to happen that's how

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.679 
stage two is going to happen that's how
this<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.220> tabulated<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
this can be tabulated now you use the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.410 
this can be tabulated now you use the
vehicle<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> when<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> fuel<00:01:08.580> has<00:01:09.090> got

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
vehicle and when the fuel has got

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.020 
vehicle and when the fuel has got
consumed<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.380> need<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> refuel<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> again<00:01:11.520> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
consumed you need to refuel it again so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
consumed you need to refuel it again so
before<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> second<00:01:12.960> refueling<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.710> need<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
before the second refueling you need to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.179 
before the second refueling you need to
note<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:15.000> kilometers<00:01:15.509> again<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.950> see

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
note the kilometers again so you can see

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
note the kilometers again so you can see
the<00:01:17.369> second<00:01:17.700> stage<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.090> happening<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the second stage is happening there is a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.800 
the second stage is happening there is a
second<00:01:19.110> refueling<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.880> doing<00:01:21.630> an

which<00:02:14.159> helped<00:02:14.849> me<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:14.970> travel<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.540> 373

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
which helped me to travel is 373

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.530 
which helped me to travel is 373
kilometers<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.580> fuel<00:02:17.849> economy<00:02:17.970> equals

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
kilometers so the fuel economy equals

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.839 
kilometers so the fuel economy equals
373<00:02:19.349> divided<00:02:19.650> by<00:02:19.830> twenty<00:02:20.220> five<00:02:20.370> point<00:02:20.640> seven

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
373 divided by twenty five point seven

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.970 
373 divided by twenty five point seven
six<00:02:21.150> equals<00:02:21.510> fourteen<00:02:21.870> point<00:02:22.110> four<00:02:22.440> three<00:02:22.680> per

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
six equals fourteen point four three per

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.039 
six equals fourteen point four three per
litre<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.909> is<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> bit<00:02:24.239> old<00:02:24.420> vehicle<00:02:24.900> so

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
litre so this is a bit old vehicle so

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.539 
litre so this is a bit old vehicle so
that's<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.470> fuel<00:02:25.709> economy<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:26.280> getting

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
that's the fuel economy you're getting
