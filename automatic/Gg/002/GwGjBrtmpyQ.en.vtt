00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.110
 hi everyone my name is Artem loved and in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.880
 This video will tell you the general rules for 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.769
 fine haircuts 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.080
 But the fact is that many clients 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.929
 interested many people ask and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.550
 many masters and ask me on 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.800
 of my workshops how does working with 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.890
 thin hair and here in this video I'm like 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.429
 time I will tell these general rules the first 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.730
 the rule is about the optimal choice 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.629
 optimal length the fact is that many 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.579
 believe 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.769
 girl what if she has thin hair 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.710
 and they will grow it in length 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.480
 will be more and it will seem that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.280
 a lot of them in fact it is not so 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.289
 because the fact is that when the hair 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.539
 thin and they are longer 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.710
 then it becomes more noticeable that they 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.199
 really thin 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.269
 so choose the optimal one 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.219
 length maybe it will be several 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.399
 shorter but you can pick up the form and all 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.039
 will look very good the second 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.430
 rule the second rule is called 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.380
 pointing the fact is that the masters when 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.060
 perform haircut they use 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.950
 various techniques of slicing straight pointing 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.980
 many large number of cuts each 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.660
 of these cuts gives a certain 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.230
 certain effect so here's pointing 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.340
 when the cut is performed indirect not 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.200
 straight cut 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.270
 but here and so little teeth and 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 the amplitude of these cloves should be 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.370
 very small maybe there are three 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.650
 millimeter this cut just pointing 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:41.220
 will give the maximum volume of visual 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:44.820
 effect and rule third rule 3 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.240
 called just coming up right 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.870
 on the run 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.790
 graduation instead of layers the fact is that 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.340
 There is such a thing as a haircut in a haircut 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.340
 haircut techniques when doing so here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.290
 delay from 0 to 90 degrees it 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.100
 called graduation all that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.320
 gains volume the very mass of hair after 90 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 and further redirection is all this 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.039
 what is already called layers so here are the layers 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.980
 just working on ridding volume 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.150
 and graduation on mass accumulation here 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.219
 redirect this redirect from 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.319
 natural growth just this comes from 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.689
 weight loss 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.519
 and work with fine hair just 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.780
 need to work as much as possible on the set 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.780
 masses ie use all screeds up to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.970
 90 degrees all she aims at 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.450
 mass accumulation 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.090
 third rule fourth rule we have 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.150
 relates to hair coloring task 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.269
 This visually create a more volumetric 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.579
 hair look it can be achieved this way 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.159
 way to make hair roots 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.019
 paint a little deeper tone 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.780
 let this difference be compared with 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.639
 the main length will be 1 or 2 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.169
 tons but visually it will give a very 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.349
 good effect will look very 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:06.069
 natural and really visual 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.099
 a sense of volume will form the fifth 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.700
 the rule is called 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.319
 I do not know clean sidelocks called matter 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.409
 tom that here are the rim 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:21.400
 single strands which they are not 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:24.000
 give the desired result but 1 dense 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.599
 the line is beautifully matched here and 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.799
 frontal here on the neck give up 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.349
 The visual effect is good as if 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.989
 this tight rich line is good 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.209
 Here is such a result you need to strive for 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.250
 and get into the compartment if all these rules 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.109
 will use 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.699
 you will use or your master 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:47.349
 will use don't know who is watching 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:49.599
 this video then it will give just good 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.939
 results this is the general rule for 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.769
 work in haircuts with thin hair 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.049
 if you have any questions you 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.069
 you can ask them in the comments and I with 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.069
 goodbye to you bye 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.670
