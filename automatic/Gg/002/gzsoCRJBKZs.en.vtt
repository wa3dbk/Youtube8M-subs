 March winners and to get up to 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.969
 here at the grand finale they danced like this 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.840
 no more 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.840
 here 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.930

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.450
 dance now on this occasion one day to 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.800
 Diego is here today in his case in the 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.800
 great end of dancing 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.950
 says Carlos 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.880
 and let's go 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.880
 Y 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:01.250
 and with me please 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.990
 diego rodrigo without a doubt for me 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.700
 are one of the strongest candidates to 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.920
 take the prize this still does not 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.240
 it ends up missing a second round have 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.100
 a lot of attitude is in the rhythm in the 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.470
 blood are very connected very 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.930
 trailers a lot of synchronization too 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.410
 I also have a little question about the genre 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.780
 they danced cumbia 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.180
 because I saw several steps that also not 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.700
 They are cumbia but they did mix 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.090
 with cobra because his style is his seed 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.770
 but in general I think that the public 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.770
 It gives me the right to enjoy option or 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.180
 a wind to taste 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.010
 you know what kind of security they have 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.020
 you two to stand in the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.210
 scenario like two giants one 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.420
 coordination as if they were machines 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.910
 used you have a security 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.650
 they have an enviable pace that many 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.650
 we really want to match 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 Excellent 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.879
 and in the morning 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.750
 I have an ot thing I 'm going 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.750
 to do one thing 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.730
 ah almost stopped dancing the little bit that 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.290
 it will take your words 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:23.030
 there is one thing there is I stop to answer 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.030
 in how you dance sings 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.680
 I'm going to say it to clarify it because I 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.539
 I understand the doubt of the 'Latin lover' 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.949
 but you also have to think of a 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:40.529
 thing the whole of you is 5 and it's from 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.890
 true the fantasy that through the 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:47.580
 steps of kiko has danced 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.450
 what they have done tonight is really 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.610
 extraordinary what they have us 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.090
 accustomed with their presentation in 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.260
 sciences 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:03.680
 but but it means that he has won 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.410
 because another presentation is missing, not that 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.050
 site where I was very nervous and now 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.050
 comes the draw of all
