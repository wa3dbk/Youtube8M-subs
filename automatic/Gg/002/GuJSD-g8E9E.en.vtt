00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:15.320
 So I'm going to start the story from where 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.320
 Uh, bc, I'll start the story from the cause of Beijing for half a million years 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.880
 by the way 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.460
 Talking 500,000 years ago gives us 500,000 years of 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.039
 I do not need it. 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:33.940
 1 half an hour is enough . 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:35.829
 500,000 years ago, China did tell you what's there is what to 6 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.050
 I found it. 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:44.140
 So, What do you dry in Qing China Entebbe 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:50.229
 The mineral've tried to be collected 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:54.339
 This will invite the Swedish mineralogist in Western industrialized countries oh gardening 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:59.710
 There was a guy in the middle who said he could not come for a number. 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:01.449
 This man came to seek and verify the canvass caravan mineral jjaro mineral interests 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:09.689
 I did it. 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:09.689
 Yeah, and in 1923 I found some of those skull fragments. 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.590
 I find the hair of the skull 8 so that this person has two complete openings 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.289
 I'm guessing. 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.539
 In 1926, I now go to the academia report 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:29.750
 Whether it is stable or not 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:33.979
 I plan on finding the skull not specified complete skull die along the lines of a lining 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.979
 What about the Chinese reserves 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.939
 Each of them is excavated in China, so maybe that skull is coming in. 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.619
 even if 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.500
 We will appear in front of our Chinese people without appearing in front of Xiang . 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.530
 I think I had a decision. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.140
 What is the story that Peking 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:02.929
 Next to him when Beijing won its bright that it burned a trail 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.829
 * Then when hyenas elephants and sea lions animal bones found these things 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.209
 It was. 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.619
 So that they spread sheet mwonyamyeon it was determined that Mr. Tan on fire fire 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.849
 You used it. 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.760
 The first thing I used a pro is that I cooked meer meat first . 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.379
 Whether it will affect the eating cooked there 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.379
 You guys have a good idea. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:31.160
 I've hometown favorite one tank war inde meat 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:34.070
 Once the meat in my hometown de Cirrus come from eating raw meat to cross 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:40.250
 I mean, you know, 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.940
 Sikineunde did that digestion can be written to, such as the right energy to be energy 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.170
 I have it 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:50.450
 The development of the brain where excess energy is ganeunya 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.040
 And then we have more raw meat to enjoy . 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.560
 He gave it to me. 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.600
 I enjoy it less. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.050
 Yes, so please be more gentle . 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.160
 Maybe I should get less than an animal protein intake. 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.660
 The intake of domesticated animal protein is very helpful in human brain development. 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.770
 I gave it a lot. 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:17.630
 And then eating this gold meat 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.150
 Less power to plant . Because newspapers have less power, these two 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.390
 Dog bone 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.670
 Joe and compost in a sense, is thinner 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:32.989
 I do not need a two-river school. It's thinning, then my muscles are thin. 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.040
 Step on me. So these two spaces are enough to keep the brain bigger. 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:40.379
 The class is huge 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:46.080
 Then the Alba Sore muscles inside the mouth of these increases required 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:49.560
 Sore wojyeo interval is widened to free the tongue moves when I say so 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:57.030
 Blossomed this mean you will be able to say 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:02.549
 So I think this is part 2 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:06.540
 This is a close relationship now. So it's time to be human. 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:10.109
 Until I use fire more and more what is before it 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:15.299
 It was just another service that had to be the same and dealt with. 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:20.489
 While using the unit. What Can I vary the prestige and little animals 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:23.849
 Appears a little different growth jigetjyo inaction in cases yet ever varying characteristics Brain 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:29.220
 This is the Paleolithic story. 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:33.380
 After the Paleolithic Age, it is the Neolithic Age. 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:39.389
 The Neolithic era is said to be the general Neolithic age from 10,000 years ago 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.830
 Neolithic era young bc 5 thousand years BC 3000 years Neolithic cc electricity 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.889
 It's 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.210
 In the Neolithic era , 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:51.110
 First of all, does it differ from stoneware? 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:56.930
 When we look for the Paleolithic age, we do a lot when we take college exams. 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:05:00.770
 Mix it up. Give me my kittens. The stones that are mixed again are torn down to the ground. 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:05.810
 Let's pick a land in the middle of it and give it to me. 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:08.660
 Momentum comes in a personal letter Electric's human right mix Can I use the welcoming stone 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.280
 You're grinding to make tools . 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.420
 So when you create a tool, you have to be masked for the direction you know everything 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.159
 Will it 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.949
 Ginger is starting to think strategically. 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:26.060
 Even if you buy stones, do not go all in. 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.930
 I think this pro-Japanese enough to the strategy's districts this strategy occurred 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.830
 Lost 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:36.439
 That's what happened. It's because of the fire. 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:41.029
 So, now that you are using the stalagmite and then 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:46.249
 What are some of the symbols found in artifacts ? 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:49.129
 The paintings of the Paleolithic period painted the cow in a straight line. 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:53.190
 By the way, when the neolithic electricity comes in 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:56.580
 It's as an abstraction. 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:02.580
 It's a geometric shape and theft. 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:06.900
 The fact that I painted it as an abstraction means that it is not just an expression, 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:09.960
 I do not mean four. 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:17.030
 What is the use of geometric shapes? 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:24.380
 I was able to tie them up by type . Right . So this is it. 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:29.550
 I was able to sort things like this to see the world. 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:35.099
 It was a Neolithic era that failed. 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:40.620
 A society whose mother knows someone and who does not know who the father is 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:45.960
 The difference between men and women, but the days of discrimination 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:50.039
 Men are starting to take the initiative now. I write monogamy. 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:57.230
 When the Western causes the initial reason 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:07:03.039
 I did not taste the system of interpreting human code by coding blood. 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:06.570
 Zhengyang I was used by one of the codes that the blood 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.570
 This gives me an important chapter. 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:18.370
 When you express it the ideal society in the old days you read the oriental classic 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.370
 When comfortable with the old society over what 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.950
 I worked together and ate together. 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:28.490
 That's what it says . 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:34.659
 Oh, of course, 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:38.590
 A society whose mother knows someone and who does not know who the father is 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:43.780
 Then the society is a leader 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:46.450
 There is a leader in the house but no ruler 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:49.390
 I have a distinction between men and women. 

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:55.720
 For more than four examples of discrimination between men and women 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:59.350
 It 's described as a society like that. It 's until the young age of the Neolithic age . 

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.890
 En rumors Wallaby we often talk 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:05.350
 Then, in the Neolithic period , 

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:10.930
 The agricultural revolution took place 

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:14.910
 Act land is not a dog in the colon then you just now planting 

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.910
 So it's development.
