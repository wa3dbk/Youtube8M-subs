00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.430
 good morning where are they today 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.769
 Friday September 28, 2012 is the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.030
 last Friday of September 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.030
 it's finally Friday 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.260
 and yesterday was 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.560
 the international day of forgiveness or something 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.560
 A) Yes 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.939
 hear it's cold it 's getting cold yesterday 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.660
 It rained and right now I'm very cold but 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.870
 Like let's talk will 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.010
 video games 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.449
 a console that came out barely 12 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.570
 years in 2000 was the play station2 the 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.089
 zone is the best selling home console in 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.010
 the story more than 100 million 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.199
 consoles 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.670
 I remember when the wii came out 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.370
 there were still games for playstation 2 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.600
 that came out on par with the play station 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.850
 3 with the wii with the xbox 360 and I 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.770
 liked to compare between playstation 2 and 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.890
 wii because it was almost always the same 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.440
 play nothing more with different controls 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.350
 but basically they did not even try 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.850
 the port or something like that because it's 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.250
 console even if you do not believe it in 2012 no 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.759
 had no single game no longer published 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.220
 drawing for for playstation2 so that 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.520
 we can give it up for dead except in 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 famitsu said there will be a game to 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.090
 playstation 2 in 2013 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.090
 you stay 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.250
 who is going to draw a game for a 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.670
 console that is 12 years old and in that 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.400
 then he will be 13 years old there is no date 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.490
 confirmed or nothing but the responsible 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.770
 of this is going to be square enix and the game 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.770
 will be treated nothing more and nothing less than 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.990
 d 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.530
 I'll read them because it's the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.530
 spanair fantasy Dublin 11 no mayo 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.270
 A) Yes 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.069
 but here is an expansion of the game and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.040
 it's a game I piss so 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.549
 but it's a game in the end for 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.280
 playstation2 rejoice and let's take this 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.590

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.719

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.219
