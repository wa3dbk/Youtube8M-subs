00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.700 
giving us a little tour do you think the
main<00:03:11.780> reason<00:03:11.810> behind<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.410> building<00:03:12.650> of

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
main reason behind the building of

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.280 
main reason behind the building of
hoover<00:03:12.920> dam<00:03:13.010> was<00:03:13.280> ah<00:03:13.520> probably<00:03:14.480> because<00:03:15.110> they

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
hoover dam was ah probably because they

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.380 
hoover dam was ah probably because they
need<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.530> power<00:03:15.770> and<00:03:16.550> that's<00:03:16.910> what<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.180> lot<00:03:17.360> of

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
need a power and that's what a lot of

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.600 
need a power and that's what a lot of
people<00:03:17.510> think<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.020> trip<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.470> it's<00:03:18.740> irrigation

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
people think the trip is it's irrigation

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.270 
people think the trip is it's irrigation
so<00:03:20.420> all<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.990> rock<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.530> you're<00:03:21.710> seeing<00:03:22.010> is

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
so all the rock that you're seeing is

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.880 
so all the rock that you're seeing is
porous<00:03:22.880> rock<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.570> there's<00:03:24.140> water<00:03:24.500> that

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
porous rock and there's water that

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.470 
porous rock and there's water that
always<00:03:25.220> seeps<00:03:25.520> through<00:03:25.670> but<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.270> comes

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
always seeps through but it comes

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.660 
always seeps through but it comes
through<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.900> rock<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.800> goes<00:03:28.010> down<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.550> the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
through the rock and it goes down to the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.880 
through the rock and it goes down to the
drainage<00:03:28.970> all<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.930> way<00:03:30.050> back<00:03:30.290> down<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.590> the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
drainage all the way back down to the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.449 
drainage all the way back down to the
river<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.480> literally<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.410> dam<00:03:33.770> is<00:03:34.070> always

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
river so literally this dam is always

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.360 
river so literally this dam is always
moving<00:03:34.700> with<00:03:35.540> water<00:03:35.840> whether<00:03:36.500> outside<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.220> it

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370
