00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello friendly neighbors for a long time 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.529
 I've had the urge to do this 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.660
 and to be able to tell you about this situation 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.610
 which has been going on for quite some time now and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 I'm really annoyed by the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.929
 actions of these people that I will name 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.270
 in the video before the start of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.640
 video in advance, I'll be very 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.949
 serious and that this video will cause them 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 be the sack to many of you I know 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.369
 and I know what will happen 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.830
 I clarify that this is not my intention 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.960
 but of course not and if it reaches them 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.899
 to offend because it 's their fault because 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.120
 the objective of the video is not that and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.820
 I'm warning also that I will not name 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 no user because apart from that this 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 theme is very generally seems to me a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.410
 lack of respect to use a person as 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.289
 an example and if not either direct 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.250
 with these points clarified I hope that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.250
 enjoy the video 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.450
 I said it and I got all the times 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.820
 they are necessary and 2006 is an evil 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.910
 game because I'm starting the video 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.770
 saying something that I have said many times 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.260
 Well, because I've met a lot of people 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.240
 that praises this game as a good game 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.460
 and that is something natural of this kind of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.830
 novice users who start being 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.930
 sonic fanboys when they have only played 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.270
 very few games of the hedgehog and these 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.880
 same people do not just come to say 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.060
 who are and 2006 is good or one of the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.890
 best and many of these people 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.050
 justify the errors of sonny 2006 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.660
 saying the stupidest thing I've ever 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.930
 heard in my fucking life they say that 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.000
 sonic adventure is worse than they are 2006 and 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.790
 that's why you can not consider 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.240
 sonny 2006 bad when the adventure 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.100
 I say again according to them is worse and 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.080
 I clarify from my point of view that 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.800
 justify some game for the mistakes 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.170
 of a previous game is how to say it 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.990
 stupid so let's start belying 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.690
 that adventure is less than 2006 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.100
 we must clarify that sonic adventure for 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.159
 the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.770
 and song and 2006 are almost 8 years of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.140
 difference so we must know that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.989
 sonic adventure was one of the first 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.120
 games that worked in 128 bits and then 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.459
 it was not so easy to program a game with 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.100
 such a great technology and - by not 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.569
 have almost experience in it and know 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.940
 even so 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.370
 sonic adventure gave him a super push 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.350
 a sonic of his dark saturn years 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.290
 It made the essence of the blue hedgehog 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.569
 came back to life and also made 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.150
 that the fans not only of sonic 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.190
 but from sega in general they felt 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.069
 hopes that better times 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.680
 They were coming, you asked them 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.880
 true sonic fans maybe that's what 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.730
 2006 sound or something like jajajajajaja 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.650
 no true sound 2006 was in a 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.830
 dark time maybe more than that of 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.739
 late 90's and tell me are and 2006 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.040
 it was the triumphant return of sonic came back 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.890
 its essence did not in fact return it yet 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.500
 darker and seriously I ask you are 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.000
 they call sonic fans they know it's 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.760
 what bothers me most and not 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.490
 with 2006 is that they defend what 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.740
 indefensible defend the shit of 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.770
 be accused of shit when in fact 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.200
 yes it is very shit sonic adventure had 6 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.720
 playable characters and 6 stories for 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.150
 each one that in the end they were united having 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.580
 a plot with plot twists and with 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.680
 a plot worthy of a movie and that 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.400
 set the example for many other games 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.640
 not only from sonic tell me that did they are and 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.500
 2006 believe that by defending a game 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.350
 saying that one of almost eight years 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.870
 previous so suddenly they are and 2006 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.090
 be excellent and I think I feel very 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.830
 indicated to talk about which game of 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.989
 Sonic is good and which is not since I 've 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.630
 played sonic almost all my life and I know 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.370
 perfectly what I 'm talking about 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.950
 I can tell you with my heart in my hand 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.410
 that the current sonic the Basque moons and that 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.140
 it is improvable in many ways some 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.120
 they become less bad than others but 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.070
 It is the truth and I know that the truth hurts 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.380
 and it hurts a lot but we have no more 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.730
 receive it with open arms and 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.340
 accept it as it is 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.960
 to finish the video I leave this 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.330
 small reflection 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.820
 I know very well how they think and how 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.650
 is that they act very well what it is that 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.680
 bothers them a lot and what it is that 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.810
 bothers less specifically I know what 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.420
 can reach bother to tell the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.360
 people who hear what they are and that is a 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.090
 poop or shit because like you 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.160
 come I saw myself a few years ago and if I 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.740
 they pay attention they may come to reason 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.200
 like many here so I leave it to you 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.330
 to your consideration if you liked this 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.310
 video I ask you to spread it so that 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.920
 it reaches more people can see it and if 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.200
 it is your decision to subscribe good 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.470
 see you in another video neighbors 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.470
 friendly
