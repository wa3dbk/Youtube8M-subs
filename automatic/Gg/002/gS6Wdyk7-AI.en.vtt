 bring a little bit of acidity 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.580
 of freshness to your recipe 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.180
 for the greediness of pin-up 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 I'm going for a little bit of salt 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.130
 the season just for 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.210
 fillet of olive oil and one to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.979
 preheat your oven to 200 Â° 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.079
 give vegetables about 10 minutes 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.320

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 time there I will prepare the trout 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.740
 langevin and beard she repairs but it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.670
 means to cut all the fins 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.670
 absolutely out 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:59.960

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:01.490
 shortened a little tail then 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.789

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.379

 that a water and bulma a dozen 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.940
 minutes it's important because the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 vegetables are always a little bit more 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.510
 long to cook that fish you pose 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.450
 fish to refuse that's it for the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.519

 me the green of his banter and his nickel 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.959
 were able to check in the modes of 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.500
 cooking on the ridge but they are 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.180
 perfect 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.060
