00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
zombies I almost like to compare it to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.650 
zombies I almost like to compare it to
the<00:00:38.640> car<00:00:39.149> 98k<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:40.559> World<00:00:40.829> War<00:00:41.149> not<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.329> bad<00:00:42.629> as

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the car 98k from World War not as bad as

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.869 
the car 98k from World War not as bad as
a<00:00:42.870> cartoon<00:00:43.290> dak<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.129> still<00:00:44.370> pretty<00:00:44.430> bad

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
a cartoon dak but it's still pretty bad

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.610 
a cartoon dak but it's still pretty bad
now<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> thing<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
now the thing I do like about the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.130 
now the thing I do like about the
ballista<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.309> first<00:00:48.300> off<00:00:48.539> i<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> iron

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
ballista is first off i think the iron

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.340 
ballista is first off i think the iron
sights<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.860> pretty<00:00:50.280> good<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.660> easier

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
sights are pretty good and it's easier

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
sights are pretty good and it's easier
to<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.620> headshots<00:00:52.890> than<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> card<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> 8k

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
to get headshots than the card on the 8k

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.340 
to get headshots than the card on the 8k
with<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> car<00:00:54.870> 98k<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.910> sucked<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
with a car 98k it kind of sucked and the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.689 
with a car 98k it kind of sucked and the
thing<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> actually<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.340> ahead<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
thing is when you actually go ahead and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
thing is when you actually go ahead and
later<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> game<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.289> decide

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
later on the game and if you do decide

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.830 
later on the game and if you do decide
to<00:01:01.710> pack<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> punch<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.430> thing<00:01:02.730> which<00:01:03.629> really

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
to pack a punch this thing which really

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.939 
to pack a punch this thing which really
doesn't<00:01:04.019> matter<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.739> pack<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
doesn't matter but if you do pack a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.640 
doesn't matter but if you do pack a
punch<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:07.320> pretty

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650

effectively<00:03:56.080> have<00:03:56.200> pretty<00:03:56.470> much<00:03:56.530> said

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
effectively have pretty much said

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.410 
effectively have pretty much said
everything<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.520> really<00:03:57.790> wanted<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.270> say

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
everything that I really wanted to say

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.850 
everything that I really wanted to say
with<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.720> dupe<00:03:58.840> with<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.020> carbines<00:03:59.530> so

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
with the dupe with the carbines so

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.070 
with the dupe with the carbines so
everything<00:04:00.760> else<00:04:00.910> that<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.630> said<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.050> that

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
everything else that I said with that

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.920 
everything else that I said with that
applies<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.340> m14<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.390> reason<00:04:04.690> why<00:04:04.900> I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
applies to the m14 and the reason why I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.470 
applies to the m14 and the reason why I
wanted<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.440> put<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.680> in<00:04:05.740> the<00:04:05.830> number<00:04:06.040> two<00:04:06.310> spot

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
wanted to put it in the number two spot

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.030 
wanted to put it in the number two spot
instead<00:04:07.480> of<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.750> number<00:04:07.900> three<00:04:08.410> spot<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.980> I

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
instead of the number three spot is I

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.449 
instead of the number three spot is I
would<00:04:09.820> have<00:04:10.000> bought<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:11.020> carbines<00:04:11.590> only<00:04:12.250> on

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
would have bought the carbines only on

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.520 
would have bought the carbines only on
that<00:04:12.790> one<00:04:13.000> map<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.390> think<00:04:13.810> but<00:04:14.350> there's

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
that one map I think but there's

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.460 
that one map I think but there's
definitely<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:15.340> m14<00:04:15.850> is<00:04:15.970> definitely<00:04:16.570> on<00:04:16.780> a

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
definitely the m14 is definitely on a

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.520 
definitely the m14 is definitely on a
lot<00:04:18.280> more<00:04:18.669> maps<00:04:19.030> than<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.720> carbine<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:20.350> that's

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
lot more maps than the carbine so that's

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.200 
lot more maps than the carbine so that's
why<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.830> put<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.370> in<00:04:21.460> a<00:04:21.580> number<00:04:21.820> two<00:04:22.030> spot

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
why I put it in a number two spot

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.780 
why I put it in a number two spot
instead<00:04:23.200> of<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.440> number<00:04:23.740> three<00:04:23.979> spot<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:24.580> it's

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
instead of the number three spot so it's

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.560 
instead of the number three spot so it's
pretty<00:04:25.120> obvious<00:04:25.810> with<00:04:25.990> coming

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
pretty obvious with coming

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.480 
pretty obvious with coming
at<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.960> number<00:04:27.230> one<00:04:27.410> spot<00:04:27.620> there's<00:04:27.920> one<00:04:28.190> gun

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
at the number one spot there's one gun

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.120 
at the number one spot there's one gun
in<00:04:29.000> zombies<00:04:29.720> that's<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.500> starting<00:04:30.920> room

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
in zombies that's in the starting room

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.920 
in zombies that's in the starting room
that<00:04:31.340> honestly<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.030> don't<00:04:32.150> think<00:04:32.420> it<00:04:32.540> should<00:04:32.570> be

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
that honestly I don't think it should be

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.040 
that honestly I don't think it should be
there<00:04:33.320> but<00:04:33.950> it's<00:04:34.130> there<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.030> had<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.480> put<00:04:35.930> it

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
there but it's there so I had to put it

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.500 
there but it's there so I had to put it
at<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.230> number<00:04:36.530> one<00:04:36.680> spot<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:37.250> had<00:04:37.550> no<00:04:37.880> choice<00:04:37.910> I

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
at the number one spot I had no choice I

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.950 
at the number one spot I had no choice I
absolutely<00:04:39.110> had<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.380> do<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.730> the

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960

I'm buried so it is 2,000 points it is

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.600 
I'm buried so it is 2,000 points it is
in<00:05:11.870> that<00:05:11.930> little<00:05:12.230> ledge<00:05:12.410> which<00:05:12.800> I've<00:05:13.010> missed<00:05:13.400> a
