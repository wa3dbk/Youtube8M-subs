00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's a difference between what the Spurs

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
it's a difference between what the Spurs
mentality<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.329> everyone<00:00:51.539> else's<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.110> think

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
mentality is and everyone else's I think

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
mentality is and everyone else's I think
the<00:00:52.680> other<00:00:52.829> part<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> who<00:00:53.699> else<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.090> secure

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the other part is who else is secure

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.840 
the other part is who else is secure
enough<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.410> themselves<00:00:55.770> that's<00:00:56.520> right<00:00:56.670> in

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
enough in themselves that's right in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.389 
enough in themselves that's right in
their<00:00:57.030> team<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.109> their<00:00:58.140> job<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:59.250> is

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
their team and then their job that is

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.860 
their team and then their job that is
would<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.910> able<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.449> yeah<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.780> don't

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
would be able to do this yeah I don't

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.360

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.789 
skeptical to think saying that is this
finable<00:01:14.210> because<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:16.020> guys<00:01:16.200> aren't<00:01:16.500> really

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
finable because the guys aren't really
