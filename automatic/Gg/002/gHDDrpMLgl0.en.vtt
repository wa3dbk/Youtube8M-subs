 good afternoon marcos but how in general 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.530
 mood as a new team mari star 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.600
 Ben Burka has very good 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.239
 mood because our team 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.000
 very good mood in our 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.630
 coaches very good mood we 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.729
 here we train to play all together 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.580
 reasonably united team therefore 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.710
 I feel very comfortable here 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.409
 what's in the team there are still brazilians somehow 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.530
 improves the moment of rapprochement with the team 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.900
 time quantum pourtant yes of course those 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.130
 the guys who were already here were brazilians 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.100
 they are enough 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.619
 contribute to bringing my 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.110
 rapprochement with the team but I talk not 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.920
 only with brazilians with russian guys 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.500
 communicate 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.180
 besides Russian there are a lot of players 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.979
 other nationalities 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.630
 in order to join the team you need 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.159
 communicate with everyone share 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.240
 impressions about how 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.640
 part of the first training takes place 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.369
 team gathering screamed for the throne year of course 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.549
 The first part of the fees is very important to us. 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.030
 not only physically but also how to work with 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.719
 ball for which is very important we play and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.399
 gain tactical positions 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.130
 so mark can say that for us 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.890
 for me personally and for the whole team in 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.810
 In general, the first part of all fees is very 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.700
 it is important tomorrow the team is coming 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 hold your first test match in 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.580
 part of the training camp in the role 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.800
 rival Donetsk miner is very 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.840
 a serious rival so and so can be 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.489
 forecasts have on this game and all in 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.560
 your attitude to this rival you 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.989
 say we are here division hi in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.970
 result park and on 100 wild dog i 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.330
 Now I can not predict the outcome of the match 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.160
 our team and the miner are strong enough 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.959
 the team we play is very similar 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.840
 football I can say that the team 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.900
 opponent very strong defense 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.900
 they play on the bottom just like us 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.709
 so it will be a fairly equal match 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.170
 so I can not predict now 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.170
 its outcome 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.599
 we train they train too this 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.840
 first part of fees i'm not sure of course 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.400
 that teams have reached 100 percent of their 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.230
 forces 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.790
 I think that this will be an interesting match well 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.590
 what am I proposing now and pressing 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.840
 topics a little bit questions put aside 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.849
 side and get back to that question here 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.370
 when you went to the club immediately took 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.090
 the decision to move to Krasnodar giants 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.090
 Park I can say that I took 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.640
 the solution immediately besides i had a friend 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.900
 Jura Movsisyan who is very good 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.900
 spoke about the team 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.680
 I also had a few suggestions 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.840
 from other teams but after i 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.720
 met with representatives of Krasnodar 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.720
 I immediately decided to go to your 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.200
 some role played in this issue 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.599
 the moment is that there is no need from the city 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.650
 leave for what you played in Kuban and that 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.180
 the very same city is not needed anywhere 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.790
 no need to move place 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.860
 residence figure mask moda para mi 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.710
 them and last name yes i can say that for 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.140
 it was very convenient for me 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:10.970
 and for my family I used to Krasnodar that 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.550
 it's always warm here and so for 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.740
 I was comfortable enough to stay in 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.960
 Krasnodar 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.640
 marcos a little bit back in the past here with 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.650
 what started your relationship with 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.750
 football and at what point did you understand 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.090
 that this is your life with the public before 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.610
 burgers they threatened to the dance hall and 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.520
 Carry theodore but it's hard enough 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.260
 question do you know that in brazil everything 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.340
 want all the kids want to be 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.340
 professional footballers 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.760
 I started playing football at the age of seven 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.450
 career professional footballer I 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.290
 started thinking at 17 when got 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.190
 invitation from the first professional 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.750
 teams 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.920
 and before that I can say that I played 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.720
 just for yourself for fun 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.030
 Marcos Well, once we talk about Brazil 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.130
 the question is of your origin 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.630
 you were born there you are a brazilian but 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.670
 your last name is very similar to Italian 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.650
 last name is just some kind of coincidence 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.660
 or is there some kind of story actually 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.330
 since backing poter poter 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.690
 disney body last name not yes yes italy ladies 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:24.050
 dad told us that our distant 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:26.120
 relatives came and whether you know 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.980
 I can't say what I have now 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.590
 some connections have become 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.350
 or 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.430
 have relatives in italy i would 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.440
 Marcus divided 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.020
 football is now in the first place for sure 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.940
 you can look at the future a little bit 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.120
 we can say here what you want 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.160

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.900

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.300
 We work with a professional team 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.630
 and most importantly, we have all the qualities 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:14.490
 for this, i think that at the end of it 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.990
 years at the end of the season we have to get into 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.660
