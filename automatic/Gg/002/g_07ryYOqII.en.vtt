let's<00:00:07.490> look<00:00:07.669> at<00:00:07.790> some<00:00:08.000> of<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:08.180> other

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
let's look at some of the other

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.240 
let's look at some of the other
treatments<00:00:09.590> that<00:00:09.710> we<00:00:09.830> use<00:00:09.860> or

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
treatments that we use or

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.250 
treatments that we use or
instrumentation<00:00:11.090> we<00:00:11.209> use<00:00:11.420> to<00:00:11.629> treat<00:00:11.840> macular

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
instrumentation we use to treat macular

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.020 
instrumentation we use to treat macular
degeneration<00:00:12.379> I<00:00:13.099> want<00:00:13.369> to<00:00:13.459> talk<00:00:13.639> about<00:00:13.789> the

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
degeneration I want to talk about the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.990 
degeneration I want to talk about the
Oct<00:00:14.900> or<00:00:15.049> optical<00:00:15.589> coherence<00:00:15.860> tomography<00:00:16.250> and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
Oct or optical coherence tomography and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.140 
Oct or optical coherence tomography and
simply<00:00:17.840> put<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.200> Oct<00:00:18.650> is<00:00:18.800> probably<00:00:19.310> the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
simply put the Oct is probably the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.210 
simply put the Oct is probably the
greatest<00:00:20.570> advancement<00:00:21.560> we've<00:00:21.680> had<00:00:21.950> in

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
greatest advancement we've had in

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.790 
greatest advancement we've had in
treating<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:22.939> monitoring<00:00:23.420> this<00:00:23.539> disease<00:00:23.930> the

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
treating and monitoring this disease the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.570 
treating and monitoring this disease the
Oct<00:00:25.340> is<00:00:25.640> a<00:00:26.230> visual<00:00:27.230> cat<00:00:27.920> scan<00:00:28.279> of<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.550> eye

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
Oct is a visual cat scan of the eye

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.779 
Oct is a visual cat scan of the eye
using<00:00:29.359> light<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:30.230> it<00:00:30.830> returns<00:00:31.189> an<00:00:31.369> image<00:00:31.609> that

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
using light and it returns an image that

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.430 
using light and it returns an image that
gives<00:00:31.939> us<00:00:32.089> a<00:00:32.210> cross-section<00:00:32.900> of<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.080> retina

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
gives us a cross-section of the retina

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.369 
gives us a cross-section of the retina
it<00:00:34.339> gives<00:00:34.519> us<00:00:34.670> a<00:00:34.820> resolution<00:00:35.690> somewhere<00:00:36.260> of

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
it gives us a resolution somewhere of

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.090 
it gives us a resolution somewhere of
about<00:00:36.620> 5<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:37.129> 10<00:00:37.339> microns<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:39.530> displays

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
about 5 to 10 microns and it displays

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.450 
about 5 to 10 microns and it displays
the<00:00:40.400> image<00:00:40.610> in<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.449> color<00:00:42.260> scale<00:00:42.589> in<00:00:42.860> which

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
the image in a color scale in which

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.149 
the image in a color scale in which
black<00:00:44.239> is<00:00:44.570> low<00:00:44.930> reflectivity<00:00:45.170> which<00:00:45.769> is<00:00:46.040> the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
black is low reflectivity which is the

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.680 
black is low reflectivity which is the
vitreous<00:00:46.640> or<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.860> beyond<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:48.949> choroid<00:00:49.190> and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
vitreous or the beyond the choroid and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.619 
vitreous or the beyond the choroid and
the<00:00:50.690> red<00:00:50.930> blue<00:00:51.619> and<00:00:51.650> green<00:00:52.210> denote<00:00:53.210> different

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
the red blue and green denote different

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.049 
the red blue and green denote different
layers<00:00:53.869> of<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.229> retina<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:55.640> this<00:00:55.790> is<00:00:55.909> what

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
layers of the retina and so this is what

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.170 
layers of the retina and so this is what
a<00:00:56.089> healthy<00:00:57.070> OCT<00:00:58.070> looks<00:00:58.339> like<00:00:58.549> you<00:00:58.729> see<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:58.909> nice

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
a healthy OCT looks like you see a nice

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.439 
a healthy OCT looks like you see a nice
phobia<00:00:59.750> depression<00:01:00.290> in<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.470> center<00:01:01.449> let's

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
phobia depression in the center let's

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.420 
phobia depression in the center let's
just<00:01:02.659> look<00:01:02.809> over<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.080> couple<00:01:03.320> cases<00:01:03.650> this<00:01:04.159> was<00:01:04.400> a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
just look over a couple cases this was a

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.210 
just look over a couple cases this was a
patient<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.970> mine<00:01:05.180> who<00:01:05.210> had<00:01:05.840> was<00:01:06.380> 68<00:01:06.860> years<00:01:07.040> old

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
patient of mine who had was 68 years old

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.730 
patient of mine who had was 68 years old
post<00:01:07.640> cataract<00:01:08.420> surgery<00:01:08.930> vision<00:01:09.229> was<00:01:09.380> down<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
post cataract surgery vision was down to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.490 
post cataract surgery vision was down to
2080<00:01:10.310> sent<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.359> me<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.659> rule<00:01:11.840> out<00:01:12.020> cysts<00:01:12.380> or

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
2080 sent to me to rule out cysts or

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.679 
2080 sent to me to rule out cysts or
macular<00:01:12.799> edema<00:01:13.369> as<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:14.090> can<00:01:14.270> clearly<00:01:14.570> see

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
macular edema as you can clearly see

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.240 
macular edema as you can clearly see
there's<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.289> posterior<00:01:15.890> vitreous<00:01:15.979> detachment

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
there's a posterior vitreous detachment

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.520 
there's a posterior vitreous detachment
and<00:01:17.030> there<00:01:17.450> was<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.600> small<00:01:17.929> full<00:01:18.259> thickness

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
and there was a small full thickness

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.069 
and there was a small full thickness
macular<00:01:19.159> hole<00:01:19.189> these<00:01:20.179> were<00:01:20.390> very<00:01:20.719> difficult

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
macular hole these were very difficult

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.950 
macular hole these were very difficult
to<00:01:21.409> do<00:01:21.530> before<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.609> obviously<00:01:23.240> one<00:01:23.509> requires

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
to do before and obviously one requires

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.779 
to do before and obviously one requires
a<00:01:24.049> surgical<00:01:24.560> intervention<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:25.219> one<00:01:25.369> requires

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
a surgical intervention and one requires

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.120 
a surgical intervention and one requires
a<00:01:25.880> medical<00:01:26.149> intervention<00:01:26.890> let's<00:01:27.890> look<00:01:28.009> at

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
a medical intervention let's look at

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.069 
a medical intervention let's look at
another<00:01:28.369> case<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:29.149> was<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.420> patient<00:01:29.869> who<00:01:29.960> was

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
another case this was a patient who was

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.200 
another case this was a patient who was
referred<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:30.710> for<00:01:30.979> an<00:01:31.070> epi<00:01:31.399> retinal<00:01:31.729> membrane

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
referred in for an epi retinal membrane

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.630 
referred in for an epi retinal membrane
visual<00:01:32.600> acuity<00:01:32.749> was<00:01:33.049> 2060<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.219> he<00:01:34.490> can

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
visual acuity was 2060 and he can

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.910 
visual acuity was 2060 and he can
clearly<00:01:34.909> see<00:01:35.270> lying<00:01:35.689> on<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.020> top<00:01:36.259> section<00:01:36.799> of

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
clearly see lying on the top section of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.099 
clearly see lying on the top section of
the<00:01:37.039> retina<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.759> there<00:01:37.999> is<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.119> line<00:01:38.780> which

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
the retina that there is a line which

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.440 
the retina that there is a line which
represents<00:01:39.319> the<00:01:39.859> epiretinal<00:01:40.189> membrane<00:01:40.450> but

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
represents the epiretinal membrane but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.080 
represents the epiretinal membrane but
the<00:01:41.569> resolution<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.409> Oct<00:01:42.979> was<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:43.880> good

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
the resolution of the Oct was so good

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.179 
the resolution of the Oct was so good
that<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.390> allowed<00:01:44.719> us<00:01:44.749> to<00:01:45.020> see<00:01:45.710> that<00:01:45.859> there<00:01:46.069> was

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
that it allowed us to see that there was

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.300 
that it allowed us to see that there was
a<00:01:46.219> very<00:01:46.640> very<00:01:47.060> small<00:01:47.569> full<00:01:48.289> thickness<00:01:48.649> macular

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
a very very small full thickness macular

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.489 
a very very small full thickness macular
hole<00:01:49.340> present<00:01:49.999> once<00:01:50.539> again<00:01:50.869> completely

hole present once again completely

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.859 
hole present once again completely
changing<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.249> course<00:01:52.639> of<00:01:52.719> management<00:01:53.719> in

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
changing the course of management in

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.319 
changing the course of management in
this<00:01:53.990> disease<00:01:54.549> now<00:01:55.549> let's<00:01:55.729> look<00:01:55.880> at<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.210> and

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
this disease now let's look at it and

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.239 
this disease now let's look at it and
macular<00:01:56.509> degeneration<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:57.770> was<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:57.979> patient

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
macular degeneration this was a patient

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.330 
macular degeneration this was a patient
of<00:01:58.460> mine<00:01:58.670> about<00:01:59.389> 77<00:02:00.079> years<00:02:00.259> old<00:02:00.439> had<00:02:00.950> central

of mine about 77 years old had central

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.289 
of mine about 77 years old had central
wavy<00:02:02.289> vision<00:02:03.289> vision<00:02:04.249> was<00:02:04.490> not<00:02:04.520> bad<00:02:04.880> down<00:02:05.119> to

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
wavy vision vision was not bad down to
