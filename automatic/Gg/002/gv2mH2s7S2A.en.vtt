00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
system then once you mount that you go

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.370 
system then once you mount that you go
ahead<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.450> grab<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.870> lamp<00:03:27.080> cord

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.740

grab the lamp on ours you can actually

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.830 
grab the lamp on ours you can actually
grab<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.530> long<00:03:48.680> as<00:03:48.770> you<00:03:48.890> keep<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.780> know

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
grab it long as you keep the you know

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.990 
grab it long as you keep the you know
the<00:03:50.960> handling<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.530> minimum<00:03:51.860> we<00:03:52.700> already

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
the handling to a minimum we already

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.350 
the handling to a minimum we already
made<00:03:53.210> our<00:03:53.390> slit<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.760> insulation<00:03:55.760> here<00:03:56.120> so

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
made our slit and the insulation here so

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.300 
made our slit and the insulation here so
we're<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:57.320> going<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.470> feed<00:03:57.740> this<00:03:57.920> all<00:03:58.190> the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
we're just going to feed this all the

way back to the metal cabinet of the
unit<00:04:02.000> itself<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:03.370> just<00:04:04.370> mount<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.790> directly

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
unit itself and just mount it directly

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.720 
unit itself and just mount it directly
over<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.810> evaporator<00:04:06.350> coil<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.890> then<00:04:07.610> you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
over the evaporator coil and then you

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.440 
over the evaporator coil and then you
just<00:04:07.970> dress<00:04:08.270> your<00:04:08.540> wires<00:04:09.940> best<00:04:10.940> way<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.180> see

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
just dress your wires best way you see

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.160 
just dress your wires best way you see
suited<00:04:13.300> okay<00:04:14.300> now<00:04:14.480> we're<00:04:14.630> going<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.780> show<00:04:14.990> the

other use for the Z bracket mount this
would<00:04:18.380> actually<00:04:18.530> be<00:04:18.770> installing<00:04:19.489> on<00:04:19.760> the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
would actually be installing on the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.110 
coil what you do is you grab a hold of
this<00:04:24.440> on<00:04:24.680> each<00:04:24.800> side<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.310> bracket<00:04:25.580> with

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
this on each side of the bracket with

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.660 
this on each side of the bracket with
the<00:04:26.240> line<00:04:26.480> being<00:04:26.750> in<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.050> middle<00:04:27.400> take<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.550> and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
the line being in the middle take it and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.310 
the line being in the middle take it and
bend<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:28.970> back<00:04:29.270> and<00:04:29.540> forth<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.960> couple<00:04:30.110> times

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
bend it back and forth a couple times

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.360 
bend it back and forth a couple times
till<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.890> breaks<00:04:31.100> off<00:04:31.370> cleanly

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.800 

we<00:04:38.370> already<00:04:38.490> drilled<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.000> one-inch<00:04:39.360> hole<00:04:39.600> in

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
we already drilled the one-inch hole in

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.050 
we already drilled the one-inch hole in
the<00:04:40.260> screws<00:04:40.620> corresponding<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.640> bracket

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
the screws corresponding to the bracket

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.910 
the screws corresponding to the bracket
so<00:04:42.780> what<00:04:42.930> you're<00:04:43.080> going<00:04:43.200> to<00:04:43.260> do<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.560> take<00:04:43.770> the

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
so what you're going to do is take the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.130 
so what you're going to do is take the
bracket<00:04:45.050> line<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.260> directly<00:04:46.830> up<00:04:48.140> then

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
bracket line that directly up then

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.350 
bracket line that directly up then
install<00:04:49.560> your<00:04:49.740> screws<00:04:52.550> okay<00:04:53.550> we<00:04:53.940> just<00:04:53.970> want<00:04:54.300> to

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
install your screws okay we just want to

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.240 
install your screws okay we just want to
make<00:04:54.450> sure<00:04:54.510> that<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:55.020> have<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.560> studs<00:04:55.890> on<00:04:56.130> the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
make sure that we have the studs on the

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.740 
make sure that we have the studs on the
outside<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.650> once<00:04:58.950> we<00:04:59.400> put<00:04:59.430> our<00:04:59.670> last<00:05:00.060> screw<00:05:00.570> on

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
outside so once we put our last screw on

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.160 
outside so once we put our last screw on
here<00:05:03.140> take<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.320> lamp<00:05:05.450> slide<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:06.690> directly

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
here take the lamp slide that directly

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:17.600 
here take the lamp slide that directly
through<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:16.320> then<00:05:16.680> use<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:17.130> nuts<00:05:17.370> that<00:05:17.550> are

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
through and then use the nuts that are

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:30.020 
through and then use the nuts that are
included<00:05:17.940> in<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.300> kit<00:05:18.420> bag

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.180 

nice<00:05:30.600> thing<00:05:30.870> about<00:05:30.900> this<00:05:31.290> lamp<00:05:31.530> cord<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:31.980> does

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
nice thing about this lamp cord it does

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.390 
nice thing about this lamp cord it does
make<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.490> nice<00:05:32.790> tight<00:05:33.270> 90-degree<00:05:34.170> Bend<00:05:34.530> so<00:05:35.310> you

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
make a nice tight 90-degree Bend so you

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.520 
make a nice tight 90-degree Bend so you
can<00:05:35.670> still<00:05:35.910> apply<00:05:36.000> your<00:05:36.420> panel<00:05:36.750> back<00:05:36.990> onto<00:05:37.260> the

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
can still apply your panel back onto the

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.220 
can still apply your panel back onto the
system<00:05:41.450> now<00:05:42.450> we're<00:05:42.600> going<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.750> finish<00:05:42.930> up<00:05:43.170> with

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
system now we're going to finish up with

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.100 
system now we're going to finish up with
the<00:05:43.440> lamp<00:05:43.650> connection<00:05:44.660> pushing<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.750> two<00:05:45.930> in

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
the lamp connection pushing the two in

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.470 
the lamp connection pushing the two in
together<00:05:46.550> we're<00:05:47.550> going<00:05:47.670> to<00:05:47.730> line<00:05:48.030> up<00:05:48.060> each

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
together we're going to line up each

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.160 
together we're going to line up each
line<00:05:49.200> on<00:05:49.380> each<00:05:49.590> side<00:05:49.890> of<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.160> connector<00:05:50.460> and

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
line on each side of the connector and

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.020 
line on each side of the connector and
then<00:05:52.170> that<00:05:52.470> concludes<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.340> installation<00:05:53.910> of

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
then that concludes the installation of

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.480 
then that concludes the installation of
the<00:05:54.120> blue<00:05:54.270> tube
