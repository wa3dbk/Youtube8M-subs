now these things can open up just to

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.089 
now these things can open up just to
show<00:05:18.569> off<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:18.990> bit<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.259> the<00:05:19.349> engine<00:05:19.710> inside<00:05:19.979> but

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
show off a bit to the engine inside but

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.350 
show off a bit to the engine inside but
it<00:05:20.190> can't<00:05:20.340> exactly<00:05:20.639> open<00:05:21.090> all<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.240> way

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
it can't exactly open all the way

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.820 
it can't exactly open all the way
because<00:05:21.509> of<00:05:21.750> these<00:05:21.900> pieces<00:05:22.229> in<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.529> way<00:05:22.650> I

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
because of these pieces in the way I

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.559 
because of these pieces in the way I
don't<00:05:23.400> think<00:05:23.520> it's<00:05:23.759> meant<00:05:23.879> to<00:05:24.000> be<00:05:24.090> it's<00:05:24.419> just

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
don't think it's meant to be it's just

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.779 
don't think it's meant to be it's just
meant<00:05:24.779> to<00:05:24.900> sort<00:05:25.139> of<00:05:25.199> like<00:05:25.409> just<00:05:26.129> open<00:05:26.460> little

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.529 
in the middle bit a little too so so you
get<00:05:38.159> him<00:05:38.340> I<00:05:38.580> guess<00:05:38.969> this<00:05:39.150> one<00:05:39.270> doesn't<00:05:39.449> have

this<00:06:38.260> up<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:39.100> other<00:06:39.130> one<00:06:39.400> I<00:06:39.580> did<00:06:39.730> recommend

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
by official Lego to build it yourself is

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.010 
by official Lego to build it yourself is
more<00:06:45.340> secure<00:06:45.760> and<00:06:46.060> alter<00:06:46.420> it<00:06:46.510> a<00:06:46.600> little<00:06:46.780> bit

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
more secure and alter it a little bit

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.230 
more secure and alter it a little bit
but<00:06:47.680> as<00:06:47.800> this<00:06:47.980> one<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.250> can<00:06:48.760> happily<00:06:49.060> recommend

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
but as this one I can happily recommend

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.510 
but as this one I can happily recommend
this<00:06:49.630> one<00:06:49.810> because<00:06:50.020> it<00:06:50.140> doesn't<00:06:50.320> exactly<00:06:51.220> fall

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
this one because it doesn't exactly fall

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.050 
this one because it doesn't exactly fall
apart<00:06:51.790> it's<00:06:52.030> quite<00:06:52.380> steady<00:06:53.580> sturdy<00:06:54.580> I<00:06:54.850> think

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
apart it's quite steady sturdy I think

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.090 
apart it's quite steady sturdy I think
the<00:06:55.120> word<00:06:55.270> is<00:06:55.420> yes<00:06:55.720> steady<00:06:56.080> steady<00:06:56.860> says

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
the word is yes steady steady says

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.400 
the word is yes steady steady says
another<00:06:57.670> I'm<00:06:57.880> an<00:06:58.120> clock<00:06:58.360> here<00:06:58.600> which<00:06:59.230> I<00:06:59.380> think

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
another I'm an clock here which I think

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.250 
another I'm an clock here which I think
this<00:06:59.740> one<00:06:59.950> is<00:07:00.240> slightly<00:07:01.240> smart<00:07:01.780> on<00:07:01.870> the<00:07:01.960> edge<00:07:02.080> I

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
this one is slightly smart on the edge I

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.370 
this one is slightly smart on the edge I
think<00:07:02.290> maybe<00:07:02.970> so<00:07:03.970> anyway<00:07:04.210> this<00:07:04.900> one's<00:07:05.140> a<00:07:05.260> good

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
think maybe so anyway this one's a good

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.900 
think maybe so anyway this one's a good
one<00:07:05.580> yes<00:07:06.580> and<00:07:07.590> since<00:07:08.590> the<00:07:08.860> whore

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:09.910 
one yes and since the whore

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.300 
one yes and since the whore
armor<00:07:10.870> set<00:07:11.230> looks<00:07:11.620> like<00:07:11.770> it's<00:07:11.950> not<00:07:12.070> really<00:07:12.220> a

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
armor set looks like it's not really a

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.030 
armor set looks like it's not really a
moving<00:07:12.670> stage<00:07:13.210> is<00:07:13.510> very<00:07:13.810> straightforward<00:07:14.770> and

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.040 
moving stage is very straightforward and

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.670 
moving stage is very straightforward and
straight<00:07:15.460> and<00:07:16.000> flat<00:07:16.350> hopefully<00:07:17.350> that<00:07:17.530> one

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
straight and flat hopefully that one

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.770 
straight and flat hopefully that one
means<00:07:18.070> it'll<00:07:18.280> be<00:07:18.340> really<00:07:18.640> secure<00:07:19.030> so

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
means it'll be really secure so

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.360 
means it'll be really secure so
subscribe<00:07:20.050> doesn't<00:07:20.470> go<00:07:20.560> below<00:07:20.740> and<00:07:20.950> kostik
