00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.870 

a<00:02:36.530> lot<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.010> things<00:02:37.310> certainly<00:02:37.700> go<00:02:37.850> through

a lot of things certainly go through

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.780 
a lot of things certainly go through
players<00:02:38.390> minds<00:02:38.750> when<00:02:39.080> they<00:02:39.200> have<00:02:39.410> an<00:02:39.560> injury

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.210 

CEO<00:02:44.450> upset<00:02:44.959> nanny<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.409> down<00:02:45.620> there<00:02:45.890> certainly

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
CEO upset nanny is down there certainly

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.949 
CEO upset nanny is down there certainly
the<00:02:46.400> pain<00:02:46.610> but<00:02:48.970> how<00:02:49.970> bad<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.629> course<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
the pain but how bad it is of course the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:03:07.369 
the pain but how bad it is of course the
rehab<00:02:51.349> that<00:02:51.560> goes<00:02:51.739> along<00:02:51.920> with<00:02:52.099> it

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.589 

so<00:03:07.859> it<00:03:08.040> looks<00:03:08.219> like<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.549> will<00:03:08.730> probably

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
so it looks like they will probably

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.809 
so it looks like they will probably
splint<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> inflatable<00:03:11.040> bag<00:03:11.489> and

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
splint that with the inflatable bag and

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.670 
splint that with the inflatable bag and
then<00:03:11.969> get<00:03:12.749> him<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.109> stretcher<00:03:13.319> in<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
then get him on the stretcher in the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.630 
then get him on the stretcher in the
cart

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.790
