but it will use the 3g network and there
we<00:03:10.220> go<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.640> number<00:03:10.850> two<00:03:11.209> number<00:03:11.660> two<00:03:11.690> is

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
we go with number two number two is

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.050 
we go with number two number two is
processing<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:14.260> there<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.410> number<00:03:15.739> three<00:03:16.100> so

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
processing and there is number three so

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.199 
processing and there is number three so
number<00:03:17.569> three<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:17.959> processing<00:03:21.760> okay<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.000> then

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
number three is processing okay and then

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.430 
number three is processing okay and then
once<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.630> done<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.989> gives<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.290> little
