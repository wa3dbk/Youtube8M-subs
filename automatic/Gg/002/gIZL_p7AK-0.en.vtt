00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello people we are making a war 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:18.600
 Casserole with the ingredients for it 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.859
 quark chris the sensible congress 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.660
 so dark again from eggs 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.609
 butter sugar and vanilla 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.910
 you could also from pulleys 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.820
 Doing three and cherries is natural 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.899
 also with every other fruit gives 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.040
 certainly quite a lot of possibilities 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.079
 With 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.750
 we make a very simple basis 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.070
 history so now start the quark 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.870
 soft butter really soft butter 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:57.420
 Show one here otherwise you would have it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:59.750
 others even join in and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750
 vanilla 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.590
 the one yellow 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.039
 the protein can always be good for you 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:32.600
 take bread or you actually take it 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:34.280
 let's hear that my hand 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:53.149
 otherwise I'll wind up like that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:02:01.130
 garden kitchen nice smooth mass and there 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:05.959
 lift our cheesecake mass with too 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:10.299
 delicious as cake is baked 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.299
 this on us in the war of our churches 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:18.739
 of course to form fireproof 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.780
 Of course, churches are frozen around these 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.269
 season 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.980
 but I think that's okay too 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.310
 season for churches is just too much 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.310
 short 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.069
 some region is also called cherry 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:52.630
 michel think that is above all things 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:58.290
 north of the case on it and distribute 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:02.950
 then baked for about 50 minutes at 180 Â° 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.580
 the crisis on whether is finished was exactly 50 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.230
 minutes in there 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.230
 powdered sugar on it and cup of coffee 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.670
 An ice cream parlor starts 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.739
 sometimes you will again relish it 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.049
 and if you liked it over like 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.200
