00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.090
 hello good kids we are here 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.559
 new call of duty ghosts video that 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 well I had enough desire to throw myself 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.980
 some games although always in this 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.050
 I just tired pretty fast but 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.180
 good for varying a bit too and for 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.680
 see the advanced warfare camouflage that 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.570
 I have not seen it yet in this game 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.930
 they gave for black ops and for 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.090
 this and yes I have uploaded something in the black 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.920
 ops but in this I have not seen it yet 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.230
 let's see how the post is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.449
 in the 12th here is a low game 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.369
 confirmed on this map to see if I can 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.130
 then also the streak is to see 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.170
 how everything is going is all that is worth 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.750
 we are losing up enough but 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.310
 good to see if at least we can 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.420
 then give a little to camouflage 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.420
 because I almost like it better than the d 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.260
 from the whites because I do not know it seems that 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.359
 they are throwing things around here 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.879
 that of white seems to you the winter is 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:06.769
 pretty basic 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.769
 there is another one here is if someone comes 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:15.820
 to said pitas I think it's here and what 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.820
 I hear pretty close 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:27.960
 I have the dog I have one from behind and 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.690
 here it's worth it so they take it from me but 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.600
 to see around here the corridor this does not 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.869
 I do not like a hair come worth I have 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.690
 turret has been able to see it at least 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.049
 block the aisle that trade veneers 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.229
 that never never caught the long step 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.229
 forever 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:57.950
 there is a sheet here because I already have 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.950
 70 let's see if we go back this 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.940
 and I think it's so often here 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.010
 above 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.050
 if I can enter here 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.399
 if I hear it very close if to this one 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.890
 voucher voucher 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.740
 if you find a briefcase that you do not see 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.550
 one is worth they are here 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.210
 we go in here 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.590
 you are my mother where is the uncle who 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.890
 will burst a box of ammo yours 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.890
 think 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.550
 what is the turret the helicopter does not 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.170
 go to S 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.960
 come on let's ask 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.050
 and the other one is seen 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.380
 I will not turn back again for 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.420
 here 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.340
 not at the moment it's going well enough to see yes 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.860
 and some veneers now that is the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.550
 helicopter me that and there and so he pulled out 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.620
 again the streak 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.100
 they have burst the sentinels and they are going to 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.100
 be here 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.620
 voucher voucher 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.579
 My mother from whom I have saved is worth 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.780
 watch 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:16.680
 not carrying the briefcase we are going 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.090
 the dog leaves me or does not leave me to see 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.469
 if I find a briefcase this or the uncle 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:26.760
 this one that we're tied but here it did not 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:31.500
 a 20 of those we go 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.940
 my mother appeared the briefcase as 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.810
 blue badges 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.810
 they are here 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.670
 and now yes 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.670
 and they take it from me 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:48.990
 behind 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.240
 the dog yes sir come come there is that 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.240
 win this as it is 21 3 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.440
 I think I 'm going to leave this here because 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:05.380
 they are coming out there the seen peek 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.380
 the one that goes up here to see sigh hair 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.340
 that is him 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.760
 the squadmate or if he has caught 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.220
 from above let's go 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.850
 I had 65 it seems to me I come up 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.570
 this site the truth that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.570
 not always 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.090
 power is that if they are there do not see me 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.949
 they ask all the time we are going to enter through the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.039
 right to see if I could find someone 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.039
 here 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.300
 my team is not there 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.510
 we passed we went to see so many here 

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:48.110
 above 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.110
 OK OK 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.060
 I was not out and it itself was 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.800
 she 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.900
 come out all where is the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.490
 turret I'm going to burst but good 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.490
 at least to see if it's worth 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.230
 I think there is more and above 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.550
 to see if I can catch the 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:18.350
 the bag sack there 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.220
 mariachis that have not touched yet 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.220
 sorry they are 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.110
 and I do not like this site 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.860
 I was 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.860
 betis 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.540
 I think they come more 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:48.290
 I have the dog you will not fall to see if I do not 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.700
 gives but good at least we are winning 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.220
 I do not think that you touch 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.960
 mariachi although they will also play 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.069
 I could take advantage of them 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.069
 they are here is here 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.430
 casey ammo I have to recharge one eye 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.430
 my mother 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.590
 It is worth much more, although now 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.200
 I should catch so much what happens that 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.390
 it's pretty even then 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.020
 who has super water on us 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.860
 I think we 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.860
 do not have down 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.110
 how many there are here but you have to 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.110
 recharge 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:36.569
 ok there were no others where we killed 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:39.969
 well then 49 on this map a pity 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:42.279
 I could not get that 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.469
 of the mariachis the streak of the 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:46.389
 mariachis and mess a little more but 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:48.279
 good still you have seen a little bit the 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.289
 camouflage and that the truth dwells 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.719
 rather more than whites to me by 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.699
 at least I like it much more shines 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:56.919
 very much and it looks quite white not 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.749
 like that of white is that it is so 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.389
 practically like the one of winter the 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:03.669
 typical winter camouflage but good 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.349
 at 49 on this map in confirmed decline 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.319
 above we have traced there that we 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:10.539
 they were making a lot of tapas but 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.749
 Nothing I hope you liked and until 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.749
 the next
