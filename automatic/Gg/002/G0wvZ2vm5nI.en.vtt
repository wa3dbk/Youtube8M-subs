00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.060 
really really good you know the weight
loss<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.119> slowed<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.530> it's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
loss is is slowed down a little bit it's

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.649 
loss is is slowed down a little bit it's
more<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.700> about<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> half

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
more like about a half

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.160 
more like about a half
on<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.749> day<00:02:07.340> compared<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.690> where<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:10.080> was

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
on a day compared to where I think was

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.050 
on a day compared to where I think was
about<00:02:10.379> point<00:02:10.709> eight<00:02:10.890> point<00:02:11.220> nine<00:02:11.280> pounds<00:02:11.879> per

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
about point eight point nine pounds per

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.259 
about point eight point nine pounds per
day<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:13.280> that's<00:02:14.280> kind<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.580> slow<00:02:14.760> down<00:02:14.970> which<00:02:15.150> is

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
day so that's kind of slow down which is

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.479 
day so that's kind of slow down which is
fine<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.900> know<00:02:15.989> I'm<00:02:16.290> starting<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:17.340> get

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
probably closer to the way my body it's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.150

percentage of this but you should be so

after i'm done with this juice fast i'll

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.470 
after i'm done with this juice fast i'll
be<00:03:04.440> eating<00:03:04.530> about<00:03:04.799> eighty<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:06.060> ninety<00:03:06.329> percent

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
be eating about eighty to ninety percent

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.259 
be eating about eighty to ninety percent
of<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:07.160> nutrients<00:03:08.160> from<00:03:08.340> vegetables<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
of my nutrients from vegetables and

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.680 
of my nutrients from vegetables and
fruits<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:11.160> other<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.239> ten<00:03:12.510> to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
fruits and that other you know ten to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.870 
fruits and that other you know ten to
twenty<00:03:13.049> percent<00:03:13.410> can<00:03:13.739> be<00:03:13.889> pretty<00:03:14.519> much<00:03:14.670> used

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
twenty percent can be pretty much used

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.729 
twenty percent can be pretty much used
on<00:03:15.060> whatever<00:03:15.299> you'd<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:15.660> knowing<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.290> you

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
on whatever you'd like knowing that you

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.650 
on whatever you'd like knowing that you
know<00:03:16.769> if<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:17.760> basically<00:03:17.940> eat<00:03:18.389> cake

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
know if you just basically eat cake

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.629 
know if you just basically eat cake
that's<00:03:18.900> probably<00:03:19.260> not<00:03:19.410> going<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.709> help<00:03:20.370> with

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
that's probably not going to help with

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.370 
that's probably not going to help with
the<00:03:20.670> health<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.380> weight<00:03:22.560> loss<00:03:22.769> but

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
the health and the weight loss but

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.500 
the health and the weight loss but
that's<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.650> concept<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:27.060> use<00:03:27.329> this

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
that's the concept is that you use this

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.080 
that's the concept is that you use this
time<00:03:27.780> period<00:03:28.139> to<00:03:28.200> reboot<00:03:28.530> your<00:03:28.739> system<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:29.639> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
time period to reboot your system to to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.690 
time period to reboot your system to to
juice<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.780> get<00:03:30.980> detoxed<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.040> get<00:03:32.220> all<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
juice and get detoxed and get all of the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.110 
juice and get detoxed and get all of the
the<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:34.799> bad<00:03:34.950> nutrition<00:03:35.220> basically<00:03:35.910> out<00:03:36.090> of

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
the the bad nutrition basically out of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.680 
the the bad nutrition basically out of
your<00:03:36.359> body<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:37.260> replace<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.709> with<00:03:38.419> power<00:03:39.419> pack

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
your body and replace it with power pack

nutrient<00:03:40.230> foods<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.389> and<00:03:42.389> that's<00:03:42.569> what<00:03:42.810> i've

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
nutrient foods and and that's what i've

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.440 
nutrient foods and and that's what i've
been<00:03:42.900> doing<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:43.650> 10<00:03:44.459> more<00:03:44.609> days<00:03:44.790> left<00:03:45.090> and

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
again on day 25 on day 30 i actually

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.229 
again on day 25 on day 30 i actually
took<00:03:53.489> photographs<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:55.130> myself<00:03:56.130> prior<00:03:56.910> to

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
took photographs of myself prior to

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.059 
took photographs of myself prior to
doing<00:03:57.389> this<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.019> i<00:03:58.230> will<00:03:58.380> have<00:03:58.500> photographs

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
doing this and i will have photographs

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.259 
doing this and i will have photographs
posts<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.440> both<00:04:01.440> will<00:04:01.709> be<00:04:01.739> equally<00:04:02.160> scary<00:04:02.549> but

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
posts so both will be equally scary but

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.990 
posts so both will be equally scary but
one<00:04:04.079> will<00:04:04.290> actually<00:04:04.680> look<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.340> lot<00:04:05.519> better<00:04:05.700> than

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000
