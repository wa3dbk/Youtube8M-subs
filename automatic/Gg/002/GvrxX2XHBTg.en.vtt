through<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:42.030> see<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.390> wheat<00:03:42.570> here<00:03:42.870> in

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
through you can see the wheat here in

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.900 
through you can see the wheat here in
the<00:03:43.019> background<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.799> hasn't<00:03:44.220> been<00:03:44.310> harvested

then you have this kind of residue left
you<00:03:54.090> can<00:03:54.239> see<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.570> standing<00:03:55.080> residue<00:03:55.590> almost

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
you can see the standing residue almost

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.440 
you can see the standing residue almost
as<00:03:56.850> high<00:03:57.060> as<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.420> wheat<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:59.489> rows<00:04:00.150> here

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
as high as the wheat and the rows here

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.830 
as high as the wheat and the rows here
are<00:04:00.600> ten<00:04:00.840> inches<00:04:01.140> apart<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.239> what<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
are ten inches apart and this is what is

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.830 
are ten inches apart and this is what is
left<00:04:04.320> with<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.860> residue<00:04:05.370> after<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.450> stripper

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
left with the residue after the stripper

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.960 
left with the residue after the stripper
headers<00:04:07.170> come<00:04:07.440> through<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:08.400> can<00:04:08.519> see<00:04:08.670> all<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
headers come through you can see all the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.840 
headers come through you can see all the
standing<00:04:09.420> straw<00:04:09.780> there's<00:04:10.769> very<00:04:11.190> little<00:04:11.459> straw

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
standing straw there's very little straw

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.060 
standing straw there's very little straw
that's<00:04:12.090> laid<00:04:12.299> down<00:04:12.510> only<00:04:12.780> one<00:04:13.049> year<00:04:13.290> tires<00:04:13.650> of

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
that's laid down only one year tires of

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.030 
that's laid down only one year tires of
your<00:04:14.610> combine<00:04:15.299> goes<00:04:15.540> goes<00:04:16.049> over<00:04:16.440> it

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
your combine goes goes over it

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.130 
your combine goes goes over it
and<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.210> see<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.540> value<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.020> the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
and so you can see the value of the

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.080 
and so you can see the value of the
standing<00:04:19.590> straw<00:04:19.860> this<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.310> what<00:04:20.490> collects<00:04:20.880> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
standing straw this is what collects the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.260 
standing straw this is what collects the
win<00:04:21.330> at<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.840> snow<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.730> shades<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:23.970> ground

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
win at the snow and shades the ground

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.350 
win at the snow and shades the ground
for<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:26.160> moisture<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.670> rain<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:27.090> comes

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
for the moisture and rain that comes
