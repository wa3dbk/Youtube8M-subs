00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 n box 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.010
 wh 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.820
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:18.060
 Masuoka is Hiroshi I am a champion of one's array of 2002 and 2003 Azari 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 Now a new model at Mitsubishi Motors 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:28.000
 Or it has been a guest of the development of new various components also in Japan around the world 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.400
 In the Mitsubishi car 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.820
 Had 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.190
 We are conducting sales promotion activities and that one 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.670
 It is possible yeah 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.670
 But it was also towards the operation education of the best driver 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.630
 Mitsubishi will adopt this mivec engine 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.280
 It is a good place 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.270
 Well it is the engine 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.350
 Does the Tteyuu 9's resistance 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.740
 That various loos 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.250
 It prevents the deterioration of the year Date 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:11.130
 That in the engine is now is moving the piston in the root that, for example, 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.110
 It is friction 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.340
 Or at that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.240
 There are the up and down movement through the because is why you can buy in the Garden &amp; the Der was gone l Nosou 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.040
 I will 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:28.440
 But the Tteyuu biggest Dos in the engine is actually what the pumping loss 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.830
 The point is that pumping out the air 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:37.620
 It is from a numeric value like that Well syringe 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.530
 This is what most of the large loss, which accounts for 30% in the sound engine 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:45.500
 In this 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:50.360
 How this in order to eliminate We adopted a say I vision God in front of the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.780
 Increase engine efficiency by reducing pumping losses 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.810
 It says this engine 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:01.400
 In the kindergarten children inhale large amounts of air 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.540
 Mix the fuel and get the power to win in a row 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.479
 Because of that the kindergartener sucks that much air 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.520
 For example, open your mouth widely 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.210
 When I suck in that air 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.780
 There is a lot of air in my body, and my mouth is closed. 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.810
 Then it does not come in quite 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.560
 I say that the throttle valve for that engine 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.480
 There is a device that restricts the air, but this is also true by this 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.360
 that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.290
 The'm interfere to prevent air from entering the inside of the circle you are riding today is 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.970
 You watch this well and change the valve timing. 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.330
 It is the air before this that I put a lot of air in the engine without much resistance 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.330
 is
