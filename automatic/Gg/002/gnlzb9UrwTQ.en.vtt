00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello friends with you gennady 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.450
 lot, I'll show you how to remove 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.410
 opening sash 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.099
 metal plastic is done this 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:16.490
 insanely just the first step you should 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.490
 completely close your window handle down 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.010
 then we remove the top cover of the loop 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.079
 bottom loop overlay 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:46.370
 take out the pins from the top loop 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.640
 by pressing on its top 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.640
 over here 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.790
 take out the pin 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:08.229
 further needed 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.159
 window and open the handle put it 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:19.119
 horizontal position 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:24.399
 then we take the frame and lift 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:28.229
 a little up our window 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.229
 removed easily and simply 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.190
 and now we have to put it on 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.290
 the place makes it even easier 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:50.310
 take the window and bottom loop and impose 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.310
 on the mating axis of the lower loop 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.869
 pin not 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.490
 hinges must be a little under 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:04.110
 angle so you can conveniently put 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.110
 our window in place 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.810
 and wind up our other edge 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.810
 It's good to get here 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.810
 follows 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.790
 want attention to upper loop 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 fell into place 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.790
 sometimes you just need a little bit when 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:39.770
 lifting up push here a little bit 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:43.010
 question and began to turn the handle down 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.160
 so that our window was closed now she 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.580
 Will not fall and the best tool in 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.700
 the world 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.700
 with such a hammer you need to score a piece and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.459
 we put in place the decorative trim 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.360
 top and bottom 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:38.270
 our window in place everything works everything 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:39.980
