00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
and now the key gen should work just

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.460 
and now the key gen should work just
copy<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.970> skeet<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.360> cannot<00:02:14.690> copy<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.230> paste

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
copy the skeet you cannot copy and paste

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.990 
copy the skeet you cannot copy and paste
however<00:02:16.069> it<00:02:16.970> won't<00:02:17.150> work<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.730> writing

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
however it won't work so so just writing

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.240 
however it won't work so so just writing
it<00:02:20.060> on<00:02:20.180> piece<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.480> paper<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.959> then<00:02:21.319> typing<00:02:22.040> it
