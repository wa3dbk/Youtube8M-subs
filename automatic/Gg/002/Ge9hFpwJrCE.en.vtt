00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.860 

I<00:01:09.130> was<00:01:09.550> also<00:01:09.850> one<00:01:10.150> of<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.300> last<00:01:10.450> people<00:01:10.690> to

I was also one of the last people to

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.090 
I was also one of the last people to
change<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.470> and

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
change it and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.330 
change it and
not<00:01:13.520> because<00:01:14.030> I<00:01:14.150> wanted<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:15.070> YouTube<00:01:16.070> is

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
not because I wanted to YouTube is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.830 
not because I wanted to YouTube is
radically<00:01:16.820> designed<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.210> change<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.659> all

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
radically designed to change it all

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.930 
radically designed to change it all
every<00:01:18.320> one

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.210 

I<00:01:21.030> got<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.600> over

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:37.880 

get<00:01:26.370> up<00:01:26.490> Morgan

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.690 

yeah<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.370> don't<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:39.060> YouTube

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.550 

I<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:42.930> also<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
I we think they also have to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.080 
I we think they also have to
using<00:01:44.950> whether<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.250> like<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.549> old<00:01:45.729> one<00:01:45.939> or

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
using whether you like the old one or

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.750 
using whether you like the old one or
the<00:01:46.119> new<00:01:46.210> one

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.250 

whether<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.480> want<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.720> stick<00:01:49.870> with<00:01:49.900> one<00:01:50.140> or

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
whether you want to stick with one or

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.900 
whether you want to stick with one or
the<00:01:50.350> other<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.310> think<00:01:51.490> it's<00:01:51.670> too<00:01:51.880> much

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
the other I just think it's too much

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.820 
the other I just think it's too much
like<00:01:52.410> we're<00:01:53.410> too<00:01:53.560> little<00:01:53.890> maybe

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
like we're too little maybe

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.760 
like we're too little maybe
I<00:01:57.290> didn't<00:01:58.290> say<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.830> is<00:01:59.760> it<00:02:00.240> that's<00:02:01.200> why<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.440> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I didn't say it is it that's why you to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.950 
I didn't say it is it that's why you to
work<00:02:02.220> me<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.520> change<00:02:02.730> it

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.270 

and<00:02:06.380> there<00:02:06.920> might<00:02:07.040> be<00:02:07.100> traffic<00:02:07.549> up<00:02:07.850> ahead

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and there might be traffic up ahead

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.490 
and there might be traffic up ahead
we<00:02:09.550> gotta<00:02:09.700> watch<00:02:09.850> out<00:02:10.030> for<00:02:10.060> that
