weapon<00:00:43.010> clip<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.430> check<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.570> size<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.350> think

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
weapon clip it up check the size I think

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.889 
weapon clip it up check the size I think
that's<00:00:47.280> quite<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> good<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.910> feel<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> right

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that's quite a good one feel that right

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.979 
that's quite a good one feel that right
and<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.520> add<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and if not just add a bit more not a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.180 
and if not just add a bit more not a
problem<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.469> think<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.100> bit

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
problem I think it's on the little bit

actually start juggling with them like
this<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.500> quite<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:34.890> using<00:01:35.400> two

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
this but I do quite like using two

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.740 
this but I do quite like using two
balloons<00:01:35.850> firstly<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> bit<00:01:36.630> more

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
balloons firstly because it's a bit more

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.120 
balloons firstly because it's a bit more
secure<00:01:37.110> because<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.470> could<00:01:37.650> rip<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
secure because this could rip and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.429 
secure because this could rip and
secondly<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> bit<00:01:40.290> more

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
secondly because you have a bit more

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
secondly because you have a bit more
color<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> bit<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.490> fun<00:01:41.670> sick

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
color then it's a bit more fun sick

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.359 
color then it's a bit more fun sick
