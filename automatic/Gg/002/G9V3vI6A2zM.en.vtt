and put it in there so that that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.040 
and put it in there so that that
wouldn't<00:00:53.460> mix<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> water<00:00:54.180> same<00:00:54.870> with

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
wouldn't mix in with the water same with

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.069 
wouldn't mix in with the water same with
the<00:00:55.230> jalapenos<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.420> I've<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.600> those<00:00:57.750> little

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the jalapenos here I've got those little

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.040 
the jalapenos here I've got those little
ones<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.680> how<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:58.920> work<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.050> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
ones just to see how they work out and I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.500 
ones just to see how they work out and I
moved<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.800> from<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> corner<00:01:02.280> back<00:01:02.699> moved<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
moved it from the corner back moved it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.759 
moved it from the corner back moved it
over<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> could<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.260> some<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:04.559> light

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
over here so I could get some more light

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
over here so I could get some more light
just<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> side<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> house<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.570> was

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
just on the side of the house it was

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.260 
just on the side of the house it was
kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> tucked<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> corner<00:01:07.380> earlier<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
kind of tucked in the corner earlier so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
kind of tucked in the corner earlier so
I<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.170> i<00:01:10.710> ran<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> electrical

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I did that then i ran the electrical

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.820 
I did that then i ran the electrical
line<00:01:11.970> kind<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> ghetto<00:01:12.990> along<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> siding

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
line kind of ghetto along the siding

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.090 
line kind of ghetto along the siding
here<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.000> didn't<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
here and then I didn't want it to get a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
here and then I didn't want it to get a
rain<00:01:17.100> down<00:01:17.310> obviously<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.350> got<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
rain down obviously so I got the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.789 
rain down obviously so I got the
five-gallon<00:01:19.799> bucket<00:01:20.780> druid<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.869> little<00:01:22.110> Mickey

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
five-gallon bucket druid a little Mickey

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.600 
five-gallon bucket druid a little Mickey
Mouse<00:01:23.070> type<00:01:23.640> holes<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.240> there<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
Mouse type holes down there with the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.749 
Mouse type holes down there with the
with<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.720> drill<00:01:28.320> whatever<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
with a little drill whatever put the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.510 
with a little drill whatever put the
timer<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.659> outlets<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.400> it's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
timer the outlets in here so it's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
timer the outlets in here so it's
rainproof<00:01:32.939> won't<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.540> messed<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.990> guess<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
rainproof won't get messed up guess I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.499 
rainproof won't get messed up guess I
should<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> little<00:01:35.520> drip<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.939> those<00:01:36.119> cords

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
should put a little drip on those cords

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.999 
should put a little drip on those cords
so<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.930> does<00:01:37.049> rain<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.380> doesn't<00:01:37.650> drip

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
so that if it does rain it doesn't drip

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.260 
so that if it does rain it doesn't drip
in<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.400> they're<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.640> into<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> bottom<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
in but they're going into the bottom of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.069 
in but they're going into the bottom of
the<00:01:39.360> thing<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.810> doesn't<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.079> matter

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
the thing so it doesn't really matter

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.819 
the thing so it doesn't really matter
pump<00:01:43.759> is<00:01:44.759> pumping<00:01:45.470> it's<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.590> not

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
pump is pumping it's actually not

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.899 
pump is pumping it's actually not
pumping<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:48.290> there's<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> pump

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
pumping right now but there's the pump

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.639 
pumping right now but there's the pump
coming<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.030> into<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.390> T<00:01:51.689> start<00:01:52.320> using<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
coming up into this T start using the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.870 
coming up into this T start using the
