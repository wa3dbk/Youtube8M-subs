Monday to Friday and that is one entire

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.940 
Monday to Friday and that is one entire

class and the whole group of students
that<00:02:52.980> are<00:02:53.100> here<00:02:53.400> go<00:02:53.610> through<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:54.000> class

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
that are here go through that class

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.390 
that are here go through that class
together<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.069> different

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
together and so we have different

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.430 
together and so we have different
visiting<00:02:57.239> faculty<00:02:57.690> members<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.140> come<00:02:58.260> in

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
for each of those classes different

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.020 
for each of those classes different
professors<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.650> final<00:03:02.100> school<00:03:02.310> teachers<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
different ministries from all over the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.449 
different ministries from all over the
United<00:03:07.440> States<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.799> Canada<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.280> teach

United States and Canada that teach

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.750 
United States and Canada that teach
those<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:15.410> think<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.500> backpacking<00:03:16.950> trips<00:03:17.310> for

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
those I think the backpacking trips for

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.080 
those I think the backpacking trips for
students<00:03:18.239> are<00:03:18.420> really<00:03:19.200> tough

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
students are really tough

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.600 
students are really tough
I<00:03:20.349> think<00:03:21.349> it<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.680> one<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:22.040> those<00:03:22.129> highlight

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
I think it is one of those highlight

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.960 
I think it is one of those highlight
things<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> year<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:24.830> trip<00:03:25.489> varies

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
things of the year the the trip varies

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.759 
things of the year the the trip varies
greatly<00:03:26.019> for<00:03:27.019> those<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.379> have<00:03:27.560> had

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
greatly for those that have had

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.309 
greatly for those that have had
experience<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.550> those<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:29.150> have<00:03:29.840> never<00:03:30.140> been

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
experience to those that have never been

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.600 
experience to those that have never been
in<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.500> outdoors<00:03:30.830> before<00:03:32.980> for<00:03:33.980> most<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.459> them

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
in the outdoors before for most of them

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.009 
in the outdoors before for most of them
is<00:03:35.120> maybe<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.420> little<00:03:35.599> bit<00:03:35.750> more<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.959> a

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
is maybe a little bit more of a

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.130 
is maybe a little bit more of a
challenge<00:03:36.440> than<00:03:36.470> they<00:03:36.709> expected<00:03:37.989> but<00:03:38.989> it's

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
challenge than they expected but it's

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.780 
challenge than they expected but it's
that<00:03:39.349> time<00:03:39.620> where<00:03:39.920> again<00:03:40.220> where<00:03:40.400> they<00:03:40.489> they

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
that time where again where they they

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.119 
that time where again where they they
see<00:03:40.849> God's<00:03:41.450> creation<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:42.319> are<00:03:42.739> confronted

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
see God's creation and are confronted

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.759 
see God's creation and are confronted
with<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.580> you're<00:03:44.299> at<00:03:44.629> one<00:03:44.959> team<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.739> have

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
with it you're at one team and you have

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.949 
with it you're at one team and you have
one<00:03:46.250> purpose<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:46.910> that's<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.420> get<00:03:47.599> from<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
one purpose and that's to get from the

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.420 
one purpose and that's to get from the
side<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.349> trail<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:49.040> side<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.370> the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
side of the trail to that side of the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.410 
side of the trail to that side of the
trail<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:54.459> have<00:03:55.459> young<00:03:55.880> people<00:03:56.180> who<00:03:56.269> come

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
trail you have young people who come

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.809 
trail you have young people who come
away<00:03:56.720> having<00:03:57.260> been<00:03:57.920> challenged<00:03:58.579> and

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
away having been challenged and

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.150 
away having been challenged and
succeeding<00:03:59.480> that<00:03:59.959> challenge<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:01.040> that's

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
succeeding that challenge and that's

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:25.909 
succeeding that challenge and that's
huge

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.010 

well<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.819> comes<00:04:27.030> off<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.539> Bible<00:04:27.870> talks

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
well it comes off that the Bible talks

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.420 
well it comes off that the Bible talks
about<00:04:28.199> disciplining<00:04:28.889> yourself<00:04:28.979> for<00:04:29.370> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
about disciplining yourself for the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.550 
about disciplining yourself for the
purpose<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.879> godliness<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.139> think<00:04:31.349> that's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
purpose of godliness and I think that's

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:40.700 
purpose of godliness and I think that's
sort<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.800> our<00:04:31.919> theme

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.370 

being<00:04:41.710> tied<00:04:42.010> together<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.930> just<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.050> huge

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
being tied together is just a huge

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.820 
being tied together is just a huge
impact<00:04:44.830> in<00:04:45.130> life<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.730> leaves<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.270> mark<00:04:46.480> it

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
impact in life it leaves a mark it

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.340 
impact in life it leaves a mark it
transforms<00:04:49.890> we<00:04:50.890> mean<00:04:51.100> just<00:04:52.290> strengthen<00:04:53.290> the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
transforms we mean just strengthen the

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.130 
transforms we mean just strengthen the
nursing<00:04:53.710> building<00:04:54.040> yourself<00:04:54.250> up<00:04:55.050> getting<00:04:56.050> to
