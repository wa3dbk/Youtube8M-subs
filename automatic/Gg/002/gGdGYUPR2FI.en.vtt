and<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.980> lot<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.459> videos<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.090> comes

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
and on a lot of the videos it just comes

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.300 
and on a lot of the videos it just comes
right<00:02:57.420> off<00:02:57.540> everything's<00:02:58.170> fine<00:02:58.440> but<00:02:59.130> what's

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
right off everything's fine but what's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.670 
right off everything's fine but what's
also<00:02:59.489> going<00:02:59.850> on<00:03:00.060> underneath<00:03:00.900> there<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.470> you'll

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
also going on underneath there is you'll

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.430 
also going on underneath there is you'll
find<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.520> if<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.970> see<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.300> black<00:03:03.810> line

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
find that if you see this black line

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.330 
find that if you see this black line
around<00:03:04.500> here<00:03:05.100> basically<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:06.180> entire<00:03:06.300> metal

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
around here basically the entire metal

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.180 
around here basically the entire metal
plate<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.610> covered<00:03:09.150> with<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.330> sort<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:10.190> almost

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
plate is covered with a sort of almost

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.580 
plate is covered with a sort of almost
like<00:03:11.520> spray<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.120> electricians<00:03:12.810> tape<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.440> that

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
like spray on electricians tape and that

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.250 
like spray on electricians tape and that
when<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.340> pull<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.730> off<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.270> pops<00:03:15.780> off<00:03:16.020> and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
when you pull that off it pops off and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.290 
when you pull that off it pops off and
what<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.500> also<00:03:16.680> does<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.190> hides<00:03:17.520> some

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
what it also does is it hides some

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.740 
what it also does is it hides some
pieces<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:19.220> copper<00:03:20.220> foil<00:03:20.790> for<00:03:21.330> example<00:03:21.630> this

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
pieces of copper foil for example this

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.570 
pieces of copper foil for example this
piece<00:03:21.989> right<00:03:22.110> here<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.160> where<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
piece right here this is where the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.979 
piece right here this is where the
ribbon<00:03:23.880> cable<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.330> attached<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
ribbon cable is attached to the

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.380 
ribbon cable is attached to the
underside<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.860> whole<00:03:26.820> bit<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:28.019> wrapped<00:03:28.470> in

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
underside the whole bit is wrapped in

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.509 
underside the whole bit is wrapped in
copper<00:03:30.390> foil<00:03:30.780> which<00:03:31.410> there's<00:03:32.040> no<00:03:32.310> way<00:03:32.459> to

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
copper foil which there's no way to

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.340 
copper foil which there's no way to
remove<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.060> cable<00:03:33.390> without<00:03:33.480> tearing<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.170> up

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
remove the cable without tearing that up

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.900 
remove the cable without tearing that up
so<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.560> have<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.799> somehow<00:03:35.040> reform<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.790> on

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
so you have to somehow reform that on

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.170 
so you have to somehow reform that on
there<00:03:36.060> there's<00:03:36.209> other<00:03:36.390> various<00:03:36.810> tables<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
there there's other various tables and

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.460 
there there's other various tables and
things<00:03:39.180> underneath<00:03:39.840> there<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.350> are

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
things underneath there that are

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.740 
things underneath there that are
impossible<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.549> pop<00:03:41.850> off<00:03:42.090> without<00:03:42.299> tearing

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
impossible to pop off without tearing

screen<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.630> causes<00:04:09.959> distortion<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:11.220> now<00:04:11.340> you

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
screen it causes distortion so now you

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.820 
screen it causes distortion so now you

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
the place of course the problem is

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.780 
the place of course the problem is
you've<00:04:24.570> removed<00:04:24.960> your<00:04:25.140> glue<00:04:25.500> right<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.550> glue

to come up with glue but first you want
to<00:04:30.900> do<00:04:30.990> a

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720

which she dropped promptly about two
weeks<00:04:43.180> after<00:04:43.420> she<00:04:43.600> got<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:43.960> for<00:04:44.110> christmas<00:04:44.560> and

weeks after she got it for christmas and

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.910 
weeks after she got it for christmas and
that's<00:04:45.280> why<00:04:45.460> i<00:04:45.490> went<00:04:45.730> to<00:04:45.910> all<00:04:46.000> this<00:04:46.120> trouble<00:04:46.800> i

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.180 

managed<00:04:50.920> to<00:04:51.010> get<00:04:51.220> this<00:04:51.520> piece<00:04:52.620> here<00:04:53.620> if<00:04:54.040> you

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
managed to get this piece here if you

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.800 
managed to get this piece here if you
can<00:04:54.340> see<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:54.610> there's<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.940> tiny<00:04:55.210> little<00:04:55.450> plug

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
can see it there's a tiny little plug

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.360 
can see it there's a tiny little plug
that<00:04:55.990> has<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.230> be<00:04:56.320> pushed<00:04:56.560> into<00:04:56.800> place<00:04:57.070> and

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
that has to be pushed into place and

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.940 
that has to be pushed into place and
then<00:04:57.430> there's<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.300> ribbon<00:04:58.660> cable<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.710> course

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
then there's a ribbon cable of course

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.990 
then there's a ribbon cable of course
the<00:05:00.040> one<00:05:00.190> that<00:05:00.310> was<00:05:00.430> originally<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:00.910> I've

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
the one that was originally and I've

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.400 
the one that was originally and I've
been<00:05:01.180> holding<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:01.600> thing<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.930> whole<00:05:01.960> time

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
been holding this thing the whole time

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.740 
been holding this thing the whole time
just<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.520> this<00:05:03.820> I've<00:05:04.090> been<00:05:04.270> very<00:05:04.450> careful

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
just like this I've been very careful

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.160 
just like this I've been very careful
with<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.230> maybe<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:05.920> pulled<00:05:06.250> on<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:06.430> now<00:05:07.140> what<00:05:08.140> I

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
with it maybe I pulled on it now what I

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.850 
with it maybe I pulled on it now what I
did<00:05:08.500> is<00:05:09.030> when<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.060> closed<00:05:10.510> it<00:05:10.780> okay<00:05:11.590> if<00:05:11.740> you

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
did is when I closed it okay if you

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.340 
did is when I closed it okay if you
notice<00:05:12.130> as<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.430> closes<00:05:12.670> the<00:05:13.150> ribbon<00:05:14.020> cable

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
notice as it closes the ribbon cable

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
notice as it closes the ribbon cable
down<00:05:14.500> there<00:05:15.780> overlaps<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:17.740> edge<00:05:17.950> of<00:05:18.250> this

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
down there overlaps the edge of this

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.550 
down there overlaps the edge of this
metal<00:05:18.760> plate<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.840> didn't<00:05:20.140> seem<00:05:20.260> to<00:05:20.320> be

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
metal plate and that didn't seem to be

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.300 
metal plate and that didn't seem to be
too<00:05:20.590> good<00:05:21.280> at<00:05:21.430> things<00:05:21.670> so<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:21.910> closed<00:05:22.300> it<00:05:22.330> up<00:05:23.310> it

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
too good at things so I closed it up it

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.030 
too good at things so I closed it up it
worked<00:05:24.669> perfectly<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:25.870> then<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.650> said<00:05:26.770> okay

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
worked perfectly and then I said okay

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.260 
worked perfectly and then I said okay
I'm<00:05:27.130> gonna<00:05:27.220> have<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.400> go<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.669> glue<00:05:27.880> this<00:05:28.030> thing

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
I'm gonna have to go and glue this thing

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.440 
I'm gonna have to go and glue this thing
back<00:05:28.419> together<00:05:28.600> again<00:05:29.700> so<00:05:30.700> I<00:05:30.730> open<00:05:31.150> it<00:05:31.210> back<00:05:31.390> up

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
back together again so I open it back up

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.380 
back together again so I open it back up
again<00:05:31.810> and<00:05:32.200> what<00:05:32.470> I<00:05:32.500> decided<00:05:32.860> to<00:05:32.980> do<00:05:33.220> was<00:05:34.030> push

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
again and what I decided to do was push

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.450 
again and what I decided to do was push
this<00:05:34.600> ribbon<00:05:35.020> cable<00:05:36.030> just<00:05:37.030> like<00:05:37.240> that<00:05:38.220> so<00:05:39.220> that

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
this ribbon cable just like that so that

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.630 
this ribbon cable just like that so that
it<00:05:39.760> actually<00:05:40.690> bends<00:05:41.320> does<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:41.830> bend<00:05:42.160> a<00:05:42.370> loop

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
it actually bends does a bend a loop

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.100 
it actually bends does a bend a loop
back<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.210> then<00:05:43.300> comes<00:05:43.510> back<00:05:43.630> like<00:05:43.870> that

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
back and then comes back like that

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.430 
back and then comes back like that
closed<00:05:45.040> it<00:05:45.190> back<00:05:45.340> up<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:46.780> device<00:05:47.020> didn't

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
closed it back up and the device didn't

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.240 
closed it back up and the device didn't
work<00:05:47.560> anymore<00:05:47.860> now<00:05:49.260> I<00:05:50.260> talked<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.800> customer

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
work anymore now I talked to customer

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.200 
work anymore now I talked to customer
service<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.850> what<00:05:52.390> they<00:05:52.810> said<00:05:53.140> was<00:05:53.860> listen<00:05:54.820> it

service and what they said was listen it
can<00:05:55.390> only<00:05:55.450> be<00:05:55.660> one<00:05:55.840> of<00:05:55.930> two<00:05:55.960> things<00:05:56.110> it's

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
can only be one of two things it's

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.100 
can only be one of two things it's
either<00:05:57.340> that<00:05:57.400> ribbon<00:05:57.729> cable<00:05:58.240> or<00:05:58.570> that<00:05:58.900> plug

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
either that ribbon cable or that plug

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.510 
either that ribbon cable or that plug
that<00:05:59.260> I<00:05:59.320> just<00:05:59.500> pointed<00:05:59.830> out<00:05:59.950> recheck<00:06:00.490> your

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
that I just pointed out recheck your

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.430 
that I just pointed out recheck your
connections<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:01.360> as<00:06:01.660> you<00:06:01.780> can<00:06:01.870> see<00:06:01.930> this<00:06:02.169> pops

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
connections and as you can see this pops

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.950 
connections and as you can see this pops
off<00:06:02.710> quite<00:06:03.310> easily<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.940> recheck<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.780> I

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
off quite easily I recheck that I

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.780 
off quite easily I recheck that I
plugged<00:06:05.229> everything<00:06:05.350> back<00:06:05.710> in<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:06.190> then<00:06:06.669> they

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
plugged everything back in and then they

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.670 
plugged everything back in and then they
told<00:06:06.970> me<00:06:07.120> well<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:07.540> only<00:06:07.690> thing<00:06:07.870> it<00:06:08.350> could<00:06:08.410> be

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
told me well the only thing it could be

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.340 
told me well the only thing it could be
is<00:06:09.010> your<00:06:09.729> ribbon<00:06:10.030> cable<00:06:10.360> is<00:06:10.510> damaged<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:11.260> I
