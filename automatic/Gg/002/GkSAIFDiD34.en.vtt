are doing the been 10 month so this adds
the<00:00:14.219> Omnitrix<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> Ultimatrix<00:00:15.809> into<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the Omnitrix and the Ultimatrix into a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.420 
the Omnitrix and the Ultimatrix into a
game<00:00:16.440> here's<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.190> little<00:00:17.630> picture<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.430> um

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
yeah - um yeah so it adds the Omnitrix

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.479 
yeah - um yeah so it adds the Omnitrix
and<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.609> Ultimatrix<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.750> your<00:00:30.869> game<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
and the Ultimatrix into your game and

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.580 
and the Ultimatrix into your game and
let<00:00:32.489> me<00:00:32.579> show<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:34.079> here<00:00:34.320> we

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
let me show you how so right here we

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.080 
let me show you how so right here we
have<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.190> Omnitrix

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
have the Omnitrix

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.680 
have the Omnitrix
what's<00:00:36.899> all<00:00:37.079> green<00:00:37.380> all<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> top

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
what's all green all at the top

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.170 
what's all green all at the top
glowstone<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:40.190> each<00:00:41.190> sides<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> middle

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
glowstone on each sides in the middle

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.619 
glowstone on each sides in the middle
and<00:00:42.390> redstone<00:00:43.050> dust<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> complete<00:00:44.129> middle

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
and redstone dust in the complete middle

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.240 
and redstone dust in the complete middle
green<00:00:45.629> wool<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> bottom<00:00:46.649> completely

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
green wool on the bottom completely

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.020 
green wool on the bottom completely
that's<00:00:48.030> how<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.420> an<00:00:48.539> Omnitrix<00:00:50.030> actually

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that's how you make an Omnitrix actually

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
that's how you make an Omnitrix actually
more<00:00:51.449> expensive<00:00:51.629> than<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> Ultimatrix<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
more expensive than the Ultimatrix and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.670 
more expensive than the Ultimatrix and
I'll<00:00:53.309> show<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.640> set<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> top<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.110> redstone

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
I'll show you I set the top all redstone

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.910 
I'll show you I set the top all redstone
dust<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.480> you're<00:00:57.480> thinking<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.559> you're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
dust and you're thinking like and you're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.110 
dust and you're thinking like and you're
probably<00:00:59.309> thinking<00:01:00.020> like<00:01:01.020> something<00:01:01.710> like

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
probably thinking like something like

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.700 
probably thinking like something like
man<00:01:03.650> he's<00:01:04.650> already<00:01:05.070> wrong<00:01:06.110> like<00:01:09.409> what's<00:01:10.409> done

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
man he's already wrong like what's done

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.060 
man he's already wrong like what's done
the<00:01:10.830> dust<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.369> harder<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.820> come<00:01:12.270> by<00:01:12.330> than<00:01:12.720> mole

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
the dust is harder to come by than mole

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.730 
the dust is harder to come by than mole
yeah<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:15.960> glow<00:01:16.170> stun<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
yeah I know and then glow stun in the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.350 
yeah I know and then glow stun in the
middle<00:01:17.009> uh<00:01:18.979> less<00:01:19.979> redstone<00:01:20.729> dust<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
middle uh less redstone dust in the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
middle uh less redstone dust in the
middle<00:01:21.570> attune<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.590> button<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> side

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
middle attune and a button to the side

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.990 
middle attune and a button to the side
of<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:25.130> green<00:01:26.130> will<00:01:26.369> block<00:01:26.790> wall

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
of that and then green will block wall

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.120 
of that and then green will block wall
and<00:01:27.180> green<00:01:27.360> wall<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> bottom<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and green wall on the bottom but the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.660 
and green wall on the bottom but the
only<00:01:29.430> reason<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.450> expensive<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
only reason it's more expensive is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.749 
only reason it's more expensive is
because<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.530> Omnitrix<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.040> has<00:01:35.250> closed

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
because on this Omnitrix it has closed

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
because on this Omnitrix it has closed
on<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.869> glowstone<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.240> redstone<00:01:39.930> gives

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
on and glowstone this one redstone gives

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
on and glowstone this one redstone gives
you<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.799> five<00:01:41.450> when<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.630> mine<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:44.060> I'm

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you like five when you mine it so I'm

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.399 
you like five when you mine it so I'm
saying<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.229> Ultimatrix<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:48.110> harder<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
saying that the Ultimatrix is harder I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.569 
saying that the Ultimatrix is harder I
mean<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.369> easier<00:01:50.939> than<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.509> Omnitrix<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.340> um

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
mean it's easier than the Omnitrix so um

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.090 
mean it's easier than the Omnitrix so um
in<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.810> comments<00:01:55.320> below

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
in the comments below

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.810 
in the comments below
just<00:01:56.850> say<00:01:57.950> what<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> more

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
just say what you think is more

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.780 
just say what you think is more
expensive<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.570> why<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:02.189> will<00:02:02.430> read<00:02:02.640> that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
expensive and why and I will read that

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.330 
expensive and why and I will read that
in<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.210> possibly<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.850> probably<00:02:05.850> um<00:02:07.160> rate<00:02:08.160> it

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
in a possibly and probably um rate it

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.380 
in a possibly and probably um rate it
thumbs<00:02:08.840> up<00:02:09.840> or<00:02:10.050> thumbs<00:02:10.080> down<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.030> I'll<00:02:12.030> also

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
thumbs up or thumbs down and I'll also

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.020 
thumbs up or thumbs down and I'll also
replace<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
replace it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.570 
replace it
reply<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.950> that's<00:02:16.950> what<00:02:17.160> I'll<00:02:17.250> do

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
reply to that so that's what I'll do

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.250 
reply to that so that's what I'll do
and<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:18.750> for<00:02:19.140> looking<00:02:19.890> at<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.090> yes<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.230> is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
and now for looking at it so yes that is

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.860 
and now for looking at it so yes that is
D<00:02:24.530> ultimatrix

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
D ultimatrix

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.260 
D ultimatrix
and<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.220> even<00:02:29.400> get<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:29.850> with<00:02:30.090> one

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
and see if I can even get it on with one

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:42.380 
and see if I can even get it on with one
hand<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:33.200> got<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.470> one<00:02:34.680> hand<00:02:41.270> there<00:02:42.270> we

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
hand I got it on with one hand there we

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.690 
hand I got it on with one hand there we
go

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
go

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.340 
go
so<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.840> Ultimatrix<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:48.020> let<00:02:49.020> me<00:02:49.080> put

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
so that is the Ultimatrix and let me put

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.520 
so that is the Ultimatrix and let me put
the<00:02:49.470> camera<00:02:49.620> down<00:02:49.770> for<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.190> sec<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:58.290> you

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
