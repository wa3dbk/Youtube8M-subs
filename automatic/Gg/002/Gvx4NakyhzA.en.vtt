Warriors<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.989> I'm<00:04:15.079> not<00:04:15.230> really<00:04:15.409> a

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
Warriors and I'm not really a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.529 
Warriors and I'm not really a
significant<00:04:16.190> margin<00:04:16.430> in<00:04:16.820> terms<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.329> them

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
significant margin in terms of them

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.749 
significant margin in terms of them
rebounding<00:04:18.259> but<00:04:18.979> enough<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.459> get<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.729> job

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
rebounding but enough to get the job

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.089 
rebounding but enough to get the job
done<00:04:20.000> yeah<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:20.989> mean<00:04:21.109> it's<00:04:21.169> helping<00:04:21.590> them<00:04:21.769> get

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
done yeah I mean it's helping them get

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.830 
done yeah I mean it's helping them get
the<00:04:22.280> lead<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.669> if<00:04:22.940> they<00:04:23.060> can<00:04:23.270> continue<00:04:23.599> to

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
the lead and if they can continue to

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.180 
the lead and if they can continue to
rebound<00:04:24.259> like<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:24.830> think<00:04:24.889> they're<00:04:25.099> going

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
rebound like this I think they're going

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.760 
rebound like this I think they're going
to<00:04:25.280> be<00:04:25.370> in<00:04:25.460> pretty<00:04:25.580> good<00:04:25.729> shape<00:04:26.590> Hardaway<00:04:27.590> with

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
to be in pretty good shape Hardaway with

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.060 
to be in pretty good shape Hardaway with
the<00:04:27.889> steal<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.460> here<00:04:29.000> comes<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.419> break<00:04:30.070> and

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
the steal and here comes the break and

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.189 
the steal and here comes the break and
he<00:04:31.190> throws<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.789> down<00:04:31.970> with<00:04:32.270> one<00:04:32.419> hand<00:04:32.660> empty

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
he throws it down with one hand empty

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.959 
he throws it down with one hand empty
