the<00:03:56.299> facility<00:03:56.750> in<00:03:56.810> Shanghai<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.319> actually

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
the facility in Shanghai and actually

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.990 
the facility in Shanghai and actually
were<00:03:57.680> replicating<00:03:58.340> our<00:03:58.430> model<00:03:58.790> from

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
were replicating our model from

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.990 
were replicating our model from
Singapore<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.750> Hong<00:03:59.810> Kong<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.380> other<00:04:01.000> vault

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
Singapore and Hong Kong and other vault

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.449 
Singapore and Hong Kong and other vault
is<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:03.019> banks<00:04:03.680> can<00:04:03.859> actually<00:04:04.220> trade

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
is that the banks can actually trade

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.699 
is that the banks can actually trade
within<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.850> facility<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:06.109> key<00:04:06.260> word<00:04:06.470> is

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
within the facility and the key word is

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.849 
within the facility and the key word is
less<00:04:07.640> time<00:04:07.970> less<00:04:08.359> cost<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:09.019> terms<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.410> shipping

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
less time less cost in terms of shipping

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.259 
less time less cost in terms of shipping
so<00:04:10.069> once<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:10.459> trade<00:04:10.700> within<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.090> same

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
so once you trade within the same

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.300 
so once you trade within the same
facility<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.109> really<00:04:12.530> provided<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.160> better

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
facility it really provided a better

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.069 
facility it really provided a better
let's<00:04:14.150> take<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.389> more<00:04:14.660> cost-effective

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
let's take a more cost-effective

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.860 
let's take a more cost-effective

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
Singapore Freeport we opened last year a

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.110 
Singapore Freeport we opened last year a
very<00:05:20.740> big<00:05:20.980> vault<00:05:21.190> here<00:05:21.370> in<00:05:21.490> Hong<00:05:21.640> Kong<00:05:21.669> yeah

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
very big vault here in Hong Kong yeah

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.870 
very big vault here in Hong Kong yeah
that<00:05:22.510> is<00:05:22.660> almost<00:05:23.050> fully<00:05:23.410> occupied<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:24.130> we're

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
that is almost fully occupied and we're

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.750 
that is almost fully occupied and we're
having<00:05:25.300> also<00:05:25.570> Switzerland<00:05:26.200> London<00:05:26.610> again<00:05:27.610> the

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
having also Switzerland London again the

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.760 
having also Switzerland London again the
idea<00:05:28.090> is<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.360> give<00:05:28.510> a<00:05:28.540> global<00:05:28.990> coverage<00:05:29.169> of

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
idea is to give a global coverage of

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.070 
idea is to give a global coverage of
votes<00:05:30.010> because<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.580> big<00:05:30.850> they<00:05:31.690> ship<00:05:31.960> it

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
votes because the big they ship it

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.630 
votes because the big they ship it
around<00:05:32.200> globally<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:33.190> they<00:05:33.340> want<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.550> have

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
around globally and they want to have

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.710 
around globally and they want to have
solution<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.060> everywhere<00:05:34.300> they<00:05:34.450> don't<00:05:34.600> want

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
solution to everywhere they don't want

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.540
