weapons so I think might not try to be
like<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.600> triple<00:01:15.960> whether<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.320> moves<00:01:16.620> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
like in triple whether the moves to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460 
like in triple whether the moves to
about<00:01:17.520> sword<00:01:17.910> breaks<00:01:18.240> yeah<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> day<00:01:19.320> or
