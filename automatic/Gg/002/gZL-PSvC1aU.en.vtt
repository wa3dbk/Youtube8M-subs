quite<00:00:09.389> an<00:00:09.570> edge<00:00:09.719> isn't<00:00:10.349> there<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.679> think<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
quite an edge isn't there I think to the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.419 
quite an edge isn't there I think to the
rivalry<00:00:12.269> between<00:00:12.300> these<00:00:12.809> two<00:00:12.870> teams<00:00:13.429> we're

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
rivalry between these two teams we're

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.099 
rivalry between these two teams we're
going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.700> see<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> match<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.299> real<00:00:15.480> passion<00:00:15.990> as

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
going to see a match of real passion as

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.130 
going to see a match of real passion as
well<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:16.440> skill<00:00:17.119> Scotland<00:00:18.119> beanie<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.990> man

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
well as skill Scotland beanie is the man

00:00:19.140 --> 00:01:02.460 
well as skill Scotland beanie is the man
with<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> whistle

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.440 

I<00:01:02.530> think<00:01:03.040> at<00:01:03.130> this<00:01:03.220> stage<00:01:03.280> in<00:01:03.490> the<00:01:03.640> season<00:01:04.090> four

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.450 
I think at this stage in the season four

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.450 
I think at this stage in the season four
goals<00:01:04.780> is<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.170> bit<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.620> an<00:01:05.710> under<00:01:05.950> achievement

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
goals is a bit of an under achievement

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.830 
goals is a bit of an under achievement
isn't<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.760> I<00:01:06.820> think<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:07.180> for<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.420> player<00:01:07.630> of

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
isn't it I think so for the player of

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.450 
isn't it I think so for the player of
its<00:01:07.990> quality<00:01:08.470> certainly<00:01:08.860> enjoyed<00:01:09.220> better

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
its quality certainly enjoyed better

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:19.050 
its quality certainly enjoyed better
seasons

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.690 

I<00:01:19.119> think<00:01:19.780> three<00:01:20.170> regulars<00:01:21.009> missing<00:01:21.430> for<00:01:21.670> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
I think three regulars missing for the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.179 
I think three regulars missing for the
visiting<00:01:22.270> manager<00:01:22.720> today<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:23.590> call<00:01:23.799> upon<00:01:24.040> he'd

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
visiting manager today to call upon he'd

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.560 
visiting manager today to call upon he'd
love<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.399> have<00:01:24.549> had<00:01:24.729> those<00:01:24.880> three<00:01:25.299> but

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
love to have had those three but

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.929 
love to have had those three but
opportunity<00:01:26.380> knocking<00:01:26.950> for<00:01:27.220> others<00:01:27.490> well<00:01:27.850> he

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
opportunity knocking for others well he

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.609 
opportunity knocking for others well he
doesn't<00:01:28.329> you<00:01:28.390> see<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.689> so<00:01:28.869> often<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.289> new<00:01:29.409> boys

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
doesn't you see it so often the new boys

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.770 
doesn't you see it so often the new boys
coming<00:01:30.039> in<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.340> they<00:01:30.490> they<00:01:31.000> stamp<00:01:31.329> their<00:01:31.509> mark

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
coming in and they they stamp their mark

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:47.500 
coming in and they they stamp their mark
so<00:01:32.110> wonder<00:01:32.799> if<00:01:32.860> they<00:01:33.009> come<00:01:33.220> here

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
spectacle that we were hoping for but we

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.720 
spectacle that we were hoping for but we

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
probably feared something like this
