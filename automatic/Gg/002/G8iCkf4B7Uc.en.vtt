 we can open our mouse 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.050
 quietly manageable 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.650
 the echo in the tac brakes we can move we can move 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.490
 you can see a friend too 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.080
 we can pass from one to the other and in the lower part, for example 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.190
 we find 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.030
 penis the links that idle balls as you see now I love one on the left 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.380

 unrelated to the same at the end we say of that action which emolabulates the gaze 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.970
 because made on telephony 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.320
 obviously we can't handle we say 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.030
 all the basics you can do with android in we can go on the internet 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.510
 we can not see that we have the browser we have a calculator we have 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.340
 a calenda represents that sad magna mater you see it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.860
 we were born with the actress who very much remembers the basic calculator we can. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 and try on android at 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.540
 obviously adapted to the size of the screen in these hours we find then 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.510
 terminate we find clocks we have the contacts of the thousand rather than the 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.510
 cleave we have dinner to give for example file manager 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.870
 here we are loaded up you see 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.320
 we find all the folders ask there are inside 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.439
 of the partition dedicated to the foolish system 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.340
 you have dedicated it to. Android 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.269
 rt commands, I'm too crazy enough I didn't notice any big bumps 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.839
 is 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:17.799
 in any case, remember that you exist, correct for exactly what is immediate 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.539
 how much I explain you with the photo keys 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:21.879
 relapse 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.239
 then we also have a gallery, we have a messaging department rather than 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.600
 music sector 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.740
 inventor 32 literally to manage any wi-fi connections with one 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.069
 good ease 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.069
 we have a search for the settings 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:50.279
 in this case we have android and two. three. 1 then be distinctly returned 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.809
 consider that most phones 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:56.159
 currently very cloudy. 33 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.789

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.529
 October November this year 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:15.819
 and finally aldo re for the moment the updated android find me say 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.819
 good general relativity is not compatible with various problems 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.939
 square you find around 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.259
 you have a chance rather than the crib you have the possibility of panda 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.409
 art 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.919
 practically open navigation holes with do 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.009
 when to see then and we can also present interact with 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.649

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.569
 left 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.350
 to open pretends faber-castell widget for the result filming 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.960

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.989
 vianini widgets 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.319
 love for example in 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.829
 calendar 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:10.690
 here it is 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.510
 We can 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.510
 then take it 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:19.799
 and going there to position the mantra unique location sure we can too 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.799

 petite rocky use. deluded passate 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.639
 rspp is to respect oneself anyway and is not equally we say 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.150
 when I tell you about it mounting 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.280
 an icon on the desktop of the phone and drag it south text let's say it wasn't 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.880
 other than for the photo size of the screen that makes browsing on 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.789
 internet with this android was very good 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:56.069
 however it is let's say it suffers from high brande girl ita is obviously net worth 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.370
 that doesn't save me 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.600
 as for other somatic features, it does not seem to me 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.270
 there is need to do other focus 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.719
