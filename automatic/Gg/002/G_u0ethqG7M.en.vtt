00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.460
 I have two interesting Chinese ones 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.339
 tablets are the xiaomi 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.929
 mi nood and the oneplus one 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.489
 well you probably known too 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.679
 oneplus one the ant never maybe not 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.359
 You must import the dimi note from 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.080
 China that is not officially the Netherlands 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.089
 delivered 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.429
 the oneplus one is only via the 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.960
 so oneplus website is beyond you 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.140
 it will take a little effort 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.419
 to do 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.380
 In this review I am going to see which one 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.380
 of the two is the better 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 in terms of design it is striking that the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 oneplus a little less high-quality 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 the oneplus is designed on the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.860
 back a sandstone finish that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.420
 feels a bit fierce in itself 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 nice the back you can possibly 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 also replace you need some effort 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.519
 but you can replace it with 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.809
 one at the back and so there is 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.000
 for example a bamboo back 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.739
 present that is also nice to the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.180
 front stands out that the screen is just one 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.370
 little on light and there on the top and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.540
 bottom has an edge I say makes 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.980
 it didn't matter that much 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.720
 bessels because the screen is not whole 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.979
 very big same goes for the shell 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.509
 more that does not have such a big one 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.850
 Both battles have one 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.009
 buttons are in the best that they are 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.570
 neat with the xiaomi which is already something 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.869
 high-quality designed that is made of glass 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.340
 and aluminum aluminum frame glasses for 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.600
 and back sides which is very cool at the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.030
 back side I think is that here 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 it is chamfered and therefore it is somewhat 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 better in the hand which comes to the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.940
 even better and more beautiful about the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.530
 xiaomi mi note really just a very beautiful 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.240
 designed phone 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.100
 there is little to argue with 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.479
 oneplus doesn't do bad but the xiaomi 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.479
 it clearly does better 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.550
 both phones have an eps display 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.250
 at the oneplus it is five and a half 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.050
 inch large at the mino tis that 5.7 inch 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.670
 big on me not so much 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.890
 china sky really you see the oneplus net 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.440
 is a bit smaller but it is good 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.440
 both just pretty big full hd 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.340
 fencing by the minute is a whole 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.569
 very nice panel 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.520
 at the oneplus it is just beautiful 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.289
 panel is laying side by side there really falls 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.420
 to color on the mino and dot 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.550
 be more vivid that contrast is higher 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.899
 the all too splattered look 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.670
 so for that matter the mino has it 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.950
 simply clear the best display the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.870
 OnePlus this certainly does not bad 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 also just pretty lively colors and 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.900
 a good contrast viewing angle of both 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.610
 telephones is good 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.800
 the brightness of the mini-note is 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.900
 maybe just a little higher and yes 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.500
 the display of the mino is common to each other 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.500
 bit better 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.410
 the two telephones are hardware 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.480
 actually almost equal the oneplus one 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.580
 has a snapdragon 800 an ac 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 processor dmi note also has such 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.370
 Processor 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.050
 the mino tip 3 gigabytes of memory and 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.280
 this also applies to the oneplus one 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.620
 so that concerns just paints whole 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.360
 little with the support by the way 4g 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.500
 one plus one missed a band that in 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.519
 the netherlands is used 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.700
 disadvantage 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.890
 but that in itself is surmountable 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.870
 oneplus one has a 31 around the medium 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.200
 per hour battery and the mino it has one 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.209
 3000 medium per hour battery well in terms of battery 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.890
 one plus one outperforms those banks 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.720
 vogue battery that just keeps it pretty 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.190
 long full that very neat at the mino 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.810
 money that less that 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.900
 yes despite a high capacity 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.489
 empty relatively quickly and also in terms of performance 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.319
 actually the oneplus one does better 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.670
 the oneplus one is very fast 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.769
 it's just a good processor out there 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.180
 is of course but with it translates 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.799
 just continue on with the oneplus one 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.750
 in very very fast and frank practice 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.180
 use less with the mino tis 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.670
 the case yes yes that monkey it sometimes one 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.720
 bit that runs that syrupier that 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.030
 soft ice cream just the less 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.110
 optimized and that they disadvantage the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.110
 xiaomi mi emergency 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.970
 then the software of the two phones 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.890
 that is really a world of difference 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.090
 oneplus which has two software versions 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.770
 which you can choose from 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.230
 we opted for cyanogenmod boring 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.920
 and the gin is a very clean version of 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.810
 android 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.790
 He is running on Android Lollipop now 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.650
 fairly simple 12 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.060
 And yes it is just very nice software 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.440
 where you can adjust quite a lot 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.060
 but that very very close to the standard 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.190
 android has stayed 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.650
 Another option is you're sitting on the ls 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.700
 oneplus itself that is a very clean one 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.670
 version of android 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.870
 yes from android lollipop also so that 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.160
 is not that bad there 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.420
 much difference between 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.340
 but there is a lot of difference between sitting 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.500
 between the xiaomi software 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.880
 and the tree 's software plus xiaomi 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.220
 runs on the mirai 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.049
 that is the interface of xiaomi itself and 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.810
 What is striking is therefore that there is no menu 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.060
 is means that you have to put everything in folders 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.860
 go places or of course somewhere on you 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.510
 Homescreen must now also be lost if you 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.040
 view the notification bar, for example 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.450
 is that very much adjusted 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.500
 yes they are just very many 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.850
 adjustments in many areas 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.830
 been 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.600
 the phone still runs on android kitkat 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.130
 he will fix an update to lollipop 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.010
 but when I don't know 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.110
 but anyway whether you're on kit cat or on 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.000
 lollipop runs that interface that is 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.450
 just less than the oneplus what me 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.310
 concerns 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.200
 what further stands out with the xiaomi is that 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.630
 it is clearly a chinese phone and 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.130
 That means you sometimes report him 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.840
 chinese does not get on some things 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.180
 well translated that apps are on it 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.370
 which you as a Westerner just don't get along with 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.690
 can therefore also for that matter to your real 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.690
 oneplus that simply arranged better 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:11.029
 then the multimedia department there are the 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.469
 two actually bold the 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.539
 show them they have the players to 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:16.219
 bottom and the oneplus has too 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.689
 speaker at the bottom and two 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.579
 speakers but they do bring a mono 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.109
 sound and it must be said 

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:23.899
 that both phones 

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:26.449
 just produce quite a bit of sound 

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.319
 do them pretty well the film is just 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.759
 slightly harder 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.379
 just a bit sharper maybe 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.819
 differences are just not that bad 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.039
 great i would go just before the show 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.459
 in terms of speaker but gave is not that whole 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.579
 much out 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:39.889
 the camera of the two that differs 

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:42.860
 a little more both have a 13 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.719
 megapixel camera with double flash 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.239
 the show more , he has two colors 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.099
 with that you can do something better with the white one 

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:51.139
 balance while flashing 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.759
 at the oneplus he has a color for me 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.669
 but good it also does well 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:58.279
 and the oneplus that shoots photos that 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.739
 slightly less lively and beautiful in color 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.999
 and a little less sharpened 

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:04.189
 and with that they might be something 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:06.259
 more natural to shoot the shell midi 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.669
 photos that are more beautiful in color 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.979
 and a little more sharpened and that 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.169
 means that they just look nicer 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.809
 yes for most, most will 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.979
 can go out if you are really natural 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:17.959
 want to shoot photos then the oneplus 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.339
 maybe just a little better but also here 

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:20.419
 holds that they are not that very much 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.069
 care 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.779
 yes at the just have pretty good ones 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.449
 camera by the way also got a good one 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.099
 selfie camera in the front 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.649
 so for that matter it's just up to date 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.259
 the good smartphones in the multimedia field 

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:34.639
 and i would say the show and each 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.909
 just wind but the difference is just 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.909
 not so good 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.360
 what is also not unimportant is that there 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.490
 Another price difference is between these 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.280
 two telephones are both relative 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.400
 cheap but to the oneplus one that costs 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.800
 300 euros for the 16 gigabyte version 350 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.820
 euro for the 64 gigabyte version without 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.710
 extendable memory 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.199
 the mie dood also has no expandable 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:02.080
 memory and a 16 and 64 gigabyte version 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:04.060
 that 16 gigabyte version that costs around 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.669
 400 euros just a little less light too 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.139
 little bit we gave him the 64 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.910
 gigabyte version that is yet another pair 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.830
 tens of more expensive and with that shield it 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.349
 just almost 100 euros with the oneplus one 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.180
 now which of the two is better 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.680
 they both have their strengths but 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.509
 I would definitely go anywhere for the Oneplus 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.490
 one go mainly because that software 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.410
 simply better optimized is the 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.240
 phone runs faster and the phone 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.530
 has a better battery 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.720
 design of the oneplus one is perhaps 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.910
 just a little less display is just a little less 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.849
 the camera is slightly less 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.440
 the speaker is just a little less so 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:37.419
 certainly benefits for the show are not 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.150
 only that much worse software 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:42.550
 worse optimization and therefore 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.650
 less pleasant user experience 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.090
 are decisive plus for me 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.740
 that once again the price a lot 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.210
 100 euros and the oneplus one 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.260
 is more easily available 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.610
 so we are concerned that they are very sure 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.610
 go for the band plus what
