there's a small problem that I'm having
you<00:04:03.390> can<00:04:03.570> tell<00:04:05.390> these<00:04:06.390> two<00:04:06.420> hex<00:04:06.930> screws<00:04:07.290> are<00:04:07.530> on

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
you can tell these two hex screws are on

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.449 
you can tell these two hex screws are on
the<00:04:07.770> back<00:04:08.010> near<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.880> back<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.480> blade<00:04:09.690> and

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
the back near the back of the blade and

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.050 
the back near the back of the blade and
then<00:04:12.080> same<00:04:13.080> on<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.290> other<00:04:13.320> side<00:04:14.060> there's

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
then same on the other side there's

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.660 
then same on the other side there's
nothing<00:04:15.480> on<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.170> side<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.340> scale<00:04:17.609> that

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
nothing on this side of the scale that

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.099 
nothing on this side of the scale that
fastens<00:04:18.540> itself<00:04:18.930> down<00:04:19.170> to<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.620> liner<00:04:20.330> so<00:04:21.330> what

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
fastens itself down to the liner so what

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.450 
fastens itself down to the liner so what
happens<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:24.050> have<00:04:25.050> very<00:04:25.460> tight

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
happens is that you have very tight

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.560 
happens is that you have very tight
seams<00:04:26.850> between

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
seams between

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.520 
seams between
scale<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.200> liner<00:04:28.440> on<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.770> back<00:04:29.040> side<00:04:30.530> but

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
scale in the liner on the back side but

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.240 
scale in the liner on the back side but
on<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.710> front<00:04:32.010> side<00:04:33.140> we<00:04:34.140> have<00:04:34.170> some<00:04:34.500> gaps<00:04:34.830> and

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
on the front side we have some gaps and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.660 
on the front side we have some gaps and
if<00:04:35.610> some<00:04:35.790> of<00:04:35.850> these<00:04:35.940> gaps<00:04:36.300> are<00:04:37.670> very

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
if some of these gaps are very

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.290 
if some of these gaps are very
noticeable<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:39.840> mean<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.110> can<00:04:40.880> let's<00:04:41.880> let's

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
noticeable and I mean I can let's let's

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.410 
noticeable and I mean I can let's let's
take<00:04:42.480> another<00:04:42.600> knife<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.940> can<00:04:44.940> show<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.150> what's

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
take another knife I can show you what's

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.130 
take another knife I can show you what's
happening<00:04:45.810> here<00:04:47.510> she's<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.600> samurai<00:04:48.960> move

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
happening here she's the samurai move

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:56.540 
happening here she's the samurai move
333<00:04:51.230> you<00:04:52.230> know<00:04:52.320> I'm<00:04:52.410> it's<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:52.800> big<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:55.550> can

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
333 you know I'm it's so big that can

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.360 
333 you know I'm it's so big that can
almost<00:04:56.750> pry<00:04:57.750> this<00:04:57.810> thing<00:04:58.170> up<00:04:58.350> with<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.950> thin

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
almost pry this thing up with the thin

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.730 
almost pry this thing up with the thin
knife<00:05:02.940> blade<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:05.810> guess<00:05:06.810> part<00:05:07.230> of<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.440> has<00:05:07.470> to

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
knife blade so I guess part of it has to

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.830 
knife blade so I guess part of it has to
do<00:05:07.890> with<00:05:08.040> just<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.310> design<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:09.450> know<00:05:09.480> they

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
do with just the design you know they

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.480 
do with just the design you know they
they<00:05:10.410> should<00:05:10.650> have<00:05:10.740> thought<00:05:10.950> about<00:05:11.100> maybe

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
they should have thought about maybe

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.790 
they should have thought about maybe
putting<00:05:11.640> another<00:05:12.090> hex<00:05:12.390> screw<00:05:12.750> right<00:05:12.990> there<00:05:13.320> or

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
putting another hex screw right there or

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.970 
putting another hex screw right there or
maybe<00:05:14.070> right<00:05:14.790> there<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.840> kind<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.170> keep<00:05:16.770> the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
maybe right there to kind of keep the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.600 
maybe right there to kind of keep the
scales<00:05:17.370> from<00:05:17.520> writing<00:05:17.880> up<00:05:18.890> but<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:21.780> know<00:05:21.870> for

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
scales from writing up but you know for

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.720 
scales from writing up but you know for
what<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.880> get<00:05:24.120> out<00:05:24.390> of<00:05:24.780> this<00:05:24.870> package<00:05:25.730> it's
