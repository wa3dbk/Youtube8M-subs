and it can take a while they might spot
you<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.979> dead<00:01:35.670> silence

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
you and if you don't have dead silence

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.890 
you and if you don't have dead silence
they<00:01:36.240> might<00:01:36.420> hear<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
they might hear you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.710 
they might hear you
but<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.710> building<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.189> great<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
but in this building is great and you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.060 
but in this building is great and you
can<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:39.960> jump<00:01:40.110> out<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.560> anything<00:01:40.770> goes

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
can just jump out there if anything goes

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.819 
can just jump out there if anything goes
wrong<00:01:41.210> now<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> B<00:01:42.570> bomb<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.990> much<00:01:43.530> much<00:01:43.770> easier

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
wrong now the B bomb is much much easier

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.880 
wrong now the B bomb is much much easier
it<00:01:44.430> has<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> great<00:01:45.060> spot<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it has a great spot which you can just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.440 
it has a great spot which you can just
run<00:01:47.130> straight<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> they'll<00:01:47.970> come<00:01:48.149> from<00:01:48.240> those

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
run straight to they'll come from those

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.960 
run straight to they'll come from those
two<00:01:48.659> places<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.310> lie<00:01:50.490> down<00:01:50.520> here

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
two places and if you lie down here

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940 
two places and if you lie down here
under<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.509> they'll<00:01:51.869> either<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.500> jump<00:01:52.829> over

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
under this they'll either just jump over

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.980 
under this they'll either just jump over
and<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:54.000> run<00:01:54.479> round<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.899> you're

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and not see you or run round and you're

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.770 
and not see you or run round and you're
protected<00:01:55.439> by<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> rock<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.270> spot

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
protected by the rock but it is a spot

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.450 
protected by the rock but it is a spot
that<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> lot<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> people<00:01:58.619> use<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> wouldn't

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that a lot of people use so I wouldn't

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
that a lot of people use so I wouldn't
be<00:01:59.549> surprised<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.210> people<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.659> used<00:02:00.930> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
be surprised if people get used to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.280 
be surprised if people get used to
checking<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.880> basically<00:02:02.880> every<00:02:03.299> round<00:02:03.540> just

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
checking it basically every round just

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.889 
checking it basically every round just
in<00:02:04.439> case<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.920> already<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.600> such

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
in case I already do because it is such

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
in case I already do because it is such
an<00:02:07.049> easy<00:02:07.200> spot<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.369> works<00:02:08.580> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
an easy spot to get to and it works so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.260 
an easy spot to get to and it works so
well<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.610> one<00:02:11.879> better

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
well but there is one better

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.460 
well but there is one better
well<00:02:12.599> another

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
well another

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.430 
well another
spot<00:02:13.770> further<00:02:14.040> back<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.380> see

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
spot further back but as you can see

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.530 
spot further back but as you can see
from<00:02:16.800> up<00:02:16.980> here<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.460> as<00:02:17.730> they're<00:02:18.120> shooting

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
from up here like as they're shooting

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.190 
from up here like as they're shooting
they<00:02:19.170> won't<00:02:19.380> look<00:02:19.530> down<00:02:19.590> there<00:02:20.040> an<00:02:20.760> SI

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
they won't look down there an SI

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.860 
they won't look down there an SI
deliberately<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:23.270> but<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.420> next<00:02:24.660> spot<00:02:24.840> is

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
deliberately do but the next spot is

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.140 
deliberately do but the next spot is
further<00:02:25.290> back<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.310> kind<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.640> line<00:02:26.850> this

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
further back and you kind of line this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.270 
further back and you kind of line this
grass<00:02:27.480> stuff<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.470> don't<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:29.040> look
