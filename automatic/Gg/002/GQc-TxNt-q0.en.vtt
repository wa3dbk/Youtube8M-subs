 that he still stayed down 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.059
 is also because he only became second 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:08.340

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.920
 unique the whole kind of simply 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.200
 human is just perfect 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.080
 You meet the valves before the concert 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.470

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.090
 have been waiting since 5 o'clock interpret that already 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.259
 quite remarkable and there I pull 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.680
 my hat off because I really have to 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.030
 say that's really cold and that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.409
 you do that so consistently and 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.520
 hire babysitter to see me 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.200

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.479
 I also feel inherited somewhere 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.030
 And then the fans are finally allowed into the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.009
 hall is 90 minutes before the concert starts 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.170
 got the best places reason everyone 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.190
 wants in the first row behind the stage 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.240
 something quieter then everyone so mixed 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.770
 I feel that I am in any case 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.060
 super super glad I finally got back 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.009
 on the stage and that my tour 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.179
 is finally starting today but I have 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.039
 also a bit tense because 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.690
 of course, one is afraid yes holds the 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.130
 Agree but the samples is 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.299
 Everything went great and my vote 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.729

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.380

 I hope to convince the people 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.649
 the rows are now tight 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.239
 crowded too tight for some fans yet 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.690
 Before the concert starts, the concert is for you 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.010
 water rich 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.630
