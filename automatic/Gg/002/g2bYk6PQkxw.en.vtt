adds a little bit more and once we brush
through<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:32.710> it's<00:05:32.919> going<00:05:33.040> to<00:05:33.100> blend<00:05:33.340> a<00:05:33.520> lot

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
through it it's going to blend a lot

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.219 
through it it's going to blend a lot
better<00:05:33.880> too<00:05:34.120> all<00:05:34.390> right<00:05:34.479> so<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:34.780> this<00:05:34.930> cools

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
going to come through usually I'll use

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.409 
going to come through usually I'll use
either<00:05:47.470> Loria<00:05:48.010> l<00:05:48.250> nett<00:05:48.520> satin<00:05:49.030> which<00:05:49.210> looks

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
either Loria l nett satin which looks

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.960 
either Loria l nett satin which looks
like<00:05:49.479> this<00:05:49.600> I<00:05:50.110> think<00:05:50.200> is<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:51.190> stronghold<00:05:51.760> but

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
like this I think is the stronghold but

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.820 
like this I think is the stronghold but
this<00:05:52.390> kind<00:05:52.540> of<00:05:52.660> smells<00:05:52.900> a<00:05:53.050> little<00:05:53.169> old<00:05:53.500> ladyish

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.110 
this kind of smells a little old ladyish
and<00:05:54.160> I<00:05:54.220> think<00:05:54.430> they<00:05:54.520> actually<00:05:54.850> have<00:05:54.970> an

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
and I think they actually have an

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.480 
and I think they actually have an
unscented<00:05:55.770> version<00:05:56.770> of<00:05:56.890> it<00:05:57.010> so<00:05:57.160> i<00:05:57.190> definitely

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
unscented version of it so i definitely

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.950 
unscented version of it so i definitely

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
recommend getting that because every

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.300 
recommend getting that because every
time<00:05:58.990> I<00:05:59.169> use<00:05:59.200> this<00:05:59.410> my<00:05:59.560> husband<00:05:59.860> is<00:05:59.979> like<00:06:00.160> oh

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
around everywhere this is actually

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.159 
around everywhere this is actually
running<00:06:23.659> out<00:06:25.300> now<00:06:26.300> depending<00:06:26.479> on<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:26.990> look

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
running out now depending on the look

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.390 
running out now depending on the look
that<00:06:27.229> you<00:06:27.379> want<00:06:27.439> your<00:06:27.710> curls<00:06:28.039> to<00:06:28.189> have

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
that you want your curls to have

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.850 
that you want your curls to have
afterwards<00:06:29.150> I<00:06:29.419> either<00:06:30.199> brush<00:06:30.560> through<00:06:30.770> it

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
afterwards I either brush through it

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.369 
afterwards I either brush through it
with<00:06:31.039> this<00:06:31.189> wide<00:06:31.460> tooth<00:06:31.759> comb<00:06:31.789> for<00:06:32.689> this<00:06:32.930> soft

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:33.379 
with this wide tooth comb for this soft

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.070 
with this wide tooth comb for this soft
bristle<00:06:33.770> brush<00:06:34.069> anyway<00:06:34.909> I<00:06:34.940> like<00:06:35.419> to<00:06:35.629> usually

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
bristle brush anyway I like to usually

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.200 
bristle brush anyway I like to usually
brush<00:06:36.770> through<00:06:36.979> it<00:06:37.099> with<00:06:37.310> the<00:06:37.490> comb<00:06:37.729> because

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
brush through it with the comb because

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.390 
brush through it with the comb because
it<00:06:38.449> kind<00:06:38.629> of<00:06:38.719> makes<00:06:39.229> it<00:06:39.409> a<00:06:39.500> little<00:06:39.650> bit<00:06:39.800> more<00:06:39.919> PC

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
it kind of makes it a little bit more PC

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.520 
it kind of makes it a little bit more PC
whereas<00:06:41.150> if<00:06:41.419> you<00:06:41.569> brush<00:06:41.810> through<00:06:42.080> it<00:06:42.199> with

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
whereas if you brush through it with

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.770 
whereas if you brush through it with
this<00:06:43.190> brush<00:06:43.550> it's<00:06:43.849> going<00:06:44.000> to<00:06:44.060> really<00:06:44.419> soften

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
this brush it's going to really soften

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.170 
this brush it's going to really soften
it<00:06:45.110> and<00:06:45.289> it<00:06:46.069> blends<00:06:46.340> it<00:06:46.490> all<00:06:46.580> together<00:06:46.759> nicely

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
it and it blends it all together nicely

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.999 
it and it blends it all together nicely
so<00:06:47.810> it<00:06:47.900> just<00:06:47.960> kind<00:06:48.229> of<00:06:48.259> depends<00:06:48.530> which<00:06:48.770> look

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009 
so it just kind of depends which look

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:50.770 
so it just kind of depends which look
you<00:06:49.129> want<00:06:49.280> to<00:06:49.340> go<00:06:49.430> for<00:06:49.610> but<00:06:50.419> right<00:06:50.539> now<00:06:50.659> i'm

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
you want to go for but right now i'm

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.100 
you want to go for but right now i'm
going<00:06:50.900> to<00:06:50.960> use<00:06:51.080> this<00:06:51.319> comb<00:06:52.779> i'm<00:06:53.779> going<00:06:53.930> to<00:06:54.020> just

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
lightly very lightly it kind of comb

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.429 
lightly very lightly it kind of comb
through<00:06:56.779> everything<00:06:57.669> just<00:06:58.669> to<00:06:58.849> blend<00:06:59.150> it<00:06:59.449> kind

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:00.439 
through everything just to blend it kind

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:09.030 
through everything just to blend it kind
of<00:07:00.500> make<00:07:00.680> these<00:07:00.830> not<00:07:01.069> look<00:07:01.250> so<00:07:01.490> done<00:07:02.060> up

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.710 

there<00:07:09.640> you<00:07:09.730> go<00:07:09.820> and<00:07:10.000> you<00:07:10.060> can<00:07:10.090> see<00:07:10.390> a<00:07:10.420> huge

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
there you go and you can see a huge

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.720 
there you go and you can see a huge
difference<00:07:10.750> already<00:07:11.260> from<00:07:11.980> like<00:07:12.190> the<00:07:12.340> volume

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
difference already from like the volume

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.370 
difference already from like the volume
and<00:07:12.820> the<00:07:12.880> body<00:07:13.090> on<00:07:13.270> the<00:07:13.390> side<00:07:13.570> compared<00:07:14.320> to
