00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 welcome to the channel alexgrey givv 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.649
 a series of lessons on paper 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.410
 minecraft in this tutorial we will learn 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.780
 do a simple block this will be an example on 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.360
 workbench here we will now 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.670
 do a workbench and in the end he should 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.529
 get this kind of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.420
 I printed it on the whole sheet so they 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.310
 pretty big if you read 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.820
 less we will have less but the scheme 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.580
 its bonding with api gathering in the cube 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.260
 so same well what guys first 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 what we need to do is cut it 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.460
 you need to cut it out by this 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.190
 lines here and here here so here and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 In general, all that lives is cut out and that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 as you cut out the young man the sweep must 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 get this here billet 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.879
 which now we will be in time 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 we need to bend it over here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.090
 edges neatly further we need 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.680
 bend here too desirable 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.199
 LED exactly here with us 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 it turns out such a small square 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 This is seen if you look like this 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.450
 This square is also apart from this. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.720
 we need to bend the top of that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.150
 we will be on top here and here exactly 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.979
 also we do act from the bottom 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.060
 parts here we are here too we fold 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.710
 despite the fact that we drove you 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 how would it get cubes plum 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 suggest we need it somehow 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.990
 stick exactly for this we have 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.329
 these are the white things you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 they glue them, too, need to bend everything 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.009
 first bend the edge neatly 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 attempts to handle this which is all marked up 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:48.329
 so we fold the whole with the top one 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:54.930
 top second top and 3 and just as well 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.009
 we do here with lower 1 lower 2 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.790
 lower 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.950
 and 3 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.550
 and here are the guys all our figurine almost 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.830
 ready 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.259
 stay on we and glue this last 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.759
 step here look here so you bent you 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.400
 should get here here 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.260
 here bends and now let's the most 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.450
 difficult that probably it will be her 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.220
 glue those who go home what glue 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.710
 the figurine is difficult in fact it is not 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.540
 itâ€™s very easy to stick together 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.910
 from the base of our block 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.100
 namely, look, we take this one 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.920
 here is the most extreme side of this take 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.260
 that's the side and so here we need her 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.380
 glue on this white one 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.530
 it is here that we apply the glue 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.780
 glue here here you apply neatly 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.910
 glue so that it was not too much of 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.300
 whether three of these glue-pencil allow 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.160
 then it is even more convenient for you to glue 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.920
 neatly here this grain to 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.690
 nowhere vylazil here 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.180
 so here bend and neatly everything 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.000
 trim trim on all sides 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.520
 that here was not white and she was fine 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.820
 stuck made a leveled us 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.310
 you need to open here and see what passed 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.890
 it turned out this turned us forehead 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.930
 look here is our block 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.060
 that is, we will see we glued the base and all 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.420
 year in the top star cheat i think you already 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.739
 guessed it yourself where to stick it 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.600
 our blog is almost ready 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.580
 now we need to paste it like this 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.560
 find when starting up and exactly the same here 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.410
 so glue find allowances on the bottom here 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.090
 so here and see that the block will be ready 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.280
 so publish apply glue here 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.140
 a little circle here and a little bit of 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.140
 circle and stick top and bottom 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.420
 so here is our first ready exactly the same we 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.610
 do with our nizam block and here 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.990
 neatly everything stuck 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.990
 we also apply glue here 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.710
 and in the same way neatly put 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.710
 glue 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.990
 and what about the guys, that's all ours, you're ready 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.450
 can also do not only a workbench 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.609
 because also make a road and a river 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.650
 always any block 1 count then it is done 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.690
 all the same shoes get the most 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.150
 the usual cube which is made pretty 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.370
 hard to glue the base and glue 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.590
 bottom glue up try it all 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.190
 make exactly and all the cube is the most 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.900
 simple 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.880
 that's why it was just ours. 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.710
 second lesson we will meet further 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.720
 the following lessons we will do more 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.310
 difficult figurines hope you had a lesson 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.620
 helpful on this all guys sweep 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.220
 block of this one here is a workbench description 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.410
 under the video 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.940
 he was like an example so i will leave u 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.950
 he can link him to the wiki too 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.110
 make and so blocks are easy to find in 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.000
 online Well guys this is all a 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.000
