00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
going to be playing with some kind of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.869 
going to be playing with some kind of
times<00:00:48.239> too<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.250> works<00:00:50.309> out<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
times too so the way this works out is

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
times too so the way this works out is
that<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.210> will<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:51.449> off<00:00:51.660> once<00:00:52.079> again<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that we will all off once again for the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
that we will all off once again for the
supply<00:00:53.100> depot<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> front<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.289> very

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
supply depot at the front with that very

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.880 
supply depot at the front with that very
seems<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.920> supply<00:00:56.879> depot<00:00:56.910> SUV<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.020> move<00:00:58.289> him

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
seems a supply depot SUV we move him

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.209 
seems a supply depot SUV we move him
away<00:00:59.280> or<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.239> scout<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.930> enemy<00:01:01.140> base<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.890> this

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
away or we scout the enemy base in this

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.289 
away or we scout the enemy base in this
scenario<00:01:02.430> i<00:01:03.030> believe<00:01:04.019> i<00:01:04.290> move<00:01:04.559> him<00:01:04.739> away<00:01:04.890> yes

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
scenario i believe i move him away yes

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.600 
scenario i believe i move him away yes
so<00:01:06.299> once<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.960> 12<00:01:07.619> supply<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.400> make<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so once we have 12 supply we make a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910 
so once we have 12 supply we make a
barracks<00:01:09.090> away<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> front<00:01:10.590> field

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
barracks away from the front field

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.630 
barracks away from the front field
vision<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.840> reason<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.710> 13<00:01:14.250> supply<00:01:14.490> we

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
vision the reason and then 13 supply we

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
vision the reason and then 13 supply we
get<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> gas<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.299> reason<00:01:15.570> why<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.869> scouts<00:01:16.140> are

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
get a gas the reason why we scouts are

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.960 
get a gas the reason why we scouts are
released<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> make<00:01:16.920> sure<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.610> units

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
released to make sure that all the units

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.890 
released to make sure that all the units
or<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> buildings<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> base<00:01:20.900> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
or all the buildings are in the base you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.050 
or all the buildings are in the base you
can<00:01:22.049> also<00:01:22.229> scale<00:01:22.619> after<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.580> barracks<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
can also scale after your barracks is

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.850 
can also scale after your barracks is
finished<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.900> should<00:01:25.049> usually<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
human room these are and this scenario I

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.130 
human room these are and this scenario I
saw<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.100> he<00:01:39.250> wasn't<00:01:39.460> making<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:40.000> zealot<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.479> I

saw that he wasn't making a zealot and I

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.690 
saw that he wasn't making a zealot and I

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
cancelled the Murray when the probe left

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.609 
cancelled the Murray when the probe left
and<00:01:42.970> I<00:01:43.060> made<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.270> reactor<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.080> everything<00:01:44.500> is

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
and I made a reactor so everything is

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.320 
and I made a reactor so everything is
about<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.009> same<00:01:45.220> with<00:01:45.610> slight<00:01:45.909> minor

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
about the same with slight minor

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.990 
about the same with slight minor
altercations<00:01:47.220> we're<00:01:48.220> making<00:01:48.550> a<00:01:48.640> second

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
altercations we're making a second

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.359 
altercations we're making a second
supply<00:01:49.240> depot<00:01:49.659> at<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.110> front<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.979> once<00:01:51.190> we

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
supply depot at the front and once we

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.920 
supply depot at the front and once we
have<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.549> hundred<00:01:51.790> gas<00:01:52.119> we<00:01:52.450> should<00:01:52.659> be<00:01:52.780> dropping

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
have a hundred gas we should be dropping

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.249 
have a hundred gas we should be dropping
a<00:01:53.259> factory<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:54.009> bunker<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.990> there<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.229> a

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
a factory and a bunker so there is a

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.840 
a factory and a bunker so there is a
factory<00:01:56.740> there's<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.100> bunker<00:01:57.280> there's<00:01:57.640> more

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
factory there's a bunker there's more

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.389 
factory there's a bunker there's more
Marines<00:01:58.180> so<00:01:58.990> once<00:01:59.200> again<00:01:59.350> everything<00:02:00.280> is

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
Marines so once again everything is

we<00:02:51.340> respond<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.910> at<00:02:52.090> risk<00:02:52.239> out<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.780> three

we respond is at risk out of three

not<00:02:55.930> three<00:02:56.290> gateway<00:02:56.620> pressure<00:02:56.950> because<00:02:57.730> it

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
not three gateway pressure because it

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.789 
not three gateway pressure because it

would have hit a little bit sooner we

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.310 
would have hit a little bit sooner we

would have seen more gas intensive
humans<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:04.209> i<00:03:04.480> put<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> bunker<00:03:05.350> at<00:03:05.859> his

put a move it on mine at the front and

put a move it on mine at the front and
we're<00:03:10.900> ready<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.200> pull<00:03:11.470> our<00:03:11.620> SUVs<00:03:12.100> off<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.640> we

we're ready to pull our SUVs off and we

we're ready to pull our SUVs off and we

don't think it's going to be an oracle

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.340 
don't think it's going to be an oracle
because<00:03:18.459> we<00:03:18.760> did<00:03:18.910> see<00:03:19.120> three<00:03:19.480> gateways<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.170> an

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.120 
mind drop in the back of his base just
in<00:03:28.030> case<00:03:28.209> he<00:03:28.239> does<00:03:28.390> try<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.780> attack<00:03:29.140> we<00:03:29.920> sell

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
in case he does try to attack we sell

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.009 
in case he does try to attack we sell
the<00:03:30.280> mothership<00:03:30.700> core<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.600> throw<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:31.900> down

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
the mothership core and we throw it down

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:32.760 
the mothership core and we throw it down
more<00:03:32.200> bunker

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
more bunker

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.280 
more bunker

from<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.100> orbitals<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.730> we<00:05:28.030> could<00:05:28.210> have

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
from the orbitals that we could have

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.150 
from the orbitals that we could have
used<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.720> delay<00:05:29.020> for<00:05:29.080> time<00:05:29.410> while<00:05:29.680> we<00:05:29.800> repair

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
used to delay for time while we repair

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.030 
used to delay for time while we repair
the<00:05:30.190> wall<00:05:30.460> kill<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:31.030> Dark<00:05:31.210> Templar

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
the wall kill the Dark Templar

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.800 
the wall kill the Dark Templar
and<00:05:32.100> this<00:05:32.250> will<00:05:32.370> tear<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.670> up<00:05:32.760> once<00:05:33.660> the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
and this will tear it up once the

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.030 
and this will tear it up once the
missile<00:05:34.110> turret<00:05:34.350> was<00:05:34.440> up<00:05:34.650> we<00:05:34.770> could<00:05:34.920> have

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
missile turret was up we could have

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.150 
missile turret was up we could have
moved<00:05:35.220> out<00:05:35.460> with<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.760> Raven<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:37.800> take<00:05:37.980> our

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
moved out with the Raven to take our

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.710 
moved out with the Raven to take our
expansion<00:05:38.520> because<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.970> Dark<00:05:39.180> Templar<00:05:39.330> can

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
expansion because the Dark Templar can

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.500 
expansion because the Dark Templar can
no<00:05:39.840> longer<00:05:40.050> deny<00:05:40.320> them<00:05:40.800> as<00:05:41.100> you<00:05:41.970> can<00:05:42.150> see<00:05:42.300> this

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
no longer deny them as you can see this

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.420 
no longer deny them as you can see this
build<00:05:42.750> makes<00:05:42.990> you<00:05:43.140> relatively<00:05:43.710> safe<00:05:43.950> against

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
build makes you relatively safe against

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.950 
build makes you relatively safe against
anything<00:05:46.310> so<00:05:47.310> thank<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.090> for<00:05:48.270> watching<00:05:48.690> and

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
anything so thank you for watching and

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.870 
anything so thank you for watching and
we'll<00:05:48.990> go<00:05:49.290> ahead<00:05:49.410> and<00:05:49.590> continue<00:05:49.980> on<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.640> other

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
we'll go ahead and continue on to other

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.710 
we'll go ahead and continue on to other
videos<00:05:51.360> as<00:05:51.930> part<00:05:52.290> of<00:05:52.350> this<00:05:52.410> guy
