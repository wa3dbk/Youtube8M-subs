Catholics today I just played the game
and<00:00:10.070> it's<00:00:10.639> very<00:00:10.880> smooth<00:00:11.180> it's<00:00:11.630> great<00:00:11.840> free

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
and it's very smooth it's great free

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.080 
and it's very smooth it's great free
running<00:00:12.380> experience<00:00:12.800> and<00:00:13.220> less<00:00:13.640> format<00:00:14.000> this

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
running experience and less format this

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.700 
running experience and less format this
time<00:00:14.270> around<00:00:14.450> in<00:00:14.570> fact<00:00:14.720> I<00:00:14.900> can't<00:00:15.200> even<00:00:15.320> pick<00:00:15.620> up

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
time around in fact I can't even pick up

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.189 
time around in fact I can't even pick up
a<00:00:15.800> gun<00:00:15.920> right<00:00:16.519> no<00:00:16.670> no<00:00:17.029> she'll<00:00:17.300> never<00:00:17.390> be<00:00:17.689> she'll

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
a gun right no no she'll never be she'll

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.540 
a gun right no no she'll never be she'll
never<00:00:18.289> pick<00:00:18.560> up<00:00:18.619> a<00:00:18.740> garden<00:00:19.009> through<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.400> whole

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
never pick up a garden through the whole

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.439 
never pick up a garden through the whole
game<00:00:19.699> so<00:00:20.240> she<00:00:20.300> relies<00:00:20.960> on<00:00:20.990> her<00:00:21.169> feet<00:00:21.859> her<00:00:22.130> hands

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
game so she relies on her feet her hands

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.970 
game so she relies on her feet her hands
so<00:00:23.449> I've<00:00:23.869> got<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.019> real<00:00:24.259> melee<00:00:24.589> combat

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
so I've got a real melee combat

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.080 
so I've got a real melee combat
experience<00:00:25.720> is<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:26.900> too<00:00:27.019> simple

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
experience is it too simple

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.589 
experience is it too simple
well<00:00:28.660> I'm<00:00:28.750> from<00:00:28.930> Smith<00:00:29.230> punches<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.680> cake<00:00:29.859> so

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
well I'm from Smith punches and cake so

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.750 
well I'm from Smith punches and cake so
it's<00:00:31.599> it's<00:00:31.990> a<00:00:32.169> bit<00:00:32.349> more<00:00:32.500> complex<00:00:32.920> it's<00:00:33.190> but<00:00:33.670> it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
it's it's a bit more complex it's but it

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.760 
it's it's a bit more complex it's but it
all<00:00:33.910> relies<00:00:34.210> on<00:00:34.270> keeping<00:00:34.930> your<00:00:35.020> momentum<00:00:35.230> so

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
all relies on keeping your momentum so

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.069 
all relies on keeping your momentum so
we<00:00:35.800> wanted<00:00:36.430> what<00:00:36.640> we<00:00:36.760> wanted<00:00:36.970> to<00:00:37.059> do<00:00:37.180> was<00:00:37.480> since

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
we wanted what we wanted to do was since

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.420 
we wanted what we wanted to do was since
the<00:00:38.199> whole<00:00:38.350> game<00:00:38.530> is<00:00:38.710> about<00:00:38.739> first-person

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
the whole game is about first-person

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.310 
the whole game is about first-person
movement<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.030> really<00:00:40.090> getting<00:00:40.870> that<00:00:40.989> flow

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
movement and really getting that flow

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.590 
movement and really getting that flow
across<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.650> rooftops<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.790> combat<00:00:43.149> is<00:00:43.239> also

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
across the rooftops the combat is also

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.829 
across the rooftops the combat is also
about<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.530> it's<00:00:44.650> about<00:00:45.089> combining<00:00:46.089> the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
about that so it's about combining the

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.869 
about that so it's about combining the
moves<00:00:47.019> all<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.290> moves<00:00:47.980> you<00:00:48.070> do<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.519> parkour

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
moves all the moves you do the parkour

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.850 
moves all the moves you do the parkour
moves<00:00:49.180> where<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.480> combat<00:00:49.839> is<00:00:50.080> more<00:00:50.500> running

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
moves where the combat is more running

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.920 
moves where the combat is more running
kicking<00:00:51.100> sliding<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:51.940> kicking<00:00:52.300> etcetera<00:00:52.660> and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
kicking sliding and kicking etcetera and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.200 
kicking sliding and kicking etcetera and
then<00:00:53.140> we<00:00:53.290> have<00:00:53.440> some<00:00:53.680> spice<00:00:53.980> to<00:00:54.220> that<00:00:54.370> why<00:00:55.150> is

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
then we have some spice to that why is

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.420 
then we have some spice to that why is
the<00:00:55.390> spice<00:00:55.659> boys<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.470> secret<00:00:56.769> so<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.070> secret

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
the spice boys the secret so the secret

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.579 
the spice boys the secret so the secret
sauce<00:00:57.670> is<00:00:58.150> how<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:58.720> different<00:00:59.199> enemy

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
sauce is how the different enemy

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.469 
sauce is how the different enemy
archetypes<00:01:00.040> behave<00:01:00.489> when<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:00.909> do<00:01:01.030> that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
archetypes behave when you do that

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.119 
archetypes behave when you do that
you<00:01:01.600> know<00:01:01.690> what<00:01:01.960> are<00:01:02.260> their<00:01:02.409> you<00:01:02.589> know<00:01:02.619> with

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
you know what are their you know with

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.820 
you know what are their you know with
weak<00:01:03.309> points<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.269> also<00:01:04.930> we<00:01:05.229> have

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
weak points and also we have

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.080 
weak points and also we have
differences<00:01:07.830> attacks<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.970> don't

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
differences attacks we actually don't

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.580 
differences attacks we actually don't
keep<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.509> flow<00:01:09.720> throughout<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> transfer

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
keep your flow throughout the transfer

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.890 
keep your flow throughout the transfer
your<00:01:10.799> momentum<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.520> ie<00:01:11.820> kicking<00:01:12.689> them

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
your momentum to them ie kicking them

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.499 
your momentum to them ie kicking them
into<00:01:13.110> stuff<00:01:13.320> housing<00:01:14.310> chain<00:01:14.490> reactions<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
into stuff housing chain reactions in

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
into stuff housing chain reactions in
the<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:16.110> their<00:01:16.259> previous<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.130> saw<00:01:17.310> one

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the in their previous or we saw one

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
the in their previous or we saw one
going<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.299> quite<00:01:18.540> forcefully<00:01:19.110> out<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
going it's quite forcefully out of a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.359 
going it's quite forcefully out of a
window<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> faith<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.770> potentially

window so that a faith can potentially

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.060 
window so that a faith can potentially
cause<00:01:23.670> people<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.450> suffer<00:01:24.930> quite<00:01:25.049> bad<00:01:25.740> ends

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
cause people to suffer quite bad ends

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.980 
cause people to suffer quite bad ends
yes<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> her<00:01:28.830> as<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.460> know

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
yes I like to think of her as you know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
yes I like to think of her as you know
she's<00:01:30.990> definitely<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.560> killer<00:01:31.860> she<00:01:32.399> does

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
she's definitely not a killer she does

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.639 
she's definitely not a killer she does
not<00:01:32.640> kill<00:01:32.850> people<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.750> she<00:01:34.080> does<00:01:34.289> cause

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
not kill people but but she does cause

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.670 
not kill people but but she does cause
them<00:01:34.890> serious<00:01:35.460> bodily<00:01:35.789> harm<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.170> felt<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
them serious bodily harm so I felt it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.559 
them serious bodily harm so I felt it
was<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.950> smooth<00:01:38.280> combat<00:01:38.940> I'm<00:01:39.119> sorry<00:01:39.390> they're

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569

was very smooth combat I'm sorry they're
there<00:01:40.170> running<00:01:40.590> across<00:01:40.979> rooftops

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
there running across rooftops

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.639 
there running across rooftops
transitioning<00:01:42.690> from<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:42.960> surface<00:01:43.440> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
transitioning from one surface to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.389 
transitioning from one surface to
another<00:01:43.830> how<00:01:44.819> do<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.179> balance<00:01:46.140> making<00:01:47.069> that

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
another how do you balance making that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.969 
another how do you balance making that
smooth<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.390> also<00:01:49.170> having<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> range<00:01:49.799> of

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
smooth with also having a range of

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.289 
smooth with also having a range of
objects<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.759> putting<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.090> big

open world this file it's not sort of
linear<00:01:53.459> levels<00:01:53.700> no<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.569> a<00:01:54.659> big<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.929> a<00:01:55.049> big

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
linear levels no it's a big it's a big

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
linear levels no it's a big it's a big
city<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:55.979> free<00:01:56.159> roam<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:58.100> we've

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
city that you can free roam and we've

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.590 
city that you can free roam and we've
worked<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.399> lot<00:01:59.429> with<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.819> animation<00:02:00.179> systems

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
worked a lot with the animation systems

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.570 
worked a lot with the animation systems
there's<00:02:00.899> there's<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.649> way<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:01.950> animations

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
there's there's way way more animations

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.279 
there's there's way way more animations
now<00:02:02.759> way<00:02:02.970> more<00:02:03.000> transitions<00:02:03.720> between<00:02:03.899> all<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
now way more transitions between all the

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.710 
now way more transitions between all the
different<00:02:04.319> states<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.759> basically<00:02:06.090> what<00:02:06.299> our

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
different states so basically what our

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.539 
different states so basically what our
philosophy<00:02:07.049> has<00:02:07.500> been<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.860> you're<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.489> you're

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
philosophy has been if you're if you're

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.859 
philosophy has been if you're if you're
standing<00:02:08.880> somewhere<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.600> look<00:02:09.750> at

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
standing somewhere and you look at

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.969 
standing somewhere and you look at
something<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.470> feels<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:10.950> should

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
something and it feels like you should

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
something and it feels like you should
be<00:02:11.190> able<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.400> jump<00:02:11.609> there<00:02:11.850> from<00:02:12.600> there

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
be able to jump there from there

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.910 
be able to jump there from there
whatever<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.049> should<00:02:13.350> be<00:02:13.440> able<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> do<00:02:13.769> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
whatever you should be able to do that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.460 
whatever you should be able to do that
in<00:02:14.910> whatever<00:02:15.269> move<00:02:15.480> you're<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.810> since<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.290> can

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
in whatever move you're in since you can

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.170 
in whatever move you're in since you can
interact<00:02:16.890> with<00:02:17.010> everything<00:02:17.579> in<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.000> world

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
interact with everything in this world

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.150 
interact with everything in this world
so<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.840> all<00:02:18.959> based<00:02:19.109> on<00:02:19.380> metrics<00:02:19.799> it's<00:02:20.010> all

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
so it's all based on metrics it's all

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.970 
so it's all based on metrics it's all
based<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:21.109> giving<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.410> player<00:02:22.650> something

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
based on giving the player something

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.190 
based on giving the player something
that<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.519> read<00:02:23.730> right<00:02:24.329> because<00:02:25.079> you're

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
that they can read right because you're

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.810 
that they can read right because you're
moving<00:02:25.320> at<00:02:25.590> something<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.220> work<00:02:26.370> something<00:02:26.730> in

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
moving at something to work something in

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.670 
moving at something to work something in
great<00:02:27.060> speeds<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.019> need<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.290> able<00:02:28.350> be<00:02:28.650> able

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
great speeds so you need to able be able

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.740 
great speeds so you need to able be able
to<00:02:28.920> read<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.220> quickly<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.299> use<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.570> we

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
to read it quickly and we use that we

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.390 
to read it quickly and we use that we
use<00:02:30.780> metrics<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.410> course<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:31.859> we<00:02:31.950> use<00:02:32.070> colors

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
use metrics of course but we use colors

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.190 
use metrics of course but we use colors
use<00:02:32.820> guidance<00:02:33.269> we<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.420> runners<00:02:33.660> vision<00:02:34.049> you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
use guidance we have runners vision you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.870 
use guidance we have runners vision you
might<00:02:34.380> have<00:02:34.500> seen<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.769> in<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> demo<00:02:35.190> yes<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
might have seen that in the demo yes the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.150 
might have seen that in the demo yes the

a<00:02:38.250> little<00:02:38.280> reality<00:02:38.579> story<00:02:39.030> obviously<00:02:39.329> it's<00:02:39.660> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
a little reality story obviously it's a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.229 
a little reality story obviously it's a
prequel<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.890> tells<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> face<00:02:41.430> origins<00:02:41.910> it's

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
prequel it tells the face origins it's

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.810 
prequel it tells the face origins it's
uh<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.049> reboot<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.829> it's<00:02:44.280> not<00:02:44.370> necessarily

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
uh it's a reboot so it's not necessarily

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.599 
uh it's a reboot so it's not necessarily
prequel<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.320> we've<00:02:46.470> done<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.680> where<00:02:47.430> we

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
prequel so what we've done is where we

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.640 
prequel so what we've done is where we
were<00:02:47.760> working<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.470> basically<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
were working with the basically the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.099 
were working with the basically the
parts<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> world<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:51.060> we<00:02:51.420> like<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:52.019> we

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
parts of the world that we like that we

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.420 
parts of the world that we like that we
wanted<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> keep<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.769> we<00:02:52.980> wanted<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.280> build

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
wanted to keep that we wanted to build

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.640 
wanted to keep that we wanted to build
on<00:02:53.609> so<00:02:54.120> faith<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.569> there<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.959> city<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.380> there

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
on so faith is there the city is there

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
corporate surveillance society is still

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.270 
corporate surveillance society is still
there<00:03:00.310> we<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:00.940> crushed<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.510> out<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.870> lot<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
there we just crushed it out a lot and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.150 
there we just crushed it out a lot and
and<00:03:03.670> what<00:03:03.970> we<00:03:04.090> want<00:03:04.270> here<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:05.050> a

and what we want here is to have a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.350 
and what we want here is to have a
stable<00:03:06.160> base<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.520> foundation<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.000> we<00:03:07.210> can

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
stable base of foundation that we can

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.880 
stable base of foundation that we can
really<00:03:07.510> build<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:07.930> hopefully<00:03:08.500> many<00:03:08.740> more

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
really build on hopefully many more

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.890 
really build on hopefully many more
games<00:03:09.220> through<00:03:09.490> this<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:10.210> would<00:03:10.330> be<00:03:10.420> lovely

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
games through this that would be lovely

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.630 
games through this that would be lovely

we<00:03:21.990> didn't<00:03:22.170> want<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.350> be<00:03:22.490> tied<00:03:23.490> down<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.940> some

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
we didn't want to be tied down to some

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.150 
we didn't want to be tied down to some
details<00:03:24.810> yeah<00:03:25.320> we<00:03:25.470> just<00:03:25.650> wipe<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.980> slate

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160

clean<00:03:26.220> but<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:26.970> do<00:03:27.060> think<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.920> players<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:29.100> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
clean but I do think that players of the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.710 
clean but I do think that players of the
first<00:03:29.370> game<00:03:29.610> when<00:03:29.760> they<00:03:29.880> play<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.270> they<00:03:30.510> will

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
first game when they play this they will

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.780 
first game when they play this they will
you<00:03:31.320> know<00:03:31.440> they<00:03:31.620> will<00:03:31.740> notice<00:03:31.950> also<00:03:32.430> they<00:03:32.550> did
