to remember one thing

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.550 
to remember one thing
Croatia<00:05:57.370> is<00:05:57.729> one<00:05:58.120> of<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.509> only<00:05:58.630> two<00:05:59.169> teams

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
Croatia is one of the only two teams

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.240 
Croatia is one of the only two teams
against<00:06:00.520> whom<00:06:00.909> Italy<00:06:01.810> as<00:06:02.020> a<00:06:02.289> bad<00:06:02.590> record<00:06:02.979> ever

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
against whom Italy as a bad record ever

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.820 
against whom Italy as a bad record ever
better<00:06:03.520> record<00:06:03.849> the<00:06:04.060> other<00:06:04.150> one<00:06:04.449> is<00:06:04.830> Brazil

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
better record the other one is Brazil

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.339 
better record the other one is Brazil
and<00:06:06.159> so<00:06:06.610> this<00:06:06.909> is<00:06:07.029> telling<00:06:07.330> that<00:06:07.630> historically

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
and so this is telling that historically

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:10.830 
and so this is telling that historically
we<00:06:08.560> suffered<00:06:08.949> a<00:06:09.099> lot<00:06:09.460> against<00:06:09.759> Croatia<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.569> is

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
we suffered a lot against Croatia it is

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.350 
we suffered a lot against Croatia it is
at<00:06:10.990> all<00:06:11.169> giving<00:06:11.680> a<00:06:11.830> lot<00:06:12.039> of<00:06:12.219> confidence<00:06:12.909> to<00:06:13.330> the

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
at all giving a lot of confidence to the

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.939 
at all giving a lot of confidence to the
squad<00:06:13.860> my<00:06:14.860> warning<00:06:15.789> I<00:06:16.150> wouldn't<00:06:16.569> be<00:06:16.949> over

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
squad my warning I wouldn't be over

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.800 
squad my warning I wouldn't be over
pessimistic<00:06:18.580> every<00:06:18.789> time<00:06:19.029> but<00:06:19.240> my<00:06:19.389> warning<00:06:19.690> is

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
pessimistic every time but my warning is

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.749 
pessimistic every time but my warning is
that<00:06:19.840> would<00:06:20.169> give<00:06:20.349> too<00:06:20.710> much<00:06:20.860> confidence<00:06:21.400> I've

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 
that would give too much confidence I've

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.080 
that would give too much confidence I've
seen<00:06:22.090> just<00:06:22.330> so<00:06:22.569> many<00:06:22.779> times<00:06:23.310> Italy<00:06:24.340> losing

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
seen just so many times Italy losing

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.999 
seen just so many times Italy losing
understatement<00:06:25.870> after<00:06:26.199> the<00:06:26.259> first<00:06:26.440> game<00:06:26.680> and

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
understatement after the first game and

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:28.709 
understatement after the first game and
now<00:06:27.460> he's<00:06:27.639> getting<00:06:27.969> even<00:06:28.029> more<00:06:28.300> difficult

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
now he's getting even more difficult

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.930 
now he's getting even more difficult
because<00:06:28.810> it's<00:06:29.349> easy<00:06:29.680> to<00:06:30.279> prepare<00:06:30.490> against

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
because it's easy to prepare against

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.450 
because it's easy to prepare against
Spain<00:06:31.210> what<00:06:32.020> it's<00:06:32.229> not<00:06:32.469> easy<00:06:32.680> what's<00:06:33.039> what<00:06:33.340> is

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
Spain what it's not easy what's what is

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.579 
Spain what it's not easy what's what is
uneasy<00:06:33.729> is<00:06:34.029> when<00:06:34.449> you<00:06:34.539> go<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.719> Croatia<00:06:35.080> Ireland
