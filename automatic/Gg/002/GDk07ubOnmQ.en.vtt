00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
hair and I think because the Marley hair

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.880 
hair and I think because the Marley hair
just<00:01:11.250> looks<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.760> natural<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:13.080> actually<00:01:13.260> looks

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
just looks so natural it actually looks

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.600 
just looks so natural it actually looks
like<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.820> could<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.780> hair<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:17.100> texture<00:01:17.580> is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
like it could be my hair the texture is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.219 
like it could be my hair the texture is
a<00:01:17.909> little<00:01:18.270> coarser<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:20.509> kinkier<00:01:21.509> which

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
a little coarser and it is kinkier which

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.590 
a little coarser and it is kinkier which
I<00:01:22.439> am<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> half<00:01:23.640> years<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> being

I am two and a half years and to being

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140 
I am two and a half years and to being
natural<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> definitely<00:01:25.680> mimics<00:01:26.430> my<00:01:26.790> hair

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
natural so it definitely mimics my hair

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
not careful but I dipped each rod and

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.530 
not careful but I dipped each rod and
hot<00:02:41.730> water<00:02:42.319> put<00:02:43.319> some<00:02:43.500> conditioner<00:02:44.069> in<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
hot water put some conditioner in the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.539 
hot water put some conditioner in the
water<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:47.480> dip<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.510> rods<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.260> there<00:02:49.530> i<00:02:49.980> was

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
water and I dip the rods in there i was

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.759 
water and I dip the rods in there i was
saying<00:02:50.730> anywhere<00:02:51.060> between<00:02:51.209> 15<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.810> 20<00:02:52.170> seconds

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
saying anywhere between 15 to 20 seconds

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.979 
saying anywhere between 15 to 20 seconds
the<00:02:53.340> water<00:02:53.640> at<00:02:54.030> first<00:02:54.269> i<00:02:54.450> was<00:02:54.599> using<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
the water at first i was using the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.680 
the water at first i was using the
microwave<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:55.859> I<00:02:56.209> guess<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.299> wasn't<00:02:57.480> leaving

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
microwave but I guess I wasn't leaving

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.539 
microwave but I guess I wasn't leaving
the<00:02:57.959> water<00:02:58.139> in<00:02:58.380> long<00:02:58.650> enough<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.400> have

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
the water in long enough so you do have

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.460 
the water in long enough so you do have
to<00:02:59.700> make<00:02:59.760> sure<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.450> water<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.989> boiling

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
to make sure that the water is boiling

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.670 
to make sure that the water is boiling
and<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.060> ended<00:03:03.239> up<00:03:03.630> actually<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.440> putting

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
and so I ended up actually just putting

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.780 
and so I ended up actually just putting
some<00:03:04.709> water<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.389> pan<00:03:07.200> or<00:03:07.260> pot<00:03:07.709> putting<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
some water in a pan or pot putting the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.390 
some water in a pan or pot putting the
conditioner<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.329> there<00:03:09.660> let<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.319> go<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.040> it's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
conditioner in there let it go to it's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.280 
conditioner in there let it go to it's
boiling<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.120> then<00:03:12.239> ported<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.780> cup<00:03:13.019> but

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
boiling and then ported in a cup but

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.440 
boiling and then ported in a cup but
again<00:03:13.590> just<00:03:13.620> be<00:03:14.010> really<00:03:14.370> really<00:03:14.400> careful<00:03:14.760> but

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
again just be really really careful but

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.289 
again just be really really careful but
um<00:03:15.750> yeah<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.470> then<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:17.160> had<00:03:18.060> some

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.819 
um yeah and then this is it had some
questions<00:03:18.450> about<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.290> do<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.560> to
