 the Sounds series are today and as against Quakenbrück 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.840
 Percent I think it's hard to beat us, but wait for the sentence 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.150
 cited the compaction and that obviously does not even work 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.269
 there is still a lot missing 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.429
 thanks the old uptrend percent 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.689
 I made 60 points in Kornburg together more today 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.809
 But what can I say, I know that the game has taken a hand 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.229
 is directed and so decided by him 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.379
 Percent the switches expelled Polat instead 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.479
 So Keppel Land still has something to do with coaching too 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.979
 the bile comes up 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.119
 but when shooting five out of nine piano strings if so the odds

 Cecilia very strong interest Corp. 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.099
 and percent 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.479
 made by 5 20 points more the motto allows I believe that both factors 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.279
 The game simply win this offensive even for kids 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.949
 delivered in the first two games 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.430
 The problem is that you do not have every fourth game 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.120
 the dresser again from 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.520
 4 50% percent was maybe on 36 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.439
 and then have to defend 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.219
 when worn up again look too 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.110
 the game must have been decided early 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.419
 it was these mistakes in the end that made the three open ones 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.610
 at the other end, Gronewold did not announce the last litter that was 3 but 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.809
 the battery is not the best first option 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.679
 Plauen players and us naturally in which the players around on the 

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:57.029
 Cup winner ready to go 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.889
 Session in a row the team has already found a bit to this 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:00.469
 on 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.469
 too good 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.389
 had in Aachen today 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.169
 so you make your full use 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.759
 Also this is great this must be out of the house they should this Wednesday 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:22.590
 26 01 2011 Frankfurt - haunting personal life 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.410
 that is the most important thing is that it was so often the right way 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.949
 provider 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.270
 have made major changes 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.879
 SWC for the Piccolo defense 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.020
 Just today against Frankfurt everything wanted to be Piccolo's Jam 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:39.330
 leave the field 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.319
 to the side Vossen if you do not let the right ones get the big one 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.919
 continuation 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.289
 that was so that the field got out right on the middle 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.750
 here we should have done that but two theaters are seen that would have to be 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.430
 it came 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.969
 too often percent the foot position 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.179
 to a pious center again and that worked in things at the bar 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:59.050
 to have 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.220
 Explicitly on the game it went from injured two days so it is still 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.319
 not one hundred percent 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.400
 in the team ranking on the Frankfurt Römer 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.040
 a bit at third refurbished something intends Kieler Woche slowly around it 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.349
 Ask what the simple team thinks 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:12.339
 Merit 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.879
 and I believe tomorrow's problem that not everyone here knows exactly how 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.819
 this new stake is played like 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:18.900
 the guests are coming 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.190
 and then as we try to bring the ball out of the middle we are still OK in 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.030
 the middle hit the first and secondly too many helps in that 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.270
 Picture quite daring the three-bet three shots left open 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.719
 we can make ten at the end of March 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.990
 who have been good but we will be back 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.140
 Well every player is there automatically »tells then cooking we help 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.980
 the opponent forester 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.069
 There it disappears in Saarbrücken 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:45.639
 and then he does not see anymore 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.810
 and that's expensive then obviously not much to complain about here 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.869
 but defensive 

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:52.430
 but have to work a bit each week 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.719
 that's good too 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.719
 Susman understands the circumstances already
