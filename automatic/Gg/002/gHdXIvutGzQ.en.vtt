00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
all different every time because I could

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.500 
all different every time because I could
never<00:00:41.800> I'm<00:00:42.190> never<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.550> same<00:00:42.730> person<00:00:42.940> each<00:00:43.210> day

I<00:00:43.750> play<00:00:44.230> differently<00:00:44.559> each<00:00:44.710> day<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.129> I<00:00:45.699> might

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
I play differently each day and I might

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.369 
I play differently each day and I might
record<00:00:46.300> things<00:00:46.690> differently<00:00:47.079> or<00:00:47.199> I<00:00:47.230> might

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
record things differently or I might

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.779 
record things differently or I might
screw<00:00:47.680> up<00:00:47.770> in<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:47.980> middle<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.340> then<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
screw up in the middle and then the

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.970 
screw up in the middle and then the
piece<00:00:48.940> has<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.239> go<00:00:49.329> at<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.480> different<00:00:49.980> slightly

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
piece has to go at a different slightly

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.299 
piece has to go at a different slightly
different<00:00:51.129> off-key<00:00:51.699> direction<00:00:52.149> um<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:54.190> this

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
different off-key direction um but this

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.950 
different off-key direction um but this
one<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.820> always<00:00:55.030> like<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.420> leave<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.629> little<00:00:55.840> more
