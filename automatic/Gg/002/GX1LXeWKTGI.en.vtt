00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.849 

I<00:00:00.170> walked<00:00:01.170> inside<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:02.340> main<00:00:03.000> memory<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
I walked inside the main memory of the

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.179 
I walked inside the main memory of the
UNIVAC<00:00:05.400> one<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.390> had<00:00:06.690> no<00:00:07.080> idea<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:08.040> you

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
UNIVAC one and I had no idea that you

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.310 
UNIVAC one and I had no idea that you
could<00:00:08.370> take<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.639> room<00:00:09.210> full<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.630> equipment

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
could take that room full of equipment

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.759 
could take that room full of equipment
and<00:00:10.580> squeeze<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.849> down<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.630> where<00:00:13.080> we're

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
and squeeze it down to where we're

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.950 
and squeeze it down to where we're
talking<00:00:13.980> now<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.960> embedding

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
talking now about embedding

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.640 
talking now about embedding

microprocessors in our bodies I got

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.519 
microprocessors in our bodies I got
hooked<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.910> notion<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.539> using<00:00:21.779> computer

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
which showed a person interacting with a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
which showed a person interacting with a
computer<00:00:36.570> using<00:00:36.870> graphics<00:00:37.620> which<00:00:38.280> was

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
computer using graphics which was

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.850 
computer using graphics which was
utterly<00:00:39.329> novel<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.559> time<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.760> less<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
utterly novel at the time it was less a
