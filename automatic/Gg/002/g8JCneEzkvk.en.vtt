alright<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.079> just<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.589> little<00:00:01.620> word<00:00:02.250> problem

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
alright so just a little word problem

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.120 
alright so just a little word problem
here<00:00:02.909> involving<00:00:03.389> fractions<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.319> division<00:00:05.009> of

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
here involving fractions and division of

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.509 
here involving fractions and division of
fractions<00:00:05.660> suppose<00:00:06.660> we've<00:00:07.020> got<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.859> board

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
fractions suppose we've got a board

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.890 
fractions suppose we've got a board
that's<00:00:08.970> 5<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.889> 14<00:00:10.889> feet<00:00:11.280> long<00:00:11.719> we're<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:12.840> to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
that's 5 and 14 feet long we're going to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.410 
that's 5 and 14 feet long we're going to
cut<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.469> into<00:00:13.679> little<00:00:14.210> planks<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.269> are

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
cut this up into little planks that are

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.599 
cut this up into little planks that are
three<00:00:15.870> quarters<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.500> foot<00:00:16.710> long<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.250> we

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
three quarters of a foot long and we

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.890 
three quarters of a foot long and we
want<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> know<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.119> many<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.449> these<00:00:18.570> little

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
want to know how many of these little

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.019 
want to know how many of these little
planks<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.619> get<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.730> probably

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
planks can we get so you can probably

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.279 
planks can we get so you can probably
see<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.330> through<00:00:21.539> there<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:21.840> got<00:00:21.990> my<00:00:22.109> little

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
see it through there I've got my little

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.859 
see it through there I've got my little
picture<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.220> suppose<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.029> cut<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.750> know

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
picture here so suppose we cut you know

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.670 
picture here so suppose we cut you know
we've<00:00:25.109> got<00:00:25.260> our<00:00:25.380> board<00:00:25.680> here<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.939> 5<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.779> 14

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
we've got our board here it's 5 and 14

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
we've got our board here it's 5 and 14
feet<00:00:28.740> long<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:30.029> we're<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> cut<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> up

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
feet long and we're going to cut it up

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.889 
feet long and we're going to cut it up
into<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.170> little<00:00:31.260> planks<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.899> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
into these little planks that are you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.440 
into these little planks that are you
know<00:00:33.989> three<00:00:34.469> fourths<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.160> foot<00:00:35.460> long<00:00:36.180> each

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
know three fourths of a foot long each

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.869 
know three fourths of a foot long each
and<00:00:36.809> okay<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.920> put<00:00:38.010> some<00:00:38.370> arbitrary

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and okay so I just put some arbitrary

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.250 
and okay so I just put some arbitrary
number<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.329> don't<00:00:39.510> count<00:00:39.780> them<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
number in there don't count them up and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.650 
number in there don't count them up and
say<00:00:40.770> oh<00:00:40.800> that's<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.430> right<00:00:41.460> because<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.270> doubt

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
say oh that's not right because I doubt

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.020 
say oh that's not right because I doubt
it<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.890> again<00:00:44.100> that's<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> idea<00:00:44.730> right

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it is so but again that's the idea right

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.970 
it is so but again that's the idea right
we've<00:00:45.239> got<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> long<00:00:45.960> piece<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> wood<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.829> want

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
we've got a long piece of wood we want

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.490 
we've got a long piece of wood we want
to<00:00:47.039> chop<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:48.120> bunch<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.719> smaller

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to chop it up into a bunch of smaller

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
to chop it up into a bunch of smaller
pieces<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.430> want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.760> how<00:00:51.210> many<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
pieces and we want to know how many of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.200 
pieces and we want to know how many of
these<00:00:51.629> smaller<00:00:51.960> pieces<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.210> well

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
these smaller pieces can we get well

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.729 
these smaller pieces can we get well
again<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:54.780> we're<00:00:54.930> doing<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:56.149> we're<00:00:57.149> taking<00:00:57.739> 5

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
again what we're doing is we're taking 5

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
again what we're doing is we're taking 5
or<00:00:59.480> our<00:01:00.480> piece<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.750> wood<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.320> 5<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.070> 1<00:01:02.960> 14

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
or our piece of wood that's 5 and 1 14

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500 
or our piece of wood that's 5 and 1 14
feet<00:01:04.530> long<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.189> we're<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> divide<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
feet long and we're going to divide it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
feet long and we're going to divide it
into<00:01:06.860> pieces<00:01:08.390> that<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.540> three<00:01:09.930> fourths<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
into pieces that are three fourths of a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.120 
into pieces that are three fourths of a
foot<00:01:11.490> long<00:01:11.790> each<00:01:12.409> okay<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.470> that's<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.040> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
foot long each okay so that's what we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
foot long each okay so that's what we
have<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.520> we've<00:01:14.729> got<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> take<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.930> five

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
have to do we've got to take the five

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.960 
have to do we've got to take the five
and<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.500> fourths<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.070> divide<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.430> by<00:01:17.640> three

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and one fourths and divide it by three

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
and one fourths and divide it by three
fourths<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.600> again<00:01:19.350> sometimes<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> have

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
fourths and again sometimes if you have

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.920 
fourths and again sometimes if you have
a<00:01:20.430> problem<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.570> maybe<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
a problem like this and maybe the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.660 
a problem like this and maybe the
numbers<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.590> kind<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.799> throwing<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.220> off<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
numbers are kind of throwing you off and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.160 
numbers are kind of throwing you off and
you're<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.330> multiply<00:01:24.840> or

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
you're like do have to multiply or

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
you're like do have to multiply or
divide<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:26.970> make<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
divide or I don't know you know make it

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
divide or I don't know you know make it
easier<00:01:27.689> numbers<00:01:28.049> suppose<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.680> was<00:01:28.799> 10<00:01:29.009> feet

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
easier numbers suppose it was 10 feet

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.780 
easier numbers suppose it was 10 feet
long<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.799> suppose<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:32.159> were<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.729> 2

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
long and suppose they were you know 2

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.260 
long and suppose they were you know 2
feet<00:01:33.060> each<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.400> maybe<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
feet each you know maybe this is a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.789 
feet each you know maybe this is a
little<00:01:36.360> bit<00:01:36.570> easier<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.650> it's

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
little bit easier right you know if it's

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.830 
little bit easier right you know if it's
10<00:01:38.009> feet<00:01:38.040> long<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.729> their<00:01:39.150> two<00:01:39.390> feet<00:01:39.630> each

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
10 feet long and their two feet each

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.800 
10 feet long and their two feet each
well<00:01:40.110> okay<00:01:40.520> yeah<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.850> five<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.450> well

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
well okay yeah you can get five and well

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.179 
well okay yeah you can get five and well
how<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.649> take<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> total

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
how do you get that you take the total

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490 
how do you get that you take the total
length<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> divide<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.270> by<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
length and you divide it by you know the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.120 
length and you divide it by you know the
length<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.890> each<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.570> smaller<00:01:48.570> piece<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
length of each little smaller piece so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.590 
length of each little smaller piece so
sometimes<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.759> about<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.329> problems

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
sometimes I think about these problems

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.990 
sometimes I think about these problems
you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:53.159> problems<00:01:53.790> I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you know when I do these problems I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.969 
you know when I do these problems I
think<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.110> with<00:01:55.200> easier<00:01:55.530> numbers

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
think about them with easier numbers

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.499 
think about them with easier numbers
just<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> sort<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.640> make<00:01:56.880> sure<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.329> doing

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
just to sort of make sure that I'm doing

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.440 
just to sort of make sure that I'm doing
the<00:01:57.659> right<00:01:57.750> thing<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.619> case<00:01:58.680> division<00:01:59.450> so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the right thing in this case division so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.959 
the right thing in this case division so
the<00:02:00.600> okay<00:02:00.930> division<00:02:01.560> makes<00:02:01.740> sense<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.790> say

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the okay division makes sense and I say

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.450 
the okay division makes sense and I say
oh<00:02:03.000> I've<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> mixed<00:02:03.960> number<00:02:04.079> /<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:05.310> know<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
oh I've got a mixed number / you know a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.700 
oh I've got a mixed number / you know a
fraction<00:02:06.210> I'm<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> make<00:02:07.350> these<00:02:07.469> both

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
fraction I'm going to make these both

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.180 
fraction I'm going to make these both
into<00:02:08.009> fractions<00:02:08.509> 4<00:02:09.509> times<00:02:09.720> 5<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:09.989> 20<00:02:10.679> plus<00:02:10.830> 1

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
into fractions 4 times 5 is 20 plus 1

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.970 
into fractions 4 times 5 is 20 plus 1
will<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.459> 21

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
will be 21

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.300 
will be 21
1<00:02:12.069> over<00:02:12.340> 4<00:02:13.290> divided<00:02:14.290> by<00:02:14.319> 3<00:02:15.190> over<00:02:15.519> 4<00:02:17.159> well<00:02:18.159> now

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
1 over 4 divided by 3 over 4 well now

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.289 
1 over 4 divided by 3 over 4 well now
I'm<00:02:18.489> going<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.760> make<00:02:19.120> my<00:02:20.549> division<00:02:21.549> into

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
I'm going to make my division into

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.089 
I'm going to make my division into
multiplication<00:02:22.330> by<00:02:23.230> multiplying<00:02:23.799> by<00:02:24.069> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
multiplication by multiplying by the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.570 
multiplication by multiplying by the
reciprocal<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:26.260> now<00:02:26.379> I<00:02:26.409> can<00:02:26.709> cancel<00:02:26.950> out<00:02:27.280> some

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
reciprocal but now I can cancel out some

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.080 
reciprocal but now I can cancel out some
factors<00:02:28.030> immediately<00:02:28.660> okay<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.640> four<00:02:30.879> and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
factors immediately okay so the four and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.660 
factors immediately okay so the four and
the<00:02:31.150> four<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.780> could<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.080> say<00:02:32.230> well<00:02:32.549> 4/4<00:02:33.549> is

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
the four we could just say well 4/4 is

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.860 
the four we could just say well 4/4 is
14<00:02:34.420> divided<00:02:35.129> 4/4<00:02:36.129> is<00:02:36.250> also<00:02:36.580> one<00:02:36.879> we<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.660> do<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
14 divided 4/4 is also one we can do the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.630 
14 divided 4/4 is also one we can do the
same<00:02:38.049> thing<00:02:38.230> with<00:02:38.379> a<00:02:38.410> 21<00:02:38.920> over<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.310> three

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
same thing with a 21 over the three

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.550 
same thing with a 21 over the three
who's<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.690> be<00:02:40.780> lazy<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.200> right<00:02:41.440> at

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
who's going to be lazy and right at

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.780 
who's going to be lazy and right at
though<00:02:41.680> 21<00:02:41.980> times<00:02:42.370> one<00:02:42.489> is<00:02:42.640> 21<00:02:43.180> /<00:02:43.450> 3<00:02:43.780> well<00:02:44.790> 21/3

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790

is<00:02:46.420> going<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.810> give<00:02:46.989> us<00:02:47.019> seven<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.760> says

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
is going to give us seven so it says

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.630 
is going to give us seven so it says
actually<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:50.319> we<00:02:50.410> chop<00:02:50.829> up<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.190> piece<00:02:51.459> of

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
actually if we chop up this piece of

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.150 
actually if we chop up this piece of
wood<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:52.720> long<00:02:53.019> piece<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:53.349> wood<00:02:53.680> we<00:02:53.980> should

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
wood this long piece of wood we should

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.130 
wood this long piece of wood we should
get<00:02:54.280> exactly<00:02:54.700> one<00:02:54.970> two<00:02:55.180> three<00:02:55.540> four<00:02:55.780> five<00:02:56.079> six

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
get exactly one two three four five six

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.509 
get exactly one two three four five six
seven<00:02:56.829> so<00:02:57.599> I've<00:02:58.599> got<00:02:58.810> too<00:02:59.019> many<00:02:59.489> too<00:03:00.489> many

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
seven so I've got too many too many

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.300 
seven so I've got too many too many
parts<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:02.190> says<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.310> would<00:03:03.430> get<00:03:03.549> exactly

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
parts so it says you would get exactly

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.819 
parts so it says you would get exactly
seven<00:03:06.310> little<00:03:06.579> little<00:03:07.480> planks<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.349> wood<00:03:08.379> that

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
seven little little planks of wood that

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.309 
seven little little planks of wood that
are<00:03:09.310> three<00:03:09.579> fourths<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.239> foot<00:03:10.480> each<00:03:10.690> and

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
are three fourths of a foot each and

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.410 
are three fourths of a foot each and
again<00:03:11.560> all<00:03:11.769> we're<00:03:11.950> doing<00:03:12.280> just<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.090> little<00:03:13.269> bit

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
again all we're doing just a little bit

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.180 
again all we're doing just a little bit
of<00:03:13.510> division<00:03:13.989> again<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.709> have<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.859> make<00:03:15.069> your

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
of division again you have to make your

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.170 
of division again you have to make your
mixed<00:03:15.489> number<00:03:15.849> into<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.630> fraction<00:03:17.579> division<00:03:18.579> by

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
mixed number into a fraction division by

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.599 
mixed number into a fraction division by
a<00:03:19.209> fraction<00:03:19.569> turns<00:03:20.139> into<00:03:20.349> multiplication<00:03:21.130> by

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
a fraction turns into multiplication by

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.520 
a fraction turns into multiplication by
the<00:03:21.639> reciprocal<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.599> then<00:03:23.139> it's<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.380> a

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
the reciprocal and then it's just a

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.110 
the reciprocal and then it's just a
matter<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.859> doing<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.310> arithmetic<00:03:24.579> and

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
matter of doing the arithmetic and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.319 
matter of doing the arithmetic and
simplifying<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.109> down
