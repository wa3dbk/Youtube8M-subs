00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
oh now you know and obviously that's not

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.100 
oh now you know and obviously that's not
the<00:02:21.590> only<00:02:21.710> part<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.370> soldiering<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.180> get<00:02:23.870> that

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the only part of soldiering I get that

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.330 
the only part of soldiering I get that
but<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> major<00:02:26.300> part<00:02:26.690> it's<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.560> large<00:02:27.860> part

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
but it is a major part it's a large part

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.140 
but it is a major part it's a large part
of<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:30.350> don't<00:02:30.650> understand<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.550> mean

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
of it and I just don't understand I mean

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.030 
of it and I just don't understand I mean
I<00:02:32.330> don't<00:02:32.540> think<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.930> have<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.200> in<00:02:33.410> me<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.650> kill

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
I don't think I have it in me to kill

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.060 
I don't think I have it in me to kill
I'm<00:02:34.940> not<00:02:35.180> sure<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.450> could<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.380> mean<00:02:36.830> don't

Shatner's<00:02:40.790> executioner<00:02:41.570> for<00:02:41.720> his<00:02:41.870> crimes

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
Shatner's executioner for his crimes

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.270 
Shatner's executioner for his crimes
against<00:02:42.410> humanity<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:44.120> aside<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:45.280> just

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
against humanity but that aside I just

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.000 
against humanity but that aside I just
I've<00:02:47.210> never<00:02:47.270> understood<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.590> maybe<00:02:48.800> it's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
I've never understood it and maybe it's

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.090 
I've never understood it and maybe it's
cuz<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.280> was<00:02:49.400> raised<00:02:49.640> by<00:02:49.820> peace-loving<00:02:50.330> hippies

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
cuz I was raised by peace-loving hippies

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.550 
cuz I was raised by peace-loving hippies
maybe<00:02:52.100> it's<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:53.720> know<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.320> I'm<00:02:54.440> an

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
maybe it's just you know that I'm an

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.990 
maybe it's just you know that I'm an
atheist<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.370> don't<00:02:55.550> believe<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.910> an

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
atheist and I don't believe in an

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.750 
atheist and I don't believe in an
afterlife<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.990> think<00:02:57.740> that<00:02:57.950> being<00:02:57.980> killed

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
afterlife so I I think that being killed

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.720 
afterlife so I I think that being killed
is<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.780> end<00:02:59.960> at<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.470> end<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.800> your<00:03:00.920> biological

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
is the end at the end of your biological

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.720 
is the end at the end of your biological
life<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.960> end<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.530> your<00:03:03.950> ability<00:03:04.610> to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
life is the end of your ability to

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.690 
life is the end of your ability to
interact<00:03:05.030> with<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.390> universe<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.140> U<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:07.250> gone

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
interact with the universe the U is gone

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.600 
interact with the universe the U is gone
maybe<00:03:08.660> that's<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.320> don't<00:03:09.590> know<00:03:09.710> but<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.310> don't

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
maybe that's it I don't know but I don't

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.960 
maybe that's it I don't know but I don't
think<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.910> have<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.120> in<00:03:11.330> me<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.510> kill<00:03:11.950> maybe

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
think I have it in me to kill maybe

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.930 
think I have it in me to kill maybe
maybe<00:03:13.970> in<00:03:14.270> self-defense<00:03:14.990> but<00:03:15.640> even<00:03:16.640> then<00:03:16.790> I'm

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
maybe in self-defense but even then I'm

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.090 
maybe in self-defense but even then I'm
not<00:03:16.970> sure<00:03:17.150> there<00:03:17.690> have<00:03:17.780> been<00:03:17.930> times<00:03:18.170> when<00:03:18.770> I've
