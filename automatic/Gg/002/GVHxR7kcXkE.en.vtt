00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.100
 Of course today, when we see Pollock's paintings, 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.133
 We find them familiar and acceptable. 

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.467
 But at the time of its creation, 

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.433
 Was shocking; it was shocking in every sense of the word, 

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.000
 Because it was an attack on the painting itself. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.767
 To make this work, Bullock has put canvas painting on the floor 

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:26.367
 Brush the paint and make it dripping, making a plate 

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:30.266
 For the same painting material, the fact that paint liquid. 

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.767
 When we see 

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:33.166
 Painting on Canvas Painting, be this 

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.367
 Normally hidden. 

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.100
 You know that paint is made to represent 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.334
 another thing, 

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:37.367
 Whether it be heaven, 

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:39.467
 Or field or skin. 

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:45.000
 But Bullock's work offers paint as a coating. He was the first person to do that. I have tried a lot 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.166
 To imitate Pollock. But none of them 

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.634
 Energy, spontaneity 

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:54.533
 Or the absolute skill he possesses in dealing with paint. 

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:59.100
 From afar, the painting is interpreted as different degrees of gray, slightly constricted, but when approaching 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.400
 Other colors emerge, at first 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.767
 It seems that Bullock has sprayed the black paint that was nominated to the stripped cloth. 

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.533

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.634
 Gray and touches of green and turquoise 

00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:16.334
 And yellow. Calculated flat image 

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:19.667
 But it is an airtight surface, 

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.533
 Contract and coagulation. 

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.100
 Occasionally 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.900
 The lines are thin 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.934
 And very accurate. Paint assembles 

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:33.266
 In some areas it begins to clot 

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.934
 But also smears. Some smooth paint, some 

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:39.367
 The other is glossy and forms a dough on the surface. 

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:43.100
 This painting has a touch. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.600
 The paintings are all amazingly human in terms of their proper measurement 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.333
 For the Bullock arm, each line of these lines 

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.634
 He registers his hand gesture between them as she moves 

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:57.800
 From above the cloth. Although you are 60 years of age or older, you are 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.266
 I still realize the moment it was made. In some way, 

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:06.667
 Bullock, the artist, is with you here while you look at the painting. This painting 

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:14.567
 Very honest; Bullock does not try to fool us in any way. But our brains can not resist trying to interpret the perspective depth. 

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.967
 They are drawn to this jungle or jungle of lines and paint. 

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:23.667
 You can define them as the same paint features. 

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:26.734
 Regardless of your background and concept of 20th century art, 

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:29.133
 No art, no 

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:31.600
 Any requirement or token. It 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.734
 Available to all. The speed with which it was made 

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:37.300
 Are the same speed as looking at these 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.700
 Painting and understanding.
