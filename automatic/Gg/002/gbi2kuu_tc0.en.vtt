00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.620
 cécile bonnet of the blog I am a star 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.030
 from my business but not every day 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.880
 so here I come with a new 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.180
 question to share with you during a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.529
 webinar on authentic selling or 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.859
 still selling by fear 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.080
 what do we do when we have 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.869
 finally an offer that arrives at a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.510
 pricing level that is going to be too much 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 high for its target question is that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.469
 this target is really talking to you 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.629
 really echo to the people you 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.809
 want to help but there is a real 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.379
 reality a real problematic of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.219
 funding 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.660
 why I say real problem 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.309
 because I tend to think that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.640
 except extreme cases 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.230
 obviously funding the cash 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.190
 money is often a question of 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 creolity is that except obviously if he 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 there is a huge gap between what 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.820
 you propose is the person 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.450
 can afford to buy any purchase 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.610
 cost 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.430
 it can cost an effort and sometimes it 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.520
 may be denied holidays 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.689
 to deny a gift that we let you do 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.619
 tighten a little belt on 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.780
 certain expenses to be able to 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.420
 buy some things including 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.189
 trainings or your products and that makes 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 part of the choices that can be made and 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.070
 the motivation of the involvement of the heart 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 we will put to you buy your 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.619
 delivery or your product 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.060
 but here you can be face this 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 particular case where despite all this 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.140
 still remains an effort enough 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.240
 therefore for the people you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 want and when one is expert in his 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.350
 domain there is an error between 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.500
 Quite frequent quotes that is that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.570
 we want 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.730
 actually go back to the client or 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.860
 the stairs to bring them all to the top of 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.390
 the mountain there the sky a lot more 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.250
 blue and where they are going to be a lot more 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.690
 happy and it's very noble to want 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.050
 that for our customers to want the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.200
 better but want to climb the whole 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.980
 mountain where all the stairs that can 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.120
 obviously to induce a cost a 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.980
 consequent investment 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.380
 and so there it is also a first 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.170
 reflection that is that sometimes it takes 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.870
 able to accept as 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.989
 professional to bring up only one 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.540
 walk and that a walk is better than 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.050
 nothing at all for your client he puts himself 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.330
 on the way 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.610
 you see but as we often have this 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.400
 requirement of perfection by wanting too much 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.350
 give them one implies a pretty price 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.850
 expensive and most will stay on the 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.400
 down the road all the way down the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.720
 mountain so think about this already 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.580
 posture which is sometimes to aim a little 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.220
 less far but allow your 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.660
 client to get moving and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.510
 to have a first result 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.190
 then the idea she's still from 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.150
 reasoning about value is to 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.820
 to say that how you could bring 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.540
 as valuable if not more 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.340
 reducing costs 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.130
 it's going to force you to be creative enough 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.530
 on your offer and if you find the 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.900
 solution you will have a hyper offer 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.110
 innovative is completely 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.200
 your target and his means to what he 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.459
 must I give you an example of which in 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 the example of this person 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.730
 there was the benefit a benefit of 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.220
 care with a counseling phase and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.560
 general it's very interesting to 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.410
 can mix power to bring next 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.570
 care is a product or a 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.790
 advice we increase the value brought 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.170
 by what we take the problem 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.080
 in a more global way 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.000
 so it's good 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.890
 interesting except that in this case 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.110
 practices do the advice it can 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.020
 cost a lot because it's our 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.510
 presence availability time is 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.680
 so there you are charged for example 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.480
 others present if you are on a 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.420
 hourly rate you spend there a 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.460
 half an hour the person is going to have 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.750
 pay half an hour of your 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.250
 time of presence to do what we 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.470
 know what can obviously be a 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.350
 investment quite important so the 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.590
 thinking that never to the entrepreneur 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.830
 who asked me this case was how 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.630
 bring the same value in terms of 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.310
 advice in reducing the cost is so there 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.340
 without being physically 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.780
 present obviously we can very well 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.810
 answer it's not possible 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.730
 but what's interesting is at 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.320
 unless you think about it because you're going 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.030
 you realize that in a lot of cases 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.860
 that obviously here again 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.320
 the ideal is to be present the ideal 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.380
 but it costs money and maybe 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.240
 that you can find a way 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.850
 to bring the same level of value the 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.980
 equivalent level or not very far 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.320
 in terms of results and that's okay 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.380
 allow to drop sharply by 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:11.260
 example you could imagine that this 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.520
 party tips you will formalize 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.750
 in the form of videos 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.240
 I do not know of a booklet because 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.460
 overall these are tips that 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.130
 will always turn around the same 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.210
 thematic here suddenly you make good 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.740
 only once you have done 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.419
 this product it will be very fast 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.740
 profitable because once you 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.020
 you'll have to shut up there 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.030
 time and so that will allow in volume 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.000
 Once you have sold it to several 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.740
 people to be able to reduce to 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.210
 the investment and the coup tout temps 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.040
 maybe bringing a similar value 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.710
 what you wanted to give through 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.880
 a face-to-face consultancy 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.010
 you can tell yourself in a first 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.610
 time yes but I'm not going to win 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.250
 my life 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.200
 and it's a reaction that is human 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.150
 which is normal but in the long run 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.910
 that does not work and that it takes 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.960
 because your notoriety 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:10.190
 your credibility can be precisely 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.250
 convey about your approach that is going to be 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.810
 an economy and efficiency approach 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.480
 efficiency to always improve the 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.800
 ratio value brought blow and again a 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.360
 time maybe that's what will do 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.350
 the innovation of our offer 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.720
 its peculiarity the thing that goes 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.460
 distinguish yourself from others you see 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.350
 what value he wants on the sale 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.970
 but it can also structure your 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.970
 organization and your development 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.860
 business any case the value that has 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.330
 a lot of value i tell you to very 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.330
 soon for a next question
