which is what you put in the palette of

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.870 
which is what you put in the palette of
the<00:01:36.270> blush<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.990> also<00:01:37.409> foreshadows<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.400> less

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
expensive so the amount of blush that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.660 
expensive so the amount of blush that
you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.330> fill<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> pilot<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.770> six<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> can

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you can fill in a pilot is six you can

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
you can fill in a pilot is six you can
put<00:01:44.820> six<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.210> here

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
put six in here

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.960 
put six in here
so<00:01:45.900> I<00:01:46.170> basically<00:01:46.380> decided<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> create<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.490> pilot

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
so I basically decided to create a pilot

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.690 
so I basically decided to create a pilot
one<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.020> helps<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.830> save<00:01:50.070> space<00:01:50.460> it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
one because it helps to save space it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
one because it helps to save space it
took<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> takes<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> space<00:01:51.659> storing<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
took it takes a lot of space storing a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.920 
took it takes a lot of space storing a
six<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:53.010> like<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.180> individually

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
six of these like this individually

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.170 
six of these like this individually
versus<00:01:55.320> getting<00:01:55.500> them<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.700> palette<00:01:57.090> like

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
versus getting them in a palette like

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.260 
versus getting them in a palette like
this<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.870> got<00:01:58.229> pilot<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.130> first<00:01:59.310> pilot<00:01:59.909> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
this so I got pilot so my first pilot is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.660 
this so I got pilot so my first pilot is
an<00:02:00.540> older<00:02:00.870> version<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.470> what<00:02:02.070> i<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.640> i

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
an older version and what i did was i

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.550 
an older version and what i did was i
took<00:02:02.820> i<00:02:03.750> depotted<00:02:04.440> beast<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.630> plum

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
took i depotted beast this this was plum

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.990 
took i depotted beast this this was plum
foolery<00:02:08.039> which<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000

with a lighter and I was able to get
them<00:02:44.730> out<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:46.020> went<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.800> math<00:02:46.980> again<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:48.510> I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
them out so I went to math again and I

palette<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.460> little<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.880> better<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.440> it's

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
palette a little bit better because it's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.820 
palette a little bit better because it's
more<00:02:55.800> sleek<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:57.450> look<00:02:57.690> how<00:02:57.870> thin<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.470> in

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
more sleek like look how thin it is in

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.790 
more sleek like look how thin it is in
comparison<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.550> this<00:02:59.820> one<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.260> don't<00:03:01.320> need

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
comparison to this one and I don't need

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.210 
comparison to this one and I don't need
to<00:03:01.950> worry<00:03:02.190> about<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:03.750> class<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.680> know<00:03:04.800> or<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
to worry about the class you know or the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.640 
to worry about the class you know or the
plastic<00:03:05.730> covering<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.480> also<00:03:06.990> this<00:03:07.200> palette

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
plastic covering and also this palette

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
plastic covering and also this palette
is<00:03:07.740> cheaper<00:03:08.280> because<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:09.240> don't<00:03:09.420> have<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.690> buy

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
is cheaper because you don't have to buy

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.320 
is cheaper because you don't have to buy
an<00:03:10.050> insert<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.950> pretty<00:03:11.520> much<00:03:11.670> with<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.000> pilot

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
an insert so pretty much with this pilot

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.270 
an insert so pretty much with this pilot
you<00:03:12.540> buy<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.750> casing<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.590> then<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.950> have<00:03:14.130> to

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
you buy the casing and then you have to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.229 
you buy the casing and then you have to
buy<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:15.150> actual<00:03:16.280> hole<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.459> holder<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.000> goes

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
buy the actual hole the holder that goes

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.390 
buy the actual hole the holder that goes
inside<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.440> can<00:03:19.530> put<00:03:19.830> your<00:03:19.860> selection<00:03:20.310> so

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
inside so you can put your selection so

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.220 
inside so you can put your selection so
this<00:03:20.550> ends<00:03:20.820> up<00:03:20.880> coming<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.209> $29

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
this ends up coming to $29

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.740 
this ends up coming to $29
whereas<00:03:22.560> this<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:22.860> only<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.250> maybe<00:03:23.880> 19<00:03:24.480> or<00:03:24.630> 18

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
whereas this is only like maybe 19 or 18

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.500 
whereas this is only like maybe 19 or 18
so<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.890> more<00:03:26.100> expensive<00:03:26.310> however<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.450> do

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
so this is more expensive however I do

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.910 
so this is more expensive however I do
like<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.930> fact<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.350> can<00:03:28.530> see<00:03:28.680> what

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
like the fact that you can see what

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.400 
like the fact that you can see what
blushes<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:29.760> there<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.959> makes<00:03:31.230> it

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
blushes you have in there it makes it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.440 
blushes you have in there it makes it
nice<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.770> pretty<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.520> bought<00:03:32.850> three
