 planets around dead stars

 History presented percent is assigned 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.449
 not only young stars can form planets 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.359
 you can also do the oldest stars 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.439
 April 5 2006 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.949
 NASA's space telescope has revealed new evidence that 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.880
 ashes of a dead star 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.869
 can generate planet 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.190
 the infrared telescope observed the scene around a pulsar 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.500
 the remnant of a star that exploded 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.860
 and found a surrounding disk 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.010
 formed with the debris expelled during the death throes of its agony 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.440
 stellar 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.820
 the dusty debris on the disk 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.350
 they could finally group together to form planets 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.100
 This is the first time that scientists detect material with the 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.330
 that the planets are formed around a star 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.590
 that perished in a violent explosion 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.330
 the article where this discovery of the telescope is reported 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.640
 space appears in the number 6 of April of the magazine nme said 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.430
 Other authors of the article are chandon lead author and co-author 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.660

 both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology issues 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.800
 we are amazed that the process of planet formation seems like 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.430
 they are universal 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.940
 I told the doctor who shook ends here 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.980

 principal investigator of this new search 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.790
 pulsars emit a large amount of high energy radiation and even in 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.070
 this hard environment 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.390
 we observe a disk almost identical to those found around 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.390
 young stars where planet has been formed 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.820
 the discovery also represents the missing piece of a puzzle that 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.630
 it arose in 1992 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.999
 when the doctor alexander posture 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.859
 from the University of Pennsylvania found three planets in orbit 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:08.079
 around a pulsar called pgr of about 2 5 7 +1 all 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.299
 the planets of said portal twice the size of the earth were in fact 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.689
 the first planets that were found outside of our solar system 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.019
 astronomers have since looked for obvious hints that the 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.329
 pulsar planets the action of a dusty debris disk 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.699
 but nobody until now had directly detected this type of discs 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:36.849

 France 13 thousand light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.079
 it was once a big, bright star with a club between 10 and 20 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.339
 times that of our sun 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.829
 the star probably survived about 10 million years until 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.899
 collapsed by its own weight about 100 thousand years ago 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.459
 and then it disintegrated in a supernova explosion 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.459
 some of the debris with offal from the explosion 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.349
 they settled for that in mind on a disc 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.620
 that today guests of these tablets of the populist star 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:17.079
 this time it could be recognized extinguished shine of the dust disk with its few 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.220
 infrared 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.739
 sensitive to heat 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.319
 the disk rotates at a distance close to one about 5 million kilometers 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.739
 from the center of the star and probably contains about ten 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.589
 land masses of material 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.039
 Pulsars are a class of supernova remnants 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.289
 called neutron stars 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.469
 which are incredibly inheritances 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.859
 they have enough one four times that of the sun 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.459
 compressed into bodies only 16 kilometers wide 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.680
 a teaspoon of the material that forms a neutron star can lend 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.379
 About two billion tons 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:03.179
 the pulsar four points 0 1 4 2 mack 6 1 is also an x-ray portal 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:06.929
 I think it means almost blind and radiates x-ray pulses 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.159
 any planet that has visited around stars that have finished 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.739
 as per the share 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.899
 was probably incinerated when the stars of carving 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.500
 the pulsar disk discovered by the cesc fault could represent the first 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:26.460
 step in the formation of a new more exotic type of planetary system 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.990
 similar to that found by postón in 1992 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:36.569
 it's very exciting to find direct evidence that the rubble around 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.020
 from a pulsar 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.439
 are able to organize themselves on a disk 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.960
 this could be the beginning of a second generation of planets
