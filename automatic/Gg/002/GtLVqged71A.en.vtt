00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.350

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.520 

assembly<00:02:46.250> instructions<00:02:46.550> tape<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.300> phone

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530

she<00:02:54.530> comes<00:02:54.769> with<00:03:02.380> two<00:03:03.380> different<00:03:03.410> persons

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
she comes with two different persons

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.979 
she comes with two different persons
because<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:06.080> can<00:03:06.290> have<00:03:06.470> her<00:03:06.769> with<00:03:07.720> both<00:03:08.720> wings

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
because you can have her with both wings

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.170 
because you can have her with both wings
on<00:03:09.230> or<00:03:09.920> just<00:03:10.580> one

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
on or just one

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.470 
on or just one

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.900 
supposed to convert confess it was
between<00:04:25.910> pieces<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:28.190> no<00:04:28.250> idea<00:04:28.400> what<00:04:28.730> that

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
between pieces you no idea what that

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.940 
between pieces you no idea what that
looks<00:04:29.150> like<00:04:29.410> nothing<00:04:30.410> really<00:04:30.710> complicated

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
looks like nothing really complicated

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:38.100 
looks like nothing really complicated
but<00:04:31.610> it's<00:04:32.210> always<00:04:32.450> know<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:34.960> this<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.170> her

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
but it's always know and this is her

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.950 
but it's always know and this is her
thang<00:04:39.110> my<00:04:40.100> light-up<00:04:40.370> little<00:04:40.910> won't<00:04:41.720> get<00:04:41.840> so

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
thang my light-up little won't get so
