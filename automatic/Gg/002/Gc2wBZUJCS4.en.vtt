 I've been fighting with this. 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.870
 today I go 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.409

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.409
 to the block 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 on the other hand aside 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.819
 paulo doors 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.799
 to score goals 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.699
 per 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.759
 but I'm glad that everything went wrong 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.759
 the priority of vacancy 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.999

 he fell 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.779
 remembered what I miss the label 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.569
 truly each change 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 the places of the funds provided for in the 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.009
 according 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.759
 the coordinator 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.759
 in the brown river 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.419
 between them 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.419
 I want her to survive 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.139
 jonas and borges 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.559
 shortly after the vote 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.049
