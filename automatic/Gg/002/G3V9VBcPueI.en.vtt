these<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:14.880> systems<00:01:15.479> slowly<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.070> moving

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
these two systems slowly kind of moving

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.980 
these two systems slowly kind of moving
towards<00:01:17.460> our<00:01:17.820> area<00:01:18.270> we're<00:01:18.659> gonna<00:01:18.720> see

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
towards our area we're gonna see

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990

increasing<00:01:19.799> chances<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.189> rain<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.790> get

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
increasing chances of rain as we get

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.280 
increasing chances of rain as we get
into<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> middle<00:01:21.509> part<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> week<00:01:21.930> but

into the middle part of the week but

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
into the middle part of the week but
before<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.650> happens<00:01:23.070> we're<00:01:23.430> gonna<00:01:23.520> squeeze

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
before that happens we're gonna squeeze

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.789 
before that happens we're gonna squeeze
out<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.659> nice<00:01:25.020> day<00:01:25.049> across<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.770> area

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
out one more nice day across the area

Wednesday night and into Thursday the
low<00:02:01.170> still<00:02:01.469> kind<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.799> lingers<00:02:02.070> off<00:02:02.250> towards

low still kind of lingers off towards

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.980 
low still kind of lingers off towards
our<00:02:02.670> West<00:02:02.939> here<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.360> we're<00:02:03.719> gonna<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
our West here so we're gonna have to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.450 
our West here so we're gonna have to
take<00:02:04.170> some<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.649> see<00:02:04.770> some<00:02:04.950> clearing<00:02:05.189> on

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
take some time to see some clearing on

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.620 
take some time to see some clearing on
Thursday<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.210> still<00:02:06.390> could<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
Thursday I think this still could be a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.089 
Thursday I think this still could be a
chance<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> scattered<00:02:07.320> shower<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
chance of a scattered shower but the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.740 
chance of a scattered shower but the
bulk<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> rain<00:02:08.670> looks<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.479> happen

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
bulk of the rain looks like will happen

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.240 
bulk of the rain looks like will happen
during<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> day<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.470> Wednesday

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
during the day on Wednesday

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.130 
during the day on Wednesday
tonight<00:02:11.910> no<00:02:12.300> issues<00:02:12.599> with<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.870> we're<00:02:13.080> gonna

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
tonight no issues with that we're gonna

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.550 
tonight no issues with that we're gonna
be<00:02:13.349> nice

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
be nice

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.800 
be nice
try<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.220> partly<00:02:14.459> cloudy<00:02:14.580> expect<00:02:15.510> windy

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
try to be partly cloudy expect windy

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.600 
try to be partly cloudy expect windy
conditions<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.069> West<00:02:17.220> at<00:02:17.310> about<00:02:17.370> 10

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
conditions out of the West at about 10

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.770 
conditions out of the West at about 10
and<00:02:17.730> 15<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> winds<00:02:18.630> will

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.760 
and 15 but I think the winds will
diminish<00:02:18.930> through<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.410> overnight<00:02:19.620> hours

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770

it'll be cold in some spots in fact we

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.720 
it'll be cold in some spots in fact we
could<00:02:22.050> go<00:02:22.170> down<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> 30s<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.340> some<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.640> the
