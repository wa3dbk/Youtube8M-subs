00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
pallets and they're very very small I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.110 
pallets and they're very very small I

thought it was like bigger than this
when<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.450> first<00:00:35.750> looked<00:00:36.440> at<00:00:36.650> it<00:00:36.710> online<00:00:36.980> but

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
when I first looked at it online but

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.720 
when I first looked at it online but
they're<00:00:37.760> actually<00:00:37.940> very<00:00:38.180> tiny<00:00:38.980> um<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.490> I<00:00:40.520> have

that<00:00:47.270> it's<00:00:47.480> very<00:00:47.600> powdery<00:00:48.290> so<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.280> have<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.640> be

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670
