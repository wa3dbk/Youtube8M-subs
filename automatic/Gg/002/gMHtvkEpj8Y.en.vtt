00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.590
 I eat how are I, I am priscilla and today 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.190
 I have an idea to declare your 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.550
 rooms if they have another wall that is 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.710
 very empty very alone then if it's clear 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.020
 it is very easy to do and not necessarily 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.110
 they have to do what I did they can 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.490
 put a little heart 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.980
 your name or the name of your boyfriends or 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.410
 girlfriends or make them in the room of their 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.170
 boyfriends or girlfriends with your name to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.210
 surprise them or well I do not know the truth 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.700
 it's nothing else this is basically the idea 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.950
 but you can transform it into what 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.500
 than to you of this cure because if you 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.630

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.399
 here below and subscribe that 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.240

 you use what works for you bed bugs 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.930
 or if you like you can also use nails and 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.870
 scissors would also be a rule 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.870
 but I do not have anymore and something to mark 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.450

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.140
 great we want our design I want 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.000
 my lyrics 20 inches long and 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.000
 three inches wide 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.340
 to be sure that I will obviously extend 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.340
 cheetahs my boyfriend helped me a little 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.170
 6 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.619

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.619
 6 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.170
 two 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.369
 if they wanted my letters two inches and 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.369
 separate media 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.700
 I did not want them while they were in 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.040
 the same level so I made this 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.640
 way you then do the way that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.640

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.650
 He does not know anything but hear these my lyrics 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.580
 and now of the bed bugs 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.290
 let's put them in all the corners 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.290
 of our design 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.030
 after the will by lines 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.060
 We draw without putting the perfect one 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.930
 up another down and like that and not very 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.930
 close to each other 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.080
 we are already satisfied with how we 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.569
 the bugs are left we will take our 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.400
 stamen and we'll make a knot in a bug 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.739
 double knot to secure it and 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.680
 then you go through all the bed bugs 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.930
 as you want as you like have fun with 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.340
