 Today is Kazuki Kato, who is arson 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:18.940
 I think that I would like to give you some tips on how to make an upswing today . 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:21.210
 First of all , you thought that you wanted to make a video-based movie by yourself 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.630
 It is a great answer 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.910
 I really think this is a good thing 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 Wedding 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.780
 It has been over 10 years even though I 'm involved in bridal photography 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:43.650
 If you made a video upbringing in Himself 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:46.490
 Reaction is very good in the direction of your relatives and her basket friends workplace attendance who 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.640
 The reason is clear 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.400
 We are more than ourselves to make 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.230
 If you made one 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.530
 Interesting 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:06.800
 You can make it funny, and the participants will grow up to eat 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:12.890
 You can see it and the reception will be exciting then 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.880
 I think it will be a very good thing to have you understand more about Mr. Groom 's father and father 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.060
 I will 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:23.120
 So it's so funny that I think it 's a bit overkill when making a video of a background 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.820
 Shooting point funny 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:32.790
 If you put an interesting message comment 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:37.020
 I think it's good It's something we can not do quite easily 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:44.400
 Let's make a video with originality 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.570
 Since the point for that purpose I will deliver in the document daily after the video, so be sure to make use of that as well 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.580
 While 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:55.540
 Make an original background video of two originals 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.080
 Please show me if you make it I look forward to 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.240
 Today is a little tip I can make it myself 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:08.060
 Meaning interesting whats tell the school point 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.060
