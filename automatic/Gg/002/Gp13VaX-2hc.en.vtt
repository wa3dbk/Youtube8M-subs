00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
returning now the reason I'm saying this

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.630 
returning now the reason I'm saying this
is<00:00:38.810> we've<00:00:39.769> actually<00:00:40.010> had<00:00:40.250> these<00:00:40.430> thoughts

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
is we've actually had these thoughts

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.220 
is we've actually had these thoughts
about<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.120> for<00:00:41.359> a<00:00:41.390> while<00:00:41.570> people<00:00:41.930> have<00:00:42.109> asked

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
about it for a while people have asked

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.020 
about it for a while people have asked
Michael<00:00:42.680> condry<00:00:43.039> and<00:00:43.129> he's<00:00:43.219> responded<00:00:43.399> maybe

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
Michael condry and he's responded maybe

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.130 
Michael condry and he's responded maybe
and<00:00:44.480> then<00:00:45.519> denial<00:00:46.519> Saints<00:00:47.059> goes<00:00:47.629> hard<00:00:47.929> point

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
and then denial Saints goes hard point

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.759 
and then denial Saints goes hard point
and<00:00:48.289> CTF<00:00:48.649> her<00:00:48.800> back<00:00:49.010> in<00:00:49.219> aid<00:00:49.370> advanced<00:00:50.149> warfare

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
and CTF her back in aid advanced warfare

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.939 
and CTF her back in aid advanced warfare
so<00:00:52.449> now<00:00:53.449> whether<00:00:53.839> that<00:00:53.929> was<00:00:54.199> just<00:00:54.469> like<00:00:54.649> he<00:00:54.829> was

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
so now whether that was just like he was

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.950 
so now whether that was just like he was
