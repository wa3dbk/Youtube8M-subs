done with it it's got a GPS it's got a

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.920 
done with it it's got a GPS it's got a

the alpha 700 just some other

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.490 
the alpha 700 just some other
interesting<00:03:03.030> things<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.690> we<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:04.050> point<00:03:04.320> out

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
interesting things that we can point out

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.470 
interesting things that we can point out
about<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.040> they've<00:03:05.520> changed<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.000> handling<00:03:06.390> a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
about it they've changed the handling a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.790 
about it they've changed the handling a
little<00:03:06.600> bit<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.959> shutter<00:03:07.200> button<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.740> the
