00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.260
 how about friends for our croquettes 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.779
 of ham we are preparing a broth of 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.520
 Important ham with remains if we leave 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.470
 dry that we are going to eat or with tips 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.660
 of ham or with bones what we have done 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.670
 It is a broth with a very intense flavor that 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.950
 now we are straining to get rid of 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.720
 as I said those remains below 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.340
 we put a saucepan on the fire add the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.809
 milk and the broth that we just 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.809
 make warm up 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.850
 and here you have the rest of the ingredients 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.730
 to make the walnut white living mass 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.800
 flour flour olive oil mix 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.379
 that we have warming up and we're going to start 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 we put olive oil on medium heat 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.010
 it is important that of the medium fire 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.449
 because we are going to add the flour to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.430
 to cook and if the fire is very 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 high flour is to put tostadita of 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.110
 brown color we do not want a dark russian 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.719
 we have a very light colored rose a 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.720
 white we cook the flour for a 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.780
 couple of minutes and we started with the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.460
 spices the nutmeg pepper 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.259
 white whenever we make dough 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.700
 Croquettes I at least do it adds 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.789
 these spices gives it a very flavor 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.229
 interesting good let's add the 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.450
 liquid part that has to enter 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.830
 boiling because if he is not going to do us 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.030
 curved very important that we do this 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.950
 we now give to Brazil 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.440
 you have to give it a lot because if you do not 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.060
 grab the bottom of the pan and 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.560
 We rectify salt care because as 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 that broth we leave what we have put what 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.819
 same left very salty we continue giving 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.229
 the hug and you see what is expressing is 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.970
 more quickly after having flour 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.159
 immediately after seven 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.630
 minutes already and you see that he has a body 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.920
 very important already 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.770
 What we are going to do now is add a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.020
 little bit of serrano ham minced 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.030
 then we find those trips 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.329
 so nice inside what is going to be 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.369
 the body of the croquette because look 14 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.049
 minutes and the mass and we have to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.119
 we be a little function with 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.490
 oil in the tray where we are going to put 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.470
 the dough so that it does not stick and the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.769
 let's let it cool in the fridge 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.450
 for at least 4 hours and if you leave it 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.709
 from one day to another better with a paper 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.709
 film so I do not know that above 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.390
 and while the dough is cooling we go to 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.440
 vary cookies are help us more 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.390
 breakfast every day do not have 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.700
 Why be special what I'm going to do 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.250
 is to join that grated cracker with bread 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.320
 grated because I do this good 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.930
 because then in the frying to have 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.240
 cookie is breaded in holds less 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.960
 oil and croquettes come out less 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.550
 oily interesting now good we're going 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.980
 to beat eggs that you know is part 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.010
 fundamental to make the breaded and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.890
 here you have the dough is hard and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.440
 help god it's over chaos face so that 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.870
 so to make some portions that already 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.800
 are almost spherical and that on the other hand 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.140
 so be all the portions 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.050
 practically the same in this way with 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.300
 this trick you see we take pieces of dough 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.250
 that are already taking that spherical shape and 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.680
 that will weigh more or less the same 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.680
 after those portions we're going to 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.540
 to bathe in the egg that we have beaten 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.540
 bathe them well and the leftover egg 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.450
 you take away that we do not need 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.080
 we passed 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.670
 to the zest and we're going well with 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.710
 develops hard and we will finish them 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.950
 to give that spherical shape 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.020
 we go back to bathe in the mixture 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.879
 perfect and you see that we are already giving a 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.040
 almost spherical shape to all 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.200
 they and we have them we are going to fry them 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.420
 this is called big figure because it's going to 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.129
 a high temperature because if you do not see 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.430
 the oil if we put them at temperature 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.050
 low 180 degrees is your thing do not you put 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.760
 many at once because if we put 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.040
 many times the temperature drops 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.380
 of the oil and we are in the one of before in 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.269
 that move the oil and that's one of 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.290
 the worst defects that a 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.209
 croquette 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.890
 well here you have them they are taking the 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.019
 colorcito move it so that for all 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.540
 sides have that gold that is so 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.269
 appetizing and we take it out quickly 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.209
 with the spider so they do not go over 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.910
 color we put them on absorbent paper 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.400
 and leave all the excess oil there 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.650
 see what reaction we have prepared what 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.510
 good color this is to eat them 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.910
 we can also present it from this 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.950
 way looks oregano fresh oregano 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.810
 It goes very well with tomato and tomato or 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.110
 well with the ham so this is in 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.639
 the marriage of three perfectly 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.830
 well good chop and oregano 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.569
 insert in a mini skewers then 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.210
 the cherry tomatoes 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.669
 the croquettes we water with the oregano 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.889
 so that to give it aroma simply and 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.569
 this is wonderful friends do the 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.869
 that you will like a hug until the 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.869
 next
