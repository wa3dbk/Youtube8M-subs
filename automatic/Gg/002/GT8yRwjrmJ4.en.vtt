00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello and welcome to the blog of the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.420
 drive academy the blog where we learn to 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.240
 drive i am mounir your monitor 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.340
 particular and today we're going 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.330
 attack road signs 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.890
 road signs so we're going 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.810
 attack the indications signaling 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 so to understand the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.920
 signage indications we will 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.269
 review a number of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 panels so that it is 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.320
 really clear to you he is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.590
 important that you be able to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.309
 able to quickly determine the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 meaning of a panel because in 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.590
 driving in driving situation we have 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.629
 really really really a time of 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.350
 reaction that is relatively short 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.610
 so if we are able to be able to 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.100
 understand the signaling quickly 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.239
 Well of course you will understand 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.039
 more easily and it will give you 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.670
 a lot more time to do that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.160
 you have to do 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.579
 then signage indications so 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.079
 these are square panels with white background 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.670
 so these panels of the books of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.289
 useful indications for driving 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.559
 when they are decked with red he 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.930
 announces the end of a ban so 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.520
 we are going to have at first 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.229
 this panel that's hours a panel that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.330
 announces a one-way traffic I 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 think you all know him the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.720
 deadlock panel so that indicates that he 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.340
 there is an entry at the level of 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.000
 the minya intersection no exit in 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.439
 intersection 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.549
 so we will have to turn around 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.810
 to be able to leave this axis there a 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.220
 priority panel with respect to 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 oncoming vehicle 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.490
 so there often you have 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.860
 difficulties in understanding what is happening 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.329
 the idea is that the finest feature 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.930
 and the one he's going to have to leave 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.759
 priority 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.979
 the biggest feature is the one that goes 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.080
 to see circulating so here in this case 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.670
 the big white it tells you that you 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.340
 have priority given the fact that 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.470
 you are right and the vehicles 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.210
 oncoming will have this 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.549
 panel has it so that will tell them 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.720
 that it is up to them to give priority 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.070
 so the exact meaning of this 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.590
 his priorities in relation to 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.520
 oncoming vehicle 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.470
 we will attack so the passage 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.820
 pedestrian you know it until then 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.880
 there is no problem that announces you 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:11.000
 a pedestrian crossing at fifty meters a 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.680
 recommended speed of 70 km / h and 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.790
 finally the location of an emergency stop 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.069
 this panel will tell you a 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.180
 voice assignment so this way is going 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.519
 go straight on it's have to go to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.819
 left we can have several variants 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.739
 of this panel so has it with two lanes 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.069
 who are going straight up a path that goes to 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.569
 left 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.430
 a voice that goes straight and right 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.380
 a path that goes straight and left 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.670
 that will not tell you everything 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.269
 just where you need to be 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.489
 placed to be able to go into the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.859
 direction you want a way of 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.150
 distress on the right 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.260
 so this is this little girl so here is a 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.519
 distress lane it's not a lane 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.290
 it's really a place 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.260
 where we will come in quotation marks 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.359
 rush into the country in case of a glitch and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.980
 and especially this panel that you 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.690
 especially appreciate who we 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.470
 announces the beginning of a section 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.390
 highway 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.829
 so when it comes to the highway 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.959
 you are going to have several panels that 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.220
 you will find especially when you 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.840
 go to a toll booth so this little 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.310
 man tells you that actually 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.319
 you have the opportunity to pay 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.430
 directly a man or a woman our 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.769
 friends a payment from a 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.480
 this small basket with the 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.010
 pieces you have you announce a 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.920
 automatic payment by coins 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.020
 currency and then finally a payment by 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.790
 subscription 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.010
 for all people who have a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.820
 electronic payment card 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.830
 signs and 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.820
 indications so we'll have some 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.380
 panels that are much more 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.780
 frequent in agglomeration so the 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.740
 bi-directional bike sign so that 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.120
 you announce that you are on a 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.980
 one-way roadway but that in 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.600
 the other way where you're going to have a 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.070
 panel or in the other direction of 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.180
 traffic you're going to have a band 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.500
 or a bike path 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.470
 so you will be able to meet some 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.290
 oncoming cyclists the end 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.770
 a pedestrian area 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.240
 a priori the end of a pedestrian area 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.670
 it's simple you do not have the right 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.230
 to get inside and then what 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.740
 sign up there announce the end of 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.990
 this zone 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.950
 and then finally an access road 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.630
 regulated for automobiles this panel 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.430
 will tell you a track where a band 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.890
 Cyclable Advisor is reserved for 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.650
 cycles only by motorcyclists 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.489
 not mopeds just the 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.600
 cycles so the bikes we will find this 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.460
 panel there quite seldom 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.110
 it's a meeting zone board 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.970
 telling you that the maximum speed 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.490
 is limited to 20 km / h and that will 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.130
 able to meet cyclists from 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.140
 pedestrians motorists so the lure 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.410
 must be particularly slow at this 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.460
 place there and then finally a green zone 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.050
 reserved for pedestrians and cyclists 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.820
 then little peculiarity for his two 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.870
 panels so has this panel will you 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.450
 signal the entrance of a tunnel 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.190
 so it's clear that in a tunnel he 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.690
 is forbidden to turn around 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.260
 stop parking outside 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.770
 planned locations and we have the obligation 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.090
 to light its lights this panel there is going to you 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.900
 announce a risk of fire 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.160
 so we stay in the jargon of fire so 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.290
 in this case it is true that we will 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.500
 approach an area where there is going to be no 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.610
 bad vegetation and then we were 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 sees that there is a lot a lot a lot 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.180
 of 1,110 so this panel is still going 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.630
 to announce that there is a risk of 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.129
 fire 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.860
 so that was all for the signage 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.379
 indication I give you an appointment 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.169
 for the next video next video 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:31.629
 which will be the prohibition signage 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.959
 so in the hope that this video you 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.749
 allow to understand correctly the 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:39.869
 indication signage go to 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:39.869
 meet again
