00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.836
 Nobody calls it killing. 

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:11.854
 Just black and white. 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.499
 The soldier's heart in my soul tells me who to fight. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.200
 Explosions, flaring as the stars above us, lead us. 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.303
 The pain I feel never goes away. Just like the memories of a mess, 

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.399
 I did. 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:44.308
 Let's remember their names with pride. The men who fought and died. 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.938
 We stand alone and yet as one. For those we left there. 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.449
 Restless nights and broken dreams. Shining lights. 

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:10.495
 While the tears run down the stubborn face unseen for the darkest nights. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.003
 Drink to their names, wave our flag and bring them proudly. 

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:24.068
 In the fading light of sunset. Otherwise, their images will soon be 

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:28.336
 forgotten. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.838
 Let's remember their names with pride. The men who fought and died. 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.937
 We stand alone and yet as one. For those we left there. 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.204
 Let's remember their names with pride. The men who fought and died. 

00:01:50.294 --> 00:01:56.835
 We stand alone and yet as one. For those we left there. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:13.000
