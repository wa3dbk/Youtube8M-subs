this week we're taking a look at a very

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.220 
this week we're taking a look at a very
sharp-looking<00:00:23.980> 1969<00:00:24.980> Chevrolet<00:00:25.460> Camaro<00:00:26.230> z28

sharp-looking 1969 Chevrolet Camaro z28

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.980 
sharp-looking 1969 Chevrolet Camaro z28
this<00:00:28.160> is<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.310> real-deal<00:00:28.520> z28<00:00:29.360> complete<00:00:29.779> with

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
this is a real-deal z28 complete with

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.830 
this is a real-deal z28 complete with
the<00:00:30.110> 302<00:00:30.910> v8<00:00:31.910> engine<00:00:32.270> under<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:32.480> hood<00:00:32.570> and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
the 302 v8 engine under the hood and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.840 
the 302 v8 engine under the hood and
four-speed<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:33.650> this<00:00:34.489> particular

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
four-speed and this particular

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.369 
four-speed and this particular
combination<00:00:35.210> is<00:00:35.720> pretty<00:00:35.900> unique<00:00:36.140> because

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
combination is pretty unique because

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.939 
combination is pretty unique because
it's<00:00:37.040> in<00:00:37.280> dusk<00:00:37.699> blue<00:00:38.150> which<00:00:38.900> was<00:00:39.080> not<00:00:39.230> an

insanely popular color on these cars and

insanely popular color on these cars and
this<00:00:42.199> one<00:00:42.410> has<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.559> very<00:00:42.830> crisp<00:00:43.250> looking<00:00:43.790> black

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
this one has a very crisp looking black

this one has a very crisp looking black

the SCCA trans-am racing series

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.890 
the SCCA trans-am racing series
they<00:01:18.560> had<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:19.040> ban<00:01:19.310> on<00:01:19.640> engines<00:01:20.180> greater<00:01:20.659> than

they had a ban on engines greater than

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.070 
they had a ban on engines greater than
305<00:01:21.680> cubic<00:01:22.159> inches<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.119> Chevrolet<00:01:23.689> came<00:01:23.930> up

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
305 cubic inches so Chevrolet came up

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.270 
305 cubic inches so Chevrolet came up
with<00:01:24.229> this<00:01:24.409> 302<00:01:25.179> which<00:01:26.179> is<00:01:26.359> essentially<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.380> 327

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
with this 302 which is essentially a 327

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.700 
with this 302 which is essentially a 327
with<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:28.939> different<00:01:29.359> crank<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.869> Pistons<00:01:30.380> and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
with a different crank and Pistons and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.800 
with a different crank and Pistons and
it's<00:01:31.189> got<00:01:31.340> other<00:01:31.460> individual<00:01:32.359> parts<00:01:32.659> that

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
it's got other individual parts that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.660 
it's got other individual parts that
make<00:01:32.929> it<00:01:33.049> 302<00:01:33.350> what's<00:01:34.250> interesting<00:01:34.460> about

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
make it 302 what's interesting about

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.569 
make it 302 what's interesting about
this<00:01:35.000> engine<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:36.409> only<00:01:36.590> 302<00:01:37.249> cubic

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
this engine is it's only 302 cubic

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.569 
this engine is it's only 302 cubic
inches<00:01:37.909> but<00:01:38.119> they<00:01:38.240> rated<00:01:38.539> it<00:01:38.749> at<00:01:39.579> 290

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
inches but they rated it at 290

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.260 
inches but they rated it at 290
horsepower<00:01:40.609> at<00:01:41.359> I<00:01:41.960> think<00:01:42.170> 5400<00:01:42.920> rpm<00:01:43.310> but

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
horsepower at I think 5400 rpm but

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.389 
horsepower at I think 5400 rpm but
because<00:01:44.899> it's<00:01:45.140> an<00:01:45.259> oversquare<00:01:45.859> design

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
because it's an oversquare design

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.099 
because it's an oversquare design
meaning<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.149> bore<00:01:47.359> is<00:01:47.570> bigger<00:01:47.810> than<00:01:47.960> the

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
meaning the bore is bigger than the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.039 
meaning the bore is bigger than the
stroke<00:01:48.429> this<00:01:49.429> engine<00:01:49.939> had<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.119> tendency<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.929> be

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
stroke this engine had a tendency to be

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.139 
stroke this engine had a tendency to be
a<00:01:51.079> very<00:01:51.350> high<00:01:51.710> revving<00:01:52.130> engine<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.999> made

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
a very high revving engine and it made

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.599 
a very high revving engine and it made
all<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.420> its<00:01:53.539> power<00:01:53.749> at<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.109> top<00:01:54.289> end<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.340> they

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
all of its power at the top end so they

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.580 
all of its power at the top end so they
say<00:01:55.880> when<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.509> wound<00:01:56.749> them<00:01:56.960> up<00:01:57.079> you<00:01:57.409> know<00:01:57.530> to

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
say when you wound them up you know to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.950 
say when you wound them up you know to
redline<00:01:57.979> these<00:01:58.700> things<00:01:58.969> made<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.479> don't<00:01:59.689> know

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
redline these things made I don't know

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.559 
redline these things made I don't know
350<00:02:00.920> horsepower<00:02:01.219> something<00:02:01.700> like<00:02:01.789> that<00:02:01.969> and

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
350 horsepower something like that and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.169 
350 horsepower something like that and
when<00:02:02.689> they<00:02:02.810> raced<00:02:03.109> them<00:02:03.319> in<00:02:03.439> Trans<00:02:03.710> Am<00:02:03.979> in<00:02:04.909> full

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
when they raced them in Trans Am in full

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.300 
when they raced them in Trans Am in full
race<00:02:05.389> trim<00:02:05.689> they<00:02:05.869> made<00:02:06.049> well<00:02:06.229> over<00:02:06.310> 450

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
race trim they made well over 450

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.980 
race trim they made well over 450
horsepower<00:02:07.579> so<00:02:08.390> that's<00:02:08.539> pretty<00:02:08.720> impressive

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
horsepower so that's pretty impressive

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.840 
horsepower so that's pretty impressive
coming<00:02:09.860> from<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.310> small<00:02:10.490> 302<00:02:11.090> v8<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.620> 302<00:02:12.920> had<00:02:13.819> a
