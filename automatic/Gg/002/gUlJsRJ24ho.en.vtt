00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 the truth that the first sensations 

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.480
 at the beginning they are being pretty 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.179
 good is starting to compete in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.740
 italy with an italian club that its older 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.830
 part is very good because it helps us 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.990
 always to prepare ourselves better and against more 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.730
 competitions so we have much better 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.650
 then that also what has 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 helped in the world cup of cottbus 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.000
 to be much better prepared and not 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.119
 we got it as the first competition that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.099
 I raised the exercise for the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.859
 final to be there in let's say 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.809
 on podium and good yes that truth that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.890
 We still lacked at the beginning 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.690
 season 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
 more or less yes yes that we still lack 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.399
 a little filming and if it comes out 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.309
 well the last diagonal is so for 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.460
 now he was on a podium a goal of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.489
 team is to be between 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.160
 the final of by teams and as a goal 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.790
 staff I would like to look for the end of the 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.280
 ground 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.199
 let's say I'm preparing enough 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.140
 well the exercise and they are coming out very 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.860
 well and I think it's possible that it's a 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.280
 low important for the team because 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.790
 brings a lot to the team then the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 truth is that it is a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.500
 bad luck let's say both for him and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 for us that has been injured 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.520
 but good looking at it from the side 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 Positive say that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.079
 this year in quotes is less 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.250
 important let's say next year 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.530
 so we have to be there bird of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.969
 cannon and good the new incorporation of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.950
 this year that has been king the truth is 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.259
 that is giving strength to the team too 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.110
 I'm young I'm not yet 24 years old but 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.590
 good here in the car of madrid enter 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.969
 with only 13 years old and I went I've been up 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.670
 now the only younger person who has 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.950
 entered the kart and the truth never I 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.479
 gervasio of fair and rafa 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.909
 martÃ­nez not that they have been like our 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.860
 top right now of the world of gymnastics 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.619
 not the way and train the way 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.450
 compete on how we prepare the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.039
 competitions his head and all the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.979
 cheeses stays with you and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.899
 you learn from them because a lot already 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.069
 I was preparing the games of Beijing 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.539
 with 18 that was when I had there my 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.940
 eye race explosion in the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.950
 European junior and all that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.160
 and good a decision of the selector 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.370
 he left me out and then I had the bad 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.980
 lucky let's say of 2011 what of the fall and 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.280
 I could not be 100% for london and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.220
 well let's say that this this 2 years I come 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.100
 eager to prepare river and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.260
 these do not escape we're all pretty 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.680
 young boys 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.720
 none goes beyond 24 years and the truth 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.150
 that that's pretty Cuban enough for 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.439
 the team let's say you're creating a 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.549
 block not for river 2016 and seriously that 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.549
 let's make a good paper
