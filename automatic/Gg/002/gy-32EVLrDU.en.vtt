street tires as you can see they have

street tires as you can see they have
really<00:00:35.370> not<00:00:35.640> much<00:00:35.790> tread<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.329> them<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.230> they

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
really not much tread on them but they

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.819 
really not much tread on them but they
have<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.800> Kevlar<00:00:38.250> lining<00:00:38.280> inside<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.329> them<00:00:39.829> it's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
have a Kevlar lining inside of them it's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.950 
have a Kevlar lining inside of them it's
built<00:00:41.070> into<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> tire<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:42.000> keep<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> keep<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
built into the tire to keep it keep it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.209 
built into the tire to keep it keep it
from<00:00:43.079> getting<00:00:43.170> punctured<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.770> having<00:00:43.950> flats

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
from getting punctured and having flats

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.209 
from getting punctured and having flats
and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.329> inside<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.200> tire<00:00:46.770> there's<00:00:47.129> an

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
and then also inside the tire there's an

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.799 
and then also inside the tire there's an
additional<00:00:47.730> liner<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.360> think<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:48.629> call

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
additional liner and I think they call

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.660 
additional liner and I think they call
it<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.930> thorne<00:00:49.230> liner<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.770> don't<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:50.489> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
it a thorne liner I don't put that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.920 
it a thorne liner I don't put that
inside<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.489> tire<00:00:53.489> between<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> tire<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
inside the tire between the tire and the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.779 
inside the tire between the tire and the
tube<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.949> should<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.309> an<00:00:56.399> additional

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
tube so that should be an additional

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.000 
tube so that should be an additional
protection<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.870> haven't<00:00:58.379> gotten<00:00:58.530> any<00:00:58.680> flats

this<00:01:47.759> doesn't<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> seal<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.770> of

this doesn't have a seal but it kind of
overlaps<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.000> doesn't<00:01:51.240> let<00:01:51.329> any<00:01:51.509> water<00:01:52.790> so

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
overlaps and it doesn't let any water so

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.910 
overlaps and it doesn't let any water so
it's<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> locking<00:01:55.200> device<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.890> a

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
with shoes when when the weather was a

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.409 
with shoes when when the weather was a
little<00:04:14.590> bit<00:04:14.859> too<00:04:15.189> cold<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:15.849> I<00:04:15.969> did<00:04:16.239> have<00:04:16.389> a

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
little bit too cold and I did have a

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.379 
little bit too cold and I did have a
time<00:04:16.600> when<00:04:16.750> my<00:04:16.840> feet<00:04:17.079> slipped<00:04:17.229> off<00:04:18.209> but<00:04:19.209> what<00:04:19.359> I

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
time when my feet slipped off but what I

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.969 
time when my feet slipped off but what I
found<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:19.959> was<00:04:19.989> because<00:04:20.289> my<00:04:20.320> feet<00:04:20.650> kind<00:04:20.859> of

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
found is it was because my feet kind of

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.219 
found is it was because my feet kind of
worked<00:04:21.160> at<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.340> edge<00:04:21.430> of<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.609> petal<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:22.090> I

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
worked at the edge of the petal and I

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.749 
worked at the edge of the petal and I
didn't<00:04:23.229> realize<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:23.860> my<00:04:24.009> feet<00:04:24.220> slipped

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
didn't realize it and my feet slipped

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.510 
didn't realize it and my feet slipped
off<00:04:24.940> so<00:04:25.240> barefooted<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.199> feel<00:04:27.039> like<00:04:27.190> my<00:04:27.340> feet

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.650

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.860 
that are kind of strapped onto the strap
and<00:06:36.039> then<00:06:36.520> my<00:06:36.669> tent<00:06:36.940> itself<00:06:37.210> is<00:06:37.419> in<00:06:37.539> this<00:06:37.660> bag

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
and then my tent itself is in this bag

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.800 
and then my tent itself is in this bag
and<00:06:38.199> then<00:06:38.289> the<00:06:38.889> fly<00:06:39.250> is<00:06:39.699> in<00:06:39.759> the<00:06:39.940> waterproof

and then the fly is in the waterproof
bag<00:06:41.020> here<00:06:41.669> this<00:06:42.669> is<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:42.970> analogy<00:06:44.699> bring<00:06:45.699> the

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
bag here this is the analogy bring the

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.719 
bag here this is the analogy bring the
video<00:06:46.060> camera<00:06:46.479> around<00:06:46.539> this<00:06:46.780> way<00:06:47.580> and<00:06:48.580> now

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
video camera around this way and now

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.340 
video camera around this way and now
Jean<00:06:49.000> fits<00:06:49.419> inside<00:06:49.630> you<00:06:50.020> can<00:06:50.110> get<00:06:50.199> one<00:06:50.320> of

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
Jean fits inside you can get one of

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.650 
Jean fits inside you can get one of
these<00:06:50.470> these<00:06:50.919> cups<00:06:51.250> and<00:06:51.850> it<00:06:51.970> fits<00:06:52.270> snugly

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
these these cups and it fits snugly

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.890 
these these cups and it fits snugly
inside<00:06:53.020> the<00:06:53.470> cup<00:06:53.650> so<00:06:54.639> my<00:06:55.030> strap<00:06:55.330> is<00:06:55.509> puff<00:06:55.690> on

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
inside the cup so my strap is puff on

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.230 
inside the cup so my strap is puff on
here<00:06:56.229> and<00:06:56.380> then<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:56.830> Nalgene<00:06:57.190> has<00:06:57.460> a<00:06:57.490> thing

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
here and then the Nalgene has a thing

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.189 
here and then the Nalgene has a thing
where<00:06:58.389> you<00:06:58.419> can<00:06:58.479> hook<00:06:58.720> it<00:06:58.810> on<00:06:58.930> with<00:06:59.740> a<00:06:59.770> little

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
where you can hook it on with a little

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.499 
where you can hook it on with a little
little<00:07:02.310> whatever<00:07:03.310> that<00:07:03.729> is<00:07:03.880> helping<00:07:04.300> them

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:04.509 
little whatever that is helping them

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.240 
little whatever that is helping them
clip<00:07:04.930> type<00:07:05.139> of<00:07:05.259> thing<00:07:05.520> so<00:07:06.520> I<00:07:07.800> think<00:07:08.800> that's

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
clip type of thing so I think that's
