00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.580
 e ffaa ad system 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.100
 signals and automatic braking is about 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.160
 a beacon device that transmits 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.960
 information to the train cabin 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.110
 warning where there are dangerous points and 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.300
 where you should slow down the 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.740
 first beacon warns you to get off 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.880
 speed 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.160
 if you do not do it the second beacon will stop you 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.080
 the train 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.380
 welcome to the reef over 78 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.060
 dead more than 100 injured and dozens of 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.420
 broken families 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.370
 and now that much day of mourning a lot 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.160
 minutes of silence at the congress in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 institutions a lot solemn word 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.829
 but in the end we will be left without 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.400
 responsible as always 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.750
 will make an explanation of what happened 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.979
 adam a mock commission 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.920
 investigation where they will close in false no 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.420
 there will be political responsibilities not 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.740
 there will be criminal responsibilities 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 you shall cast all the blame on driver 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.960
 of the train that has been damaged and that has cost 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.570
 life to more than 78 people not only 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 had the asfa system but 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.149
 It was also equipped with the system 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.259
 asfa digital the latest generation a 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.600
 train machinist can get distracted 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.470
 you can faint or you can just 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.979
 fall asleep for that is the ffaa for 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.979
 avoid it 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.310
 if a train ignores the signals 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.869
 acoustics of the device and does not lower the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.580
 speed the system automatically 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.350
 stop the train if this has not happened 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.080
 so the conclusion is easy 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.320
 of the ffaa 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.540
 it has not worked the machinist's fault is 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.220
 possible but this case was two 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.870
 machinists 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.080
 both ignored the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.090
 device do not let us manipulate 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.930
 we do not stay in theories about whether the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.620
 train arrived late or similar stories 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.659
 that a train enters a dangerous curve 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.390
 recognized as such by the ministry of 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:35.450
 encouragement when he made that path that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.540
 between 190 kilometers per hour 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.400
 just 4 km from the stop and all 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.420
 we know what it takes to stop a train 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.290
 and that faith does not stop that train 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.060
 that is at least striking if the eagerness 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.510
 or operated 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.200
 as it seems to be the case it is simply 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.700
 for a basic question 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.519
 lack of maintenance 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.760
 maintenance that costs money 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.670
 maintenance that can be trimmed if 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.200
 there are causes attributable to the promotion what 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.439
 we are going to find that is that in 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.870
 how much do you touch political responsibilities 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.250
 the truth is over if we are waiting 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.019
 to the media we 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.239
 tell the truth or that politicians 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.879
 assume responsibilities and tell us the 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.040
 we 're really going to find what 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.510
 same as the victims were found 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.879
 of the Valencia metro will deceive us 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.680
 they will blame the machinist and 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.079
 they're going to lie to us so much with the reports 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.650
 technicians as with the commission of 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.560
 investigation as with the conclusions 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.540
 you do not have to wait to see the result 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.049
 of that commission of inquiry that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.970
 will do in his day so that everything is concluded 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.299
 that they are not to blame for anything 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.689
 and that everything has happened because of the 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:03.639
 always by the workers in this 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.639
 case the machinist
