comfy<00:01:59.170> we<00:02:00.170> didn't<00:02:00.380> get<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.530> chance<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.890> talk

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
comfy we didn't get a chance to talk

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.180 
comfy we didn't get a chance to talk
about<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.760> star<00:02:02.030> USA<00:02:02.480> which<00:02:02.960> really<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:03.620> was

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.290 
the new all-star collection and that's
really<00:02:14.440> edgy<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.550> really<00:02:15.730> fun<00:02:16.030> it's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
really edgy and it's really fun it's

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.930 
really edgy and it's really fun it's
very<00:02:16.750> young<00:02:17.050> but<00:02:17.380> you've<00:02:17.920> got<00:02:18.070> all<00:02:18.250> these<00:02:18.400> you

very young but you've got all these you

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.520 
very young but you've got all these you
know<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.210> amazing<00:02:19.660> pieces<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.260> are

know just amazing pieces that are

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.460 
know just amazing pieces that are
affordable<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.580> also<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.630> think<00:02:23.260> we're<00:02:23.350> going

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
affordable and also I think we're going

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.350 
affordable and also I think we're going
to<00:02:23.530> bring<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.770> new<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.400> know<00:02:24.430> customer

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
to bring you a new you know customer

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.820 
to bring you a new you know customer
that<00:02:25.510> maybe<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.200> haven't<00:02:26.380> been<00:02:26.560> able<00:02:26.709> to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
that maybe you haven't been able to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.730 
that maybe you haven't been able to
reach<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:28.450> spent<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.840> lot<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.020> time<00:02:29.170> on<00:02:29.560> both

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
reach but we spent a lot of time on both

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.340 
reach but we spent a lot of time on both
fabric<00:02:30.520> development<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.300> washed<00:02:31.630> finishing

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
fabric development and washed finishing

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.410 
fabric development and washed finishing
and<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.770> think<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.459> collection<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.090> try<00:02:34.360> to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
and I think in that collection we try to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.210 
and I think in that collection we try to
make<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.720> what<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.020> would<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.500> would<00:02:35.620> describe<00:02:35.950> is

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
make it what I would I would describe is

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.880 
make it what I would I would describe is
imperfectly<00:02:36.850> perfect<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.290> think<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.680> lot

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
imperfectly perfect so we think a lot

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.470 
imperfectly perfect so we think a lot
about<00:02:39.070> how<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.660> guy<00:02:41.730> doesn't<00:02:42.730> necessarily

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
about how that guy doesn't necessarily

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.420 
about how that guy doesn't necessarily
want<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.750> look<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.140> prim<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.440> proper<00:02:44.620> he<00:02:45.130> wants

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
want to look so prim and proper he wants

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.220 
want to look so prim and proper he wants
to<00:02:45.550> look<00:02:45.670> cool<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.270> he<00:02:46.690> wants<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:46.989> have<00:02:47.200> a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
to look cool but he wants to have a

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.650 
to look cool but he wants to have a
slight<00:02:47.739> little<00:02:48.010> thing<00:02:48.459> that's<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.239> little<00:02:49.480> off

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
slight little thing that's a little off

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.530 
slight little thing that's a little off
a<00:02:49.959> little<00:02:50.110> imperfectly<00:02:50.800> perfect<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:51.730> you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
a little imperfectly perfect and so you

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.360 
a little imperfectly perfect and so you
know<00:02:52.630> we<00:02:52.750> put<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:52.989> wires<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> edges<00:02:54.340> of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
know we put like wires in the edges of

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.250 
know we put like wires in the edges of
the<00:02:54.550> lapels<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.330> garment<00:02:55.570> so<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.080> if<00:02:56.170> you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
the lapels of the garment so that if you

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.810 
the lapels of the garment so that if you
want<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.560> wrinkle<00:02:56.800> them<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.100> little<00:02:57.340> bit<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
want to wrinkle them a little bit in the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.250 
want to wrinkle them a little bit in the
pocket<00:02:58.270> flaps<00:02:58.510> if<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.810> want<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.080> wrinkle

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
pocket flaps if you want to wrinkle

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.790 
pocket flaps if you want to wrinkle
things<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.770> that<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.870> notice<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.900> lot<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.709> the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
things like that I notice a lot of the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.920 
things like that I notice a lot of the
trousers<00:03:03.250> who<00:03:03.340> also<00:03:03.550> cut<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> little<00:03:04.480> shorter

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
trousers who also cut a little shorter

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.490 
trousers who also cut a little shorter
to<00:03:05.050> give<00:03:05.230> emphasis<00:03:05.970> possibly<00:03:06.970> do<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.180> shoes

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to give emphasis possibly do the shoes

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.020 
to give emphasis possibly do the shoes
yeah<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.530> mean<00:03:08.770> in<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.040> connects<00:03:09.520> election<00:03:09.940> I

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
yeah I mean in that connects election I

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.850 
yeah I mean in that connects election I
think<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.390> guy<00:03:10.600> appreciates<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.590> little

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
think that guy appreciates a little

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.550 
think that guy appreciates a little
lower<00:03:12.040> rise<00:03:12.400> slimmer<00:03:13.060> trials<00:03:13.630> or<00:03:13.810> some<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
lower rise slimmer trials or some of the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.199 
lower rise slimmer trials or some of the
pants<00:03:14.860> have<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.010> little<00:03:15.280> flair<00:03:15.549> to<00:03:15.730> them<00:03:15.910> but

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
pants have a little flair to them but

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.420 
pants have a little flair to them but
for<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.900> most<00:03:17.049> part<00:03:17.230> it's<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.620> little<00:03:17.860> skinnier

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
for the most part it's a little skinnier

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.729 
for the most part it's a little skinnier
but<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:18.880> don't<00:03:19.060> make<00:03:19.239> them<00:03:19.480> skin<00:03:20.200> tight<00:03:20.440> and

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
but we don't make them skin tight and

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.250 
but we don't make them skin tight and
they're<00:03:20.830> still<00:03:21.070> like<00:03:21.690> there's<00:03:22.690> still<00:03:22.810> an<00:03:23.049> ease

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
they're still like there's still an ease

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.199 
they're still like there's still an ease
to<00:03:23.290> them<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:24.010> think<00:03:24.489> there's<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:25.090> know<00:03:25.180> I

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
to them I think there's a you know I

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.580 
to them I think there's a you know I
don't<00:03:25.600> think<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:25.989> want<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.230> look<00:03:26.350> like<00:03:26.470> you're

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
don't think you want to look like you're

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.949 
don't think you want to look like you're
