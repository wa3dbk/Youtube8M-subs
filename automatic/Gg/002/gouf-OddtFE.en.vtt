hey<00:00:02.730> guys<00:00:03.000> just<00:00:03.929> kind<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.290> been<00:00:04.560> playing

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
hey guys just kind of been playing

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.909 
hey guys just kind of been playing
around<00:00:04.920> my<00:00:05.190> test<00:00:05.460> world<00:00:05.730> here<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:07.230> think<00:00:07.770> I

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
around my test world here and I think I

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.830 
around my test world here and I think I
came<00:00:08.160> up<00:00:08.309> with<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> pretty<00:00:08.670> good<00:00:08.970> design<00:00:09.420> for<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
came up with a pretty good design for a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.280 
came up with a pretty good design for a
waterless<00:00:10.410> mob<00:00:11.070> tower<00:00:11.759> gravity<00:00:12.450> trap<00:00:12.840> kind<00:00:13.200> of

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
waterless mob tower gravity trap kind of

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.259 
waterless mob tower gravity trap kind of
thing<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.830> want<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.460> show<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.910> basic

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
thing I want to show you the basic

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.900 
thing I want to show you the basic
principle<00:00:15.809> behind<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.410> we've<00:00:16.680> all<00:00:16.859> seen<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
principle behind it we've all seen you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.689 
principle behind it we've all seen you
know<00:00:18.029> how<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.570> spawn<00:00:19.140> mobs<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.770> make

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
know how you can spawn mobs and make

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.480 
know how you can spawn mobs and make
them<00:00:20.910> fall<00:00:21.180> from<00:00:21.420> gravity<00:00:22.279> but<00:00:23.279> what's

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
them fall from gravity but what's

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.700 
them fall from gravity but what's
interesting<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.869> new<00:00:25.140> method<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.650> I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
interesting is this new method that I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.130 
interesting is this new method that I
have<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.580> killing<00:00:27.210> them<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.599> then

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
have of have killing them and then

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.009 
have of have killing them and then
separating<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:28.859> there<00:00:29.039> drops<00:00:29.810> having<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.900> all

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
separating out there drops having it all

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.889 
separating out there drops having it all
collect<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.790> even<00:00:33.120> works<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.540> endermen

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
collect and it even works with endermen

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.330 
collect and it even works with endermen
so<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.290> ender<00:00:34.590> pearls<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.160> things

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
so you can get ender pearls and things

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
so you can get ender pearls and things
like<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> basic<00:00:36.930> principle<00:00:37.410> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
like that so the basic principle is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.660 
like that so the basic principle is
using<00:00:37.860> these<00:00:38.210> glass<00:00:39.210> panes<00:00:40.670> what's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
using these glass panes what's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.600 
using these glass panes what's
interesting<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:42.270> them<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:43.160> when<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.309> move

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
interesting about them is when they move

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.389 
interesting about them is when they move
when<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:45.000> pushed<00:00:45.210> by<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> piston<00:00:46.399> there

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
when they're pushed by a piston there

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.279 
when they're pushed by a piston there
you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.030> collision<00:00:48.539> mask<00:00:48.750> when<00:00:49.170> I'm

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
you know collision mask when I'm

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
you know collision mask when I'm
standing<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.829> right<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.129> goes<00:00:50.760> away<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.300> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
standing on right now goes away for a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.090 
standing on right now goes away for a
split<00:00:51.570> second<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.379> enough<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> make

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
split second and that's enough to make

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100 
split second and that's enough to make
items<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.850> fall<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.420> land<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.690> these<00:00:54.870> things

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
items that fall and land on these things

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.900 
items that fall and land on these things
fall<00:00:55.379> through<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.489> let<00:00:56.579> me<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.760> ahead<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
fall through so let me go ahead and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.610 
fall through so let me go ahead and
demonstrate<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> looks<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
demonstrate what that looks like to you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.439 
demonstrate what that looks like to you
real<00:00:58.829> quick<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.550> press<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.940> button<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
real quick we press this button and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.410 
real quick we press this button and
watch<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.980> cross-sections<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.180> you'll<00:01:03.329> see

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
watch the cross-sections here you'll see

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.550 
watch the cross-sections here you'll see
them<00:01:03.570> disappear<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> split<00:01:04.710> second

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
them disappear for just a split second

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.580 
them disappear for just a split second
see<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.090> now<00:01:09.090> that's<00:01:09.270> enough<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.869> let<00:01:10.080> items

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
see that now that's enough to let items

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
see that now that's enough to let items
fall<00:01:10.799> through<00:01:11.070> let<00:01:11.100> me<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.430> grab<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> bunch<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
fall through let me just grab a bunch of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
fall through let me just grab a bunch of
mushrooms<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> show<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.520> kind<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.580> what

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
mushrooms here and show you kind of what

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.710 
mushrooms here and show you kind of what
I'm<00:01:14.790> talking<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:15.320> let's<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:17.390> just<00:01:18.390> throw<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
I'm talking about let's see just throw a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
I'm talking about let's see just throw a
bunch<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.890> cross

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
bunch of these on the little cross

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.969 
bunch of these on the little cross
sections<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:27.049> all<00:01:28.049> right<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.650> those

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
sections here all right so all those

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
sections here all right so all those
mushrooms<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.850> top<00:01:30.119> hoo-wee<00:01:30.930> presses

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
mushrooms are now on top hoo-wee presses

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.870 
mushrooms are now on top hoo-wee presses
button<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.390> them<00:01:33.540> fall<00:01:33.780> through<00:01:34.880> well

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
button and all of them fall through well

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.950 
button and all of them fall through well
okay<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.650> them<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> well<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
okay so not all of them and well that is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
okay so not all of them and well that is
a<00:01:39.990> problem<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:40.939> resolved<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
a problem that I actually resolved and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.170 
a problem that I actually resolved and
let<00:01:42.600> me<00:01:42.689> take<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> over<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> my<00:01:43.920> killing<00:01:44.909> floor

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
let me take you over to my killing floor

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.230 
let me take you over to my killing floor
over<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> show<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.710> I've<00:01:46.799> done<00:01:47.240> so

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
over here and show you what I've done so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.270 
over here and show you what I've done so
here<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.689> see<00:01:49.049> 13<00:01:49.649> by<00:01:49.829> 13<00:01:49.860> area<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.970> believe

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
here you can see 13 by 13 area I believe

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.249 
here you can see 13 by 13 area I believe
13<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.670> way<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.299> way<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
13 this way and that way so all the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.530 
13 this way and that way so all the
Pistons<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.979> move<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.399> center<00:01:56.850> floor<00:01:57.210> area

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
Pistons can move this center floor area

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
Pistons can move this center floor area
this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.780> where<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.200> mobs<00:01:58.439> will<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.710> landing

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this is where the mobs will be landing

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.340 
this is where the mobs will be landing
on<00:02:00.560> now<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> set<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
on now I have a one I have it set up so

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.980 
on now I have a one I have it set up so
you<00:02:04.469> press<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.860> button<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.329> floor

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you press this button and then the floor

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
you press this button and then the floor
moves<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.380> way<00:02:07.619> then<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.550> way<00:02:08.759> then<00:02:09.000> this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
moves this way then this way then this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630 
moves this way then this way then this
way<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.539> back<00:02:09.899> again<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> resets<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.520> let

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
way then back again in the resets so let

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.040 
way then back again in the resets so let
me<00:02:11.670> press<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.150> show<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.810> you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
me press that show that to you

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.770 
me press that show that to you
so<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.400> follows<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.550> same<00:02:16.790> principle<00:02:17.090> every

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
so that follows the same principle every

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.550 
so that follows the same principle every
time<00:02:17.989> these<00:02:18.140> move<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:19.010> cross-sections<00:02:20.560> go

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
time these move the cross-sections go

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.440 
time these move the cross-sections go
away<00:02:21.800> for<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.069> split<00:02:22.430> second<00:02:23.000> let<00:02:23.209> all<00:02:23.300> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
away for a split second let all the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.949 
away for a split second let all the
items<00:02:23.750> fall<00:02:24.019> through<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:26.300> resolves<00:02:26.870> a

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
items fall through that resolves a

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.160 
items fall through that resolves a
problem<00:02:27.379> with<00:02:27.530> these<00:02:27.680> mushrooms<00:02:29.170> staying

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
problem with these mushrooms staying

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.110 
problem with these mushrooms staying
right<00:02:30.319> here<00:02:30.380> if<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:30.860> was<00:02:31.010> pushed<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
right here if this was pushed to the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.270 
right here if this was pushed to the
right<00:02:32.360> or<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.690> left<00:02:32.890> they<00:02:33.890> would<00:02:34.040> fall

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
right or to the left they would fall

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.000 
right or to the left they would fall
straight<00:02:34.489> through<00:02:36.280> ok<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:38.319> have<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:39.709> setup

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
straight through ok so I have this setup

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.000 
straight through ok so I have this setup
now<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:41.060> mob<00:02:41.360> tower<00:02:42.010> setting<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.190> have<00:02:44.120> water

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
now in a mob tower setting I have water

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.500 
now in a mob tower setting I have water
underneath<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.250> killing<00:02:46.580> floor<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:47.150> push<00:02:47.360> all

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
underneath the killing floor to push all

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.390 
underneath the killing floor to push all
the<00:02:47.599> items<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.110> center<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.709> then<00:02:48.769> a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
the items to the center and then a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
the items to the center and then a
little<00:02:49.459> collection<00:02:50.030> system<00:02:50.540> underneath<00:02:52.420> it's

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
little collection system underneath it's

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.380 
little collection system underneath it's
just<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.750> pretty<00:02:54.319> standard<00:02:54.829> gravity<00:02:55.819> fall<00:02:56.060> trap

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
just a pretty standard gravity fall trap

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.180 
just a pretty standard gravity fall trap
let<00:02:56.720> me<00:02:56.780> go<00:02:56.900> ahead<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.170> turn<00:02:57.319> it<00:02:57.470> on<00:02:57.739> well

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
let me go ahead and turn it on well

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.710 
let me go ahead and turn it on well
actually<00:02:58.400> let<00:02:58.790> me<00:02:58.849> go<00:02:58.970> ahead<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.209> take<00:02:59.299> inside

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
actually let me go ahead and take inside

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.880 
actually let me go ahead and take inside
real<00:02:59.900> quick<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.349> we<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:00.739> what<00:03:00.860> looks

real quick just so we can see what looks

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.569 
real quick just so we can see what looks
like<00:03:01.069> in<00:03:01.280> here<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:02.349> can<00:03:03.349> get<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.799> here<00:03:04.190> maybe<00:03:04.640> ah

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
ok so let's just go up to the very top

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.990 
ok so let's just go up to the very top
floor<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.470> have<00:03:15.709> pissed<00:03:16.040> at<00:03:16.220> art<00:03:16.459> I'm<00:03:16.790> sorry

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
floor so I have pissed at art I'm sorry

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.599 
floor so I have pissed at art I'm sorry
I<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.319> lava<00:03:18.319> lighting<00:03:18.889> in<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.250> turn<00:03:19.489> it

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
I have lava lighting in here to turn it

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.099 
I have lava lighting in here to turn it
off<00:03:20.109> it's<00:03:21.109> just<00:03:21.410> three<00:03:21.859> wide<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.579> believe<00:03:23.269> nine

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
off it's just three wide I believe nine

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.319 
off it's just three wide I believe nine
long<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:27.100> signs<00:03:28.100> in<00:03:28.370> between<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:29.000> spawn

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
long with signs in between the spawn

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.289 
long with signs in between the spawn
floors<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.590> when<00:03:30.950> mobs<00:03:31.190> spawn<00:03:31.880> here<00:03:32.120> they'll

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
floors so when mobs spawn here they'll

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.059 
floors so when mobs spawn here they'll
just<00:03:32.480> walk<00:03:32.810> right<00:03:32.870> over<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.410> signs<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.829> fall

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
just walk right over the signs and fall

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.090 
just walk right over the signs and fall
straight<00:03:34.310> down<00:03:35.230> looks<00:03:36.230> like<00:03:36.440> i<00:03:36.560> have<00:03:36.590> four

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
straight down looks like i have four

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.520 
straight down looks like i have four
floors<00:03:37.459> this<00:03:38.299> isn't<00:03:38.690> quite<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.139> building

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
floors this isn't quite to the building

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.319 
floors this isn't quite to the building
limit<00:03:39.829> i<00:03:39.920> can<00:03:40.130> make<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.340> lot<00:03:40.609> more<00:03:40.639> floors<00:03:41.180> in

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
limit i can make a lot more floors in

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.680 
limit i can make a lot more floors in
here<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.569> speed<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:41.989> up<00:03:42.170> more<00:03:43.180> let<00:03:44.180> me<00:03:44.329> find

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
here to speed this up more let me find

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.650 
here to speed this up more let me find
my<00:03:44.870> way<00:03:45.019> back<00:03:45.049> out<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.650> here<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.209> then<00:03:47.209> turn

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
my way back out of here and then turn

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.300 
my way back out of here and then turn
this<00:03:47.810> on<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.350> guys<00:03:48.410> can<00:03:48.620> see<00:03:48.680> how<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:49.250> is

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
this on so you guys can see how this is

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.229 
this on so you guys can see how this is
working<00:03:49.400> OOP<00:03:51.880> apparently<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:52.910> don't<00:03:53.090> know<00:03:53.150> how

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
working OOP apparently I don't know how

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.699 
working OOP apparently I don't know how
to<00:03:53.329> get<00:03:53.450> out<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.600> glass<00:03:54.549> let's<00:03:56.260> fill<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.440> back

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
to get out of glass let's fill that back

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.129 
to get out of glass let's fill that back
in<00:03:58.720> it's<00:03:59.720> like<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.250> all<00:04:01.250> right<00:04:01.549> let<00:04:02.329> me<00:04:02.359> turn

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
in it's like that all right let me turn

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.089 
in it's like that all right let me turn
the<00:04:03.319> lava<00:04:03.530> off<00:04:03.799> so<00:04:04.160> we<00:04:04.280> can<00:04:04.459> have<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:06.829> mob

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
the lava off so we can have the mob

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:15.880 
the lava off so we can have the mob
spawning<00:04:10.840> look

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.740 

alright<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:17.820> just<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.090> second<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.540> lava

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
alright so in just a second the lava

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.970 
alright so in just a second the lava
will<00:04:18.989> all<00:04:19.049> go<00:04:19.260> away<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.560> can<00:04:19.739> see<00:04:19.860> it's

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
will all go away you can see it's

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.860 
will all go away you can see it's
starting<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.250> get<00:04:20.340> darker<00:04:20.730> in<00:04:20.820> there<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:27.510> move

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
starting to get darker in there and move

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.800 
starting to get darker in there and move
back<00:04:28.230> down<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.740> killing<00:04:29.160> floor<00:04:29.310> area<00:04:32.810> okay

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
back down to the killing floor area okay

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:41.060 
back down to the killing floor area okay
now<00:04:34.020> we<00:04:34.080> got<00:04:34.290> mom<00:04:34.440> spawning<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:39.870> see<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.860> well

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
right away there was an Enderman that

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.670 
right away there was an Enderman that
died<00:04:42.810> dropped<00:04:43.230> his<00:04:43.380> ender<00:04:43.620> pearl<00:04:45.200> now<00:04:46.200> you<00:04:46.260> can

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
died dropped his ender pearl now you can

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.050 
died dropped his ender pearl now you can
see<00:04:46.860> that<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.070> items<00:04:47.430> are<00:04:47.550> just<00:04:47.760> kind<00:04:47.910> of

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
see that the items are just kind of

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.970 
see that the items are just kind of
hanging<00:04:48.660> out<00:04:48.900> on<00:04:49.050> top<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:49.530> sometimes

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
hanging out on top of this sometimes

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.440 
hanging out on top of this sometimes
sometimes<00:04:50.430> they<00:04:50.580> fall<00:04:50.730> through<00:04:51.030> sometimes

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
sometimes they fall through sometimes

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.970 
sometimes they fall through sometimes
they<00:04:51.600> hang<00:04:51.780> out<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.200> that's<00:04:52.320> what<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.620> Pistons

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
they hang out so that's what the Pistons

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.200 
they hang out so that's what the Pistons
are<00:04:53.100> for<00:04:53.310> like<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.640> showed<00:04:53.850> at<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.060> beginning

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
are for like I showed at the beginning

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.530 
are for like I showed at the beginning
of<00:04:54.570> this<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:55.320> move<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.620> floor<00:04:56.000> all<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.270> items

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
of this to move the floor all the items

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.570 
of this to move the floor all the items
will<00:04:57.690> fall<00:04:57.900> through<00:04:58.400> and<00:05:00.980> they<00:05:01.980> all<00:05:02.160> go<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.370> the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
will fall through and they all go to the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.450 
will fall through and they all go to the
collection<00:05:02.850> point<00:05:03.240> which<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.480> really<00:05:03.690> cool

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.120 

missing<00:05:08.460> at<00:05:08.550> which<00:05:08.730> there<00:05:09.830> let<00:05:10.830> me<00:05:10.890> go<00:05:11.010> ahead

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
missing at which there let me go ahead

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.700 
missing at which there let me go ahead
and<00:05:11.250> press<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.670> button<00:05:15.200> you<00:05:16.200> see<00:05:16.230> all<00:05:16.560> the

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
and press the button you see all the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.290 
and press the button you see all the
items<00:05:17.010> that<00:05:17.070> were<00:05:17.160> on<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.460> floor<00:05:17.700> now<00:05:17.970> gone

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
items that were on that floor now gone

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.090 
items that were on that floor now gone
they've<00:05:18.960> all<00:05:19.140> fallen<00:05:19.380> through<00:05:19.740> into<00:05:19.980> the

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
they've all fallen through into the

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.950 
they've all fallen through into the
water<00:05:20.310> system<00:05:23.120> yeah<00:05:24.120> there<00:05:24.360> is<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.510> slight

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
water system yeah there is a slight

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.280 
water system yeah there is a slight
issue<00:05:25.290> that<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:25.620> had<00:05:25.890> here<00:05:26.190> let<00:05:26.520> me<00:05:27.110> take<00:05:28.110> you

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
issue that I had here let me take you

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.110 
issue that I had here let me take you
inside<00:05:28.410> here<00:05:29.040> make<00:05:29.370> this<00:05:29.490> three<00:05:29.700> tall<00:05:29.910> so<00:05:30.060> I

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
inside here make this three tall so I

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.280 
inside here make this three tall so I
can<00:05:30.270> fit<00:05:31.850> since<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:33.330> way<00:05:33.510> this<00:05:33.660> piston<00:05:34.050> is<00:05:34.110> set

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
can fit since the way this piston is set

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.159 
can fit since the way this piston is set
up<00:05:34.380> there's<00:05:34.560> actually<00:05:34.919> like<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.120> one-half<00:05:36.169> to

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
up there's actually like a one-half to

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.520 
up there's actually like a one-half to
wide<00:05:37.710> gap<00:05:38.040> here<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.930> spiders<00:05:39.930> were<00:05:40.110> landing

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
wide gap here and spiders were landing

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.400 
wide gap here and spiders were landing
in<00:05:40.620> there<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:40.980> surviving<00:05:41.640> so<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.540> surrounded

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
in there and surviving so I surrounded

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.909 
in there and surviving so I surrounded
the<00:05:44.070> outside<00:05:44.580> area<00:05:44.850> with<00:05:45.570> glass<00:05:46.169> panes<00:05:46.590> and

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
the outside area with glass panes and

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.790 
the outside area with glass panes and
that<00:05:47.810> prevents<00:05:48.810> all<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.110> mobs<00:05:49.290> from<00:05:49.470> falling

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
that prevents all the mobs from falling

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.820 
that prevents all the mobs from falling
through<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:50.280> surviving<00:05:51.260> but<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.470> leaves<00:05:52.650> a

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
through and surviving but that leaves a

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.340 
through and surviving but that leaves a
problem<00:05:53.220> with<00:05:53.370> some<00:05:53.550> items<00:05:54.080> staying<00:05:55.080> right

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
problem with some items staying right

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.990 
problem with some items staying right
there<00:05:55.560> every<00:05:55.830> once<00:05:55.980> in<00:05:56.190> a<00:05:56.250> while<00:05:56.400> now<00:05:56.580> I<00:05:56.610> can<00:05:56.910> be

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
there every once in a while now I can be

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.440 
there every once in a while now I can be
avoided<00:05:57.300> if<00:05:58.290> I<00:05:58.620> adjust<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:59.190> way<00:05:59.340> that<00:05:59.610> mob<00:05:59.880> for

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
avoided if I adjust the way that mob for

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.590 
avoided if I adjust the way that mob for
is<00:06:00.930> set<00:06:01.350> up<00:06:01.500> up<00:06:01.710> there<00:06:02.040> to<00:06:02.790> keep<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:03.090> mobs<00:06:03.330> more

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
is set up up there to keep the mobs more

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.570 
is set up up there to keep the mobs more
centered<00:06:04.169> more<00:06:04.800> in<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.280> center<00:06:05.640> but<00:06:07.580> for

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
centered more in the center but for

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.860 
centered more in the center but for
right<00:06:08.669> now<00:06:08.700> it's<00:06:09.030> not<00:06:09.210> that<00:06:09.360> big<00:06:09.510> of<00:06:09.570> a<00:06:09.690> deal

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
right now it's not that big of a deal

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.750 
right now it's not that big of a deal
it's<00:06:10.140> only<00:06:10.320> like<00:06:10.470> a<00:06:10.500> few<00:06:10.740> items<00:06:10.919> like<00:06:11.490> out<00:06:11.669> of

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
it's only like a few items like out of

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.870 
it's only like a few items like out of
all<00:06:11.850> of<00:06:11.910> these<00:06:12.180> that<00:06:12.900> are<00:06:12.930> you<00:06:13.410> know<00:06:13.530> dropping

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
all of these that are you know dropping

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:22.750 
all of these that are you know dropping
so<00:06:14.880> let's<00:06:15.030> go<00:06:15.150> ahead<00:06:15.180> hit<00:06:15.630> this<00:06:15.810> button

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.710 

now<00:06:23.760> you<00:06:23.820> can<00:06:23.970> just<00:06:24.150> see<00:06:24.240> all<00:06:24.390> those<00:06:24.510> items

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
now you can just see all those items

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:34.100 
now you can just see all those items
coming<00:06:25.080> down<00:06:29.750> so<00:06:30.750> this<00:06:30.900> is<00:06:30.930> pretty<00:06:31.290> good<00:06:33.110> just

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
coming down so this is pretty good just

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.090 
coming down so this is pretty good just
go<00:06:34.290> and<00:06:34.410> grab<00:06:34.590> all<00:06:34.680> these<00:06:36.800> now<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:37.830> only

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
go and grab all these now the only

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.570 
go and grab all these now the only
drawback<00:06:38.880> to<00:06:39.120> this<00:06:39.330> setup<00:06:39.600> is<00:06:40.310> you<00:06:41.310> got<00:06:41.460> the

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
drawback to this setup is you got the

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.400 
drawback to this setup is you got the
tower<00:06:41.790> which<00:06:42.270> you<00:06:42.660> know<00:06:42.750> I'm<00:06:42.960> sure<00:06:43.140> you<00:06:43.260> can

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
tower which you know I'm sure you can

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.030 
tower which you know I'm sure you can
make<00:06:43.500> it<00:06:43.620> look<00:06:43.740> better<00:06:45.260> but<00:06:46.260> it's<00:06:46.470> not<00:06:46.590> that

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
make it look better but it's not that

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.190 
make it look better but it's not that
nice<00:06:47.280> to<00:06:47.490> look<00:06:47.640> at<00:06:47.850> and<00:06:50.270> it's<00:06:51.270> works<00:06:51.960> pretty

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
nice to look at and it's works pretty

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.470 
nice to look at and it's works pretty
fast<00:06:52.320> too<00:06:52.800> I<00:06:52.920> mean<00:06:53.280> just<00:06:53.880> that<00:06:54.000> amount<00:06:54.240> of<00:06:54.300> time

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
fast too I mean just that amount of time

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.640 
fast too I mean just that amount of time
already<00:06:54.750> 5-under<00:06:55.350> pearls<00:06:55.680> I<00:06:55.830> mean<00:06:57.410> can't<00:06:58.410> ask

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
already 5-under pearls I mean can't ask

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.960 
already 5-under pearls I mean can't ask
for<00:06:58.800> better<00:06:58.950> than<00:06:59.190> that<00:06:59.490> really<00:07:01.670> so<00:07:02.670> you<00:07:02.790> can

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
for better than that really so you can

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.910 
for better than that really so you can
add<00:07:03.090> more<00:07:03.330> spawn<00:07:03.780> floors<00:07:04.140> to<00:07:04.350> make<00:07:04.500> it<00:07:04.650> spawn

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
add more spawn floors to make it spawn

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.800 
add more spawn floors to make it spawn
