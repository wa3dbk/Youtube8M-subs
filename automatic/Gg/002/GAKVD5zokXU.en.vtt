00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 finally all that tell me you know you 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.629
 are the ideal customer for lenses 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.629
 Chinese portrait you

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.400
 Chinese portrait is if you were a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.930
 flower I 'll be a news otis that's it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.220
 the child story very chic that a rose 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.700
 it's not that at all precisely it's so 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.070
 you were a defect I would be very very 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:38.760
 friendly and a little boring game is 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:46.500
 an insult will cook you an egg 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:53.519
 rotten and eats the same purpose the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.780
 pestilent to an accident I 'll be two 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.949
 bumper cars coming in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.629
 in a perversion listen what does not 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.250
 look at me not a mouth I'll be the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.990
 war of thongs because I would like 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.910
 open a war I'm against 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.300
 advanced thongs for tonga in favor 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.250
 tonga 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.250
 no I 'm going to do the big fat leipp 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.130
 lure excluded because I led a 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.570
 crusade five years ago against the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.220
 underpants you know it was these people from 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.079
 tights with the foot cut a lot of 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.390
 women who wore them so I was at 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.799
 become a little head anti finally underwear 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.970
 good now it's the strings that we 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.610
 sees more and more with the beautiful 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.170
 days and I find it a little curious 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.970
 because the string principle is 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.220
 even though it does not show up 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.649
 can you see that I had against you the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.200
 tanga no longer the tanga 2 is a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.209
 guys string or sli for that and for 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 that's good there and not the divas talent the 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.560
 string because I stayed at one 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.869
 definition that carlos gave recently 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.880
 with big heads said I like the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.049
 string because it allows cats to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.060
 play with display yes there was a 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.160
 drawing of wismes a frightful not seen 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.080
 it was a woman on the beach lying 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.030
 on the belly there was a man behind 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.830
 she with david cut in half in the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.209
 sense of length and she him she 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.599
 went back to tell him if he had a little more 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.599
 patient 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.880
 we continue a weapon two fingers cut 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.060
 hungry because apart from the finer the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.880
 all a bad ordeal obligate all the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.970
 world to put strings on you too 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.130

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.900

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.340

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.740

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.300
 compliment for men
