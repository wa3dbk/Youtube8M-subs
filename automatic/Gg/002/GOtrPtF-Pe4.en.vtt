00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
screen buttons yeah there's people that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.000 
screen buttons yeah there's people that
don't<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.460> these<00:01:14.610> fast<00:01:14.880> menus<00:01:15.360> but

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010

don't like to have these fast menus but
we<00:01:17.010> have<00:01:17.190> thought<00:01:17.460> Alma<00:01:17.850> also<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:19.220> what

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
we have thought Alma also on them what

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.020 
we have thought Alma also on them what
we<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.490> done<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:21.260> create<00:01:22.260> this<00:01:23.030> maximize

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
we have done it's create this maximize

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.840 
we have done it's create this maximize
and<00:01:24.270> minimize<00:01:24.350> arrows<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:26.220> allows<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and minimize arrows that allows you to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.930 
and minimize arrows that allows you to
to<00:01:27.750> load<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.890> select<00:01:29.130> different<00:01:29.580> levels

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
to load or to select different levels

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.330 
to load or to select different levels
for<00:01:30.780> example<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.320> use<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.680> level<00:01:32.040> it's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
for example you can use this level it's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.540 
for example you can use this level it's
gonna<00:01:32.460> say<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.870> smaller<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:35.370> one

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
gonna say this can be smaller this one

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.710 
gonna say this can be smaller this one
just<00:01:35.790> an<00:01:35.940> O<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.630> on/off<00:01:37.620> but<00:01:38.240> from<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.450> first

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
just an O and on/off but from this first

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.180 
just an O and on/off but from this first
