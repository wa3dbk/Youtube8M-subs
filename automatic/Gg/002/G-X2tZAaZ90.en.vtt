cooking see you in Australia okay hey I
just<00:04:38.570> saw<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.199> it<00:04:39.410> I<00:04:39.560> looked<00:04:39.919> up<00:04:40.100> there<00:04:40.370> on

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
just saw that it I looked up there on

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.850 
just saw that it I looked up there on
that<00:04:40.789> wall<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.330> nobody<00:04:41.750> picked<00:04:41.990> Australia<00:04:42.740> so

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
that wall and nobody picked Australia so

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.339 
that wall and nobody picked Australia so
I<00:04:42.889> figured<00:04:43.280> I'd<00:04:43.400> better<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.900> that's<00:04:45.050> my

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
I figured I'd better so that's my

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:46.659 
I figured I'd better so that's my
reasoning<00:04:45.770> but<00:04:45.889> I<00:04:45.950> guess<00:04:46.160> that<00:04:46.340> was<00:04:46.430> by<00:04:46.610> the

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
reasoning but I guess that was by the

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.939 
reasoning but I guess that was by the
spirit

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949
