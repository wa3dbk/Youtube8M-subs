reddit<00:00:12.929> not<00:00:13.410> too<00:00:13.650> long<00:00:13.860> ago<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:15.619> it<00:00:16.670> uses

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
reddit not too long ago and it uses

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.920 
reddit not too long ago and it uses
three<00:00:19.470> charges<00:00:19.830> along<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:20.840> activated<00:00:21.840> by

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
three charges along here activated by

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:31.609 
three charges along here activated by
this<00:00:22.140> redstone<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.240> also<00:00:29.359> use<00:00:30.619> two

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this redstone and it can also use two

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:42.049 
this redstone and it can also use two
charges<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.610> kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.850> does<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
charges and this one kind of does a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.560 
charges and this one kind of does a
lower<00:00:43.280> shorter<00:00:44.450> lob<00:00:46.039> not<00:00:47.039> far<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.120> hit

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
lower shorter lob not far one can hit

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.889 
lower shorter lob not far one can hit
like<00:00:48.870> almost<00:00:49.289> way<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.629> but<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
like almost way up there but it is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.560 
like almost way up there but it is
pretty<00:00:52.140> sporadic<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.879> landed<00:00:54.300> down

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
pretty sporadic that one landed down

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.189 
pretty sporadic that one landed down
there<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.050> first<00:00:55.350> shelf<00:00:55.680> I've<00:00:56.640> seen<00:00:56.940> it

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
there on that first shelf I've seen it

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:07.399 
there on that first shelf I've seen it
land<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.320> lot<00:00:58.590> higher<00:01:05.090> little<00:01:06.090> hand<00:01:06.409> really

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
land a lot higher little hand really

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.679 
land a lot higher little hand really
high<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> bit<00:01:10.860> sporadic<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.689> we're

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
high so it is a bit sporadic and we're

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.710 
high so it is a bit sporadic and we're
going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.840> upgrade<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> first<00:01:15.390> we're

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
going to upgrade it a bit so first we're

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.800 
going to upgrade it a bit so first we're
going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:15.990> rid<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.259> redstone<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.810> try

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
going to get rid of this redstone I try

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.320 
going to get rid of this redstone I try
to<00:01:18.840> avoid<00:01:18.990> redstone<00:01:19.939> never<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.210> you're

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
to avoid redstone never know when you're

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.770 
to avoid redstone never know when you're
going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.860> really<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.070> access<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> well

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
going to really have access to it well

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.499 
going to really have access to it well
go<00:01:24.900> ahead<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> add<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> lever<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:26.299> now<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
go ahead and add a lever there now that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.710 
go ahead and add a lever there now that
lever<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:28.140> still<00:01:28.619> trigger<00:01:28.860> 12<00:01:29.549> charges<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
lever will still trigger 12 charges and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.960 
lever will still trigger 12 charges and
then<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.470> third<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:31.970> down<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:34.939> we<00:01:35.939> don't

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
then a third one down there and we don't

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.310 
then a third one down there and we don't
need<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.479> block<00:01:36.780> anymore<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.960> works<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
need this block anymore so it works the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:49.520 
need this block anymore so it works the
same<00:01:40.350> three<00:01:41.250> TT<00:01:45.920> nice<00:01:46.920> long<00:01:47.280> high<00:01:47.610> lob<00:01:48.259> its<00:01:49.259> way

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
same three TT nice long high lob its way

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.569 
same three TT nice long high lob its way
up<00:01:49.560> there<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.049> weird<00:01:52.579> graphics

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
up there and that was weird graphics

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.670 
up there and that was weird graphics
update<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.549> fire<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:57.320> but<00:01:58.320> this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
update and you can fire the two but this

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.810 
update and you can fire the two but this
lever<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.340> hard<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> reach<00:02:00.509> an<00:02:00.890> awkward<00:02:01.890> so

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
lever is hard to reach an awkward so

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.090 
lever is hard to reach an awkward so
we're<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> add<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> new<00:02:04.140> lever<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
we're going to add a new lever for the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.650 
we're going to add a new lever for the
shot<00:02:06.170> just<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.320> right<00:02:07.469> above<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.179> so

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
shot just up right above it but then so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.150 
shot just up right above it but then so
don't<00:02:09.840> need<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.110> anymore<00:02:10.170> that'll<00:02:10.920> trigger

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
don't need that anymore that'll trigger

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.309 
don't need that anymore that'll trigger
the<00:02:11.489> shot

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
the shot

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:22.259 
the shot
and<00:02:13.189> it'll<00:02:13.640> let<00:02:13.819> still<00:02:14.060> activate<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.749> same

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.349 

nice<00:02:23.269> long<00:02:23.540> lob<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:25.519> land<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:25.909> little<00:02:26.090> lower

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
nice long lob and land it a little lower

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.309 
nice long lob and land it a little lower
so<00:02:28.150> now<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.420> want<00:02:29.599> to<00:02:29.659> get<00:02:29.719> rid<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.930> these<00:02:30.049> iron

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
bars I never know what I'm going to have

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.949 
bars I never know what I'm going to have
access<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.409> those<00:02:33.680> either<00:02:34.189> I<00:02:34.670> try<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.269> use<00:02:35.389> wood

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
access to those either I try to use wood

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.530 
access to those either I try to use wood
and<00:02:36.340> cobblestone<00:02:37.340> pretty<00:02:37.849> much<00:02:38.000> for<00:02:38.239> blocks

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
and cobblestone pretty much for blocks

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.500 
and cobblestone pretty much for blocks
and<00:02:39.069> all<00:02:40.069> my<00:02:40.250> cannons<00:02:40.669> so<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.669> and<00:02:43.999> it's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
and all my cannons so do that and it's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.440 
and all my cannons so do that and it's
kind<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.959> minimalistic<00:02:45.849> just<00:02:46.849> cobble<00:02:47.239> stone

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
kind of a minimalistic just cobble stone

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.830 
kind of a minimalistic just cobble stone
and<00:02:47.629> wood<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:49.359> that's<00:02:50.359> how<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.540> get<00:02:50.689> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
and wood and that's how you get the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.759 
and wood and that's how you get the
levers<00:02:51.169> and<00:02:51.349> everything<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:55.090> will<00:02:56.769> work

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
levers and everything so this will work

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.909 
levers and everything so this will work
the<00:02:57.980> same<00:02:58.750> another<00:02:59.750> thing<00:03:00.109> is<00:03:00.319> that<00:03:00.409> this

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
the same another thing is that this

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.649 
the same another thing is that this
water<00:03:01.400> source<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:02.329> comes<00:03:02.780> along<00:03:03.049> here<00:03:03.469> and<00:03:03.680> it

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
water source it comes along here and it

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.240 
water source it comes along here and it
reaches<00:03:05.659> all<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.870> charges<00:03:06.469> you<00:03:06.620> can<00:03:06.739> also<00:03:06.919> add

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
reaches all the charges you can also add

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.849 
reaches all the charges you can also add
one<00:03:07.939> on<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.209> side<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:09.409> will<00:03:09.500> create<00:03:09.680> an

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
one on that side and it will create an

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.909 
one on that side and it will create an
infinite<00:03:10.189> water<00:03:10.459> spring<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.659> just<00:03:12.590> putting<00:03:12.829> a

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
infinite water spring and just putting a

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.099 
infinite water spring and just putting a
TNT<00:03:13.370> there<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:13.939> activating<00:03:14.629> it<00:03:14.780> it'll<00:03:15.079> just

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
TNT there and activating it it'll just

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.089 
TNT there and activating it it'll just
recreate<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.329> so<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:18.319> can<00:03:18.439> have<00:03:18.620> one<00:03:18.829> around

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
recreate it so you can have one around

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.309 
recreate it so you can have one around
around<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.819> handy<00:03:20.150> just<00:03:20.479> within<00:03:21.049> your

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
around and handy just within your

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.460 
around and handy just within your
diagonal<00:03:21.769> shot<00:03:21.979> cannon<00:03:23.949> now<00:03:24.949> having<00:03:25.849> a<00:03:25.939> ladder

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
diagonal shot cannon now having a ladder

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.869 
diagonal shot cannon now having a ladder
there<00:03:29.049> tinky<00:03:30.049> does<00:03:30.560> this<00:03:30.769> little<00:03:31.040> hop<00:03:31.250> when

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
there tinky does this little hop when

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.460 
there tinky does this little hop when
you<00:03:32.000> activate<00:03:32.359> it<00:03:32.509> and<00:03:34.479> it'll<00:03:35.479> hop<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:36.229> way

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
you activate it and it'll hop that way

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.039 
you activate it and it'll hop that way
and<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:36.949> way<00:03:36.979> but<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.090> won't<00:03:38.269> hop<00:03:38.569> this<00:03:38.989> way

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
and that way but it won't hop this way

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.619 
and that way but it won't hop this way
because<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.859> block<00:03:40.159> is<00:03:40.189> in<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.579> way<00:03:40.699> but<00:03:41.479> it

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
because this block is in the way but it

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.300 
because this block is in the way but it
will<00:03:41.780> hop<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.319> way<00:03:42.379> and<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:45.040> want<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.129> try<00:03:46.280> to

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
will hop this way and I want to try to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.899 
will hop this way and I want to try to
avoid<00:03:46.759> putting<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.299> block<00:03:47.569> here<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:49.459> can<00:03:49.669> I

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
avoid putting a block here you can I

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.059 
avoid putting a block here you can I
mean<00:03:50.209> this<00:03:50.299> will<00:03:50.479> work<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:51.259> can<00:03:51.470> activate<00:03:51.859> it

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
mean this will work you can activate it

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.479 
mean this will work you can activate it
from<00:03:52.159> here<00:03:52.540> reload<00:03:53.540> down<00:03:53.720> here<00:03:54.400> it's<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.459> little

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
from here reload down here it's a little

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.879 
from here reload down here it's a little
weird<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.060> awkward<00:03:56.229> but<00:03:57.229> if<00:03:57.439> you<00:03:57.560> just<00:03:57.769> have

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
weird and awkward but if you just have

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.699 
weird and awkward but if you just have
access<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.430> another<00:03:58.609> ladder<00:03:59.379> you<00:04:00.379> can<00:04:00.560> put

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
access to another ladder you can put

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.599 
access to another ladder you can put
that<00:04:00.739> here<00:04:02.919> and<00:04:03.919> that<00:04:04.879> will<00:04:04.969> work<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.299> same

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
that here and that will work the same

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:13.140 
that here and that will work the same
let's<00:04:07.609> say

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.379 

this<00:04:16.799> block<00:04:17.799> will<00:04:18.040> prevent<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.669> TT<00:04:19.150> from

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
this block will prevent this TT from

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.550 
this block will prevent this TT from
hopping<00:04:19.630> this<00:04:19.930> way<00:04:21.509> just<00:04:22.509> the<00:04:22.660> same<00:04:22.870> as<00:04:23.080> if<00:04:23.229> it

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
hopping this way just the same as if it

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.610 
hopping this way just the same as if it
was<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:24.009> block<00:04:24.370> like<00:04:24.580> that<00:04:25.229> so<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.979> will<00:04:27.160> never

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
was a block like that so it will never

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.820 
was a block like that so it will never
hop<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:29.979> direction<00:04:31.229> it'll<00:04:32.229> always<00:04:32.470> just

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
hop in that direction it'll always just

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.460 
hop in that direction it'll always just
go<00:04:33.009> towards<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> water<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.660> doing<00:04:38.139> that<00:04:38.169> you

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
go towards the water so doing that you

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.360 
go towards the water so doing that you
can<00:04:38.620> actually<00:04:42.930> send<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.070> exactly<00:04:45.070> where<00:04:45.280> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
can actually send it exactly where you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.390 
can actually send it exactly where you
want<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.979> will<00:04:50.979> make<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.160> is

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
want it to and this will make it is

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.439 
want it to and this will make it is
accurate<00:04:51.639> almost<00:04:52.449> as<00:04:52.660> possible<00:04:54.419> it'll<00:04:55.419> just

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
accurate almost as possible it'll just

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.080 
accurate almost as possible it'll just
hop<00:04:55.810> up<00:04:55.840> into<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.380> hole<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.830> then<00:04:57.820> straight

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
hop up into the hole and then straight

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.200 
hop up into the hole and then straight
down<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:59.139> won't<00:04:59.800> work<00:04:59.949> if<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.520> put<00:05:00.699> a<00:05:00.729> block

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
down it won't work if you put a block

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.080 
down it won't work if you put a block
here<00:05:02.070> TNT<00:05:03.330> will<00:05:04.330> always<00:05:04.840> tend<00:05:05.139> to<00:05:05.699> hit<00:05:06.699> that

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
here TNT will always tend to hit that

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.150 
here TNT will always tend to hit that
block<00:05:07.449> that's<00:05:07.870> in<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.110> middle<00:05:08.229> hit<00:05:08.800> its<00:05:08.919> head

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
block that's in the middle hit its head

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.360 
block that's in the middle hit its head
on<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.490> when<00:05:09.669> it<00:05:09.699> tries<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.210> do<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.539> hop<00:05:10.870> and

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
on it when it tries to do a hop and

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.310 
on it when it tries to do a hop and
instead<00:05:12.370> land<00:05:13.240> on<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.509> edge<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.960> one<00:05:14.139> of<00:05:14.229> these

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
instead land on the edge of one of these

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.820 
instead land on the edge of one of these
other<00:05:14.530> blocks<00:05:14.830> over<00:05:15.039> here<00:05:15.419> so<00:05:16.419> it<00:05:17.349> just<00:05:17.620> does<00:05:17.800> a

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
other blocks over here so it just does a

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.390 
other blocks over here so it just does a
little<00:05:18.580> hop<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.800> doesn't<00:05:20.800> go<00:05:20.860> anywhere<00:05:21.099> and

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
little hop and doesn't go anywhere and

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.330 
little hop and doesn't go anywhere and
blows<00:05:21.610> itself<00:05:21.880> up<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:23.590> have<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.130> try<00:05:24.280> to

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
blows itself up so you have to try to

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.060 
blows itself up so you have to try to
avoid<00:05:24.669> that<00:05:25.380> but<00:05:26.380> this<00:05:26.590> ladder<00:05:28.199> letters<00:05:29.199> have

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
avoid that but this ladder letters have

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.800 
avoid that but this ladder letters have
this<00:05:30.280> edge<00:05:30.810> have<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.840> hitbox<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:34.419> can<00:05:34.570> land

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
this edge have a hitbox and you can land

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.379 
this edge have a hitbox and you can land
on<00:05:34.930> it<00:05:35.139> you<00:05:35.349> can<00:05:35.590> splat<00:05:36.159> and<00:05:36.370> die<00:05:36.699> on<00:05:36.729> it<00:05:37.120> which

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
on it you can splat and die on it which

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.560 
on it you can splat and die on it which
I'm<00:05:37.840> sure<00:05:38.190> some<00:05:39.190> pool<00:05:39.460> know<00:05:40.090> what<00:05:40.270> I'm<00:05:40.419> talking

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
I'm sure some pool know what I'm talking

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.920 
I'm sure some pool know what I'm talking
about<00:05:41.039> but<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.159> also<00:05:42.340> has<00:05:42.580> a<00:05:42.639> side<00:05:43.180> edge<00:05:43.510> and

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
about but it also has a side edge and

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.750 
about but it also has a side edge and
that<00:05:44.320> will<00:05:44.440> prevent<00:05:44.710> it<00:05:44.860> from<00:05:45.010> hopping<00:05:45.370> this

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
that will prevent it from hopping this

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.060 
that will prevent it from hopping this
way<00:05:46.000> just<00:05:46.539> the<00:05:46.690> same<00:05:46.960> as<00:05:47.229> this<00:05:47.680> block<00:05:48.039> will

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
way just the same as this block will

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.710 
way just the same as this block will

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
prevent it from hopping this way

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.219 
prevent it from hopping this way
diagonally<00:05:51.180> so<00:05:52.180> we<00:05:52.300> will<00:05:52.510> stay<00:05:52.690> on<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:52.870> top<00:05:53.080> of

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
diagonally so we will stay on the top of

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.649 
diagonally so we will stay on the top of
this<00:05:53.289> letter<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.949> won't<00:05:54.400> hop<00:05:54.699> this<00:05:54.970> way<00:05:55.030> and

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
this letter it won't hop this way and

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:02.330 
this letter it won't hop this way and
now<00:05:56.409> I<00:05:56.470> have<00:05:56.650> a<00:05:56.710> view<00:05:57.099> for<00:05:57.490> this<00:05:57.639> lever<00:06:00.930> and

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
now I have a view for this lever and

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.050 
now I have a view for this lever and
making<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.490> pretty<00:06:04.060> accurate<00:06:05.729> you<00:06:06.729> can<00:06:06.909> hit

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
making it pretty accurate you can hit

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.700 
making it pretty accurate you can hit
right<00:06:07.270> about<00:06:07.510> that<00:06:07.720> spot<00:06:08.080> every<00:06:08.380> time<00:06:08.409> now<00:06:10.710> so

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
right about that spot every time now so

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.219 
right about that spot every time now so
that's<00:06:12.370> mostly<00:06:12.940> it<00:06:13.060> for<00:06:13.659> the<00:06:13.870> single-shot

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
that's mostly it for the single-shot

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.409 
that's mostly it for the single-shot
upgrades<00:06:14.860> we<00:06:15.370> can<00:06:15.520> also<00:06:15.639> just<00:06:15.940> add<00:06:16.389> another

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
upgrades we can also just add another

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:23.000 
upgrades we can also just add another
shot<00:06:16.990> if<00:06:17.139> you<00:06:17.260> want<00:06:19.919> oops<00:06:20.919> now<00:06:21.909> just<00:06:22.210> reload<00:06:22.539> it

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
shot if you want oops now just reload it

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:31.220 
shot if you want oops now just reload it
down<00:06:24.010> here

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.400 

now<00:06:32.230> that<00:06:33.060> shot<00:06:34.060> had<00:06:34.750> a<00:06:34.780> chance<00:06:35.080> to<00:06:35.260> actually

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
now that shot had a chance to actually

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.140 
now that shot had a chance to actually
land<00:06:35.710> on<00:06:35.890> the<00:06:35.980> top<00:06:36.190> of<00:06:36.340> this<00:06:36.430> ladder<00:06:36.700> so<00:06:37.090> you

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
land on the top of this ladder so you

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.170 
land on the top of this ladder so you
can<00:06:37.330> just<00:06:37.360> place<00:06:37.660> a<00:06:37.690> block<00:06:37.960> here<00:06:38.940> lucky<00:06:39.940> it<00:06:40.060> did

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
can just place a block here lucky it did

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.770 
can just place a block here lucky it did
in<00:06:40.270> that<00:06:40.420> time<00:06:41.850> and<00:06:42.850> you<00:06:43.030> can<00:06:43.180> just<00:06:43.330> load<00:06:43.750> it

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
in that time and you can just load it

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.770 
in that time and you can just load it
from<00:06:43.990> down<00:06:44.170> here<00:06:46.290> who<00:06:47.290> get<00:06:48.220> rid<00:06:48.340> of<00:06:48.370> a<00:06:48.490> water

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
from down here who get rid of a water

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.370 
from down here who get rid of a water
sorry<00:06:49.780> I<00:06:49.840> still<00:06:50.050> have<00:06:50.200> another<00:06:50.380> one<00:06:51.960> so<00:06:52.960> now<00:06:53.260> it

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
sorry I still have another one so now it

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.260 
sorry I still have another one so now it
can't<00:06:53.620> hop<00:06:53.770> this<00:06:54.010> way<00:06:54.070> and<00:06:54.700> you<00:06:55.030> have<00:06:55.120> two

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
can't hop this way and you have two

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.120 
can't hop this way and you have two
shots<00:06:55.570> going<00:06:55.900> right<00:06:56.170> around<00:06:56.320> the<00:06:56.560> same<00:06:56.740> spot

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
shots going right around the same spot

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.310 
shots going right around the same spot
for<00:06:57.160> a<00:06:57.580> diagonal<00:06:58.240> cannon<00:06:58.600> so<00:06:58.900> that<00:06:59.080> will<00:06:59.170> hit

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
for a diagonal cannon so that will hit

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.490 
for a diagonal cannon so that will hit
two<00:06:59.500> different<00:06:59.770> spots<00:06:59.950> which<00:07:00.520> is<00:07:00.730> nice<00:07:01.090> for

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
two different spots which is nice for

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.410 
two different spots which is nice for
taking<00:07:02.500> out<00:07:02.620> a<00:07:02.650> larger<00:07:03.040> area<00:07:03.210> because<00:07:04.210> of<00:07:04.240> that

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.420 
taking out a larger area because of that

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.470 
taking out a larger area because of that
little<00:07:04.570> extra<00:07:05.490> randomness<00:07:06.490> of<00:07:06.910> the<00:07:06.970> spread

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:07.480 
little extra randomness of the spread

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.080 
little extra randomness of the spread
and<00:07:09.780> that's<00:07:10.780> mostly<00:07:11.410> it<00:07:11.580> at<00:07:12.580> least<00:07:12.820> for<00:07:13.030> this

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
and that's mostly it at least for this

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.500 
and that's mostly it at least for this
ladder<00:07:13.420> we<00:07:14.050> can<00:07:14.610> the<00:07:15.610> last<00:07:15.850> thing<00:07:16.090> we<00:07:16.210> could<00:07:16.330> do

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510 
ladder we can the last thing we could do

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.350 
ladder we can the last thing we could do
is<00:07:17.640> we<00:07:18.640> change<00:07:19.090> into<00:07:19.300> a<00:07:19.360> slab<00:07:21.060> and<00:07:22.060> this<00:07:22.240> is

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
is we change into a slab and this is

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.940 
is we change into a slab and this is
dirt<00:07:22.540> you<00:07:23.050> dig<00:07:23.260> out<00:07:23.380> dirt<00:07:23.650> here<00:07:23.920> and<00:07:25.800> you<00:07:26.800> can

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:26.950 
dirt you dig out dirt here and you can

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.210 
dirt you dig out dirt here and you can
fire<00:07:27.160> it<00:07:27.190> straighter<00:07:28.230> nice<00:07:29.230> straight<00:07:29.560> shot<00:07:29.860> I

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.950 

like<00:07:33.220> loading<00:07:33.520> from<00:07:33.790> here<00:07:34.330> and<00:07:34.600> at<00:07:34.690> the<00:07:34.810> edges

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
like loading from here and at the edges

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.600 
like loading from here and at the edges
of<00:07:35.170> these<00:07:35.470> blocks<00:07:37.380> do<00:07:38.380> it<00:07:38.500> all<00:07:38.650> from<00:07:38.890> standing

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
of these blocks do it all from standing

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.420 
of these blocks do it all from standing
in<00:07:39.730> one<00:07:39.910> position<00:07:42.480> and<00:07:43.480> that's<00:07:44.130> hit<00:07:45.130> it<00:07:45.250> too

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430 
in one position and that's hit it too

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.780 
in one position and that's hit it too
late<00:07:45.640> but<00:07:46.830> they<00:07:47.830> both<00:07:47.980> want<00:07:48.250> to<00:07:48.310> landed<00:07:48.610> right

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:48.790 
late but they both want to landed right

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.170 
late but they both want to landed right
where<00:07:48.820> that<00:07:48.970> one<00:07:49.270> was<00:07:49.480> and<00:07:50.550> that's<00:07:51.550> what<00:07:52.000> a

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.180 
where that one was and that's what a

00:07:52.180 --> 00:08:00.000 
where that one was and that's what a
slab<00:07:52.600> can<00:07:53.320> do<00:07:57.090> so<00:07:58.380> hope<00:07:59.380> you<00:07:59.500> like<00:07:59.650> this<00:07:59.860> video

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.010 
slab can do so hope you like this video
