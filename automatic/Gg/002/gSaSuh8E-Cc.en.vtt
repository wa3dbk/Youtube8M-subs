long-range firing is viable however it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.189

be<00:00:31.320> patient<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:31.980> your<00:00:32.189> shots<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> most

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
be patient with your shots but the most

interesting<00:00:33.750> thing<00:00:33.899> about<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> weapon<00:00:34.440> is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
interesting thing about the weapon is

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.860 
interesting thing about the weapon is
his<00:00:34.710> crit<00:00:35.010> potential<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> 20%<00:00:36.120> crit<00:00:36.690> chance

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
his crit potential as a 20% crit chance

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.500 
his crit potential as a 20% crit chance
base<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> 2.0<00:00:38.100> multiplier<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:39.239> even

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
base and a 2.0 multiplier now even

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
base and a 2.0 multiplier now even
though<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> lot<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.200> damage<00:00:40.530> potential

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
though this is a lot of damage potential

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.380 
though this is a lot of damage potential
I<00:00:41.040> didn't<00:00:41.309> think<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> Crypt<00:00:41.760> bill<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.120> viable

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I didn't think the Crypt bill was viable

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.459 
I didn't think the Crypt bill was viable
on<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> because<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.230> being<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
on it because of it being a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
on it because of it being a
semi-automatic<00:00:44.010> single-shot<00:00:44.610> firing<00:00:45.059> weapon

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
semi-automatic single-shot firing weapon

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.119 
semi-automatic single-shot firing weapon
and<00:00:45.660> even<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.170> put<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> maxed<00:00:47.010> out

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and even if you put on a maxed out

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.619 
and even if you put on a maxed out
pistol<00:00:47.579> gamut<00:00:47.850> mod<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.239> only<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
pistol gamut mod you can only get the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.049 
pistol gamut mod you can only get the
crit<00:00:48.899> chance<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> 44%<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.670> after<00:00:50.910> some

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
crit chance up to 44% but after some

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.459 
crit chance up to 44% but after some
further<00:00:51.210> testing<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.809> seemed<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> crit

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
further testing it seemed that the crit

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.170 
further testing it seemed that the crit
chance<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:52.860> viable<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.699> appeared<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
chance was viable because it appeared I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
chance was viable because it appeared I
was<00:00:54.270> winning<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:54.660> Daryl's<00:00:55.079> than<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
was winning more Daryl's than not and I

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.830 
was winning more Daryl's than not and I
was<00:00:55.890> also<00:00:56.219> seeing<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.520> crazy<00:00:56.940> numbers<00:00:57.629> like

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
was also seeing some crazy numbers like

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.290 
was also seeing some crazy numbers like
over<00:00:58.109> 10k<00:00:58.649> damage<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> headshot<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
over 10k damage with a headshot but the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.819 
over 10k damage with a headshot but the
obvious<00:01:00.600> drawback<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.289> running<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> crit

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
obvious drawback about running the crit

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.560 
obvious drawback about running the crit
damage<00:01:01.949> build<00:01:02.340> over<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> regular<00:01:03.000> top<00:01:03.210> damage

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
even when not critic so even though it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
even when not critic so even though it
has<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> bit<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.450> damage<00:01:24.840> laws<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.290> gives<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
has a bit of a damage laws it gives the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.410 
has a bit of a damage laws it gives the
Lex<00:01:25.950> prime<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> late-game<00:01:26.820> into<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
Lex prime more of a late-game into the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
Lex prime more of a late-game into the
longer<00:01:27.810> missions<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.829> other<00:01:28.920> words<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
longer missions so in other words this

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.980 
longer missions so in other words this
weapon<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.670> basically<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.210> crit<00:01:30.509> or<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.810> home

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
weapon is basically go crit or go home

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.899 
weapon is basically go crit or go home
because<00:01:31.320> his<00:01:31.409> base<00:01:31.680> damage<00:01:31.710> alone<00:01:32.369> does<00:01:32.670> not

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
because his base damage alone does not

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.219 
because his base damage alone does not
compare<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> some<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.659> other<00:01:33.810> top-tier

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
compare to some of the other top-tier

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.600 
compare to some of the other top-tier
secondaries<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> game<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> mayor

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
secondaries in the game like the mayor

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.550 
secondaries in the game like the mayor
lock<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> brac<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> fact<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
lock or the brac but the fact that the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.410 
lock or the brac but the fact that the
potential<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> still<00:01:38.700> recommend<00:01:39.060> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
potential is there I still recommend it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.700 
potential is there I still recommend it
and<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.900> still<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> lot<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.320> fun<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> use

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and it's still a lot of fun to use

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
and it's still a lot of fun to use
alright<00:01:41.670> guys<00:01:41.820> let's<00:01:42.030> talk<00:01:42.119> about<00:01:42.180> I'm<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
alright guys let's talk about I'm on a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
alright guys let's talk about I'm on a
tower<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.079> formal<00:01:43.470> ex-prime<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.460> first

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
tower for formal ex-prime and I'm first

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.670 
tower for formal ex-prime and I'm first
just<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.970> go<00:01:45.119> over<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> polarities<00:01:45.899> for

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
just gonna go over the polarities for

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.289 
just gonna go over the polarities for
the<00:01:46.770> weapon<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.250> weapon<00:01:47.520> did<00:01:47.700> come<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.119> V

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the weapon this weapon did come with a V

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.749 
the weapon this weapon did come with a V
polarity<00:01:48.750> slot<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> top<00:01:50.189> left<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
polarity slot it was in the top left and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.940 
polarity slot it was in the top left and
I<00:01:50.790> moved<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> bottom<00:01:51.869> left<00:01:52.079> added<00:01:52.770> two

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
I moved it to the bottom left added two

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.889 
I moved it to the bottom left added two
more<00:01:52.979> V's<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> two<00:01:53.939> dashes<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
more V's and two dashes and that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.139 
more V's and two dashes and that
completed<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> build<00:01:55.950> after<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:57.030> though

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
completed the build after that though

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.700 
completed the build after that though
for<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.360> core<00:01:57.570> mods<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.380> horn

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
for the core mods is going to be horn

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350 
for the core mods is going to be horn
strike<00:01:59.009> lethal<00:01:59.490> torrent<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.880> barrel

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
strike lethal torrent and barrel

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.030 
strike lethal torrent and barrel
diffusion<00:02:00.869> these<00:02:01.079> are<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.439> raw<00:02:01.680> damage

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
diffusion these are just your raw damage

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
diffusion these are just your raw damage
mods<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.509> crit<00:02:03.780> build

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
mods and then because it's a crit build

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.620 
mods and then because it's a crit build
you<00:02:04.740> want<00:02:04.920> pistol<00:02:05.250> gammas<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> crit<00:02:06.390> chance

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
you want pistol gammas for a crit chance

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.419 
you want pistol gammas for a crit chance
and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.020> turret<00:02:07.229> cracker<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.979> crit<00:02:08.220> damage

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and then turret cracker for crit damage

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.170 
and then turret cracker for crit damage
now<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.239> one<00:02:09.450> may<00:02:09.660> seem<00:02:09.929> obvious<00:02:10.170> but

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
now this one may seem obvious but

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.000 
now this one may seem obvious but
usually<00:02:12.180> with<00:02:12.330> secondaries

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
usually with secondaries

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.589 
usually with secondaries
actually<00:02:14.370> gives<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.670> less<00:02:14.909> damage<00:02:15.269> because

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
actually gives you less damage because

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.149 
actually gives you less damage because
of<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.870> either<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.349> multiplier<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.799> too<00:02:16.950> low

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
of the either the multiplier is too low

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.009 
of the either the multiplier is too low
or<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.879> not<00:02:18.000> viable<00:02:18.269> because<00:02:18.450> crit<00:02:18.900> chance

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
or it's not viable because crit chance

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.199 
or it's not viable because crit chance
too<00:02:19.319> low<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> Lexx<00:02:20.579> Prime<00:02:20.849> has<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
too low but because the Lexx Prime has a

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.170 
too low but because the Lexx Prime has a
2.0<00:02:21.720> multiplier<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.500> has<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.980> 20%<00:02:23.280> crit<00:02:23.939> chance

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
2.0 multiplier and has a 20% crit chance

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.020 
2.0 multiplier and has a 20% crit chance
which<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.170> decent<00:02:25.379> enough<00:02:25.769> it's<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.610> viable

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
which is decent enough it's it's viable

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.009 
which is decent enough it's it's viable
on<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.180> weapon<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.510> that's<00:02:27.629> actually<00:02:27.959> how

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
on the weapon and that's actually how

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.539 
on the weapon and that's actually how
you<00:02:28.049> get<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.349> big<00:02:28.530> damage<00:02:28.829> spike<00:02:29.280> on

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
you get the big damage spike on

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.699 
you get the big damage spike on
especially<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.659> headshots<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.440> over

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
especially the headshots like the over

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.550 
especially the headshots like the over
10k<00:02:32.250> crits<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.909> you'll<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.269> sometimes<00:02:33.750> so

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
10k crits that you'll see sometimes so

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.229 
10k crits that you'll see sometimes so
that's<00:02:34.590> how<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.010> works<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.879> basically

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
that's how that works and then basically

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.369 
that's how that works and then basically
after<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.569> I've<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:36.959> combined<00:02:37.290> two

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
after that I've just combined two

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.229 
after that I've just combined two
different<00:02:37.709> elements<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.970> different

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
different elements on the different

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.149 
different elements on the different
factions<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:40.230> which<00:02:40.440> works<00:02:40.709> best<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.069> I'm

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
factions like which works best so I'm

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.470 
factions like which works best so I'm
just<00:02:41.280> gonna<00:02:41.430> walk<00:02:41.730> through<00:02:41.909> that<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.299> and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
just gonna walk through that now and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.110 
just gonna walk through that now and
explain<00:02:42.720> why<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:44.099> this<00:02:44.370> one<00:02:44.549> trigger<00:02:44.909> near

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
explain why so this one trigger near

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.880 
explain why so this one trigger near
basically<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.079> Grenier<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.409> you<00:02:46.739> want

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
basically on in Grenier is you want

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.009 
basically on in Grenier is you want
radiation<00:02:47.459> first<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:48.329> that's<00:02:48.480> electric<00:02:48.870> and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
radiation first so that's electric and

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.229 
radiation first so that's electric and
fire<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.799> basically<00:02:50.190> works<00:02:50.909> against

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
fire and this basically works against

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.660 
fire and this basically works against
alloyed<00:02:51.720> armored<00:02:52.200> enemies<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.400> elite

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
alloyed armored enemies so like elite

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.770 
alloyed armored enemies so like elite
Lancers<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.389> Raiders

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
bombur's named Nate Palmer's like stuff

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.259 
bombur's named Nate Palmer's like stuff
like<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.250> if<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.400> procs<00:02:59.700> it'll<00:03:00.030> proc

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
like that and if it procs it'll proc

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.910 
like that and if it procs it'll proc
like<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> radiation<00:03:00.989> effect<00:03:01.290> which<00:03:01.500> will<00:03:01.709> make

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
like a radiation effect which will make

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.949 
like a radiation effect which will make
the<00:03:02.040> confusion<00:03:02.609> kind<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:02.909> like<00:03:03.060> mixes<00:03:03.540> chaos

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the confusion kind of like mixes chaos

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.649 
the confusion kind of like mixes chaos
power<00:03:04.260> but<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:05.670> weapon<00:03:05.970> doesn't<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.359> mean<00:03:06.510> it

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
power but this weapon doesn't I mean it

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.390 
power but this weapon doesn't I mean it
has<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.079> decent<00:03:07.409> status<00:03:07.799> chance<00:03:08.010> but<00:03:08.250> it

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
has like a decent status chance but it

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.610 
has like a decent status chance but it
won't<00:03:08.579> prague<00:03:08.849> very<00:03:09.180> often<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:10.109> really

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
won't prague very often so don't really

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.050 
won't prague very often so don't really
count<00:03:10.799> on<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.129> it's<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.400> really<00:03:11.670> here<00:03:11.909> for

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
count on that it's just really here for

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.089 
count on that it's just really here for
the<00:03:12.150> damage<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:13.139> then<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.470> pathogen

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
the damage and then I have pathogen

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.129 
the damage and then I have pathogen
rounds<00:03:14.430> which<00:03:14.579> is<00:03:14.760> poison<00:03:15.540> damage<00:03:15.659> on<00:03:15.870> its<00:03:16.019> own

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
rounds which is poison damage on its own

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.129 
rounds which is poison damage on its own
and<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:16.409> will<00:03:16.670> do<00:03:17.670> 25%<00:03:18.120> extra<00:03:18.599> damage<00:03:18.959> to

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
and this will do 25% extra damage to

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.830 
and this will do 25% extra damage to
ferry<00:03:19.530> Armand<00:03:20.010> units<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.459> like<00:03:21.359> Lancers<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
ferry Armand units so like Lancers and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.569 
ferry Armand units so like Lancers and
troopers<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.709> heavy<00:03:22.859> gunners<00:03:23.099> stuff<00:03:23.400> like

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
troopers and heavy gunners stuff like

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.250 
troopers and heavy gunners stuff like
that<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.510> that's<00:03:24.690> how<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.900> works

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
that so that's how that works

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.369 
that so that's how that works
moving<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.980> corpus<00:03:26.400> Oh<00:03:26.579> corpus<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.540> combo

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
moving on to corpus Oh corpus the combo

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.110 
moving on to corpus Oh corpus the combo
you<00:03:28.500> want<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.829> magnetic<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.970> will

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
you want is magnetic and this will

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.390 
you want is magnetic and this will
damage<00:03:30.299> their<00:03:30.720> shields<00:03:31.199> and<00:03:31.379> that<00:03:32.280> is

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
damage their shields and that is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.490 
damage their shields and that is
electric<00:03:32.879> and<00:03:33.060> ice<00:03:33.780> will<00:03:34.079> give<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.349> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
electric and ice will give you the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.439 
electric and ice will give you the
magnetic<00:03:34.829> combo<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.669> then<00:03:35.819> after<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.269> you

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
magnetic combo and then after that you

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.539 
magnetic combo and then after that you
want<00:03:36.690> toxic<00:03:37.139> damage<00:03:37.319> because<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.220> will<00:03:38.400> just

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
want toxic damage because this will just

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.670 
want toxic damage because this will just
give<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.139> multipliers<00:03:40.139> against<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.500> flesh

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
give you multipliers against the flesh

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.039 
give you multipliers against the flesh
units<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.220> also<00:03:41.790> toxic<00:03:42.150> damage<00:03:42.599> alone<00:03:42.840> will

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
units and also toxic damage alone will

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.990 
units and also toxic damage alone will
go<00:03:43.199> through<00:03:43.560> shields<00:03:44.040> before<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.489> magnetic

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
go through shields before the magnetic

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.210 
go through shields before the magnetic
even<00:03:45.500> destroys<00:03:46.500> us<00:03:46.620> completely<00:03:47.099> so<00:03:47.190> you

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
even destroys us completely so you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.189 
even destroys us completely so you
already<00:03:47.489> get<00:03:47.790> some<00:03:48.000> damage<00:03:48.239> in<00:03:48.540> before<00:03:48.930> other

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
already get some damage in before other

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.750 
already get some damage in before other
shields<00:03:49.650> are<00:03:49.769> down<00:03:49.919> type<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.400> thing<00:03:50.549> that's

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
shields are down type of thing that's

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.939 
shields are down type of thing that's
why<00:03:50.879> that<00:03:51.090> works<00:03:51.299> really<00:03:51.510> well<00:03:51.859> after<00:03:52.859> that

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
why that works really well after that

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.129 
why that works really well after that
for<00:03:53.129> infested<00:03:53.730> basically<00:03:54.480> what<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:54.690> want<00:03:54.930> is

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
for infested basically what you want is

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.800 
for infested basically what you want is
corrosive<00:03:55.680> because<00:03:56.250> corrosive<00:03:56.730> does<00:03:57.000> great

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
corrosive because corrosive does great

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.420 
corrosive because corrosive does great
damage<00:03:58.079> against<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.680> ancients<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.280> that's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
damage against the ancients and that's

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.979 
damage against the ancients and that's
electric<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.090> poison<00:04:00.510> will<00:04:00.629> give<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.840> that

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
electric and poison will give you that

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.890 
electric and poison will give you that
and<00:04:01.199> then<00:04:02.099> fire<00:04:02.819> damage<00:04:03.150> on<00:04:03.299> its<00:04:03.449> own<00:04:03.629> will

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
and then fire damage on its own will

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.300 
and then fire damage on its own will
give<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.139> multipliers<00:04:04.590> against<00:04:04.889> all<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
give you multipliers against all the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.939 
give you multipliers against all the
other<00:04:05.340> units<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.569> faction<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.199> if<00:04:07.829> the

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
other units in the faction and if the

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.610 
other units in the faction and if the
procs<00:04:08.250> it'll<00:04:08.730> also<00:04:09.419> do<00:04:10.049> like<00:04:10.229> a<00:04:10.260> damage

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
procs it'll also do like a damage

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.979 
procs it'll also do like a damage
overtime<00:04:10.799> effect<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.609> and<00:04:12.389> fear<00:04:12.690> them<00:04:12.870> as

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
overtime effect and and fear them as

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.360 
overtime effect and and fear them as
well<00:04:13.139> but<00:04:13.260> again<00:04:13.379> don't<00:04:13.709> don't<00:04:14.040> really<00:04:14.190> count

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
well but again don't don't really count

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.589 
well but again don't don't really count
on<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.489> because<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.849> low<00:04:14.879> status<00:04:15.389> chance

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
on that because the low status chance

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.659 
on that because the low status chance
after<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.709> for<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.919> voids<00:04:17.159> though<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.549> you

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
after that for the voids though all you

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.020 
after that for the voids though all you
got<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.909> do<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.269> just<00:04:18.539> slide<00:04:19.139> this<00:04:19.349> over<00:04:19.620> and

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
got to do is just slide this over and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.879 
got to do is just slide this over and
then<00:04:21.109> for<00:04:22.109> actually<00:04:22.380> know<00:04:22.469> that<00:04:22.500> that's

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
then for actually know that that's

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.920 
then for actually know that that's
actually<00:04:23.159> wrong<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:24.419> leave<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.780> there

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
actually wrong you you leave that there

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.240 
actually wrong you you leave that there
and<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.200> put<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.469> Deep<00:04:25.650> Freeze<00:04:25.680> there

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
and you put the Deep Freeze there

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.950 
and you put the Deep Freeze there
because<00:04:26.520> what<00:04:26.789> that<00:04:26.820> will<00:04:27.060> basically<00:04:27.150> do<00:04:27.539> is

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
because what that will basically do is

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.230 
because what that will basically do is
give<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.229> corrosive<00:04:28.860> damage<00:04:29.220> which<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:29.940> good

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
give you corrosive damage which is good

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.059 
give you corrosive damage which is good
against<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.960> ferret<00:04:31.410> army<00:04:31.650> unit<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:31.949> the

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
against the ferret army unit so the

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.590 
against the ferret army unit so the
heavy<00:04:32.220> gunners<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.819> why<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.000> have<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.419> on

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
heavy gunners is why you have that on

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.510 
heavy gunners is why you have that on
and<00:04:33.840> then<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:34.590> deep<00:04:34.770> freeze<00:04:35.039> is<00:04:35.250> for<00:04:35.400> the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
and then a deep freeze is for the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.059 
and then a deep freeze is for the
shielded<00:04:36.090> targets<00:04:36.930> in<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.319> voids<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.830> that's

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
shielded targets in the voids and that's

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:38.719 
shielded targets in the voids and that's
how<00:04:38.220> it's<00:04:38.370> gonna<00:04:38.430> work

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
how it's gonna work

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.339 
how it's gonna work
and<00:04:38.940> that's<00:04:39.569> it<00:04:39.750> guys<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.139> easy<00:04:40.610> simple<00:04:41.610> build

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
and that's it guys so easy simple build

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.020 
and that's it guys so easy simple build
it<00:04:43.349> but<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:43.830> works<00:04:44.009> great<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.340> feel<00:04:44.699> this<00:04:44.819> is<00:04:44.940> the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
it but it works great I feel this is the

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.850 
it but it works great I feel this is the
best<00:04:45.270> way<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.479> build<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.470> last<00:04:46.650> thing<00:04:46.800> I

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
best way to build it the last thing I

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.770 
best way to build it the last thing I
want<00:04:47.009> to<00:04:47.069> mention<00:04:47.220> too<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.729> have<00:04:47.940> tried<00:04:48.630> out

want to mention too is I have tried out

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.420 
want to mention too is I have tried out
a<00:04:48.810> bill<00:04:49.110> with<00:04:49.289> just<00:04:49.590> pistol<00:04:49.979> gamma<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.340> not

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430

a bill with just pistol gamma and not
the<00:04:50.580> tart<00:04:50.789> cracker<00:04:51.259> and<00:04:52.259> basically<00:04:52.530> putting

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
the tart cracker and basically putting

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.920 
the tart cracker and basically putting
on<00:04:52.949> like<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.160> faction<00:04:53.699> mod<00:04:53.880> or<00:04:54.210> another<00:04:54.479> element

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
on like a faction mod or another element

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.960 
on like a faction mod or another element
and<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.470> will<00:04:55.740> get<00:04:55.889> less<00:04:56.099> damage<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.699> way<00:04:56.910> so

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
and you will get less damage that way so

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.390 
and you will get less damage that way so
I<00:04:57.479> have<00:04:58.050> tested<00:04:58.500> all<00:04:58.680> this<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.069> believe<00:04:59.310> it<00:04:59.370> or

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
I have tested all this and believe it or

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.310 
I have tested all this and believe it or
not<00:04:59.490> like<00:04:59.550> tart<00:04:59.940> cracker<00:05:00.180> does<00:05:00.599> work<00:05:00.930> on<00:05:01.169> this

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
not like tart cracker does work on this

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.379 
not like tart cracker does work on this
