and there are some important points to

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.130 
and there are some important points to
think<00:00:01.620> about<00:00:02.360> where<00:00:03.360> will<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.720> links<00:00:03.990> you're

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
think about where will the links you're

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.160 
think about where will the links you're
cutting<00:00:04.529> go<00:00:04.770> when<00:00:05.040> it<00:00:05.160> breaks<00:00:05.400> off<00:00:05.960> and<00:00:06.960> what

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
cutting go when it breaks off and what

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.690 
cutting go when it breaks off and what
will<00:00:07.290> happen<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.770> rest<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.250> tree<00:00:08.490> when
