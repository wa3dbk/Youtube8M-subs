and<00:00:05.890> this<00:00:06.490> is<00:00:06.700> the<00:00:06.880> new<00:00:07.029> black<00:00:07.689> diamond<00:00:08.350> shovel

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
and this is the new black diamond shovel

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.539 
and this is the new black diamond shovel
cold<00:00:09.040> the<00:00:09.280> 'back<00:00:10.500> they've<00:00:11.500> got<00:00:11.710> some<00:00:12.009> I<00:00:12.280> got

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
cold the 'back they've got some I got

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.119 
cold the 'back they've got some I got
something<00:00:12.849> going<00:00:13.030> on<00:00:13.120> here<00:00:13.360> ok<00:00:13.719> so<00:00:13.959> then<00:00:14.919> it

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
something going on here ok so then it

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.480 
something going on here ok so then it
comes<00:00:15.309> in<00:00:15.580> two<00:00:15.790> sizes<00:00:16.050> this<00:00:17.050> is<00:00:17.260> a<00:00:17.289> seven<00:00:18.010> liter

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
comes in two sizes this is a seven liter

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.410 
comes in two sizes this is a seven liter
blade<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:20.260> a<00:00:22.440> nine<00:00:23.440> liter<00:00:23.800> blade<00:00:24.270> see<00:00:25.270> the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
blade and a nine liter blade see the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.140 
blade and a nine liter blade see the
difference<00:00:25.780> here<00:00:25.960> in<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.260> size<00:00:26.640> leaders<00:00:27.640> Rees

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
difference here in the size leaders Rees

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.249 
difference here in the size leaders Rees
refers<00:00:29.020> to<00:00:29.050> volume<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.670> only<00:00:31.360> see<00:00:31.600> surface<00:00:31.990> area

here<00:00:32.410> but<00:00:32.590> BT<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:32.950> like<00:00:33.219> one<00:00:33.430> book<00:00:33.610> we<00:00:33.790> can<00:00:33.969> lift

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
here but BT is like one book we can lift

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.610 
here but BT is like one book we can lift
9<00:00:35.350> liters<00:00:36.070> of<00:00:36.280> snow<00:00:36.610> and<00:00:37.420> seven<00:00:37.930> layers<00:00:38.140> which

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
9 liters of snow and seven layers which

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.880 
9 liters of snow and seven layers which
is<00:00:38.890> real<00:00:39.960> bottom<00:00:40.960> line<00:00:40.990> they<00:00:41.500> have<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.620> big

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
is real bottom line they have a big

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.950 
is real bottom line they have a big
blade<00:00:42.130> and<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.910> medium<00:00:43.210> sized<00:00:43.480> plate<00:00:44.400> and<00:00:45.960> this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
blade and a medium sized plate and this

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
blade and a medium sized plate and this
blade<00:00:47.290> works<00:00:48.220> in<00:00:48.460> HO<00:00:48.700> mode<00:00:48.970> which<00:00:49.450> is<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.800> you

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
blade works in HO mode which is if you

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.860 
blade works in HO mode which is if you
got<00:00:51.130> to<00:00:51.220> move<00:00:51.310> a<00:00:51.430> lot<00:00:51.579> of<00:00:51.730> snow<00:00:51.910> you<00:00:52.360> want<00:00:52.750> a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
got to move a lot of snow you want a

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.479 
got to move a lot of snow you want a
snow<00:00:53.110> home<00:00:53.290> ok

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
snow home ok

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.420 
snow home ok
ideally<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.239> want<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.450> back<00:00:55.660> home<00:00:55.930> but<00:00:56.590> those

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
ideally you want a back home but those

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.340 
ideally you want a back home but those
are<00:00:57.579> pretty<00:00:57.760> heavy<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.630> this<00:00:58.780> is<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.079> next

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
are pretty heavy so this is the next

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.790 
are pretty heavy so this is the next
best<00:00:59.500> thing

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
best thing

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.039 
best thing
human<00:01:00.280> power<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:02.820> they<00:01:03.820> did<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.210> by<00:01:04.420> making<00:01:04.720> a

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
human power and they did it by making a

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.050 
human power and they did it by making a
really<00:01:05.409> solid<00:01:07.499> angle<00:01:08.499> here<00:01:08.829> by<00:01:09.429> instead<00:01:09.999> of

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
really solid angle here by instead of

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.450 
really solid angle here by instead of
doing<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.659> right<00:01:10.929> angle<00:01:11.380> which<00:01:12.069> is<00:01:12.249> what

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
doing a right angle which is what

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.580 
doing a right angle which is what
everyone<00:01:12.729> else<00:01:12.969> is<00:01:13.179> doing<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:14.020> right<00:01:14.229> angles

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
everyone else is doing and right angles

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.309 
everyone else is doing and right angles
are<00:01:14.740> really<00:01:15.130> prone<00:01:15.429> to<00:01:15.639> breaking<00:01:16.030> they<00:01:16.810> worked

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
are really prone to breaking they worked

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:25.349 
are really prone to breaking they worked
in<00:01:17.939> 245<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.909> awesome<00:01:23.249> then<00:01:24.249> works<00:01:25.119> like

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
in 245 that's awesome then works like

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:31.289 
in 245 that's awesome then works like
this<00:01:25.569> it's<00:01:26.020> straight<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.310> extend<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
this it's straight you can extend it so

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.789 
this it's straight you can extend it so
you've<00:01:31.689> got<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.869> really<00:01:32.259> long<00:01:32.859> blade<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:34.799> ease

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
you've got a really long blade for ease

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.090 
you've got a really long blade for ease
of<00:01:35.829> moving<00:01:36.399> a<00:01:36.459> lot<00:01:36.609> of<00:01:36.729> snow<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.889> can

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
of moving a lot of snow and then you can

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.389 
of moving a lot of snow and then you can
switch<00:01:39.999> pretty<00:01:40.479> easily<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:42.579> home<00:01:43.329> mode<00:01:44.399> like

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
switch pretty easily to home mode like

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.999 
switch pretty easily to home mode like
that<00:01:45.670> really<00:01:46.420> raking<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.899> lot<00:01:47.079> of<00:01:47.229> snow<00:01:47.439> which<00:01:47.859> i

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
that really raking a lot of snow which i

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.800 
that really raking a lot of snow which i
think<00:01:48.069> is<00:01:48.310> really<00:01:48.429> awesome<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:49.119> there's

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
think is really awesome and there's

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
think is really awesome and there's
another

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
another

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.570 
another
at<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.260> end<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.680> there's<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.130> little

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
at the end here there's this little

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:03.950 
at the end here there's this little
plastic<00:01:53.940> nut<00:01:54.570> either<00:01:55.850> turn<00:01:56.850> around<00:01:57.590> and<00:02:02.960> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
plastic nut either turn around and this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.370 
plastic nut either turn around and this
allows<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:05.520> put<00:02:05.729> any<00:02:06.060> salt<00:02:06.870> you<00:02:07.110> probably

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
allows you to put any salt you probably

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.020 
allows you to put any salt you probably
can't<00:02:07.619> see<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.950> from<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.250> distance<00:02:08.789> but

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
can't see it from this distance but

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.660 
can't see it from this distance but
there's<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> little<00:02:09.990> slot<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.009> then

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
there's a little slot in here and then

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.370 
there's a little slot in here and then
this<00:02:11.820> little<00:02:12.120> plastic<00:02:12.480> thing<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> could<00:02:13.200> put

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
this little plastic thing you could put

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.770 
this little plastic thing you could put
any<00:02:13.590> sawzall<00:02:14.340> blade<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.940> get<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.270> any

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
any sawzall blade we can get in any

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.940 
any sawzall blade we can get in any
hardware<00:02:16.740> store<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:18.230> there's<00:02:19.230> some<00:02:19.380> snow<00:02:19.680> pit

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
hardware store and there's some snow pit

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.670 
hardware store and there's some snow pit
or<00:02:20.220> maybe<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.550> need<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:21.470> unfortunately<00:02:22.470> maybe

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
or maybe you need to unfortunately maybe

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.800 
or maybe you need to unfortunately maybe
there's<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.070> an<00:02:23.580> Abbe<00:02:24.090> burial<00:02:24.450> you're<00:02:24.570> doing<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
there's a an Abbe burial you're doing a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.380 
there's a an Abbe burial you're doing a
rescue<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.530> there's<00:02:25.739> some<00:02:26.670> branches<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
rescue and there's some branches in the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.050 
rescue and there's some branches in the
way<00:02:27.510> with<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.020> saw<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.739> cut<00:02:28.920> away<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
way with the saw you can cut away the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.650 
way with the saw you can cut away the
branches<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.920> lot<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.610> times<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.000> can't<00:02:33.270> store

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
branches a lot of times you can't store

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.810 
branches a lot of times you can't store
it<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:35.459> your<00:02:35.520> pack<00:02:36.020> because<00:02:37.020> it's<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:38.040> too

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
it in your pack because it's just too

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.920 
it in your pack because it's just too
long<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.090> shorten<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:42.780> a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
long so you can shorten it up just a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.040 
long so you can shorten it up just a
little<00:02:42.959> bit<00:02:43.290> further<00:02:43.640> by<00:02:44.640> collapsing<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:48.050> on

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
little bit further by collapsing this on

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.660 
little bit further by collapsing this on
the<00:02:49.200> other<00:02:49.320> side<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.220> gets<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the other side so that just gets a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.660 
the other side so that just gets a
little<00:02:50.940> bit<00:02:51.150> shorter<00:02:51.270> still<00:02:51.959> which<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.890> it's

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
little bit shorter still which is it's

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.160 
little bit shorter still which is it's
gonna<00:02:53.790> make<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> difference<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.900> lot<00:02:55.110> of

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
gonna make a difference in a lot of

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.449 
gonna make a difference in a lot of
packs<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.620> terms<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.920> whether<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.100> get<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> in

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
packs in terms of whether you get it in

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.440 
packs in terms of whether you get it in
or<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.640> alright

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
or out alright

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.380 
or out alright
and<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:58.290> that's<00:02:58.440> new<00:02:58.680> Black<00:02:59.250> Diamond<00:02:59.549> evac
