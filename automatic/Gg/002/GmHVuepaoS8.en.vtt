00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.389 

my<00:00:48.239> case<00:00:48.510> was<00:00:48.690> right<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.110> 74<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.280> can

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
my case was right here at 74 you can

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:01.330 
my case was right here at 74 you can
speed<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.360> impatient

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:10.649 

turnout<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.460> because<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.480> when

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.030 

flashback

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.720 

ready<00:01:18.460> for<00:01:18.700> when<00:01:18.850> it's<00:01:18.970> about<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.210> start<00:01:21.690> and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
ready for when it's about to start and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.460 
ready for when it's about to start and
you're<00:01:24.730> gonna<00:01:24.850> want<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.090> save<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.840> pause<00:01:26.260> it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
you're gonna want to save it pause it

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.390 
you're gonna want to save it pause it
right<00:01:26.590> here<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.860> you're<00:01:30.010> going<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.160> all

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
right here and then you're going to all

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.310 
right here and then you're going to all
tap<00:01:30.670> out<00:01:30.990> find<00:01:31.990> your<00:01:32.200> folder

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
so all things get the it steam directory

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.560 
so all things get the it steam directory
steam<00:01:41.040> apps

I'll catch my global Offensive csgo and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.380 
I'll catch my global Offensive csgo and
replays<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.490> again<00:01:53.760> we'll<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:53.970> back<00:01:54.090> into<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
replays and again we'll go back into the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.540 
replays and again we'll go back into the
game

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.880

fallback<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.619> dust<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.250> then<00:02:10.760> you're

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
fallback for the dust and then you're

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.730 
fallback for the dust and then you're
going<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> want<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.270> get<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.570> demo<00:02:11.840> right<00:02:12.710> here

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
going to want to get the demo right here

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.990 
going to want to get the demo right here
the<00:02:13.010> match<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.550> save<00:02:13.790> it

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.770 

so<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.750> copy<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:20.080> right<00:02:20.380> there

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.480 

you<00:02:23.380> should<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.620> able<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.800> copy<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.190> paste<00:02:24.280> it

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
you should be able to copy and paste it

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.300 
you should be able to copy and paste it
right<00:02:24.520> in<00:02:24.790> here

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
right in here

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.170 
right in here
find<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.060> immediately

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.970 

and<00:02:30.269> then<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.079> I<00:02:31.109> yeah<00:02:31.530> when<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.709> have<00:02:31.859> it<00:02:31.920> all

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and then I I yeah when I have it all

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.459 
and then I I yeah when I have it all
neatly<00:02:32.250> sorted<00:02:32.730> out<00:02:32.879> obviously<00:02:33.420> csgo<00:02:34.049> demos

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
neatly sorted out obviously csgo demos

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.680 
neatly sorted out obviously csgo demos
for<00:02:34.739> your<00:02:34.859> highlights

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.950 

so<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.470> AAPIs<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:41.550> where<00:02:41.820> we<00:02:42.000> go

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
so the AAPIs is where we go

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.070 
so the AAPIs is where we go
and<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.500> highly<00:02:45.070> recommend<00:02:45.330> having<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.870> star

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
and I highly recommend having the star

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.630 
and I highly recommend having the star
tick<00:02:47.350> because<00:02:47.710> it's<00:02:48.010> going<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.220> be<00:02:48.280> very<00:02:48.460> hard

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
tick because it's going to be very hard

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.780 
tick because it's going to be very hard
to<00:02:48.670> memorize<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:51.070> just<00:02:51.250> get<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.610> tick

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
to memorize it so you just get the tick

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.320 
to memorize it so you just get the tick
from<00:02:52.030> in-game

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.800 

you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810
