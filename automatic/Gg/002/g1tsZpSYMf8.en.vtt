00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.340
 hello dragon city players how are 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.160
 I am diego an and I come to bring you the 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.740
 third part about the ancestral world 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.450
 as you know this we stay in that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.570
 He had called her fat and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.740
 obviously in the last chapter in the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.300
 drink I had a hard time 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.430
 pronounce but finally I can 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 pronounce then with her that is something 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.520
 I have a hard time but good 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.920
 we are here to get the 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.900
 resources needed to be able to finally 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.550
 can invoke hundred dragon that was something 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.140
 of scorpion at risk watching macro of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.610
 name very well 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.770
 but here I already have the resources 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.770
 needed to be able to bring it here to 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 this ancestral world and what I did already 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.550
 is to improve the topaz mine 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 since it is necessary to put it will look for the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.770
 fourth dragon but at once the best 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.769
 is correct when you hit and so 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.890
 now you do not need stamina to 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.059
 focus this course piercing piercing 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.589
 in the reader or scorpions is not 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.930
 needed the topaz nothing more with the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.510
 blue and I recommend that this one that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.979
 improve only the mines but with those 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.500
 improving the mines will save a lot 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.780
 platinum and good as you can see d'arthur 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 it takes a minute and video the video has 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.810
 helped a minute and I can leave 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.130
 I hope so let's wait for the minute 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.470
 I'm not going to advance 10 more than one 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.899
 minute who we are a minute a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.910
 prayer now does not compare so 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.580
 good guys can pass the video to 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.070
 let the minute pass and now we come back 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.110
 and good friends and spent the minute as 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.910
 we can say observe now we have here 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.100
 our friend piercing the king of the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.960
 scorpions to me I really love their 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.030
 design is very very father plus the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.530
 combination between red and black that are 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.180
 my favorite color combination 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.360
 good not with red but with blue 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.770
 but it makes it look great and good 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.140
 we can see the three elements that is the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.430
 ancient and on land at the end of the medium 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.980
 he does it to me 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.070
 but that they want to be land of 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.820
 truth not because you want and we can 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.360
 see that the upper 2 of the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.979
 right side of their habitat and good I've 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.810
 got the drink I want to share it with 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.840
 everyone that we do not find not only 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.550
 with those of face nothing more 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.970
 good here and we will see what 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.010
 says your description do not you think you 're 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.090
 these chains have appeared out of nowhere 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.470
 Piercings was held for pretending 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.260
 surprise again understand poison in 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.000
 flames what caused huge 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.129
 black clouds like with a thousand 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.030
 scorpions to help him get out of the 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.310
 prison that is his description is very 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.790
 father I liked in general I like 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.500
 the dragon can not deny it and well 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.150
 right now let's see how gives life 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.490
 platinum of 1 180 gives very good enough 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.030
 platinum 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.580
 and this 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.860
 and when their habitat is causes that 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.380
 media element and it sounds good to them 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.150
 saying with respect to the mines is 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.040
 I need to improve the mines 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.700
 so they give us they saw they give me two 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.700
 polished and four this 42 54 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.340
 and they are necessary to focus it 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.900
 obviously the next dragon already 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.740
 would have between the resources because I did not 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.680
 they ask in your passive 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.770
 polished but also the brute so I've 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.000
 brought from the mine directly but that 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.260
 I think I'll leave for the other 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.709
 video 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.879
 and here put 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.879
 two videos in a day 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.660
 so I recommend that if they go 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.570
 improving in the mines that is what they 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.740
 will help save platinum with that already 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.230
 that as you continue to swallow are more 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.030
 difficult of time because already having to 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.060
 the mines give them the diamonds 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.100
 polished then we do in an easy search 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.860
 of this for example they ask us three 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.940
 polished then to but the other one comes 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.620
 the red ones that are already 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.659
 this 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.040
 what are the following called those reds 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:01.010
 they are but the next polishing we are going to 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.319
 see what those reds are called are the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.659
 cigars that are not clean their balls I 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.940
 and my cops will be clean and like 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.800
 can you see Sarthou has platinum 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.500
 80 but 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.540
 to improve the 2,280 mine 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.590
 that it would be better to improve the mine or 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.510
 better produce things and convert them 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.460
 better just climb the mine this 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.800
 level but that's going to be little by little 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.150
 I believe that he is the swing is going to be a 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.130
 little complicated to get them 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.620
 but you remember the most important thing 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.070
 Now it's getting platinum and getting 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.110
 silver better in the mines and with that and him 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.670
 it's going to be a piece of cake to get it 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.830
 just as the other dragons remember 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.080
 first to get platinum with 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.090
 respect to produce improving the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.950
 mines the best option is obviously 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.870
 leveling the dragons 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.590
 let's see now nothing else I have 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.970
 evolved this I have level 2 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.150
 and I have enough to be able 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.650
 evolve this data ask us the the 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.260
 topaz so I will not be able to 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.620
 evolve and this one also asks topaz 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.800
 and others stole the rubies are 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.410
 the two polished villages clean landscapes 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.760
 but we are going to improve and this one is saved 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.070
 the east yes we are going to evolve a 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.900
 so we're going to fix it since 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.910
 they had not passed the demonstration because 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.220
 we are level in both but not 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.830
 you can record it but here it is for 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.430
 get on and to raise it to level 3 when 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.200
 to level 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.300
 3 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.430
 we are parents there was animation as it goes 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.530
 rising level and already with this in 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.289
 back closer more has it easier 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.419
 go improving 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.219
 so well guys I think this has 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.559
 been everything I hope you like it 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.479
 video mostly served subscribe 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:48.099
 they count closed like and we're 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.099
 watching until next time
