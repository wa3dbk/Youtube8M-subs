00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.450
 plan and again that fernandez this time 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.639
 to share a small tutorial 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.160
 I want to share something that my friend told me 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.630
 friend Ã¡lex to whom I thank you for this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 advice that is really giving me 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.500
 much result as you already know 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.330
 I was opening more than a million and a half 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.310
 in envelopes throughout the latter 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.310
 videos last weeks and it has touched me 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.680
 little and nothing that I have put together many 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 single gold players I have put together many 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 contracts and I've also put together many 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.949
 chemical basically what I want 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.130
 explain friends in the following and how 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.460
 are watching Acosta I sold it in 2100 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.370
 currencies the approximate cost of cost in 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.739
 the market is about 850 coins but 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.450
 as they see there the player who bought it already 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.930
 I 'm using it I sold it with 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.399
 approximately 60 contracts is with one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.750
 master chemistry which cost me acosta 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 I invested him to his 850 coins of value in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.420
 the market put some 900 more coins 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.440
 and I had an approximate cost of 1700 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 coins 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.320
 but we sold it to 2100 this is what 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 I want to explain and you who open 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.250
 envelopes and have several gold players 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.530
 they have many contracts and they have 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.590
 I advise you to do what 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.020
 next to be able to recover that silver 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.550
 dead we have in contracts for 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.010
 to be able to recover that dead silver that 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.530
 we have in chemistry is this that 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.620
 I explained to each player they add some 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.960
 60 contracts plus the extra percentage that 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.300
 we have for the dt and we also add 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.150
 a chemistry and we can recover very 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.030
 quickly this silver notice that coast 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.030
 It has an approximate value of 850 coins 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.640
 As I told you I sold it in 2100 seriously 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.270
 It has an approximate cost of 600 coins 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.539
 and I sold it in 1700 coins 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.020
 susaeta has an approximate cost of 600 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.420
 coins and I sold it in 1900 coins what 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.950
 same with candle watches in sail the case of 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.119
 candle also has an approximate cost 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.380
 of 6 thousand 800 coins plus the investment of 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.430
 900 coins 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.640
 would give me about 7 thousand 700 coins and what 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.220
 they sold 8 thousand 100 coins look at the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.180
 case of this lateral this side does not 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.810
 worth more than 800 coins plus investment 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.140
 that I told them about two contracts of 28 and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.829
 a chemistry would be worth about 1,700 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.810
 coins and I sold it in 2,300 coins and 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.810
 one of the cases that I gain the most 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.370
 he left was the next koscienly social and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.880
 I sold it with 60 contracts a chemistry of 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.760
 shade the cooking value is about 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.610
 7.600 coins plus what I add to it 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.900
 about 900 coins we would be in about 8 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:58.230
 thousand 500 coins and I sold it in 9 thousand 300 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.319
 friends coins I hope understood occasion
