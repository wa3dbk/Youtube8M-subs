00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.857
 I want my call. I love her. I love her. 

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:05.359
 I want my call. 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.194
 That is nice. 

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:13.534
 How many of your friends have I killed? 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.123
 I've been working on this for twenty years. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.501
 And I know the difference between idiots who need to learn manners ... 

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:25.254
 ... and phenomenons like you that would only enjoy it. 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.716
 And you've killed six of my friends. 

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.970
 Please. My insides hurt. 

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:34.555
 I'm not interested! Go back 

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:37.307
 The boss said he would make the voices go. 

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.894
 He said he would go inside and replace them with bright lights. 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.022
 Like Christmas! 

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:44.982
 You are crazy my friend. Go back! 

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:48.152
 A doctor immediately in the detention wing. Come on, open the door. 

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:50.362
 You back down! 

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:51.989
 Hey, we do not have much time. 

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:56.618
 They told me that only one of the two would survive. 

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:58.912
 And that they would allow our friends to choose. 

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.503
 All right, Rachel. It will come out well. 

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:08.756
 Everything will be fine. They will find you. 

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:12.885
 In agreement. I'll help you. Tell me what happens to you. 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.429
 &lt;i&gt; Can you find something sharp? &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:16.805
 I am trying. 

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.182
 What? 

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:20.351
 Harvey? 

00:01:24.646 --> 00:01:25.856
 Harvey, what's wrong? 

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.578
 All available units. Meet at 52, 250 Street. 

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:44.124
 Do you want to know why I use a knife? 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.669
 The guns are too fast. 

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:50.255
 You can not taste ... 

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:53.926
 ... the little emotions. 

00:01:56.428 --> 00:02:00.349
 You see, in his last moments ... 

00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:03.560
 ... people show you who they really are. 

00:02:04.978 --> 00:02:07.981
 So, in a certain way I know your friends ... 

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:10.109
 ... better than you did. 

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.990
 Do you want to know which of them were cowards? 

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:29.670
 - What is that? - He has a kind of contusion. 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.632
 I know you're going to enjoy this. I'm going to have to try ... 

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:35.676
 ... and enjoy it even more. 

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:46.979
 Quiet! Quiet! 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:52.985
 - Drop the weapon now! Let go! - Let go! Drop your weapon! 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.320
 - Sorry. - What does he want? 

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:58.532
 I just want my phone call. 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.829
 &lt;i&gt; What ... What's going on? &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.832
 Just talk to me for a second. 

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:11.086
 Very well. 

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.393
 Is that a ... phone? 

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:37.488
 Get on the path!
