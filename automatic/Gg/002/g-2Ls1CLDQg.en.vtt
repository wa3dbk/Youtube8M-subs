00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.729 
now i feel with the frustration with a
some<00:02:08.220> yeah<00:02:09.060> sure<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.229> nothing<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
some yeah sure you have nothing to

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.910 
some yeah sure you have nothing to
stream<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.610> be

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
stream and that can be

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.240 
stream and that can be
a little<00:02:12.310> bit<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:13.390> problem<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.830> but

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
a little bit of a problem for you but

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.640 
a little bit of a problem for you but
then<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.610> other<00:02:15.730> side<00:02:16.209> MLG<00:02:17.140> these<00:02:17.410> guys

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
then on the other side MLG these guys

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.280 
then on the other side MLG these guys
created<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.430> MiG<00:02:18.940> lead<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.599> pro<00:02:20.080> league

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
created the MiG lead the the pro league

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.620 
created the MiG lead the the pro league
they<00:02:20.680> created<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.190> two<00:02:21.370> case<00:02:21.670> they've<00:02:22.060> been

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
they created the two case they've been

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.540 
they created the two case they've been
in<00:02:22.810> charge<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.290> all<00:02:23.470> these<00:02:23.650> tournaments<00:02:24.099> so<00:02:24.520> I

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
in charge of all these tournaments so I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.350 
in charge of all these tournaments so I
think<00:02:24.819> it's<00:02:25.290> they<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.590> say<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:28.030> either

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
think it's they can say that you either

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.300 
think it's they can say that you either
stream<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:28.989> their<00:02:29.140> platform<00:02:29.380> or<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.010> can

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
stream it on their platform or you can

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.120 
stream it on their platform or you can
because<00:02:30.700> at<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.090> end<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.510> whole<00:02:31.690> story

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
because at the end of the whole story

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.309 
because at the end of the whole story
MLG<00:02:33.130> did<00:02:33.580> create<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> league<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.170> think

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
MLG did create the league so I think

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.130 
MLG did create the league so I think
they<00:02:35.709> have<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.610> ability<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.630> tell<00:02:37.870> pro

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
they have and the ability to tell pro

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.800 
they have and the ability to tell pro
players<00:02:38.470> if<00:02:38.830> they<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.700> stream<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.239> over<00:02:40.540> on<00:02:40.780> a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
players if they can stream it over on a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.259 
players if they can stream it over on a
different<00:02:41.200> platform<00:02:41.380> or<00:02:41.800> not<00:02:41.980> now<00:02:42.550> guys<00:02:42.910> make
