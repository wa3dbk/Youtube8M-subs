00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.040
 I was completely alone against two 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.040
 players but you just have to defend 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:29.070
 the player's bullets 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:32.129
 in 19 seconds to try to get 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.600
 the low to try to use it and what 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.800
 has legend that was deactivating the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.390
 bomb that I do not know if to end the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.580
 final 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 very well that 44 has done well for the 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.720
 paint game team very well targeted 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.489
 finally you have to know how to wake up after 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.000
 of having only achieved a low 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.700
 eight rounds in just eight against 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.079
 three players from the team schools 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.040
 there he will catch the first one not for now 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.860
 it is expected to know that there is someone 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.270
 disabled perfect played now by 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.739
 part of eight will be charged to the one who is 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.480
 disabled can be uploaded to the next 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.030
 there are other seconds left and it is loaded 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.570
 he's going to do it and he does it he does 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.119
 ochoa got the low and avoided that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.110
 deactivation is over this first 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.820
 round 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.440
 but I want to see the exxon saying 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.180
 a few more casualties there we have it 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.510
 returns to rate the status of cerberus 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.000
 point for them 14 to 21 difference 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.740
 right now of 7 points where they are finished 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.510
 to reappear now because he has scored 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.980
 of course now waiting for 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.570
 experience players appear 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.920
 that are reappearing all of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.330
 close UFOs that could have left it 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.620
 pass but if it goes ahead the first 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.640
 is also carried to the second could 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.740
 take the third one ahead 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.240
 get triple low for triple homex 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.890
 therefore to do behrouz stays 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.670
 no bullets softex will recognize 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.070
 elementary 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.410
 jae bum bum and some that you will 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.119
 the enemies because it always comes in handy and 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.259
 it looks very nice in a good match 30 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.509
 seconds ahead this is going to be 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.950
 specific victory of cerberus care 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.119
 that is to me it can be sneaked left when 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.890
 lewis are you alive has just reappeared 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.360
 the whole team knows that you know it 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.860
 he has to turn around a minute 50 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.180
 seconds ahead from behind the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.369
 she wolf team for only a little 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.750
 he knows he's going to get in the area 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.430
 reception does not see absolutely nobody 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.750
 You could put the tie by himself not 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.970
 have no close companion get 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.440
 end the prey appear the second 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.820
 any time I could put the 2 to 2 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.830
 on the scoreboard in videos that ends with 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.790
 already if there he gives me back and finish 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.800
 also with the video is going to try 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.540
 put displaced in the marker that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.350
 He has done me a round of applause for 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.860
 please wait for him 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.960
 but he just saved the flag of 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.070
 hexane player making it perfect 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.320
 because the team of experts that 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.970
 has just done Malaga now with that 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.320
 final jackson is going to get inside no 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.090
 get the low I finally think that without 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.130
 be has got to the end and they are going to 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.840
 do with this flag team 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 keep turning it will make good play of 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.830
 malagueÃ±o in him says four minutes no 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.700
 got worked you do not worry that 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.700
