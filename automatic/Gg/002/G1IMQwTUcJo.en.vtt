00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 we are now talking about development design 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:11.840
 of the design of this new s 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.840
 maurizio carbonaro d italy good morning 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.010
 how can you understand the latter? 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.449
 generation of sh had a goal more 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.730
 important to create the best 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.980
 possible evolution of what from 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.710
 over 10 years the best selling scooter in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.289
 italy in villa first thing we have 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.739
 made by analyzing what were i 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.800
 distinctive features of sh fin design 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.920
 since the distant 2001 especially for the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.410
 series 125 for the truth that happened and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.289
 7 has always been a product 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.719
 extremely simple modern elegant e 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.789
 very functional assisted one 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.370
 generation we wanted to add 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.399
 two important elements that are a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.890
 more refinement and a pinch of 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.260
 more sportiness that is not brazen but 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.450
 a little more sophisticated hga wanted for 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.210
 this sh like for all generations 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.729
 earlier than sh especially since 2001 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.070
 that the whole design was developed 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.990
 in the sale of Rome precisely because 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.820
 believes that it is an Italian product and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.810
 so he needs to have that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.229
 stability 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.210
 unfortunately possibility that I am here in 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.430
 Italy may have precisely because 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.290
 we knew this book well 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.689
 therefore an internal competition 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.759
 within the style center where they are 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.850
 an innumerable series have been developed 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.700
 of sketch here you see only a part e 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.870
 among these species this was chosen 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.330
 sketch one of my sketches 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.190
 defined the point as kiss kiss kiss 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.320
 that there simply because yes 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.360
 closer to those more 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.210
 compared to the other sketches to those who 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.550
 they were our initial elegance targets 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.190
 simplicity, of course, but not there 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.170
 reached full so below 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.650
 see what evolution has been 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.200
 of this who sketch thanks to the comments 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.930
 and the indications of the rent give 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.670
 along with the magic they explained 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.000
 but our headquarters in 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:18.660
 japan and also to the indications of a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.970
 of Italy directly through us 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.220
 passed gradually towards a more development 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.080
 or less elegant more or less sporty up 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.430
 to hit what was then 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.840
 decimated the file jokes is a species 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.180
 because it was the scooter 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.000
 the final version of the design and up 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.160
 which started the development of the model e 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.350
 then industrialization the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.440
 distinctive character of this plus 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.750
 there was above all in the continuity that 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.410
 we read between the front part that 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.290
 central and rear with the use of 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.320
 few lines but with a marked character e 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.209
 sophisticated surfaces we have succeeded in 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.660
 get an almost sculptural appearance 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.670
 all this indeed already very much the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.730
 feeling of quality that was ours 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.280
 main objective or obtain a 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.350
 qualitative leap visible almost as if 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.980
 this model belongs to one 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.980
 upper category 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.489
 of course we have not worked here 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.610
 only in the side view but I have it 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.500
 seen a bit like a model in all 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.940
 various views especially in that 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.500
 front 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.140
 this is because in recent years many 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.130
 competitors have taken as a reference the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.910
 sh a little too much reference and then 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.630
 the image 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.830
 how to say clearly original 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.390
 recognizable that it had in the past 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.740
 in recent years it has gone a little 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.510
 to get lost 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.640
 so we thought about revisiting the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.180
 further maintaining what were i 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.340
 fundamental points of the hÃ¨ 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.320
 we have introduced some changes and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.720
 new to them the first was in 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.670
 following the elimination of the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.290
 radiation in the front yes 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.640
 shows as I said before in the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.620
 rear 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.960
 we have how to say this introduced 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.150
 shield and work with surfaces 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.280
 they too even if sought after and 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.350
 especially these exclusions emphasizes 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.440
 this feeling of continuity that exists 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.420
 between front rear central part 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.130
 he too in which to say that these increases 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.620
 sensations in more sculptural places 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.960
 we also worked very hard 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.920
 also with regards to the face 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.280
 especially the one you recognize 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.010
 night time then working on the lights 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.050
 of position and following a little the last 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.280
 We have developed automotive trends 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:43.570
 in a very subtle vertical way 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.940
 to make this new image of 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.500
 extremely modern front end ed 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.970
 elegant 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.500
 here you can see how it was 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.840
 evolution over the last ten years 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.780
 where compared to previous models e 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.430
 they tried to maintain above all 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.890
 the last two generations of this one 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.860
 triangulation that exists between the lighthouse 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.600
 main and position lights then 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.430
 we have small details before 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.160
 as the front chrome is always 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.990
 was present especially in the last ones 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.820
 two generations of here then we have 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:24.220
 however worked in all the various 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.350
 seen as I told you I show it 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.730
 a sketch 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.990
 another important innovation always a 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.040
 following what was the goal 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.860
 main 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.580
 this feeling of more marked quality 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.970
 was to change the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.950
 traditional caesura line between the 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.729
 shell of the front shield and that 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.400
 rear 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.310
 as you can see we have moved the line to 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.890
 cut inside the part of the 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.750
 shield all this amplifies the 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.300
 feeling of quality because it is the part 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.979
 bodywork enters the interior 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:05.050
 of the shield from a feeling of 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:08.050
 higher finish here you can tell how 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.460
 all like we give in a family way 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.919
 of the front to the part 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:16.030
 superior with others a small one 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:18.669
 detail all this part around the 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.410
 pilot and in this whole part then 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.650
 surfaces were already touring and are 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.640
 slightly higher starting with 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.650
 instrumentation from the right 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.690
 this good to thematize the feeling of 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.890
 comfort have no critical point 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:35.530
 while in the front and in the 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.930
 held back of the curves a 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.360
 you can also see them here or more tense 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.470
 from institutions and dynamics in this 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.020
 percentage what that thin 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:50.160
 more sporty appearance 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.160
 that's all thank you
