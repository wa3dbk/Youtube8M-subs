as<00:00:51.449> important<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.500> year<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.340> he

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
as important this year so I think he

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
as important this year so I think he
pulls<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:54.059> well<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
pulls in really well if you want you to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
pulls in really well if you want you to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
get the chemistry style with boost pacer

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
get the chemistry style with boost pacer
defending<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.500> heading<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> him<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.579> overall
