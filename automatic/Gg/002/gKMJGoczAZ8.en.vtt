00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
into the slot just place firm pressure

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.969 
into the slot just place firm pressure
at<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.270> opening<00:02:03.630> until<00:02:04.200> those<00:02:04.380> firmly<00:02:04.740> rooted

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.430 
same method works for the video card
once<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.360> done<00:02:12.569> just<00:02:12.840> put<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> gate<00:02:13.260> back

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
once that's done just put the gate back

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.259 
once that's done just put the gate back
down<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.920> screw<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> video<00:02:14.640> card<00:02:14.849> bracket

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
pretty much flesh to the side panel so

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.920 
pretty much flesh to the side panel so
it's<00:02:20.790> getting<00:02:20.970> fresh<00:02:21.209> air<00:02:21.360> directly<00:02:21.629> through

be<00:03:47.459> careful<00:03:47.760> with<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:47.970> middle<00:03:48.269> piece<00:03:48.450> though

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
be careful with this middle piece though

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.720 
be careful with this middle piece though
as<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.440> plate<00:03:49.650> may<00:03:49.860> be<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.040> bit<00:03:50.220> sharp<00:03:50.550> where

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
as the plate may be a bit sharp where

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.000 
as the plate may be a bit sharp where
the<00:03:50.820> connection<00:03:51.060> was<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.140> would<00:03:52.530> highly

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
the connection was so I would highly

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.860 
the connection was so I would highly
recommend<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.700> not<00:03:53.940> give<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.269> plate<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.840> a

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
recommend you not give this plate to a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.259 
recommend you not give this plate to a
depressed<00:03:55.680> email<00:03:56.010> once<00:03:56.550> you<00:03:56.670> get<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.910> plastic

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
front panels I will let you know that

the<00:04:05.970> white<00:04:06.269> prodigy<00:04:06.750> front<00:04:06.989> panel<00:04:07.350> isn't<00:04:07.890> much

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
the white prodigy front panel isn't much

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.039 
the white prodigy front panel isn't much
like<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> black<00:04:08.610> one<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:09.209> there<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.750> bit

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
like the black one so there is a bit

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.900 
like the black one so there is a bit
less<00:04:10.230> air<00:04:10.410> flow<00:04:10.560> coming<00:04:10.830> in<00:04:11.010> but<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.580> panels

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
less air flow coming in but the panels

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.220 
less air flow coming in but the panels
are<00:04:12.060> fully<00:04:12.299> solvable<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:12.959> believe

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
are fully solvable and I believe

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.110 
are fully solvable and I believe
