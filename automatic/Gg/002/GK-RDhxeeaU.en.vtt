00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:08.460
 what is going on was called back fitness oskar 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.920
 with the last push days and exercise 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.740
 what could it be but tips 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.780
 I have a bit of my own here 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.660
 concept of four times four with the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.420
 same weight left to easy in 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.390
 Another nice time to get one 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.699
 From time to time I was practicing where I was 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.039
 weight again regularly with each set 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.039
 increase that was already the first 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.610
 do not warm up with any dish 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.470
 It was very easy for me 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.680
 however, for me it is an exercise in 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.020
 I'm pretty good and that's why 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.690
 if I put some weight on it now 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 so second sentence I do not know if 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.760
 we can recognize it below I have 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.450
 a ten kilo disc hangs and the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.289
 next sentence is carried out entirely 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.850
 nearly so far as it goes down could 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.100
 not further down because of these black ones 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.679
 ding comes alone shoulders and then 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.909
 not quite up but the poor ones 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.149
 Press ufas 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.639
 the chest and the triceps last in the 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.889
 to keep tension and the sentences are 

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:17.159
 always very short but for that they will 

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:21.060
 always heavier and the penultimate sentence 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.729
 I have the break both last 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.429
 Exercises kept as low as possible 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.200
 to the breast right again 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.760
 destroy goods with a good feeling 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.490
 to go home 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.500
 now I've hung with 20 kilos I 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.370
 I would have it quite normal 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.860
 See you soon 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.000
 I'll show you how I do it 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.229
 make the additional weights and will 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.229
 again penultimate sentence 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.670
 he could not do any more but he has to 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.500
 still overcome this exercise there is yes 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.870
 as you know measured on the belt 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.490
 can buy around 15 euros but that 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.100
 you do not need to be here i have 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.590
 in normal thin belt of h &amp; m 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.200
 or what do I know 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.300
 42 35 euro you also need a clue 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.310
 not very good is easy 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.830
 not running around made it so that he 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.150
 just stays with everyone 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.880
 any belt the dumbbell or the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.190
 weight washer just gets in between 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.540
 hanged it can unfortunately on the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.730
 picture does not recognize so well 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.460
 In any case, the weight comes between 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.600
 the belt here even three slices so 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.000
 30 kilo and belongs again to hang 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.330
 and then you are ready for 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 the next sentence when we do this exercise 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.670
 with so much weight we only perform 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.090
 so you can do six at a minimum 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.380
 Creating repetition then it is easy 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.160
 a power exercise that gives you a lot 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.110
 much power in advance a lot of power 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.150
 The result is always a lot of muscle 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.290
 and I put on again until 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.450
 fail with the last sentence so one 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.700
 calm down 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.000
 and accordingly very much mine 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.959
 some poor tense that's about to 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.959
 the coup day 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.640
 that was the last video the others 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.940
 you see videos left and right in the 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.310
 corner 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.989
 soon the polder will come you can 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.989
 Kraft clear up until next time people
