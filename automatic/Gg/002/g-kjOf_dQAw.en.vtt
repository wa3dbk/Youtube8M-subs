00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.550
 Welcome to another year of boxing this time. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.350
 we have a tablet was contained raisin 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.109
 ps thank you and it 's the 1 830 was 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.789
 stands out its processor is an intel 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.609
 atom and mite 1.6 giants in one 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.080
 nursery when 19th century and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.930
 ips technology and a revolution that I 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.050
 I think maybe it's a bit of a low 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.010
 will also create but let's see this has 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.180
 two cameras one front and one 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 5 megapixel rear and 2 has also 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.129
 one thing that I think is what goes 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.579
 to be 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.250
 you can up to 32 gb sport plus some 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.960
 transport marks 32 spots on 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:05.729
 windows so more inside the box 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:11.119
 with the tablet you have a battery and so 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.119
 we have what it takes to take care of the screen 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:27.890
 let 's not like the house if 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:41.579
 we have an instruction manual 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:47.130
 we also have the player is not 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:54.799
 so nothing special 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.799
 here's the cable and we'll see 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:11.240
 is no longer required in the list 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.050
 besides this is at most not to say 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.310
 that is question is that have no author goes 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.640
 that it is not just us that we have to adjust 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.640
 manually 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.550
 I do not like very much 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.050
 we have 30 gigs in the dropbox for six 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.070
 months are good for a person 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:38.950
 let's see how the ecca fact 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:43.970
 you can see the pixels is not is not so 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.870
 like other nursery schools but not 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.040
 I think it's not bad at all when 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 That 's how it's been a week, I'll go 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.580
 Latin test, let's see how the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.240
 sporting has several conditions under which 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:07.310
 keys matter how much the camera camera 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:10.239
 front and looking around it is part of 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.239
 low has nothing 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.730
 Also we do not have in theory will 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:28.250
 close to the svr of what should be the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:31.370
 here the power button that 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.680
 controls the man and which card entry 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.560
 micro SD 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:42.350
 let's see how the sporting if 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.350
 I wish some morals were in special 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.820
 leave in comments and I'll try 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.820
 analyze in more detail
