00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
but he's just not Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.140 
but he's just not Arnold Schwarzenegger
and<00:03:06.680> he's<00:03:06.860> not<00:03:07.040> trying<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.460> be<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.790> that's<00:03:07.940> one

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
and he's not trying to be and that's one

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.160

lore of this movie character motivations
are<00:04:54.440> odd<00:04:54.620> sometimes<00:04:55.280> things<00:04:55.610> just<00:04:55.760> kind<00:04:56.180> of

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
are odd sometimes things just kind of

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.970 
are odd sometimes things just kind of
fall<00:04:56.480> by<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.630> wayside<00:04:56.900> of<00:04:57.260> really<00:04:57.530> impressive

fall by the wayside of really impressive
action<00:04:58.130> sequences<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:58.970> that<00:04:59.060> was<00:04:59.180> really<00:04:59.330> my

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
action sequences and that was really my

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.420 
action sequences and that was really my
biggest<00:04:59.720> flaw<00:05:00.080> with<00:05:00.290> this<00:05:00.410> movie<00:05:00.800> was<00:05:01.250> the

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
biggest flaw with this movie was the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.940 
biggest flaw with this movie was the
script<00:05:01.790> some<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.389> the<00:05:02.450> plot<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:03.290> didn't<00:05:03.680> really

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
script some of the plot it didn't really

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.560 
script some of the plot it didn't really
mesh<00:05:04.250> all<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.669> time<00:05:04.850> it<00:05:05.030> seemed<00:05:05.270> sometimes

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
mesh all the time it seemed sometimes

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.879 
mesh all the time it seemed sometimes
like<00:05:05.900> characters<00:05:06.229> are<00:05:06.350> something<00:05:06.620> thrown

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
like characters are something thrown

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.070 
like characters are something thrown
