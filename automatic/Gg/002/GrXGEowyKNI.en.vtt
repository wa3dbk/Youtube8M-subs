00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
will move this section up now originally

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.390 
will move this section up now originally
there<00:02:01.730> was<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.910> tab<00:02:02.270> right<00:02:02.930> here<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:04.130> because

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
there was a tab right here but because

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.090 
there was a tab right here but because
of<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.610> design<00:02:05.000> flaw<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:06.200> tab<00:02:06.440> was<00:02:06.650> so<00:02:06.830> weak

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
of a design flaw the tab was so weak

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.010 
of a design flaw the tab was so weak
that<00:02:07.340> during<00:02:07.760> transformation<00:02:08.180> it<00:02:08.540> would<00:02:08.690> snap

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
that during transformation it would snap

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.980 
that during transformation it would snap
off<00:02:09.350> so<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.820> would<00:02:11.030> have<00:02:11.060> used<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.780> have<00:02:11.870> an

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.510 
off so you would have used to have an
awkward-looking<00:02:12.380> fireboat<00:02:13.070> somewhat<00:02:13.400> like

and since this is a diecast toy don't
expect<00:04:38.160> too<00:04:38.310> much<00:04:38.490> of<00:04:38.550> possibility<00:04:39.500> but<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.800> is

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
surprising it is more poseable than the

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.220 
surprising it is more poseable than the
old<00:04:48.240> band<00:04:48.530> igf-1<00:04:49.530> boundaries<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:52.380> definitely
