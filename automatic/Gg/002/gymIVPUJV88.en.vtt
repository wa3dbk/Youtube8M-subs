00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.140 

the<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.380> we<00:02:19.590> are<00:02:19.710> using<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:20.550> made<00:02:20.970> of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
the can we are using is actually made of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.600 
the can we are using is actually made of
aluminium<00:02:23.360> salt<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:25.170> know<00:02:25.410> it's<00:02:26.250> Tennessee

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.730 

tamarind<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:33.250> thing<00:02:34.290> which<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.470> don't

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
tamarind is this thing which I don't

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.760 
tamarind is this thing which I don't
want<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.280> remember<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.260> an

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
want you to remember it's just an

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.370 
want you to remember it's just an
organic<00:02:39.220> acid<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.340> we<00:02:42.640> can<00:02:42.790> easily<00:02:43.030> say<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.959> pH

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
organic acid so we can easily say the pH

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.160 
organic acid so we can easily say the pH
of<00:02:44.680> our<00:02:45.130> mixture<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.700> less<00:02:46.060> than<00:02:46.300> seven<00:02:46.660> which

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
of our mixture is less than seven which

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.930 
of our mixture is less than seven which
is<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.350> fancy<00:02:47.709> way<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.070> saying<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.670> our

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
is a fancy way of saying that our

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.990 
is a fancy way of saying that our
mixture<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.620> acidic<00:02:53.459> aluminium<00:02:54.459> has<00:02:54.700> these

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
mixture is acidic aluminium has these

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.240 
mixture is acidic aluminium has these
three<00:02:55.480> loosely<00:02:56.080> bound<00:02:56.230> electrons<00:02:56.830> which

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
three loosely bound electrons which

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.940 
three loosely bound electrons which
means<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:58.180> tends<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.660> lose<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.380> electrons

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
means it tends to lose this electrons

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.680 
means it tends to lose this electrons
and<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.050> does<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.850> leaves<00:03:04.360> it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
and so it does it here it leaves it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.580 
and so it does it here it leaves it
three<00:03:05.230> electrons<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.850> aluminum<00:03:07.480> foil<00:03:08.260> and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
three electrons in the aluminum foil and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.180 
three electrons in the aluminum foil and
then<00:03:09.130> comes<00:03:09.400> out<00:03:09.610> as<00:03:09.760> al<00:03:10.600> three<00:03:10.870> plus<00:03:10.900> into<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
then comes out as al three plus into the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.900 
then comes out as al three plus into the
mixture

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.920 

and<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.440> huge<00:03:18.190> number<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.660> al<00:03:19.660> three

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
and like this a huge number of al three

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.680 
and like this a huge number of al three
plus<00:03:19.960> comes<00:03:20.470> out<00:03:20.680> leaving<00:03:21.430> its<00:03:21.760> electrons<00:03:22.480> in

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
plus comes out leaving its electrons in

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.370 
plus comes out leaving its electrons in
it<00:03:22.960> and<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:25.180> can

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
it and so that the can

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.540 
it and so that the can
has<00:03:27.980> much<00:03:28.370> more<00:03:28.610> electron<00:03:29.030> density<00:03:29.560> or<00:03:30.560> in

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
has much more electron density or in

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.070 
has much more electron density or in
other<00:03:31.700> words<00:03:32.000> we<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.300> say<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.720> becomes

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
other words we can say it becomes

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.930 
other words we can say it becomes
negative

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.460 

and<00:03:37.620> as<00:03:38.620> we<00:03:38.830> know<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.810> h2o<00:03:41.310> NaCl<00:03:42.340> breaks<00:03:42.910> apart

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
and as we know in h2o NaCl breaks apart

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.559 
and as we know in h2o NaCl breaks apart
into<00:03:44.470> na<00:03:44.950> m<00:03:45.130> CL<00:03:45.550> minus

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.170 

so<00:03:49.819> there<00:03:50.819> are<00:03:51.060> many<00:03:52.400> ions<00:03:53.400> chlorine<00:03:53.819> ions

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
so there are many ions chlorine ions

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.380 
so there are many ions chlorine ions
available<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:55.379> aluminum<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.129> capture<00:03:56.519> to

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
available for aluminum to capture to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.750 
available for aluminum to capture to
make<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.319> know<00:03:58.439> stable<00:03:58.920> compound<00:03:59.489> called

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
make a you know stable compound called

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.259 
make a you know stable compound called
alcl3<00:04:00.720> aluminium<00:04:01.470> chloride<00:04:01.620> which<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.430> very

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
alcl3 aluminium chloride which is very

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.229 
alcl3 aluminium chloride which is very
stable<00:04:03.629> with<00:04:04.260> six<00:04:04.799> h2o<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:05.790> that's<00:04:06.060> a

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
stable with six h2o but that's a

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:14.720 
stable with six h2o but that's a
different<00:04:06.450> issue<00:04:12.650> when<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:13.680> said<00:04:14.099> our<00:04:14.340> mixture

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
different issue when I said our mixture

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.289 
different issue when I said our mixture
is<00:04:14.879> a<00:04:15.090> speck<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.629> meant<00:04:16.380> there<00:04:17.100> are<00:04:17.280> lots<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.789> h+

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
is a speck it meant there are lots of h+

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.360 
is a speck it meant there are lots of h+
ions<00:04:18.539> loitering<00:04:19.380> here<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.829> there<00:04:20.039> in<00:04:20.190> your

electrons from the carbon water making
the<00:04:28.680> carbon<00:04:29.070> rod<00:04:29.300> more<00:04:30.300> positive<00:04:30.990> in<00:04:31.169> nature

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
the carbon rod more positive in nature

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.210 
the carbon rod more positive in nature
so<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.150> electron<00:04:34.660> density<00:04:34.950> this<00:04:35.950> time

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
so the electron density this time

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.530 
so the electron density this time
decreases<00:04:37.230> as<00:04:38.230> I've<00:04:38.440> said<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:39.450> carbon<00:04:40.450> rod

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
decreases as I've said a carbon rod

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.640 
decreases as I've said a carbon rod
becomes<00:04:40.930> positive

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.879 

so<00:04:44.650> now<00:04:44.949> we<00:04:45.010> have<00:04:45.520> this<00:04:46.210> positive<00:04:47.020> carbon<00:04:47.560> rod

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
so now we have this positive carbon rod

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.689 
so now we have this positive carbon rod
and<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.820> negative<00:04:49.240> can

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.899 

so<00:04:52.699> when<00:04:52.939> we<00:04:53.090> connect<00:04:53.509> them<00:04:53.629> with<00:04:53.810> wires<00:04:54.909> the

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
so when we connect them with wires the

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.260 
so when we connect them with wires the
electrons<00:04:56.810> from<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:59.110> aluminum

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
electrons from the aluminum

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.709 
electrons from the aluminum
comes<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.760> positive<00:05:03.760> carbon<00:05:04.030> go

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:19.869 

and<00:05:06.809> so<00:05:07.469> there<00:05:07.830> is<00:05:08.039> a<00:05:08.069> flow<00:05:08.639> of<00:05:08.729> electrons

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.170 

if<00:05:20.879> we<00:05:21.090> have<00:05:21.389> n<00:05:21.629> number<00:05:22.379> of<00:05:22.410> batteries<00:05:23.180> every

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
if we have n number of batteries every

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.110 
if we have n number of batteries every
battery<00:05:24.599> having<00:05:24.960> EMF<00:05:25.410> E<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.120> internal

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
battery having EMF E and internal

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.850 
battery having EMF E and internal
resistance<00:05:27.750> smaller<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.430> if<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.860> resistance

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
resistance smaller and if the resistance

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.339 
resistance smaller and if the resistance
of<00:05:32.159> the<00:05:32.280> wire<00:05:32.460> is<00:05:32.789> bigger<00:05:33.090> attend<00:05:33.569> for<00:05:34.229> the

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
of the wire is bigger attend for the

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.469 
of the wire is bigger attend for the
parallel<00:05:34.889> connection<00:05:35.129> and<00:05:35.699> write<00:05:36.000> or

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
parallel connection and write or

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.380 
parallel connection and write or
expression<00:05:37.199> for<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.560> current

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
expression for the current

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.770 
expression for the current
this<00:05:39.960> thing

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
this thing

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.429 
this thing
pretty<00:05:41.990> different<00:05:42.550> from<00:05:43.660> series

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:53.640 

there's<00:05:48.069> a<00:05:48.189> reason<00:05:48.399> why<00:05:48.819> I<00:05:48.849> am<00:05:49.179> showing<00:05:49.569> you<00:05:49.599> DZ

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.740 

as<00:05:53.710> we<00:05:54.460> know<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:57.060> for<00:05:58.060> our<00:05:58.090> battery<00:05:58.479> of

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
as we know that for our battery of

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.110 
as we know that for our battery of
course<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.440> internal<00:05:59.830> resistance<00:06:00.400> is<00:06:00.610> much

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
course the internal resistance is much

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.990 
course the internal resistance is much
much<00:06:01.449> bigger<00:06:01.810> than<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.650> resistance<00:06:03.520> of<00:06:03.729> the

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
much bigger than the resistance of the

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.590 
much bigger than the resistance of the
wires

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
wires

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.960 
wires
thus<00:06:07.540> reducing<00:06:08.540> from<00:06:08.810> those<00:06:09.080> expression

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
thus reducing from those expression

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.360 
thus reducing from those expression
we<00:06:11.300> can<00:06:11.480> see<00:06:11.750> that<00:06:11.960> in<00:06:12.170> cereal<00:06:12.740> we<00:06:12.920> are<00:06:12.980> getting

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
we can see that in cereal we are getting

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.420 
we can see that in cereal we are getting
the<00:06:13.490> electricity<00:06:13.760> by<00:06:14.660> our<00:06:14.960> which<00:06:15.560> actually<00:06:16.310> do

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
the electricity by our which actually do

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.970 
the electricity by our which actually do
not<00:06:16.550> depend<00:06:16.910> on<00:06:17.180> n<00:06:17.540> the<00:06:17.840> number<00:06:18.320> of<00:06:18.500> batteries

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
not depend on n the number of batteries

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.690 
not depend on n the number of batteries
but<00:06:19.610> in<00:06:19.820> parallel<00:06:20.660> connection<00:06:21.290> it<00:06:23.650> actually

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
but in parallel connection it actually

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:32.059 
but in parallel connection it actually
depends<00:06:25.700> on

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.510 

so

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
so

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.779 
so
if<00:06:33.580> we<00:06:33.789> have<00:06:34.090> more<00:06:34.780> than<00:06:34.960> one<00:06:35.319> battery<00:06:35.860> we<00:06:36.550> will

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
if we have more than one battery we will

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.140 
if we have more than one battery we will
of<00:06:37.000> course<00:06:37.259> have<00:06:38.259> a<00:06:38.710> better<00:06:39.370> result<00:06:39.729> in

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
of course have a better result in

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.920 
of course have a better result in
parallel

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930

parallel
the<00:06:42.380> next
