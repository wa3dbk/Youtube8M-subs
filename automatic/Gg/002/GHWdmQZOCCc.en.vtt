00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.040
 when they called me he was among the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.480
 selected that I was going to Spain what 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.700
 first thing I did was that they came out 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.410
 the tears of emotion that he felt and 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.540
 I immediately called my family to 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.890
 inform them to share the 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.170
 emotion that they were already feeling in that 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.660
 moment the memory I have of my son 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.150
 with a ball in its beginnings in the club 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.860
 of venalum he was going to play four and he 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.540
 out of class four and went to 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.890
 field they were practicing and the people 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.960
 according to the students 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.989
 good when I wrote it in football that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.290
 we went to the first day of practice as a 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.480
 normal child had a huge vitality 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.720
 so much so that in the first game that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.820
 we went to get a bus 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.560
 I think every time I see him play is that 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.810
 I got excited in every game in every 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.990
 game in the practices in everything that I go and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.680
 I think it is giving everyone power in 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.690
 the courts all that he can empower 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.880
 good support in the following measure will 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.740
 feel I tell you that of all your life that 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.840
 the sconce on the court everything 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.180
 can each game and hard that something 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.890
 different and that you put your whole life in a 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.310
 game that game is not going to go back to 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.310
 repeat 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.780
 I practice soccer since I was 4 years old 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.520
 paper loaded my mom in this dream of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.040
 to be a professional player is that she 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.920
 is always supporting me outside and inside 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.740
 of the field as it says it dale 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.080
 I support you, you can take everything away 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.070
 that my mom is always supporting me 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.310
 I would better describe what I am a player 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.340
 who plays the ball a lot 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
 I like to give pleasure to my companions 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.760
 to make the goals or if I have 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.250
 the opportunity I do 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.810
 my dream is to be a professional player and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.040
 play in real madrid 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.780
 I would also like to play professionally 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.100
 in the vinotinto since that other dream 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.930
 that I have 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.070
 the growth of jesus faria has been 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.010
 excellent I have from 8 years old 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.720
 already seeing him together he's already 14 years old 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.720
 He has been a player who has been maturing 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.060
 much the main virtue of jesus faria 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.530
 is creativity and is the player of 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.690
 way as we say the times of 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.740
 good team I appreciate that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.380
 have your opportunity first to God 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.150
 and then to the coach who has to 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.980
 has given a lot of confidence to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.080
 unwrap on the court and to my 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.270
 family that has given me great support 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.890
 it seems an excellent that the people of 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.850
 flour bread is doing this kind of 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.340
 activities because it gives you a chance 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.970
 to guys who do not have many 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.260
 resources to develop and your career 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.260
