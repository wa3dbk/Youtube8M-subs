now some people use the other side of
the<00:01:50.619> knife<00:01:50.800> but<00:01:51.159> I<00:01:51.220> don't<00:01:51.490> agree<00:01:51.640> with<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:51.970> I

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
the knife but I don't agree with that I

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.420 
the knife but I don't agree with that I
think<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.630> should<00:01:52.780> use<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.290> heel<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.619> the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
think you should use the heel of the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.450 
think you should use the heel of the
knife<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:55.000> thick<00:01:55.600> knife<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.770> cut<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.310> the

claw just get the heel in and then twist

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.580 
claw just get the heel in and then twist
that<00:02:00.790> will<00:02:00.940> break<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.420> shell<00:02:01.690> rip<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.500> open
