so<00:03:28.419> yeah<00:03:29.169> that's<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:30.099> only<00:03:30.130> downside<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.120> I

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
so yeah that's the only downside to I

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.420 
so yeah that's the only downside to I
guess<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.260> animation<00:03:32.680> API<00:03:32.980> one<00:03:33.280> can

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
guess but and the animation API one can

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.860 
guess but and the animation API one can
be<00:03:33.549> mixed<00:03:33.760> with<00:03:33.910> other<00:03:34.120> things<00:03:34.329> as<00:03:34.540> well<00:03:34.720> so

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
be mixed with other things as well so

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.449 
be mixed with other things as well so
kind<00:03:35.169> of<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.349> there's<00:03:35.829> another<00:03:36.010> mod<00:03:36.250> called

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459
