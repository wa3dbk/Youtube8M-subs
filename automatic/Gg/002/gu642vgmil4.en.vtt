00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.639
 so the machine is now a while 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:13.519
 already on shows a quarter of an hour 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:17.619
 now boiler is building pressure slowly and 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.720
 The machine means you can hear it well 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.670
 The last attempt came from this 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.700
 overpressure valve or whatever that 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.230
 Ding means a lot of steam just out and 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.860
 I believe that because somewhere the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.419
 Problem is I do not know why and 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.969
 usually wander this 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.070
 Overpressure valve will work at all 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.910
 but if it works like this now 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.680
 the last time 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.690
 then here comes quite a lot 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.310
 steam I think out of this opening 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.920
 you can not pinpoint it exactly 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.910
 because then on the complete page 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.350
 distributed here 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.230
 You can almost do it from the complete one 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.030
 side but my origin is out 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.340
 otherwise this valve is likely to be here too 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.450
 nowhere to get out 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.760
 now you can easily see me 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.430
 do not know in the camera picture whether that is 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.430
 unfortunately can not see 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.590
 unfortunately I do not think so but has 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.980
 you can see that it is so accurate 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.890
 here as a little steam out and the 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:21.250
 pretty much under this now 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.250
 08 it keeps on increasing 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.010
 You can not see anything here down here 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.430
 everything looks normal it will be fine 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.430
 Strength 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.530
 yes otherwise I am sure if the 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:54.299
 machine follow suit really water 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:57.409
 reasonable one sees out the water the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.409
 Machines now identified 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.539
 you really can not say where 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.810
 That's exactly what it can not come from 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.810
 locate 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.550
 despite heat but I suppose that 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.550
 added
