00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
putting out mega surfer 5th generation

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.670 
putting out mega surfer 5th generation
before<00:04:01.840> i'll<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.350> know

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
before i'll you know

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.759 
before i'll you know
5th<00:04:03.160> gen<00:04:03.519> Megas<00:04:03.970> were<00:04:04.390> non-existent<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.470> with

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
5th gen Megas were non-existent and with

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.039 
5th gen Megas were non-existent and with
already<00:04:06.100> no<00:04:06.250> we<00:04:06.430> can<00:04:06.610> basically<00:04:06.820> confirm<00:04:07.600> hey

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
already no we can basically confirm hey

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.710 
already no we can basically confirm hey
we<00:04:08.560> got<00:04:08.769> 5th<00:04:09.070> gen<00:04:09.310> Megas<00:04:09.730> that's<00:04:09.970> awesome<00:04:10.510> and

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
we got 5th gen Megas that's awesome and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.830 
we got 5th gen Megas that's awesome and
that's<00:04:11.290> really<00:04:11.620> important<00:04:12.280> because<00:04:12.510> 5th<00:04:13.510> gen

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
that's really important because 5th gen

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.900 
that's really important because 5th gen
is<00:04:14.049> kind<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.560> sort<00:04:14.860> of<00:04:14.980> become<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.640> the

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
is kind of sort of become the the
