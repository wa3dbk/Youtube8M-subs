00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:19.119
 fast five of time will have come about 4 or 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.660
 5 times is the tenth time I come to 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.660
 festival 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.510
 I'm having a great time beyond 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.399
 what is music for the environment that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.280
 there is in the camping what unites us is that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.339
 that feeling of the music of the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.760
 experiences of living the moment and 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.760
 maximum 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.719
 6 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.719
 the same 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 place 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.680
 who is Richter answering? 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.540
 good 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.670
 I've been here for 10 years now in alcalÃ¡ and then 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.440
 this year I have given him the entrance to my 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.210
 boyfriend for his birthday but for me it's 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.590
 much more than an entrance to a concert 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.330
 and you like the group much better but 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.600
 nor is it strictly necessary with 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.910
 see people enjoy around and you 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.490
 integrate yourself a little in that halo of 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.990
 happiness is fantastic to see parents 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.180
 taking the children as they represent that 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.250
 the illusions that I have grown 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.470
 with metallica compendian because my father 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.570
 I had an incredible taste and they paid me 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.180
 with me to see metallica and for me 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.980
 been super special and you have to live it and 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.510
 it fills you then you go you're going to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.830
 hook and things have never come 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.830
 You have to prove 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.640
 American people 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.310
 Christ slowly 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.310
