 Hi, I'm Gabrielle Shrager, senior story director 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.500
 at Ubisoft Montpellier Studios and the lead writer of ZombiU. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.570
 We're going to talk about the story ... 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.570
 Episode 2 LONDON: A CITY OF BLOOD AND FIRE 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.050
 I have lived in London, and the team has been walking around the city for a long time 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.420
 to gain unique impressions and soak up the atmosphere. 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.309
 An incredible image of the city has emerged from this. 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.309
 A creepy, super-realistic version of London, where hell is waiting for you on every street corner. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.780
 ZombiU contains various locations that reflect the contrast of modern London. 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.560
 From the splendor of Buckingham Palace to the filthy of a suburb. 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.310
 Where can you find a Zombie bobby, Beefeater and a zombie member of the Royal Guard? 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.070
 It is the year 2012 and the Black Prophecy is about to come true. 0: 01: 42.070.0: 01: 45.450 John Dee foresaw the apocalypse 400 years ago, 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.320
 and now you're in the middle of it. 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.510
 Run or you will die! 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.230
 ZombiU contains three main characters who all try to survive in a different way 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.840
 and interpret John Dee's Black Prophecy differently. 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.060
 The Parate is your mysterious guide and mentor. A survivor who saw the apocalypse coming 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.030
 and prepared for it; a sober army veteran. He will do everything to teach you 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.700
 survive so that you can experience the Black Prophecy coming true. 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.700
 Hey boy, here! Come to the station! 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.210
 Sondra is one of the leaders of a secret society called the Ravens of Dee. 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.569
 They have been studying John Dee and the Black Prophecy for centuries. 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.620
 They try to help as many survivors as possible to leave London. 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.620
 Sorry, I can't do any more, I have to go to the other defensive wall. 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.280
 Dr. Knight is one of the queen's doctors. He survived far below Buckingham Palace 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.230
 in the royal bunkers, where he obsessively searches for the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.040
 legendary 'Panacee', a universal medicine that John Dee was looking for when he died. 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.500
 Welcome. Make yourself at home. But don't touch anything. This is 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.480
 important scientific work. 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.709
 The fascinating Dee was one of the most fascinating and mystical men in British history. The players are allowed to discover the extensive mythology that we created around his life and work. 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.209
 The players can discover the extensive mythology 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.180
 that we created around his life and work. 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.950
 We soon realized that the overall storyline of this game 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.840
 does not belong to the survivors you play with, but to you, the player. 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.090
 You follow the storyline, from the beginning to the end. 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.890
 We also meet other survivors in Brick Lane and we see them 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.440
 have remained alive. 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.099
 These characters pass the story line on to each other. 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.090
 All survivors benefit from the progress of their predecessor. They continue with the storyline, 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.099
 as in a deadly relay race, hoping that maybe one of the survivors 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.730
 comes alive from battle. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.700
 In the next episode 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.500
 Surviving the hard way The technology of ZombiU
