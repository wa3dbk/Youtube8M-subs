00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.150
 good morning 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.309
 we are at this moment with weapons 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.730
 group and the owner holder Mr. 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.020
 fabio regazzi this good morning 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.720
 company arms group 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.690
 she was one of the pioneers to bring her cigarettes 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 electronics in Italy and beyond is 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.280
 the only electronic cigarette 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.230
 recognized by the Italian league 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.510
 smoke-free yes and we were pioneers with 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.590
 the group and the company our brand 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.050
 is category 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.660
 we pioneered this project 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.580
 because being a great ex-smoker 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.820
 I immediately fell in love with the first ones 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.550
 champions who are beginning to see each other in 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.550
 united and from there I decided to create 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.650
 this this company 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.270
 the why of the of the of the only one 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.060
 company the only brand approved by 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.119
 Italian smoke-free alloy is given by one 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.560
 chosen since the beginning of the first days 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.440
 of the beginning of the start up of this 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.360
 firm in deciding to invest in 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.600
 significantly in research e 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.759
 in studies and in collaboration with 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.080
 the Italian anti-smoking association Professor 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.479
 polosa that today one of the maximum 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.380
 exponents in the world in the study of 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.110
 electronic cigarette 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.660
 we did a pilot study on 40 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.660
 patients who already published in journals 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.660
 international medicine with results 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.330
 stratospheric that basically say that 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:39.130
 not only the product is not dangerous but 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.539
 but it is a great opportunity for 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.780
 reduce the risks of smoking 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:47.289
 therefore the study has now expanded from 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.020
 40 to 300 patients and we are really 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.990
 upon arrival of the publication of the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.570
 complete study to come 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.670
 intro I think a couple of months all these 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.399
 research actually leads to failure 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.430
 at random you are also distributed in 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.110
 pharmacies absolutely say that in 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.759
 this time for us the most channel 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.349
 the channel is certainly important 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.120
 pharmacies were not easy to understand 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.620
 the importance and potential la 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.519
 validity of our product also 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.510
 because in the last year and a half 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.519
 rightly the desire to do business 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.680
 the company is always there and therefore they are 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.750
 even some products come out a little more 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 little more we say put together in some 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.390
 so if we want to say however definitely 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.090
 today we were rewarded by pharmacies 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.130
 thanks to a work of method tenacity 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.830
 of constancy that has allowed us to do 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.860
 understand to the pharmacist the importance of 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.069
 brand categories here why not behind 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.010
 there is only research but also design 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.989
 absolutely the facts I can do 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.599
 see why I loved it 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.110
 it's a thing just looks like a package 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.870
 of cigarettes that opens 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.090
 look has put absolutely not a 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.930
 beautiful object we also say that in 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.269
 parallel to an activity as I said of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.430
 important in-depth study and research 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.380
 we also did a good job a 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.630
 marketing study level e 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.880
 of the aesthetics of the product, however 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 the product like is not a detail 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.799
 you can see a cigarette so it's not 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.900
 an invasive and difficult to product 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.790
 to keep 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.400
 I guarantee you as a great ex-smoker 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.160
 looks a lot like a cigarette with the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.380
 small detail that of not hurting and 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.019
 so surely a crusade me 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.700
 is giving a lot of satisfactions either 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.650
 at a health level that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.090
 entrepreneurial so we will continue on 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.130
 this road 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.930
 we thank the pharmacies that are today 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.980
 almost arrived at 7000 and therefore we are 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.030
 very happy and we are starting to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.920
 also work on foreign markets 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.950
 we will start shortly for Spain on 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.660
 Portugal to France and Switzerland 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.870
 we hope not to stop 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.870
 knows very well I wish indeed I do them 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.340
 also a last question for her 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.770
 cosmofarma and therefore also a beautiful one 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.110
 showcase your own video you don't want to expose them 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.850
 also to really be given an even 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.100
 last year we are present in a way 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.500
 less less important less significant 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.090
 we say as a test in Rome we wanted 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.220
 just view the experience of Rome 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.940
 this year to present ourselves more 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.080
 structured in bologna the feedback is 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.210
 extraordinary pharmacists from all over Italy 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.750
 they came to visit us from Sicily 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.860
 from Calabria from Puglia 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.750
 surely it will be an experience that 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.480
 we will also repeat so it presses more 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.100
 significant is more important 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.950
 we hope for everyone in that 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.470
 you work for the health of ex-smokers but 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.550
 even those in government 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.440
 thanks again to Mr. fabio regazzi e 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.980
