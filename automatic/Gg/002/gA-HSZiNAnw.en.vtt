00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
difficult and that was really what we

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.110 
difficult and that was really what we

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
had to concentrate on overnight so we

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
had to concentrate on overnight so we
did<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.960> car<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.230> much<00:00:58.350> better<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.800> Saturday

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.450 
did the car was much better on Saturday
setup<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.960> when<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> qualifying<00:01:01.800> positive

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that we could you know be at the front

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.219 
that we could you know be at the front
front<00:01:05.100> row<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.549> everything<00:01:05.850> went<00:01:06.000> well<00:01:06.229> first

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
front row if everything went well first

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350

two sessions in qualifying went without

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.350 
two sessions in qualifying went without
really<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.930> big<00:01:10.320> issue<00:01:10.490> but<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
really a big issue but you know the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.120 
really a big issue but you know the
other<00:01:12.390> teams<00:01:12.720> rock<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.170> lot<00:01:13.409> closer<00:01:13.740> than<00:01:14.040> what

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
other teams rock a lot closer than what

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.710 
other teams rock a lot closer than what
we<00:01:14.280> expected<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.299> were<00:01:15.360> only<00:01:15.479> sort

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
we expected you know they were only sort

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.179 
we expected you know they were only sort
of<00:01:15.780> two<00:01:15.900> tenths<00:01:16.140> behind<00:01:16.470> three<00:01:16.680> tenths<00:01:16.860> behind

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
of two tenths behind three tenths behind

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.310 
of two tenths behind three tenths behind
and<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:18.030> expected<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.780> more<00:01:18.869> tiny

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and we expected a little bit more tiny

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.740 
and we expected a little bit more tiny
bit<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.770> anyway<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.150> hadn't<00:01:21.390> run<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> low

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
bit I do anyway but we hadn't run on low

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
bit I do anyway but we hadn't run on low
fuel<00:01:22.049> over<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> winter<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.700> car<00:01:23.939> was

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
fuel over the winter so the car was

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.020 
fuel over the winter so the car was
working<00:01:24.420> differently<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> wasn't<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.909> my

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
working differently and it wasn't to my

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.109 
working differently and it wasn't to my
liking<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.780> q1<00:01:27.990> q2<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.549> q3<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
liking really in q1 q2 and then q3 and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
liking really in q1 q2 and then q3 and
we<00:01:30.180> put<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> fuel<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.229> felt<00:01:31.500> normal

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
we put the fuel in it it felt normal

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.020 
we put the fuel in it it felt normal
again<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> car<00:01:32.400> felt<00:01:32.640> good<00:01:32.790> and

was really just about knowing what

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.780
