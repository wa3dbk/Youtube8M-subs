and<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.290> why<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> move<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.880> wanted<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and it is why to move you wanted to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.469 
and it is why to move you wanted to
protect<00:01:24.659> his<00:01:24.900> pawn<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.799> e5<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:27.090> can't<00:01:27.360> be

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
protect his pawn on e5 it can't be

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.030 
protect his pawn on e5 it can't be
captured<00:01:27.900> immediately<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.590> he<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
captured immediately but he want to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.770 
captured immediately but he want to
protect<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.490> he<00:01:29.640> played<00:01:29.820> f4<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
protect that he played f4 and that is a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.420 
protect that he played f4 and that is a
mistake<00:01:31.070> let's<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.220> back<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:33.090> best<00:01:33.299> move<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
mistake let's go back the best move is

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.429 
mistake let's go back the best move is
a3<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:38.180> black<00:01:39.180> must<00:01:39.630> decide<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.409> with

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
a3 and black must decide what to do with

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.249 
a3 and black must decide what to do with
his<00:01:40.680> bishop<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.700> he<00:01:42.119> takes<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:42.810> looks<00:01:43.079> like

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
his bishop if he takes which looks like

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.569 
his bishop if he takes which looks like
obvious<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.700> bishop<00:01:45.420> takes<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.579> white

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
obvious more then bishop takes and white

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
obvious more then bishop takes and white
is<00:01:47.790> standing<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.750> bad

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
is standing not bad

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.149 
is standing not bad
perhaps<00:01:49.829> black<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> only<00:01:50.970> tiny<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.720> better

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
perhaps black is only tiny bit better

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.280 
perhaps black is only tiny bit better
but<00:01:53.159> white<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.460> still<00:01:54.090> okay<00:01:55.159> but<00:01:56.159> f4<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.290> a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
but white is still okay but f4 is a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:07.100 
but white is still okay but f4 is a
mistake<00:01:59.060> why<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.740> black<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.479> move<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:06.110> he

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
mistake why it is black to move and he

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.240 
mistake why it is black to move and he
played<00:02:07.380> green<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.099> g4<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.980 

if<00:02:11.930> King<00:02:12.930> goes<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.440> F<00:02:13.680> 2<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.250> example

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
if King goes to F 2 for example

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.810 
if King goes to F 2 for example
that's<00:02:15.990> bad<00:02:16.260> because<00:02:16.650> Bishop<00:02:17.250> takes<00:02:17.460> and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
that's bad because Bishop takes and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.020 
that's bad because Bishop takes and
after<00:02:18.780> Bishop<00:02:18.930> takes<00:02:19.110> rook<00:02:19.620> takes<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.610> black

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
after Bishop takes rook takes and black

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
after Bishop takes rook takes and black
is<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.210> ink<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.190> white<00:02:23.970> had<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.330> play<00:02:24.540> Knight

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
is the ink so white had to play Knight

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.290 
is the ink so white had to play Knight
to<00:02:25.080> f3<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:27.140> we<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.350> reached<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.830> critical
