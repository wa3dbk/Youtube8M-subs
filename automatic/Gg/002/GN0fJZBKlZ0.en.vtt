again I think I would be inclined to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.050 
again I think I would be inclined to
just<00:01:15.689> leave<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> cancer<00:01:17.460> problem

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060

that<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.390> continue<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.140> progress<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that will continue to progress just a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.780 
that will continue to progress just a
paint<00:01:20.520> flaw<00:01:21.920> again<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.070> nice<00:01:23.280> new<00:01:23.520> wheels

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
give you a quick look here under the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.460 
give you a quick look here under the
spare<00:04:35.760> tire<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.389> back<00:04:36.630> shelf<00:04:36.960> here<00:04:37.229> here

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
spare tire and the back shelf here here

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.920 
spare tire and the back shelf here here
is<00:04:37.560> an<00:04:37.710> su<00:04:38.040> fuel<00:04:38.400> pump<00:04:38.699> looks<00:04:39.479> to<00:04:39.690> be<00:04:39.780> in<00:04:39.900> good

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
is an su fuel pump looks to be in good

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.290 
is an su fuel pump looks to be in good
shape<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.500> we<00:04:40.650> know<00:04:40.830> we've<00:04:41.520> got<00:04:41.639> a<00:04:41.699> nice<00:04:41.940> break

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
shape and we know we've got a nice break

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.390 
shape and we know we've got a nice break
Union<00:04:42.780> there<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.139> looks<00:04:43.320> like<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.500> recent<00:04:44.160> line

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
Union there it looks like a recent line

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.490 
Union there it looks like a recent line
and<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.790> good<00:04:45.030> rubber<00:04:45.479> hose<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.810> lot<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.320> times

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
and a good rubber hose a lot of times

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.710 
and a good rubber hose a lot of times
those<00:04:46.770> won't<00:04:47.010> get<00:04:47.160> changed<00:04:47.639> and<00:04:47.820> they<00:04:48.570> get

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
those won't get changed and they get

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.500 
those won't get changed and they get
cracked<00:04:49.110> then<00:04:49.889> we<00:04:50.070> have<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.310> 12-volt<00:04:51.120> battery

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
cracked then we have a 12-volt battery

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.480 
cracked then we have a 12-volt battery
which<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.080> still<00:04:52.500> positive<00:04:52.740> ground<00:04:53.190> as

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
which is still positive ground as

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.719 
which is still positive ground as
original<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.479> can<00:04:54.630> also<00:04:54.810> see<00:04:55.199> here<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.729> there

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
original we can also see here that there

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.640 
original we can also see here that there
is<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.300> little<00:04:57.570> bit<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.870> leakage<00:04:58.139> on<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.410> front

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
is a little bit of leakage on the front

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.070 
is a little bit of leakage on the front
of<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.830> axle<00:04:59.280> but<00:04:59.430> that's<00:04:59.610> very<00:05:00.180> minor<00:05:00.510> most

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
of the axle but that's very minor most

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.950 
of the axle but that's very minor most
of<00:05:01.260> them<00:05:01.380> are<00:05:01.530> pretty<00:05:01.800> sloppy<00:05:02.729> so<00:05:03.720> that's

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
of them are pretty sloppy so that's

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.050 
of them are pretty sloppy so that's
that's<00:05:04.710> good<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.130> see<00:05:05.340> that's<00:05:05.610> well<00:05:05.880> within

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
that's good to see that's well within

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.560 
that's good to see that's well within
spec<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:06.960> then<00:05:07.590> we<00:05:07.740> have<00:05:07.949> the<00:05:08.100> other<00:05:08.570> battery

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
spec and then we have the other battery

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.330 
spec and then we have the other battery
tray<00:05:09.870> here<00:05:10.080> in<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.380> old<00:05:10.500> days<00:05:10.680> they<00:05:10.889> were<00:05:10.949> 6

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
tray here in the old days they were 6

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.300 
tray here in the old days they were 6
volts<00:05:11.699> to<00:05:11.910> 6<00:05:12.210> volts<00:05:12.539> wire<00:05:12.750> together<00:05:13.080> for<00:05:14.039> 12

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
volts to 6 volts wire together for 12

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.879 
volts to 6 volts wire together for 12
and<00:05:14.639> that<00:05:14.820> one<00:05:15.050> you<00:05:16.050> could<00:05:16.229> certainly<00:05:16.380> restore

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
and that one you could certainly restore

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.219 
and that one you could certainly restore
it<00:05:16.979> that<00:05:17.160> way<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.370> wouldn't<00:05:17.520> bother<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.539> it's

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
it that way I wouldn't bother but it's

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.930 
it that way I wouldn't bother but it's
nice<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.650> see<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:19.979> it<00:05:20.070> hasn't<00:05:20.250> rested<00:05:20.580> away

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
nice to see that it hasn't rested away

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.360 
nice to see that it hasn't rested away
on<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.150> lot<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.389> these<00:05:21.570> cars<00:05:21.930> that's<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.919> telltale

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
on a lot of these cars that's a telltale

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.890 
on a lot of these cars that's a telltale
sign<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:24.270> of<00:05:25.199> resting<00:05:26.389> going<00:05:27.389> on<00:05:27.510> in<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.720> back

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
sign of of resting going on in the back

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.020 
sign of of resting going on in the back
of<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.139> car<00:05:28.380> but<00:05:29.310> all<00:05:29.430> in<00:05:29.580> all<00:05:29.669> looks<00:05:29.940> good

floor these are potential rust spots in

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.480 
floor these are potential rust spots in
here<00:06:07.889> but<00:06:08.669> this<00:06:08.820> one's<00:06:09.060> excellent<00:06:10.250> nice<00:06:11.250> that

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
here but this one's excellent nice that

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.159 
here but this one's excellent nice that
it's<00:06:11.639> also<00:06:11.880> painted<00:06:12.510> when<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.780> car<00:06:13.020> was

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
it's also painted when the car was
