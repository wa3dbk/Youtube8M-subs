surfing just like we're pushing
wakeboarding<00:01:20.080> we<00:01:20.560> began<00:01:20.830> working<00:01:21.130> on<00:01:21.370> ideas

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
wakeboarding we began working on ideas

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.300 
wakeboarding we began working on ideas
to<00:01:22.030> make<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.330> wave<00:01:22.480> better<00:01:22.890> easily<00:01:23.890> switch<00:01:24.160> it

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
to make the wave better easily switch it

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.640 
to make the wave better easily switch it
from<00:01:24.460> side<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.730> side<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.390> also<00:01:25.990> be<00:01:26.440> able<00:01:26.530> to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
from side to side and also be able to

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.220 
from side to side and also be able to
fine-tune<00:01:27.010> it<00:01:27.460> much<00:01:27.700> like<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:27.940> NC<00:01:28.480> RS<00:01:28.780> system

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
fine-tune it much like the NC RS system

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:43.080 
fine-tune it much like the NC RS system
does<00:01:29.470> with<00:01:29.890> our<00:01:29.920> wakeboard<00:01:30.520> wake<00:01:42.000> taking<00:01:43.000> a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
different look and approach based on

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.990 
different look and approach based on
things<00:01:45.160> we've<00:01:45.340> learned<00:01:45.610> from<00:01:45.820> our

developments over the past five years we

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.920 
developments over the past five years we
focused<00:01:48.700> on<00:01:48.820> affecting<00:01:49.300> how<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.450> water<00:01:49.810> flows

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
focused on affecting how the water flows

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.530 
focused on affecting how the water flows
off<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.830> boat<00:01:51.010> versus<00:01:51.820> affecting<00:01:52.330> how<00:01:52.480> the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
off the boat versus affecting how the

engaged the wave plate allows you to

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.740 
engaged the wave plate allows you to
manipulate<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.220> wave<00:01:57.580> form<00:01:57.970> without<00:01:58.450> having

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
manipulate the wave form without having

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.450 
manipulate the wave form without having
to<00:01:58.840> move<00:01:58.990> people<00:01:59.230> and<00:01:59.500> ballast<00:01:59.860> from<00:02:00.010> side<00:02:00.310> to

this is done by redirecting the flow of
water<00:02:03.970> coming<00:02:04.390> off<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.750> boat<00:02:04.930> instead<00:02:05.830> of
