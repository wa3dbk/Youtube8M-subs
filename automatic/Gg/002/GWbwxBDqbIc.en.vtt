 aquarium man man aquarium itself 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.300
 that has to do with sexuality not 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.819
 interesting basically we find ourselves with 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.380
 two people aquarian always agree 

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:26.409

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.899
 unusual are going to be people on the other hand 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.689

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.790
 in other people a certain degree of 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.610
 trust they have a way of being very 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.860
 friendly but have much more 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.230
 determination of what they demonstrate in the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.570
 surface then aquarium appears 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.040
 many times a very open sign but 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.040
 is a sign that that fixity focuses and 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.800
 concentrates it according to objectives 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.350
 so when he meets an aquarian 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.320
 an aquarian woman if they share those 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.749
 common goals is going to be a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.520
 motivation to begin that link 

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:08.330
 always when 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.430
 We speak 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.670
 of two people who share the sign 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.830
 they will increase the virtues and also 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.020
 the defects is increased all that 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.000
 has to do with the sign the sign of 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.580
 aquarium itself is regal by urano that 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.680
 is the disconforming planet that always goes 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.470
 to look for the changes that have to be the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.920
 uranus planet that has to do with what 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.740
 Novelty will always break everything 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.490
 that has to do with what is established in 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.990
 function of new ideas is the sign 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.870
 avant-garde then they both go to 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.150
 share that free approach of what 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.270
 it has to do with life indeed they have 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.460
 generated great changes women are 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.620
 Aquarian men depending on what 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.630
 that has to do with the common good 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.110
 then the mental stimulus is a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.220
 feature that they share with 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.700
 regarding what has to do with the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.860
 sexuality they like to enjoy and they go to 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.130
 look also get out of the routine is 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.729
 Characteristic of people or couples 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.390
 open that allow themselves to enjoy 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.250
 and experience there are also 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.709
 Aquarians that are ruled by Saturn 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.810
 since it is your not that planet runs people 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.750
 Saturn is often found more 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.170
 strong in some letter of some 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.629
 aquarian and mark one more person 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.700
 conventional so there is a certain 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.190
 amount of aquarians that are going to be more 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.940
 conventional and they will be within 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.220
 a routine or within the established 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.470
 feeling comfortable but beyond that 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.900
 always the stimulus 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.170
 mental is going to be a constant too 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.030
 the altruistic goals aquarium has 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.530
 to do with that common good that's why 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.810
 always be part of communities or of 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.000
 try to achieve change generate those 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.260
 changes the goal of aquarium in the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.790
 life is always being able to feel useful in 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.489
 function to what it has to do with the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.890
 common good if I feel an admiration with 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.859
 Regarding what the couple is going to 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.139
 merge are going to mimic very well not 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.770
 it is positive that they argue or that they collide 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.990
 since the fixity of face 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.810
 results in that if there is a 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.840
 opposition between the two is difficult 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.890
 can always agree on the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.780
 Aquarian under that friendly surface 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.780
 has that fixity of character that many 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.060
 Sometimes people can not get to 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.280
 perceive him as a couple is a couple 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.440
 cheerful will also enjoy a lot of 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.750
 the social contacts of friends 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.850
 is the couple that is related to 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.730
 different people from the most varied 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.580
 nature where that sexuality also 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.320
 allows you to enjoy it in a spontaneous way 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.060
 or open 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.240
 many times another problem is the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.370
 detachment do not feel jealous naturally 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.920
 they trust a lot what the couple is and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.620
 many times they open and there may be a 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.350
 time without seeing or communicating 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.870
 they also occur many times between 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.390
 aquarium and aquarium that everyone lives by 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.120
 your own account or what you have to see 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.580
 with the opening the word opening is 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.260
 one of the keywords with respect 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.200
 what the couple has to do with 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.220
 experimentation an open couple what 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.260
 that has to do with the 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.350
 objectives altruistic objectives 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.120
 social openness in itself all that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.150
 has to do with the vanguard or with 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.390
 novelty will be characteristics of a 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.430
 woman and an aquarian man generally 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.980
 they also have very intelligent children 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.000
 because you can nourish just from 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.340
 all these characteristics also that 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.040
 novel approach that what you have to 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.610
 will do with life itself so it's a 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.310
 cheerful couple an open couple where 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.410
 the mental stimulus is a constant and 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.270
 a royal need for uranus that if the 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.390
 different planet so always 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.430
 there will also be a certain degree of 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.400
 peculiarity with regard to what is the 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.460
 couple or at home or in ideas or in 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.980
