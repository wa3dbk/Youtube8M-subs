at<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.529> beginning<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.849> idea<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.840> was

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
at the beginning the idea is that it was

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.789 
at the beginning the idea is that it was
almost<00:00:10.290> like<00:00:10.469> an<00:00:10.590> apartment<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:12.480> man<00:00:12.750> who<00:00:13.679> is

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
almost like an apartment of a man who is

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.359 
almost like an apartment of a man who is
more<00:00:14.130> very<00:00:14.549> much<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> traveler<00:00:15.690> who

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
more very much of a traveler who

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.130 
more very much of a traveler who
collects<00:00:17.369> things<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.910> he<00:00:18.119> dropped<00:00:18.810> things

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
collects things so he dropped things

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.200 
collects things so he dropped things
except<00:00:19.560> Terra<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> store<00:00:20.640> has<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:20.970> very

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
except Terra so the store has this very

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.349 
except Terra so the store has this very
sort<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.660> masculine<00:00:22.529> environment<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:24.119> he<00:00:24.240> has

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
sort of masculine environment but he has

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.389 
sort of masculine environment but he has
a<00:00:24.390> weird<00:00:24.660> obsession<00:00:25.140> he<00:00:25.289> has<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> lot<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> shoes

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399

my name is Christian Rita and I'm

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
my name is Christian Rita and I'm
designing<00:00:35.370> soon<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:37.350> am<00:00:37.730> most<00:00:38.730> famous<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
designing soon I am most famous for the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.630 
designing soon I am most famous for the
red<00:00:40.350> soul<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:42.559> when<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> started<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.370> red

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
red soul and when I started that red

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.540 
red soul and when I started that red
soul<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.440> 92<00:00:46.440> 93<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:48.739> women<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.920> Paris<00:00:50.309> were

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
soul in 92 93 and women in Paris were

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.389 
soul in 92 93 and women in Paris were
very<00:00:50.850> much<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.930> black<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.559> dressed<00:00:53.219> in

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
very much all in black or dressed in

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.720 
very much all in black or dressed in
black<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.510> wanted<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.100> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
black and I wanted to have this this

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.340 
black and I wanted to have this this
colored<00:00:57.120> soul<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.660> thought<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> very

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
colored soul but I thought at the very

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.610 
colored soul but I thought at the very
beginning<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> maybe<00:00:59.370> change<00:00:59.820> colors<00:01:00.620> every

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
beginning to maybe change colors every

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.070 
beginning to maybe change colors every
season<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.520> immediately<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.239> realized<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
season but immediately I realized that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.920 
season but immediately I realized that
red<00:01:04.710> has<00:01:05.280> different<00:01:05.850> meanings<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.360> most<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
red has different meanings in most of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.310 
red has different meanings in most of
the<00:01:07.020> culture<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.070> always<00:01:08.369> positive<00:01:09.320> but

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the culture but it's always positive but

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.550 
the culture but it's always positive but
also<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:11.040> realized<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:13.200> people<00:01:13.380> who

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
also I realized that for people who

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.740 
also I realized that for people who
don't<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.979> colours<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.430> still<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.180> red<00:01:15.479> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
don't like colours I still have red a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.840 
don't like colours I still have red a
woman<00:01:16.439> dressed<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.950> black<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.580> still

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
woman dressed in black would have still

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.410 
woman dressed in black would have still
the<00:01:18.360> red<00:01:18.570> nails<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.860> rail<00:01:20.070> lips<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.390> they

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the red nails the rail lips so they

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.170 
the red nails the rail lips so they
would<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.020> consider<00:01:22.500> red<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> color<00:01:23.790> really

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
would not consider red as a color really

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.570 
would not consider red as a color really
they<00:01:24.689> would<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.530> colors<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.130> red<00:01:26.400> was

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
they would not have colors but red was

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.800 
they would not have colors but red was
already<00:01:26.850> making<00:01:27.119> part<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.840> their<00:01:28.400> of<00:01:29.400> their

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
already making part of their of their

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.520 
already making part of their of their
environment<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> way

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.020 

designing<00:01:36.530> for<00:01:36.710> men<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.340> completely

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
designing for men is completely

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.880 
designing for men is completely
different<00:01:38.210> than<00:01:38.690> designing<00:01:38.900> for<00:01:39.440> women<00:01:39.770> and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
different than designing for women and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.580 
different than designing for women and
for<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:41.180> long<00:01:41.450> time<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.110> would<00:01:42.290> have<00:01:42.380> never

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
for a long time I would have never

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.100 
for a long time I would have never
considered<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:43.280> do<00:01:43.460> really<00:01:44.210> properly<00:01:45.080> a

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
considered to do really properly a

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.690 
considered to do really properly a
collection<00:01:45.560> for<00:01:45.770> men<00:01:45.860> because<00:01:46.280> it's<00:01:46.460> such<00:01:46.670> a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
collection for men because it's such a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.180 
collection for men because it's such a
different<00:01:47.210> thing<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.690> it's<00:01:48.350> not<00:01:48.650> a<00:01:48.710> natural

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
different thing so it's not a natural

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.490 
different thing so it's not a natural
extension<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.030> way<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:50.480> very<00:01:51.050> very<00:01:51.350> very

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
extension in a way it's very very very

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.090 
extension in a way it's very very very
very<00:01:51.680> different<00:01:51.980> so<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.420> first

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
very different so this is the first

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.240 
very different so this is the first
store<00:01:55.100> completely<00:01:55.700> dedicated<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.510> men<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:58.100> a

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
store completely dedicated to men in a

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.060 
store completely dedicated to men in a
way<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.490> owned<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.690> guy<00:01:59.900> who<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.380> young

through<00:02:37.820> women's<00:02:38.180> eyes<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.290> thought<00:02:39.560> that

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
through women's eyes and I thought that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.650 
through women's eyes and I thought that
it<00:02:39.830> was<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.040> perfect<00:02:40.520> way<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.640> put<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.060> instead

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
it was a perfect way to put it instead

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.020 
it was a perfect way to put it instead
of<00:02:41.780> thinking<00:02:42.260> okay<00:02:42.830> Matt<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.190> different<00:02:43.760> so

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
of thinking okay Matt is different so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.340 
of thinking okay Matt is different so
it's<00:02:44.180> more<00:02:44.450> about<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.780> line<00:02:44.990> it's<00:02:45.260> like

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
it's more about the line it's like

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.500 
it's more about the line it's like
designing<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:46.070> car<00:02:46.340> whatever<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:47.090> more<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.420> an

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
designing a car whatever it's more of an

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.449 
designing a car whatever it's more of an
object<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.080> thought<00:02:48.650> well<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.100> should<00:02:49.130> actually

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459

keep<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.500> excitement<00:02:51.830> sign<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.850> it's<00:02:53.060> really

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
keep the excitement sign and it's really

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.530

funny<00:02:53.510> because<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.020> response<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:55.540> what

that a lot of people I know who had all

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.520 
that a lot of people I know who had all
the<00:03:16.430> tattoos<00:03:16.670> really<00:03:17.660> speak<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.170> atween

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
the tattoos really speak of that atween

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.340 
the tattoos really speak of that atween
a<00:03:18.590> very<00:03:18.950> very<00:03:19.850> very<00:03:20.120> strong<00:03:20.660> way<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.200> very

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
a very very very strong way and very

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.170 
a very very very strong way and very
personal<00:03:21.890> way<00:03:22.040> it's<00:03:22.280> almost<00:03:22.550> like<00:03:22.760> your<00:03:23.150> own

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180

armoury<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.410> because<00:03:24.770> of<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.160> thought<00:03:25.640> if

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
armoury so because of that I thought if

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.310 
armoury so because of that I thought if
you<00:03:25.970> have<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.209> tattoo<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.989> want<00:03:27.170> to
