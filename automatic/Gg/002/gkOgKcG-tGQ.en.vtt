00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:11.819
 add via command line 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.160
 you must first access the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:21.659
 server handling then I will dictate the command 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.430

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.519
 seconds 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.470
 the client I think is much faster 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.569
 than it graphical interface 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.959
