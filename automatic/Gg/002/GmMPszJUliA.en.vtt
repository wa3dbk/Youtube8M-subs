curve<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.710> stop<00:03:29.370> there<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.260> then<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
curve and stop there and then in the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.760 
curve and stop there and then in the
middle<00:03:32.460> of<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.090> I'm<00:03:33.540> going<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.350> start<00:03:34.590> down

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
middle of that I I'm going to start down

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.320 
middle of that I I'm going to start down
here<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:35.490> go<00:03:35.730> straight<00:03:36.150> down<00:03:37.820> okay

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
here and go straight down okay

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.280 
here and go straight down okay
now<00:03:39.960> that<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:41.220> one<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.700> legs<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.420> right

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
now that is one of the legs and right

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.130 
now that is one of the legs and right
here<00:03:43.710> is<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.310> test<00:03:45.230> coming<00:03:46.230> down<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:47.040> curve

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
here is the test coming down in a curve

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.750 
here is the test coming down in a curve
and<00:03:49.850> all<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.300> way<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.780> far

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
and all the way that far

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.500 
and all the way that far
okay<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:54.030> other<00:03:54.060> leg<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:56.400> says<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.030> legs

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
okay the other leg it says that the legs

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.760 
okay the other leg it says that the legs
are<00:03:57.959> slender<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.750> that's<00:04:00.750> exactly<00:04:01.440> how<00:04:01.590> we're

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
are slender so that's exactly how we're

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.680 
are slender so that's exactly how we're
going<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.010> make<00:04:02.220> them<00:04:02.580> all<00:04:04.070> right<00:04:05.070> now<00:04:05.690> curb

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
going to make them all right now curb

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.440 
going to make them all right now curb
their<00:04:07.340> start<00:04:08.340> here<00:04:08.459> make<00:04:09.150> an<00:04:09.330> oval<00:04:09.959> there<00:04:10.920> and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
their start here make an oval there and

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.250 
their start here make an oval there and
then<00:04:12.450> enlarge<00:04:13.020> it<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:14.190> come<00:04:14.640> up

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
then enlarge it and come up

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.410 
then enlarge it and come up
there<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.130> go<00:04:17.450> now<00:04:19.520> jump<00:04:20.520> over<00:04:20.760> from<00:04:21.210> these

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
there you go now jump over from these

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.520 
there you go now jump over from these
clumps<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:22.140> fur<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:23.340> make<00:04:23.640> a<00:04:23.670> nice<00:04:24.530> curved

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
clumps of fur and make a nice curved

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.980 
clumps of fur and make a nice curved
line<00:04:26.430> like<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.230> then<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.070> tail<00:04:30.920> is<00:04:31.920> forked

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
line like so and then the tail is forked

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.940 
line like so and then the tail is forked
we're<00:04:33.990> going<00:04:34.170> to<00:04:34.230> come<00:04:34.440> up<00:04:34.680> like<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:37.680> gets

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
we're going to come up like this it gets

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.690 
we're going to come up like this it gets
its<00:04:38.160> psychic<00:04:38.760> abilities<00:04:39.570> its<00:04:40.410> tail<00:04:40.920> vibrates

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
its psychic abilities its tail vibrates

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.620 
its psychic abilities its tail vibrates
which<00:04:42.630> i<00:04:42.780> think<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:43.110> very<00:04:43.230> cool<00:04:43.760> it's<00:04:44.760> split<00:04:45.360> at

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
which i think is very cool it's split at

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.990 
which i think is very cool it's split at
the<00:04:45.810> end<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:50.270> come<00:04:51.270> back<00:04:51.570> in<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.970> make<00:04:53.970> it

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
the end and come back in and make it

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.030 
the end and come back in and make it
nice<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:57.440> parallel<00:04:59.180> okay<00:05:00.470> here<00:05:01.470> is<00:05:01.590> our<00:05:01.740> line

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
nice and parallel okay here is our line

but<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.880> reflection<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.510> light<00:05:39.680> I'm<00:05:40.680> going<00:05:40.920> to

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
but the reflection of light I'm going to

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.360 
but the reflection of light I'm going to
take<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.250> black<00:05:41.550> marker<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.770> I<00:05:43.770> am<00:05:43.950> going<00:05:44.310> to

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
take a black marker and I am going to

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.330 
take a black marker and I am going to
put<00:05:44.580> some<00:05:44.850> lines<00:05:45.570> in<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.830> wall<00:05:47.450> accent<00:05:49.340> this

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
put some lines in that wall accent this

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.940 
put some lines in that wall accent this
a<00:05:50.960> spin

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
a spin

00:05:52.950 --> 00:06:00.580 
a spin
adding<00:05:53.760> some<00:05:54.000> black<00:05:54.530> to<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.680> eyes

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.550 

okay<00:06:01.070> makes<00:06:01.670> a<00:06:01.820> big<00:06:02.000> difference<00:06:05.290> I'm<00:06:06.290> also

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
okay makes a big difference I'm also

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.210 
okay makes a big difference I'm also
adding<00:06:07.040> a<00:06:07.460> little<00:06:07.700> black<00:06:09.160> to<00:06:10.160> inside<00:06:10.640> the<00:06:10.670> ears

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
adding a little black to inside the ears

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.430 
adding a little black to inside the ears
just<00:06:13.220> on<00:06:13.490> the<00:06:13.640> top<00:06:16.630> that's<00:06:17.630> darker<00:06:18.200> there

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
just on the top that's darker there

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.630 
just on the top that's darker there
because<00:06:18.940> the<00:06:19.940> ear<00:06:20.240> is<00:06:20.630> actually<00:06:21.290> deeper<00:06:21.800> right

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
because the ear is actually deeper right

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.000 
because the ear is actually deeper right
there<00:06:22.940> all<00:06:23.780> right<00:06:23.840> now<00:06:24.230> we've<00:06:24.440> got<00:06:24.650> some<00:06:24.890> more

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
there all right now we've got some more

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.540 
there all right now we've got some more
shading<00:06:25.580> to<00:06:25.910> do<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:26.710> then<00:06:27.710> I<00:06:27.950> think<00:06:28.250> that

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
shading to do and then I think that

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.330 
shading to do and then I think that
would<00:06:28.970> be<00:06:29.030> very<00:06:29.480> close<00:06:29.750> to<00:06:30.050> finishing<00:06:30.340> I'm

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
would be very close to finishing I'm

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.030 
would be very close to finishing I'm
gonna<00:06:31.670> do<00:06:31.910> some<00:06:32.240> shading<00:06:32.690> and<00:06:33.560> then<00:06:33.830> it's

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
gonna do some shading and then it's

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.510 
gonna do some shading and then it's
going<00:06:34.190> to<00:06:34.280> be<00:06:34.630> under<00:06:35.630> the<00:06:35.660> head<00:06:36.310> because<00:06:37.310> the

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
going to be under the head because the

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.590 
going to be under the head because the
head<00:06:37.730> casts<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.450> shadow<00:06:38.480> there<00:06:39.280> and<00:06:40.600> the

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
head casts a shadow there and the

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.870 
head casts a shadow there and the
underbelly<00:06:42.290> and<00:06:43.720> this<00:06:44.720> leg<00:06:45.220> actually<00:06:46.220> I<00:06:46.460> can

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 
underbelly and this leg actually I can
