hello and welcome to PvP scar tutorials

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.820 
hello and welcome to PvP scar tutorials
today<00:00:09.719> I'm<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.110> be<00:00:10.170> teaching<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.740> the

basics of what it what it is quite

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.919 
basics of what it what it is quite
simple<00:00:14.250> indeed<00:00:14.400> um<00:00:14.849> yeah<00:00:15.509> there's<00:00:15.809> nothing

else you really need apart from a wooden

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.240 
else you really need apart from a wooden
axe<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.720> yeah<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.470> that's<00:00:19.770> not<00:00:20.039> really

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
axe and yeah just that's not really

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.250 
axe and yeah just that's not really
necessary<00:00:20.539> warden<00:00:21.539> axes<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
necessary warden axes are on the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.349 
necessary warden axes are on the
necessary<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.340> helps<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.880> benefit

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
necessary this is what helps you benefit

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.170 
necessary this is what helps you benefit
your<00:00:24.539> server<00:00:24.810> by<00:00:25.080> simplifying<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.849> building

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
your server by simplifying the building

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.660 
your server by simplifying the building
process<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.840> shortens<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.010> length<00:00:29.310> of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
process it shortens down the length of

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.630 
process it shortens down the length of
time<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.510> trying<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.410> create<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.890> super

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
time of trying to create like super

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.950 
time of trying to create like super
logic<00:00:33.090> skyscrapers<00:00:34.219> etc<00:00:35.219> ok<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
logic skyscrapers etc ok this is the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
logic skyscrapers etc ok this is the
basic<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.250> say<00:00:38.640> well<00:00:39.000> does<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.270> say

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
basic just like say well does it say

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.770 
basic just like say well does it say
your<00:00:40.200> left<00:00:40.440> click<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> location<00:00:41.600> when<00:00:42.600> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
your left click on a location when that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
your left click on a location when that
happens<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.440> should<00:00:43.620> say<00:00:43.800> first<00:00:44.129> position<00:00:44.640> set

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
happens it should say first position set

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.670 
happens it should say first position set
to<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> coordinates<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.350> air<00:00:46.500> bubble

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to the coordinates like an air bubble

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
to the coordinates like an air bubble
then<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.300> should<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.230> click

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
then you should you want to right click

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
then you should you want to right click
on<00:00:49.649> another<00:00:49.980> location<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.940> will<00:00:51.030> say<00:00:51.180> second

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
on another location that will say second

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
on another location that will say second
position<00:00:51.989> set<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> coordinates<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.250> what

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
position set to the coordinates but what

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.319 
position set to the coordinates but what
then<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.420> end<00:00:54.570> word<00:00:54.780> says<00:00:55.020> 80<00:00:55.379> around<00:00:56.329> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
then of the end word says 80 around that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.040 
then of the end word says 80 around that
or<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.199> yeah<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.920> um<00:00:59.359> well<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
or this yeah that's um well what that is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.810 
or this yeah that's um well what that is
is<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.250> tells<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:02.670> many

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
is it's like it tells you how many

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
is it's like it tells you how many
blocks<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.899> yeah<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:05.010> helps

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
blocks are there so yeah it also helps

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.020 
blocks are there so yeah it also helps
slow<00:01:05.909> Josette's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.689> 90<00:01:07.310> don't<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.430> mining<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
slow Josette's a 90 don't know mining is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
slow Josette's a 90 don't know mining is
a<00:01:09.240> 90<00:01:09.780> wait<00:01:10.549> I<00:01:11.549> try<00:01:12.240> 98<00:01:12.720> yet<00:01:14.030> 98<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.420> um<00:01:15.890> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
a 90 wait I try 98 yet 98 is um the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.760 
a 90 wait I try 98 yet 98 is um the
coordinate<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> numbers<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.770> numerals

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
coordinate all the numbers of numerals

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.060 
coordinate all the numbers of numerals
smooth<00:01:20.100> stone<00:01:20.430> bricks<00:01:20.810> now<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.500> this

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
smooth stone bricks now you can this

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.910 
smooth stone bricks now you can this
helps<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.549> lot<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:24.150> ya<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.140> may<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.560> too<00:01:25.799> many

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
helps a lot see ya you may need too many

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.770 
helps a lot see ya you may need too many
items<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.670> use<00:01:26.850> telling<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
items you can use telling you this is

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260 
items you can use telling you this is
like<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.170> too<00:01:28.350> many<00:01:28.500> items<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:29.150> because<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
like a too many items in because you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.880 
like a too many items in because you
need<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> code<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.439> don't<00:01:31.650> always

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
need the code but you you don't always

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.190 
need the code but you you don't always
have<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.220> use<00:01:32.369> code<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.329> he<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.720> /<00:01:34.020> I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
have to use code so you like he do / I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.050 
have to use code so you like he do / I
set<00:01:34.700> glass<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.210> stuff<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.750> yet<00:01:37.350> does<00:01:37.680> that

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
set glass and stuff and yet does that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
set glass and stuff and yet does that
what's<00:01:39.060> down<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.479> yeah<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.079> does<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
what's down there yeah it does but that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.060 
what's down there yeah it does but that
stuff<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.150> um<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.409> also<00:01:43.560> set<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.979> to
