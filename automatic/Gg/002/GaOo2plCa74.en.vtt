00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.480 
pound that's to 14 to 14 to 20 and and
condition<00:02:35.300> wise<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.870> may<00:02:36.710> be<00:02:36.770> could<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.250> a

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
condition wise I may be could it be a

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.840 
condition wise I may be could it be a
touch<00:02:38.180> touch<00:02:38.570> maybe<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.140> two<00:02:39.560> pound<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:40.610> that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
touch touch maybe to two pound like that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.810 
touch touch maybe to two pound like that
but<00:02:41.420> your<00:02:42.080> condition<00:02:42.470> was<00:02:42.530> good<00:02:42.800> they<00:02:42.950> made

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
but your condition was good they made

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.370 
but your condition was good they made
the<00:02:44.000> glutes<00:02:44.209> win<00:02:44.570> but<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.870> would<00:02:45.080> have<00:02:45.170> liked

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
the glutes win but I would have liked

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.000 
the glutes win but I would have liked
them<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:47.020> but<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.050> think<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.620> do<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:48.980> I

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
them really in but I think to do that I

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.410 
them really in but I think to do that I
might<00:02:49.250> affect<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.550> risk<00:02:49.670> lose<00:02:50.030> them<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.209> little

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
might affect the risk lose them a little

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.420 
might affect the risk lose them a little
bit<00:02:50.510> too<00:02:50.810> much<00:02:51.020> muscle<00:02:51.260> tissue<00:02:51.500> now<00:02:52.160> I'm<00:02:52.250> not

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
bit too much muscle tissue now I'm not

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.680 
bit too much muscle tissue now I'm not
one<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.580> those<00:02:52.730> people<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.090> goes<00:02:53.240> oh<00:02:53.450> I've

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
one of those people that goes oh I've

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.330 
one of those people that goes oh I've
got<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.930> keep<00:02:54.080> my<00:02:54.200> size<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:55.280> is

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
got to keep my size but it is

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.490 
got to keep my size but it is
bodybuilding<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.510> are<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:56.959> not<00:02:57.050> skinny<00:02:57.350> guys

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
bodybuilding we are it's not skinny guys

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.530 
bodybuilding we are it's not skinny guys
on<00:02:57.709> stage<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:58.730> think<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.180> found<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.420> I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
on stage so I think I found that I

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.850 
on stage so I think I found that I
balanced<00:02:59.870> on<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.050> day<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.500> terms<00:03:00.560> of

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
balanced on the day in terms of

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.320 
balanced on the day in terms of
cognition<00:03:01.100> versus<00:03:01.610> size<00:03:01.790> so<00:03:02.540> yeah<00:03:04.030> it's<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.090> six

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
cognition versus size so yeah it's a six

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.500 
cognition versus size so yeah it's a six
foot<00:03:05.450> two<00:03:05.600> to<00:03:06.350> 14<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.520> here<00:03:07.730> at<00:03:07.850> gold<00:03:08.060> star<00:03:08.120> gym

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.150 
foot two to 14 so here at gold star gym
which<00:03:08.690> arguably<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.140> one<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.440> best<00:03:09.620> gyms
