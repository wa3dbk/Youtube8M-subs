00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
that about it's actually a quite

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.960 
that about it's actually a quite
difficult<00:03:36.360> haircutting<00:03:37.350> technique<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.400> made

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
difficult haircutting technique you made

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.259 
difficult haircutting technique you made
three<00:03:39.750> or<00:03:39.780> four<00:03:40.130> triangles<00:03:41.130> at<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.820> top<00:03:42.030> and

three or four triangles at the top and

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.890 
three or four triangles at the top and
then<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.980> make<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.220> now<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.269> good<00:03:45.420> second<00:03:45.720> ago

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
then you make a now it's good second ago

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.040 
then you make a now it's good second ago
you<00:03:46.080> maple<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.070> stationary<00:03:47.670> guide<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.420> pull

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
you maple a stationary guide so you pull

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.320 
you maple a stationary guide so you pull
all<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.470> hair<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.890> one<00:03:50.100> place<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.940> gets

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
all the hair to one place so it gets

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.650 
all the hair to one place so it gets
longer<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.140> the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
longer in the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.980 
longer in the
in<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:54.430> other<00:03:54.670> side<00:03:54.820> because<00:03:55.000> it's<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.840> way

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
in the other side because it's the way

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.080 
in the other side because it's the way
that<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.440> hair<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.620> flowing<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.550> that's<00:03:57.850> why

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
that the hair is flowing so that's why

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.610 
that the hair is flowing so that's why
it<00:03:58.150> has<00:03:58.570> some<00:03:58.750> more<00:04:00.300> texture<00:04:01.300> and<00:04:01.600> it's<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.410> has

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
it has some more texture and it's it has

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.740 
it has some more texture and it's it has
too<00:04:02.770> much<00:04:02.890> fill<00:04:03.190> in<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.460> hair<00:04:03.610> it<00:04:04.420> looks

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
too much fill in the hair it looks

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.810 
too much fill in the hair it looks
really<00:04:05.050> great<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.290> think<00:04:05.650> it's<00:04:06.400> one<00:04:06.580> of<00:04:06.610> the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820
