 in this video I will tell about the children's album 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.390
 this is not just an album this is an album which 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:21.699
 can fill for ten years then 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:25.630
 There are only 12 here turns on 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:28.859
 each turn has ten identical 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:35.110
 questions that can be filled 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:39.840
 every year year after year means wish 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.970
 the customer were in that the album was 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.200
 interesting but it was not there 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.840
 abundance of angel flowers ryushechek 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.530

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.880
 in their hands and used habits and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.969
 famous means 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.749
 the album was very voluminous therefore 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:22.060
 it is difficult to fasten on rings so I 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:27.009
 fastened him to such twines 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.509
 it turned out quite a mischievous mean on 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.819

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.069
 sovushki means cover is soft 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.909
