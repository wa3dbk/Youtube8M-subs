00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the history books he would probably

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.150 
the history books he would probably
mention<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.260> he<00:00:52.350> doesn't<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.980> at

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

mention that but he doesn't get to be at
the<00:00:53.340> actual<00:00:53.699> ceremony<00:00:54.199> hopefully<00:00:55.199> he<00:00:55.320> still

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530

gets<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.980> medal<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.489> mean<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:56.820> he

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
gets a medal I mean just because he

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
gets a medal I mean just because he
wasn't<00:00:57.239> able<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> time<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.559> sure

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
wasn't able to be there a time I'm sure

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.830 
wasn't able to be there a time I'm sure
he<00:00:59.129> still<00:00:59.340> gets<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.879> would<00:01:00.359> hope<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.539> anyway

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
he still gets it I would hope so anyway

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.810 
he still gets it I would hope so anyway
that's<00:01:00.989> only<00:01:01.199> fair<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> him<00:01:01.620> he's<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.670> third

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that's only fair to him he's at third

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
that's only fair to him he's at third
place<00:01:03.030> Todoroki<00:01:03.690> second<00:01:04.080> Vargo<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.680> first<00:01:05.280> and

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.140 
get to see that that should be pretty
interesting<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.520> seems<00:04:38.580> like<00:04:38.820> even<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
interesting it seems like even the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.490 
interesting it seems like even the
nurses<00:04:39.330> there<00:04:39.690> when<00:04:39.840> he<00:04:39.960> was<00:04:40.080> checking<00:04:40.229> into

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
nurses there when he was checking into

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.499 
nurses there when he was checking into
the<00:04:40.560> hospital<00:04:40.710> were<00:04:41.100> like<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:42.090> one<00:04:42.300> with

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
the hospital were like that one with

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.600 
the hospital were like that one with
ears<00:04:42.870> or<00:04:43.139> whatever<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.560> was<00:04:43.590> like<00:04:43.800> whoa<00:04:44.070> they

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
ears or whatever it was like whoa they

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.790 
ears or whatever it was like whoa they
probably<00:04:44.820> suck<00:04:45.060> told<00:04:45.240> her<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.900> he<00:04:46.229> was<00:04:46.350> he

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
probably suck told her that he was he

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.560 
probably suck told her that he was he
probably<00:04:46.979> told<00:04:47.190> them<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.550> he<00:04:47.669> was<00:04:47.699> her<00:04:48.300> son

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
probably told them that he was her son

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.659 
probably told them that he was her son
and<00:04:48.750> they're<00:04:48.870> like<00:04:48.990> oh<00:04:49.229> shit<00:04:49.410> he<00:04:50.310> hadn't<00:04:50.580> been

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
and they're like oh shit he hadn't been

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.100 
and they're like oh shit he hadn't been
to<00:04:50.820> see<00:04:51.000> her<00:04:51.120> ever<00:04:51.419> since<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.080> happened

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
to see her ever since it happened

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.960 
to see her ever since it happened
because<00:04:52.500> he<00:04:52.650> was<00:04:53.130> like<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.370> cause<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.610> all<00:04:53.940> of

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
because he was like the cause of all of

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.939 
because he was like the cause of all of
it<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:54.210> he<00:04:54.270> didn't<00:04:54.449> want<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.710> push<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.740> any

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
it so he didn't want to push it any

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.740 
it so he didn't want to push it any
further<00:04:56.070> but<00:04:56.970> he's<00:04:57.150> going<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.389> see<00:04:57.509> her<00:04:57.630> now

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
further but he's going to see her now

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.820 
further but he's going to see her now
and<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:57.900> think<00:04:58.080> that's<00:04:58.229> good<00:04:58.410> that's<00:04:58.620> going<00:04:58.770> to

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
and I think that's good that's going to

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.980 
and I think that's good that's going to
be<00:04:59.009> a<00:04:59.039> major<00:04:59.759> thing<00:05:00.030> in<00:05:00.210> helping<00:05:00.509> him<00:05:00.690> figure

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
be a major thing in helping him figure

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.409 
be a major thing in helping him figure
out<00:05:01.050> what<00:05:01.380> he<00:05:01.500> needs<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:01.800> do<00:05:02.099> and<00:05:02.400> then<00:05:02.970> we<00:05:03.120> have

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
out what he needs to do and then we have

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.240 
out what he needs to do and then we have
me<00:05:03.840> Turia<00:05:04.169> he's<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.740> only<00:05:04.860> one<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.009> haven't

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
have to figure out another way to use

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.400 
have to figure out another way to use
this<00:05:17.520> which<00:05:17.699> is<00:05:18.090> good<00:05:18.300> I've<00:05:18.539> been<00:05:18.960> wondering

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
this which is good I've been wondering

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.499 
this which is good I've been wondering
the<00:05:19.680> whole<00:05:19.770> time<00:05:20.099> how<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.430> hell<00:05:20.820> he<00:05:21.240> can't

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
the whole time how the hell he can't

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
going on where he's got like previous

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.029 
going on where he's got like previous
users<00:05:27.389> in<00:05:27.570> his<00:05:27.750> mind<00:05:28.020> or<00:05:28.259> something<00:05:28.380> I<00:05:28.800> don't

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
users in his mind or something I don't

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.980 
users in his mind or something I don't
know<00:05:29.220> what<00:05:29.430> how<00:05:30.030> that's<00:05:30.210> gonna<00:05:30.419> play<00:05:30.539> into<00:05:30.960> it

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
know what how that's gonna play into it

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.390

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
but he's got to figure out his own

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.730 
but he's got to figure out his own
unique<00:05:32.729> way<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.180> use<00:05:33.599> this<00:05:33.780> thing<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.229> make<00:05:34.289> it

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
unique way to use this thing and make it

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.870 
unique way to use this thing and make it
