00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
seeds well it just so happens that I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.439 
seeds well it just so happens that I
saved<00:00:46.629> this<00:00:47.629> one<00:00:47.839> from<00:00:48.080> last<00:00:48.320> year<00:00:48.739> I<00:00:49.239> just<00:00:50.239> let

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
saved this one from last year I just let

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.149 
saved this one from last year I just let
it<00:00:50.479> go<00:00:50.629> on<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.019> vine<00:00:51.320> until<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:54.350> got<00:00:54.530> hard<00:00:54.920> it

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
it go on the vine until it got hard it

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.399 
it go on the vine until it got hard it
gets<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:55.699> guess<00:00:56.150> it's<00:00:56.420> kind<00:00:56.780> of<00:00:56.870> like<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:56.989> gourd

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409

gets I guess it's kind of like a gourd
it<00:00:57.920> gets<00:00:58.909> real<00:00:59.239> woody<00:00:59.570> if<00:01:00.019> you<00:01:00.140> leave<00:01:00.320> it<00:01:00.470> on

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
it gets real woody if you leave it on

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:09.090 
it gets real woody if you leave it on
too<00:01:00.830> long<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.750> it's<00:01:02.750> just<00:01:05.560> filled<00:01:06.560> with<00:01:06.860> seeds

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
too long and it's just filled with seeds

too long and it's just filled with seeds
seed<00:01:10.100> saving<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:12.070> something<00:01:13.070> people<00:01:13.310> ought<00:01:13.670> to

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
seed saving is something people ought to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.999 
seed saving is something people ought to
really<00:01:15.380> consider<00:01:18.520> I'm<00:01:19.520> slowly<00:01:20.180> moving<00:01:21.009> to

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
really consider I'm slowly moving to

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.080 
really consider I'm slowly moving to
more<00:01:22.219> open<00:01:22.880> pollinated<00:01:23.659> heirloom<00:01:24.229> varieties

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
more open pollinated heirloom varieties

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.550 
more open pollinated heirloom varieties
that<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.119> can<00:01:26.539> save<00:01:26.990> my<00:01:27.259> seeds<00:01:29.409> because<00:01:30.409> with

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
that I can save my seeds because with

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.969 
that I can save my seeds because with
everything<00:01:31.009> going<00:01:31.399> on<00:01:31.579> in<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.909> world<00:01:32.179> today

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
everything going on in the world today

everything going on in the world today
people<00:01:35.079> really<00:01:36.079> don't<00:01:36.320> know<00:01:36.500> what<00:01:36.710> they

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
people really don't know what they

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:43.060 
people really don't know what they
expect<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:39.140> it'd<00:01:39.350> be<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> good<00:01:39.829> idea<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.920> be

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
expect so it'd be a good idea to to be

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.459 
expect so it'd be a good idea to to be
prepared<00:01:45.640> now<00:01:46.640> what<00:01:46.850> I'm<00:01:46.939> gonna<00:01:47.060> do<00:01:47.390> I'm<00:01:48.289> gonna

cut it and I don't know three or four

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.309 
cut it and I don't know three or four
pieces<00:01:54.499> so<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.429> can<00:01:55.640> get<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.030> seeds<00:01:56.299> inside

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.569 

alright<00:02:00.319> let's<00:02:00.530> see<00:02:00.710> what<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.009> seeds<00:02:01.249> look

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
alright let's see what the seeds look

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.840 
alright let's see what the seeds look
like

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:21.759 

so<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:04.939> can<00:02:05.119> get<00:02:05.270> them<00:02:05.420> out<00:02:20.110> they<00:02:21.110> kind<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.530> step

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
so I can get them out they kind of step

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:39.699 
so I can get them out they kind of step
to<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.069> sides<00:02:26.709> they're<00:02:27.709> coming<00:02:28.069> out

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:03:16.270 

kinda<00:02:40.709> reminds<00:02:41.069> me<00:02:41.219> of<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.430> loss<00:02:41.670> Ness

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.740 

okay<00:03:17.280> now<00:03:17.550> I'm<00:03:17.670> gonna<00:03:17.819> start<00:03:18.030> picking<00:03:18.300> through

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
okay now I'm gonna start picking through

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.240 
okay now I'm gonna start picking through
all<00:03:18.900> these<00:03:19.230> all<00:03:20.069> this<00:03:20.430> mess<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:22.319> getting<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
all these all this mess and getting the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.280 
all these all this mess and getting the
seeds<00:03:23.519> out<00:03:25.970> pretty<00:03:26.970> big<00:03:27.209> seeds<00:03:27.540> by<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.930> way<00:03:30.290> so

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
seeds out pretty big seeds by the way so

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.839 
seeds out pretty big seeds by the way so
when<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.620> plant<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.280> need<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.519> put<00:03:32.700> them<00:03:32.790> down

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
when you plant you need to put them down

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:42.650 
when you plant you need to put them down
about<00:03:33.709> or<00:03:34.709> at<00:03:35.010> least<00:03:35.190> an<00:03:35.340> inch<00:03:35.489> deep

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.530 

saving<00:03:43.660> just<00:03:44.550> one<00:03:45.550> of<00:03:45.700> these<00:03:45.849> one<00:03:46.840> kakuzu<00:03:48.540> I'll

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
saving just one of these one kakuzu I'll

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.390 
give you a whole the seeds you need in
order<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.860> make<00:04:00.069> sure<00:04:00.130> these<00:04:00.700> seeds<00:04:01.030> are<00:04:01.209> good

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
order to make sure these seeds are good

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.100 
order to make sure these seeds are good
I'm<00:04:03.400> going<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.760> plant<00:04:04.000> three<00:04:04.330> or<00:04:04.420> four<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:04.930> them

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.430 

and<00:04:08.110> see<00:04:09.069> if<00:04:09.160> they'll<00:04:09.340> germinate<00:04:13.140> I'm<00:04:14.140> just

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
and see if they'll germinate I'm just

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.340 
and see if they'll germinate I'm just
pushing<00:04:14.709> them<00:04:14.890> down<00:04:15.160> in<00:04:15.459> here<00:04:17.280> nothing<00:04:18.280> fancy

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.190 

naturally<00:04:23.910> I'm<00:04:24.910> gonna<00:04:25.240> water<00:04:25.510> them<00:04:25.720> in<00:04:25.900> real

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
naturally I'm gonna water them in real

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.379 
naturally I'm gonna water them in real
well

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
well

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.930 
well

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
put them on my eating might cuz it's

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.200 
put them on my eating might cuz it's
still<00:04:31.120> cold<00:04:31.389> right<00:04:31.810> now<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:33.729> see<00:04:34.000> if<00:04:34.090> they

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
still cold right now and see if they

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:42.470 
still cold right now and see if they
germinate

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.980 

two<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.200> them<00:04:43.350> came<00:04:43.560> up<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.190> have<00:04:44.430> at<00:04:44.610> least

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
two of them came up so we have at least

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.190 
two of them came up so we have at least
at<00:04:45.990> least<00:04:46.710> a<00:04:47.100> 50%<00:04:48.680> germination<00:04:49.680> rate<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.930> we

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
at least a 50% germination rate so we

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.850 
at least a 50% germination rate so we
are<00:04:52.380> good<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.830> go<00:04:53.220> with<00:04:53.250> kakuzu<00:04:54.030> this<00:04:54.390> year
