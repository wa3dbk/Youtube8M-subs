00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.000
 welcome back friends music of you have them 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.799
 just heard a beautiful song that 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.220
 made the history of disco music le 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.909
 freak 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.759
 the authors are the group the chic a little 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.450
 a word game this beautiful 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.970
 song is based on a simple riff 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.570
 simple then not much played on one 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.460
 typical rhythm of funky ie in 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.190
 sixteenths where they are very present 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.470
 these accents executed both with 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.600
 detached notes both with known ribs 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.759
 both with breaks combining them on one 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.659
 rhythmic in sixteenths often come 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.310
 also complex figures have given 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.649
 life just in this kind of 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.280
 discomusic born a few years earlier with 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.530
 other groups like the meters then and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.069
 volumes has evolved over the years 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.810
 with so many other groups in short that they have 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.770
 especially had a great fortune 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.019
 in nightclubs 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.420
 at the time there was no dj with the disc 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.200
 there was the group that played and played 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.530
 just this kind of disco music here 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.660
 therefore practice a lot with timing 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.549
 the execution of every single sixteenth 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.470
 with ghost breaks possibly with 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.700
 some small changes as I did 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.250
 in the video you just saw for 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.500
 take good control over the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.370
 rhythmic mainly also have one 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.680
 enjoy the reading 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.930
 not just to play the chic as far as 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.850
 in short, they are a great group with gods 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.120
 beautiful songs like the one we have 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.380
 just heard so good study but 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.880
 also and above all good fun 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.880
 hello and see you soon
