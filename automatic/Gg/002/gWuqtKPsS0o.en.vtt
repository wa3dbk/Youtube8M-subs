00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.259 

so<00:01:03.010> here's<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.400> couple<00:01:03.700> of<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.880> lighting

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
so here's a couple of the lighting

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.370 
so here's a couple of the lighting
patterns<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.400> all<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.760> good<00:01:07.000> stuff<00:01:10.380> switch

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
patterns and all that good stuff switch

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:27.670 
patterns and all that good stuff switch
tonight<00:01:11.680> here

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.440 

so<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.770> doesn't<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.220> wig<00:01:29.520> wigs<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.120> front

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so it doesn't have wig wigs on the front

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
so it doesn't have wig wigs on the front
it<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.840> has<00:01:31.080> um<00:01:32.990> two<00:01:33.990> pinkies<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> turn

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it just has um two pinkies and the turn

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.680 
it just has um two pinkies and the turn
signals<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.720> i<00:01:37.340> think<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.640> looks<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.510> fine

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
signals which i think is looks just fine

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.910 
signals which i think is looks just fine
and<00:01:40.080> then<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.440> has<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
and then it has a

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.160 
and then it has a
one<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.220> side<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.729> push<00:01:44.479> bar<00:01:44.720> one<00:01:45.140> a

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
one on that side of the push bar one a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.660 
one on that side of the push bar one a
near<00:01:45.500> all<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.159> yeah<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.460> can<00:01:46.729> see<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.299> I

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
near all that yeah you can see it so I

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.090 
near all that yeah you can see it so I
do<00:01:49.670> like<00:01:50.000> how<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.299> tail<00:01:50.600> lights<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.140> reverse

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:03.840 
do like how the tail lights and reverse
lights<00:01:52.369> flash<00:01:52.670> that's<00:01:53.030> nice<00:01:55.330> so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.060 

this<00:02:04.510> is<00:02:04.659> what<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:04.869> was<00:02:05.229> setting<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.890> would
