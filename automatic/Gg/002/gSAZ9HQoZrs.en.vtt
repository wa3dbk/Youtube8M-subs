00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
we're going to talk about the my cloud

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.640 
we're going to talk about the my cloud
the<00:00:12.000> my<00:00:12.120> cloud<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> latest<00:00:13.019> personal

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the my cloud is the latest personal

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.430 
the my cloud is the latest personal
cloud<00:00:13.799> storage<00:00:14.190> from<00:00:14.309> WD<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.929> basically

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
cloud storage from WD and and basically

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.300 
cloud storage from WD and and basically
it's<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.980> 2<00:00:17.760> 3<00:00:18.150> or<00:00:18.300> 4<00:00:18.570> terabyte<00:00:19.050> hard<00:00:19.289> drive<00:00:19.590> but

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it's a 2 3 or 4 terabyte hard drive but

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.070 
it's a 2 3 or 4 terabyte hard drive but
