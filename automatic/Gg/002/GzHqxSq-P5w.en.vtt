00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.859 

so<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.580> assign<00:00:17.820> out<00:00:18.119> binary

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
so we have to assign out binary

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.420 
so we have to assign out binary
functions<00:00:19.350> for<00:00:19.590> these<00:00:19.770> though<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.279> are

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
functions for these though they are

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.570 
functions for these though they are
variables<00:00:21.119> okay<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.800> will<00:00:23.130> be<00:00:23.279> assuming

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
variables okay so I will be assuming

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.940 
variables okay so I will be assuming
some<00:00:24.090> conditions<00:00:24.599> for<00:00:24.660> these<00:00:24.960> output

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
some conditions for these output

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.670 
some conditions for these output
variables<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.520> that<00:00:26.550> our<00:00:27.150> robot<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:28.050> for

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
variables so that our robot for for

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.220 
variables so that our robot for for
going<00:00:29.070> straight<00:00:29.400> left<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.300> right<00:00:30.509> are<00:00:30.750> for

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
going straight left and right are for

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:45.889 
going straight left and right are for
the<00:00:31.650> robot<00:00:32.040> okay<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.970> let's<00:00:33.600> say<00:00:43.010> three<00:00:44.899> okay

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the robot okay so let's say three okay

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.639 
the robot okay so let's say three okay
so<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.679> are<00:00:46.859> m1<00:00:47.399> m1<00:00:47.699> one<00:00:48.359> motor<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
so they are m1 m1 one motor this is the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.829 
so they are m1 m1 one motor this is the
second<00:00:49.980> motor<00:00:50.190> okay<00:00:50.429> so<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.269> if<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.600> give

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
second motor okay so what if I give

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.900 
second motor okay so what if I give
something<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.649> 1<00:00:53.519> 0<00:00:54.050> 0<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.429> will<00:00:56.550> take<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
something like 1 0 0 so I will take it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.419 
something like 1 0 0 so I will take it
as<00:00:57.120> forward<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.769> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> hardware<00:00:59.370> I

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
as forward that is in the hardware I

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.160 
as forward that is in the hardware I
will<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.699> connected<00:01:00.089> it<00:01:00.269> like<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.989> so

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
will be connected it like this it so

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.810 
will be connected it like this it so
that<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.589> this<00:01:01.949> value<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.370> given<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that if this value is given to the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.720 
that if this value is given to the
motors<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.629> robot<00:01:03.870> will<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.170> forward<00:01:04.410> and<00:01:04.980> if

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
motors the robot will go forward and if

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.630 
motors the robot will go forward and if
one<00:01:06.120> zero<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.900> zero<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.440> given<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
one zero one zero is given it will go to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.720 
one zero one zero is given it will go to
the<00:01:08.850> right<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:10.020> 0<00:01:10.440> 1<00:01:10.650> 0<00:01:10.980> 1<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.220> given<00:01:11.400> it

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
the right and if 0 1 0 1 is given it

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.250 
the right and if 0 1 0 1 is given it
will<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> left<00:01:12.330> will<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.050> in

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
will go to the left will see that in

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.580 
will go to the left will see that in
detail<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.159> itself<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.350> checking<00:01:16.350> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
detail or here itself so checking this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.740 
detail or here itself so checking this
condition<00:01:17.100> ok<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.030> condition<00:01:18.509> comes

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
condition ok so this condition comes

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.590 
condition ok so this condition comes
when<00:01:19.140> let's<00:01:19.979> say<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> line<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
when let's say this is the line and this

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.440 
when let's say this is the line and this
is<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.899> robot<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.250> s<00:01:23.399> 1<00:01:23.430> s<00:01:23.850> 2<00:01:23.909> s

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
is the robot and this is your s 1 s 2 s

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.929 
is the robot and this is your s 1 s 2 s
3<00:01:24.509> right<00:01:25.170> s<00:01:25.470> 1<00:01:25.799> s<00:01:26.100> 2<00:01:26.159> s<00:01:27.119> 3<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.700> does

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
3 right s 1 s 2 s 3 right so when does

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.539 
3 right s 1 s 2 s 3 right so when does
this<00:01:30.240> 0<00:01:30.659> 0<00:01:30.960> 0<00:01:31.140> coming<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.430> three

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
this 0 0 0 coming when all the three

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.240 
this 0 0 0 coming when all the three
sensors<00:01:32.969> are<00:01:33.149> not<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.719> line<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.530> so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
sensors are not in the line right so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
sensors are not in the line right so
when<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.909> three<00:01:36.030> sensors<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.719> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
when all the three sensors are not in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
when all the three sensors are not in
the<00:01:36.930> line<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.530> will<00:01:37.799> tell<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> bot<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the line so I will tell the bot the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450 
the line so I will tell the bot the
robot<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.600> search<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.229> line<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.219> just

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
robot go search for the line so you just

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.719 
robot go search for the line so you just
give<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:41.880> normal<00:01:43.100> condition<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.219> for<00:01:44.369> towing

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
give one normal condition or for towing

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
give one normal condition or for towing
so<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.689> robot<00:01:45.840> will<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.350> turning<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
so that the robot will be turning and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.069 
so that the robot will be turning and
searching<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.759> line<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.930> ran

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
searching for the line so I just ran

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
searching for the line so I just ran
quite<00:01:49.259> rapidly<00:01:49.590> give<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.130> right<00:01:50.399> condition

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
quite rapidly give it as right condition

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.639 
quite rapidly give it as right condition
ok<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.719> I<00:01:51.750> will<00:01:52.049> take<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.560> 0<00:01:52.799> 1<00:01:53.009> 0<00:01:53.039> is<00:01:53.520> right

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
ok so I will take one is 0 1 0 is right

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.590 
ok so I will take one is 0 1 0 is right
that<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.770> robot<00:01:56.100> will<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.399> flowing<00:01:56.579> right<00:01:56.820> okay

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that is robot will be flowing right okay

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
that is robot will be flowing right okay
so<00:01:58.109> let's<00:01:58.649> say<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.549> now<00:01:59.700> coming<00:01:59.939> to

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
so let's say the and so now coming to

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
so let's say the and so now coming to
the<00:02:00.180> next<00:02:00.210> condition<00:02:00.659> 0<00:02:01.200> 0<00:02:01.500> 1<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the next condition 0 0 1 so this is the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.730 
the next condition 0 0 1 so this is the
condition<00:02:02.939> where<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> line<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
condition where we have a line to the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.099 
condition where we have a line to the
right<00:02:04.770> side<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:06.000> s<00:02:06.299> 3<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> black

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
right side that is s 3 is on the black

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.310 
right side that is s 3 is on the black
black<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.799> white<00:02:08.070> s<00:02:08.610> 3<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:09.030> giving<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.050> sensor

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
black on white s 3 is giving the sensor

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.200 
black on white s 3 is giving the sensor
S<00:02:10.470> 3<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.679> giving<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.130> serve<00:02:11.340> value<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.760> 1<00:02:12.030> which

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
S 3 is giving the serve value of 1 which

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.480 
S 3 is giving the serve value of 1 which
is<00:02:12.330> truth<00:02:12.720> value<00:02:13.080> which<00:02:13.290> means<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.800> s<00:02:14.220> 3

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
is truth value which means that s 3

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.800 
is truth value which means that s 3
sensor<00:02:15.030> has<00:02:15.330> sensed<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.900> black<00:02:16.170> line<00:02:16.500> okay<00:02:16.980> so

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
sensor has sensed the black line okay so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.630 
sensor has sensed the black line okay so
so<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.960> line<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.620> something<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
so the line is like something like the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.470 
so the line is like something like the
snow<00:02:20.970> only<00:02:21.510> thawed<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:23.040> s<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.640> sensor

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
snow only thawed so that s the sensor

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.710 
snow only thawed so that s the sensor
on<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.750> line<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.819> what<00:02:26.819> should<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.239> now

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
on the line so what should we do now

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.630 
on the line so what should we do now
the<00:02:27.959> robot<00:02:28.290> should<00:02:28.319> take<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.769> right<00:02:29.099> turn<00:02:29.310> right

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the robot should take a right turn right

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.089 
the robot should take a right turn right
so<00:02:30.269> again<00:02:30.750> keeping<00:02:31.049> her<00:02:31.319> right<00:02:31.560> down<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
so again keeping her right down to the

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.360 
so again keeping her right down to the
motors<00:02:32.489> what<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.879> zero<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.659> is<00:02:33.780> he<00:02:33.930> okay<00:02:34.920> no

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
motors what is zero what is he okay no

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.640 
motors what is zero what is he okay no
give<00:02:36.090> me<00:02:36.120> coming<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.840> third<00:02:37.170> condition

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
give me coming to the third condition

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.539 
give me coming to the third condition
one<00:02:37.980> zero<00:02:38.640> ones<00:02:39.200> or<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> condition<00:02:40.709> because<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
one zero ones or a condition because the

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.759 
one zero ones or a condition because the
line<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.269> center<00:02:42.629> part<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.440> robot

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
line is in the center part of the robot

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.979 
line is in the center part of the robot
so<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.099> robot<00:02:44.879> should<00:02:45.150> go<00:02:45.360> straight<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.930> a

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
so that robot should go straight in a

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.110 
so that robot should go straight in a
straight<00:02:46.230> manner<00:02:46.260> right<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> street

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
straight manner right so for the street

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.670 
straight manner right so for the street
condition<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.599> have<00:02:48.720> assumed<00:02:49.049> this<00:02:49.230> this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
condition I have assumed this this

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.839 
condition I have assumed this this
binary<00:02:50.459> value<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:52.489> zero<00:02:53.489> one<00:02:53.610> zero

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
binary value that is one zero one zero

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:03.440 
binary value that is one zero one zero
one<00:02:54.840> okay<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.120> forward<00:03:02.450> now

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
one okay so this is for forward now

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.199 
one okay so this is for forward now
coming<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.170> fourth<00:03:04.410> one<00:03:04.730> zero<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:05.910> month

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
coming to the fourth one zero one month

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.559 
coming to the fourth one zero one month
so<00:03:06.620> here<00:03:07.620> we<00:03:07.829> can<00:03:08.010> see<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.370> s2<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.090> s3<00:03:09.209> both

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
so here we can see that s2 and s3 both

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.140 
so here we can see that s2 and s3 both
are<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.900> black<00:03:10.739> tank

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
are in black tank

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.089 
are in black tank
all<00:03:12.150> right<00:03:12.359> condition<00:03:12.840> again<00:03:13.109> so<00:03:13.650> I'll<00:03:13.829> just

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
all right condition again so I'll just

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.039 
all right condition again so I'll just
give<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> right<00:03:14.640> condition<00:03:15.090> again<00:03:15.329> this<00:03:15.599> is<00:03:15.810> one

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
give a right condition again this is one

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.990 
give a right condition again this is one
zero<00:03:16.200> one<00:03:16.950> zero<00:03:17.310> right<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.890> now<00:03:20.700> I'm<00:03:20.849> coming

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
zero one zero right and now I'm coming

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.599 
zero one zero right and now I'm coming
to<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> fifth<00:03:21.540> one<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.859> one<00:03:23.099> zero<00:03:23.280> zero

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
to the fifth one this is one zero zero

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.020 
to the fifth one this is one zero zero
right<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.019> which<00:03:25.680> means<00:03:25.859> that<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.340> sensor<00:03:26.700> s1

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
right so which means that the sensor s1

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.589 
right so which means that the sensor s1
is<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.390> black<00:03:28.200> line<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.849> robot<00:03:30.359> should

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
is on black line so the robot should

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.080 
is on black line so the robot should
actually<00:03:30.870> take<00:03:31.319> a<00:03:31.380> left<00:03:31.739> turn<00:03:32.010> right<00:03:32.280> as<00:03:32.669> you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
actually take a left turn right as you

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.879 
actually take a left turn right as you
can<00:03:33.239> see<00:03:33.419> here<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.079> will<00:03:34.440> be<00:03:34.560> writing<00:03:34.859> the

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
can see here so I will be writing the

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.530 
can see here so I will be writing the
left<00:03:35.160> condition<00:03:35.639> for<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.910> motor<00:03:36.060> outputs

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
left condition for the motor outputs

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.830 
left condition for the motor outputs
here<00:03:36.720> then<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.530> condition<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.430> have<00:03:39.419> assumed

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
here then of condition is I have assumed

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.110 
here then of condition is I have assumed
this<00:03:39.930> has<00:03:40.169> zero<00:03:40.410> one<00:03:41.190> zero<00:03:41.400> one

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
this has zero one zero one

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.520 
this has zero one zero one
this<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:43.040> okay<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.700> now<00:03:45.139> coming<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.410> over

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
this is okay and now coming to the over

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.629 
this is okay and now coming to the over
sixty<00:03:46.859> this<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.549> 1<00:03:48.090> 0<00:03:48.120> 1<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:48.810> it's<00:03:49.620> like<00:03:49.799> this

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
sixty this is 1 0 1 so it's like this

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.729 
sixty this is 1 0 1 so it's like this
condition<00:03:51.419> is<00:03:51.569> ready<00:03:51.900> ready<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.230> come<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
condition is ready ready to come in a

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.309 
condition is ready ready to come in a
line<00:03:52.889> follower<00:03:53.310> robot<00:03:53.340> program<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.260> am

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
line follower robot program but I am

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.039 
line follower robot program but I am
gonna<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:55.889> don't<00:03:56.220> give<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.849> one<00:03:57.030> no<00:03:57.359> idea

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
gonna just don't give you one no idea

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.379 
gonna just don't give you one no idea
that<00:03:58.230> we<00:03:58.919> don't<00:03:59.130> have<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.400> line<00:03:59.609> in<00:03:59.819> center<00:04:00.180> but

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
that we don't have a line in center but

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.229 
that we don't have a line in center but
we<00:04:00.540> have<00:04:00.720> two<00:04:00.900> lines<00:04:01.109> or<00:04:01.639> either<00:04:02.639> of<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:03.030> sides

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
we have two lines or either of the sides

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.110 
we have two lines or either of the sides
so<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.319> I<00:04:04.680> could<00:04:05.160> really<00:04:05.400> choose<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.910> go<00:04:06.090> to

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
so I just I could really choose to go to

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.110 
so I just I could really choose to go to
right<00:04:06.569> even<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:06.959> we<00:04:07.109> have<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:08.730> know<00:04:08.790> turns

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
right even if we have to you know turns

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.030 
right even if we have to you know turns
okay<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.109> what<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.440> do<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.889> I<00:04:10.919> just<00:04:11.220> be<00:04:11.579> wearing

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
okay so what I do is I just be wearing

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.390 
okay so what I do is I just be wearing
one

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
one

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.930 
one
so<00:04:16.400> if<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:16.670> have<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:19.220> know<00:04:19.340> there<00:04:19.670> are

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
so if you have to you know there are

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.320 
so if you have to you know there are
branches<00:04:20.420> so<00:04:20.750> for<00:04:20.989> single<00:04:21.200> just<00:04:21.920> go<00:04:22.070> right<00:04:22.520> and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
branches so for single just go right and

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.300 
branches so for single just go right and
then<00:04:23.390> this<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:24.230> one<00:04:24.470> one<00:04:24.830> zero

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
then this is one one zero

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.300 
then this is one one zero
okay<00:04:25.670> one<00:04:26.270> one<00:04:26.420> zero<00:04:26.570> it's<00:04:26.840> like<00:04:26.990> we<00:04:27.290> have<00:04:27.470> s1

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
okay one one zero it's like we have s1

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.340 
okay one one zero it's like we have s1
and<00:04:28.460> s2<00:04:28.610> on<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.910> black<00:04:29.090> line<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:30.110> robot

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
and s2 on the black line so the robot

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.590 
and s2 on the black line so the robot
has<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.620> go<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:30.920> so<00:04:31.550> again<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.450> left

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
has to go that so again the left

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.900 
has to go that so again the left
position<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:33.080> 0<00:04:33.320> 1<00:04:33.500> 0<00:04:33.740> 1<00:04:35.710> we<00:04:36.710> have<00:04:36.920> 1<00:04:37.220> 1<00:04:37.250> 1<00:04:37.700> so

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
position is 0 1 0 1 we have 1 1 1 so

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.000 
position is 0 1 0 1 we have 1 1 1 so
this<00:04:38.210> means<00:04:38.450> that<00:04:38.630> all<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.170> or<00:04:39.500> three<00:04:39.680> sensors

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
this means that all the or three sensors

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.010 
this means that all the or three sensors
are<00:04:40.190> on<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.460> black<00:04:40.640> line<00:04:40.880> so<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.480> will<00:04:41.810> choose

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
are on the black line so I will choose

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.650 
are on the black line so I will choose
to<00:04:42.170> go<00:04:42.320> straight<00:04:42.740> okay<00:04:43.250> you<00:04:43.760> can<00:04:44.120> choose<00:04:44.300> it<00:04:44.510> to

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
to go straight okay you can choose it to

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.440 
to go straight okay you can choose it to
be<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:45.800> go<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:46.010> left<00:04:46.400> or<00:04:46.640> right<00:04:46.850> or<00:04:46.880> that

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
be to go to left or right or that

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.210 
be to go to left or right or that
depends<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.200> conditions<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.860> are<00:04:48.980> about

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
depends on the conditions you are about

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.910 
depends on the conditions you are about
to<00:04:49.280> this<00:04:50.120> is<00:04:50.330> not<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.720> kind<00:04:50.900> of<00:04:51.050> line<00:04:51.650> track

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
to this is not the kind of line track

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.190 
to this is not the kind of line track
that<00:04:52.100> we<00:04:52.220> will<00:04:52.340> be<00:04:52.490> cutting<00:04:52.670> okay<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.960> just

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
that we will be cutting okay so I just

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.920 
that we will be cutting okay so I just
make<00:04:55.040> it<00:04:55.070> go<00:04:55.370> straight<00:04:55.610> for<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:55.880> zero<00:04:56.180> zero

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
make it go straight for the zero zero

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.630 
make it go straight for the zero zero
one<00:04:57.320> forward<00:04:59.380> okay<00:05:00.380> so<00:05:00.770> there<00:05:01.280> you<00:05:01.430> go<00:05:01.610> you

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
one forward okay so there you go you

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.210 
one forward okay so there you go you
have<00:05:01.970> successfully<00:05:02.660> you<00:05:03.050> know<00:05:03.170> learned<00:05:03.740> how

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
have successfully you know learned how

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.670 
have successfully you know learned how
to<00:05:04.250> write<00:05:04.780> output<00:05:06.670> binary<00:05:07.670> you<00:05:08.450> know<00:05:08.680> values

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
to write output binary you know values

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.060 
to write output binary you know values
for<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.040> set<00:05:10.280> of<00:05:10.310> input<00:05:10.850> variables<00:05:11.780> okay<00:05:12.620> so

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
for a set of input variables okay so

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.970 
for a set of input variables okay so
this<00:05:13.280> is<00:05:13.460> how<00:05:13.640> you're<00:05:13.880> gonna<00:05:14.060> design<00:05:14.510> your

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
this is how you're gonna design your

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.240 
this is how you're gonna design your
robot<00:05:15.980> using<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.490> logical<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.840> know

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
robot using the logical you know

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.340 
robot using the logical you know
operands<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:20.150> method<00:05:20.570> of<00:05:20.660> logics<00:05:21.200> of

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
operands and the method of logics of

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.930 
operands and the method of logics of
answers<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.070> that<00:05:22.100> you<00:05:22.280> will<00:05:22.460> be<00:05:22.640> able<00:05:22.760> to

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
answers so that you will be able to

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.450 
answers so that you will be able to
implement<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.540> in<00:05:23.660> your<00:05:23.690> logical<00:05:24.680> gates<00:05:24.950> as<00:05:25.160> in

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
implement it in your logical gates as in

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.690 
implement it in your logical gates as in
hard<00:05:25.730> as<00:05:26.000> as<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.419> hardware<00:05:26.870> part<00:05:27.320> okay<00:05:27.590> so<00:05:28.130> let's

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
hard as as a hardware part okay so let's

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.240 
hard as as a hardware part okay so let's
now<00:05:28.910> rub<00:05:29.600> this<00:05:29.750> off<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.380> continue<00:05:30.890> with<00:05:31.040> the

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
now rub this off and continue with the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.310 
now rub this off and continue with the
next<00:05:31.669> part<00:05:32.000> I<00:05:32.210> will<00:05:32.330> show<00:05:32.690> you<00:05:32.750> how<00:05:33.260> to

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
next part I will show you how to

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.630 
next part I will show you how to
implement<00:05:33.770> this<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:35.120> this<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:36.340> how<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.370> get

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
implement this and this and how to get

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.300 
implement this and this and how to get
the<00:05:37.970> inputs<00:05:38.480> from<00:05:38.720> these<00:05:39.140> sensors<00:05:39.620> it's<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.130> try

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
the inputs from these sensors it's a try

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.590 
the inputs from these sensors it's a try
and<00:05:40.370> how<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:40.669> actually<00:05:40.880> implement<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.480> in

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
and how to actually implement it in

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.440 
and how to actually implement it in
conjugates<00:05:42.110> as<00:05:42.590> in<00:05:42.919> hardware<00:05:43.430> or<00:05:43.610> in<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.210> next

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
conjugates as in hardware or in the next

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.130 
conjugates as in hardware or in the next
part<00:05:44.660> of<00:05:44.750> it<00:05:44.990> so<00:05:45.260> I'll<00:05:45.500> see<00:05:45.860> you<00:05:45.950> then
