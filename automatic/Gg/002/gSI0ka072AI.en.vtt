00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
a couple of seconds of DPS the next

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.310 
a couple of seconds of DPS the next
abilities<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.119> AOE<00:01:42.450> cone<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> just

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
abilities like this AOE cone is you just

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.810 
abilities like this AOE cone is you just
seeing<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.680> now<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.310> hit<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.640> down

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
seeing that now that will hit you down

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.109 
seeing that now that will hit you down
it<00:01:45.149> hits<00:01:45.360> me<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.780> about<00:01:45.930> 20<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.799> 25<00:01:47.220> k<00:01:47.549> so

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it hits me for about 20 I think 25 k so

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.539 
it hits me for about 20 I think 25 k so
that's<00:01:48.329> nearly<00:01:48.630> killing<00:01:48.930> me<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.369> think<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.460> was

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
that's nearly killing me I think it was

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.819 
that's nearly killing me I think it was
a<00:01:50.579> bit<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:51.090> than<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> takes<00:01:52.649> me

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
a bit more than that and so it takes me

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.170 
a bit more than that and so it takes me
quite<00:01:52.860> low<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> use<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> health<00:01:53.970> well

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
quite low so I have to use a health well

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.380 
quite low so I have to use a health well
straight<00:01:54.689> after<00:01:55.020> he<00:01:55.200> does<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.560> tumor<00:01:56.390> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
straight after he does that tumor the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.209 
straight after he does that tumor the
next<00:01:57.659> attack<00:01:57.750> will<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.350> healed<00:01:58.560> why<00:01:59.009> now<00:01:59.189> is

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
next attack will be healed why now is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.819 
next attack will be healed why now is
like<00:01:59.729> hold<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.180> his<00:02:00.360> axe<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.259> throw<00:02:01.619> his

this fight now I did take the
Enchantress<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.020> well<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.670> found

Enchantress as well just because I found

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
Enchantress as well just because I found
that<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.180> little<00:02:36.510> bit<00:02:36.600> easier<00:02:36.780> although<00:02:37.500> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
that a little bit easier although it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.330 
that a little bit easier although it
doesn't<00:02:37.830> make<00:02:38.040> too<00:02:38.250> big<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.670> difference<00:02:39.200> but

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
doesn't make too big of a difference but

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.530 
doesn't make too big of a difference but
