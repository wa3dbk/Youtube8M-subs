back you can never replace it and the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.200 
back you can never replace it and the
engine<00:01:30.560> will<00:01:30.680> never<00:01:30.950> run<00:01:31.400> quite<00:01:31.850> as<00:01:31.970> well

again<00:01:36.340> imagine<00:01:37.340> this<00:01:37.600> multiplied<00:01:38.600> across<00:01:38.960> the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
again imagine this multiplied across the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.210 
again imagine this multiplied across the
world<00:01:39.380> hour<00:01:40.040> by<00:01:40.550> hour<00:01:40.759> day<00:01:41.150> by<00:01:41.600> day<00:01:42.190> there<00:01:43.190> are

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
world hour by hour day by day there are

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.460 
world hour by hour day by day there are
over<00:01:43.520> 1<00:01:43.790> billion<00:01:44.150> vehicles<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.080> world's

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
over 1 billion vehicles on the world's

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.130 
over 1 billion vehicles on the world's
roads<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.700> problem<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.180> engine<00:01:47.660> wear<00:01:47.869> is

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
roads so the problem of engine wear is

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.880 
roads so the problem of engine wear is
growing<00:01:48.920> by<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.250> second

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.950 

fortunately<00:01:56.890> Castro<00:01:57.850> had<00:01:58.210> been<00:01:58.420> working<00:01:58.690> on

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
fortunately Castro had been working on

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.310 
fortunately Castro had been working on
the<00:01:59.110> problem<00:01:59.320> and<00:02:00.450> Castro<00:02:01.450> Magnatech<00:02:02.080> is

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
the problem and Castro Magnatech is

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.880 
the problem and Castro Magnatech is
their<00:02:03.310> solution
