00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.750
 in the first six months of the baby's life 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.449
 human milk infant formula should 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.210
 to be the only food offered he supplies 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.400
 all nutritional needs is 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.769
 water or tea is not necessary 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.300
 but when it comes time to introduce the 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.510
 solid foods 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.040
 many mothers are left in doubt 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.380
 then from the sixth month the mother 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.510
 continue breastfeeding because breastfeeding 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.040
 will provide nutrients needed to 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.430
 the development and growth of the baby 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.340
 but also complements breastfeeding with 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.650
 introduction of potato and potato 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.140
 of doctor vegetable exists somehow 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.090
 play this process the mother 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.150
 can stimulate with the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.280
 colorful child aa 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.080
 consume these foods we 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.610
 usually indicates that you make a table 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.650
 beautiful as long as the child has not yet 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.720
 have this habit then to work with 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.610
 some little jokes can be 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.810
 interesting yes but with a bit of 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.670
 be careful because this can also be 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.670
 dangerous because you can adapt the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.560
 child to get accustomed to this type of 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.180
 situation and there in the front it gets difficult 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.160
 you cut and take 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.290
 then from the sixth month the child 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.560
 begins to have a maturity in the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.690
 chewing swallowing in digestion as 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.580
 also she starts to work the whole 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.530
 facial muscles and she starts having 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.690
 a maturity to consume all 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.100
 food but it is from the eighth month 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.350
 that we begin to have a release 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.300
 greater of some foods and one year 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.590
 this child is able to consume the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.210
 family food 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.620
 That's why it's very important that you already 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.130
 stimulate the entire investigative process 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.560
 from the beginning it does not liquefy pope 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.440
 will not lose potatoes just to 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.300
 stimulate the child to chew because 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.250
 otherwise it will happen neda seems 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.290
 those children after 2 34 years of 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.049
 age that has a lot of difficulty in 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.720
 consuming protein in chewing 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.549
 more difficult foods that do not require 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.350
 more chewing then this ends too 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.350
 hindering the speech process 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.470
 the key tip in this case avoid 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.120
 monotony 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.000
 so it 's important that you work with 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.739
 all the foods you can color 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.659
 different will always have vitamins 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.760
 different then that story of your 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.519
 battery is just to make a shredded chicken 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.989
 with a little rice is not wrong then 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.239
 Let's have color on this plate then. 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.459
 carrot beet work with 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.110
 dark green leaves work with 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.709
 nutrients and foods like broccoli 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.730
 then this will bring more body dish 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.650
 more flavour 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.329
 you will encourage this child to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.329
 work the best palate
