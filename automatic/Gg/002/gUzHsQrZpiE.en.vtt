you how to replace props a lot of people
don't<00:00:08.700> get<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.269> because<00:00:09.660> they<00:00:09.929> don't

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
don't get this because they don't

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.749 
don't get this because they don't
understand<00:00:10.650> these<00:00:10.830> props<00:00:11.130> aren't<00:00:11.490> all<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
understand these props aren't all the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.240 
understand these props aren't all the
same<00:00:11.790> these<00:00:12.330> two<00:00:12.570> spend<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.200> way<00:00:13.380> these<00:00:13.920> two

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
same these two spend one way these two

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.180 
same these two spend one way these two
spin<00:00:14.580> another<00:00:14.820> way<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.949> going

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
spin another way so this one is going

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.599 
spin another way so this one is going
this<00:00:17.490> way<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.869> going<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.680> way<00:00:19.920> so

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
this way this one is going this way so

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
this way this one is going this way so
that's<00:00:20.850> how<00:00:21.119> you're<00:00:21.270> able<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.600> get<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.170> turn

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
that's how you're able to get it to turn

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.700 
that's how you're able to get it to turn
and<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> moves<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.029> does<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.019> if<00:00:25.380> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and do the moves that it does so if you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.589 
and do the moves that it does so if you
put<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.039> wrong<00:00:26.189> prop<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.510> these

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
put the wrong prop on one of these

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.540 
put the wrong prop on one of these
motors<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> make<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.160> want<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
motors it's going to make it want to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.150 
motors it's going to make it want to
flip<00:00:30.060> over<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.529> first<00:00:31.859> take

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
flip over when you when you first take

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.750 
flip over when you when you first take
off<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.770> do<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.800> an<00:00:35.130> accident<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
off so if you do have an accident you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.040 
off so if you do have an accident you
crash<00:00:36.030> we're<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:36.750> ahead<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
crash we're just going to go ahead and

crash we're just going to go ahead and
show<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.230> how<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> replace<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.860> prop<00:00:38.250> real

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489

quick you will need a drill and a drill
bit<00:00:43.940> I'm<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> show<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:46.399> how

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.860 
bit I'm not going to show you this how
to<00:00:47.460> drill<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> out<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.270> think<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.570> guys<00:00:48.690> are

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
to drill it out so I think you guys are

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.869 
to drill it out so I think you guys are
pretty<00:00:48.989> smart<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.680> I'm<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.280> think<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
pretty smart and I'm going to think that

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.069 
pretty smart and I'm going to think that
you<00:00:50.969> guys<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.270> how<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:51.870> there's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you guys know how to do it but there's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.939 
you guys know how to do it but there's
like<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.500> insert<00:00:53.129> right<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
like this little insert right here that

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.069 
like this little insert right here that
basically<00:00:55.949> will<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> space<00:00:57.690> or<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
basically will be a space or if you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.200 
basically will be a space or if you
don't<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.850> prop

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
don't put that in when you put this prop

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.330 
don't put that in when you put this prop
on<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.170> loose<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.859> it's

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
on it's going to be all loose and it's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
on it's going to be all loose and it's
not<00:01:02.670> good<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.600> just

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
not good it's going to actually just

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.230 
not good it's going to actually just
completely<00:01:04.799> destroy<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.519> motor<00:01:05.760> bearings

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
completely destroy your motor bearings

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.899 
completely destroy your motor bearings
so<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> make<00:01:07.439> sure<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.100> little

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
so we want to make sure that this little

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.359 
so we want to make sure that this little
hub<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> drill<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
hub is in there and you want to drill it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.000 
hub is in there and you want to drill it
out<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.760> fits<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.600> snug<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
out so that fits really snug when you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
out so that fits really snug when you
push<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.460> thing<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:14.939> right<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.509> can

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
push that thing down right there you can

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.390 
push that thing down right there you can
see<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.110> moving<00:01:16.560> there's<00:01:16.799> no<00:01:16.950> jiggling

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
see it's not moving there's no jiggling

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.580 
see it's not moving there's no jiggling
so<00:01:17.640> when<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.060> new<00:01:18.210> prop<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:19.020> you're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so when you get your new prop out you're

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.140 
so when you get your new prop out you're
going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> these<00:01:20.490> things<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
going to get one of these things and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
going to get one of these things and
these<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> spacers<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.950> talking

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
these are the spacers that I was talking

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
these are the spacers that I was talking
about<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:24.060> basically<00:01:24.509> are<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> be

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
about that basically are going to be

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.859 
about that basically are going to be
making<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.100> tight<00:01:26.400> around<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:27.090> thing<00:01:27.420> so

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
making it tight around this thing so

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.140 
making it tight around this thing so
this<00:01:28.140> bigger<00:01:28.590> fatter<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
this bigger fatter one is the one that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
this bigger fatter one is the one that
you're<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> drill<00:01:30.990> out<00:01:31.170> it's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you're going to want to drill out it's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.999 
you're going to want to drill out it's
really<00:01:32.340> close<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> doesn't<00:01:34.079> quite<00:01:34.320> fit<00:01:34.860> on

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
really close but it doesn't quite fit on

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.590 
really close but it doesn't quite fit on
there<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.520> want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> drill<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
there so you want to drill it out just a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630 
there so you want to drill it out just a
tiny<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> size<00:01:38.430> of

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
tiny a little bit like just the size of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
tiny a little bit like just the size of
that<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:40.020> super<00:01:40.229> nice

new prop so when you put your new prop
in<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> put<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.819> already<00:02:09.060> drilled

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
in you put that in it's already drilled

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
in you put that in it's already drilled
out<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.530> long<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.890> don't<00:02:11.069> lose<00:02:11.340> that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
out so as long as you don't lose that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.010
