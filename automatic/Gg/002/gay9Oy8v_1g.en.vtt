if<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.340> remind<00:00:20.970> last<00:00:21.180> split<00:00:22.189> if<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.460> running

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
if you remind last split if it's running

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.560 
if you remind last split if it's running
it's<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.590> basic<00:00:26.189> rule<00:00:26.580> never<00:00:27.119> change<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
it's like a basic rule never change the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.410 
it's like a basic rule never change the
running<00:00:27.750> system<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.439> obviously<00:00:29.369> now<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
running system and obviously now the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170 
running system and obviously now the
times<00:00:30.990> got<00:00:31.260> hard<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.800> us<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.160> I've<00:00:32.759> got<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
times got hard for us so I've got to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
times got hard for us so I've got to
work<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.450> bit<00:00:33.719> more<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.829> like

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
work a little bit more but it's not like

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.119 
work a little bit more but it's not like
that<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.989> whole<00:00:37.170> thing<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.950> own

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that I do like the whole thing on my own

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459 
that I do like the whole thing on my own
it's<00:00:38.670> always<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> team<00:00:39.390> effort<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.140> provide

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
it's always a team effort and I provide

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.510 
it's always a team effort and I provide
like<00:00:41.309> know-how<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.989> more<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
like know-how so it's more of like a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.240 
like know-how so it's more of like a
mutual<00:00:45.030> agreement<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.289> mutual<00:00:46.860> work<00:00:47.010> rather

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
mutual agreement and mutual work rather

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
mutual agreement and mutual work rather
than<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.640> design<00:00:48.059> everything<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.719> them<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
than I design everything for them a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.080 
than I design everything for them a
joint<00:00:49.739> effort<00:00:49.980> well<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.550> mentioned<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:50.940> it

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
joint effort well you mentioned that it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.310 
joint effort well you mentioned that it
is<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.210> bit<00:00:51.390> harder<00:00:51.719> now<00:00:51.840> because<00:00:51.870> obviously

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is a bit harder now because obviously

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
is a bit harder now because obviously
they<00:00:52.649> haven't<00:00:52.980> had<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> best<00:00:53.399> super<00:00:53.730> week<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
they haven't had the best super week I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
they haven't had the best super week I
lost<00:00:54.120> yesterday<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.750> how<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> very<00:00:55.079> hard

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
lost yesterday and how a very hard

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
lost yesterday and how a very hard
matchup<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.920> today<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.309> where<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.879> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
matchup for them today so where do you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.790 
matchup for them today so where do you
come<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.239> specifically<00:00:58.140> try<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.680> prepare

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
come in specifically try and prepare

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.569 
come in specifically try and prepare
them<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.280> match<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.140> well<00:01:01.140> again<00:01:01.579> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
them for a match like this well again it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.469 
them for a match like this well again it
always<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.390> differs<00:01:04.610> at<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> moment<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
always like differs at the moment I

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.480 
always like differs at the moment I
think<00:01:06.600> we've<00:01:07.020> got<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.470> issues<00:01:08.010> more<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
think we've got like issues more on a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.200 
think we've got like issues more on a
tactical<00:01:09.650> level<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.580> much<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
tactical level not so much on a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
tactical level not so much on a
psychological<00:01:12.750> level<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.350> think<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
psychological level I think on a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.429 
psychological level I think on a
psychological<00:01:15.030> level<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.780> still<00:01:16.080> strong

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
psychological level we are still strong

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
psychological level we are still strong
but<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.979> general<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.700> always<00:01:21.060> important

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
but in general it's always important

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.830 
but in general it's always important
that<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.960> keep<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> mindset<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.720> losing<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
that you keep the mindset of losing is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
that you keep the mindset of losing is
actually<00:01:25.290> part<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> game<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.369> important

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
actually part of the game it's important

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
actually part of the game it's important
that<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> don't<00:01:27.330> forget<00:01:27.689> about<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> as

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that you don't forget about that and as

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.940 
that you don't forget about that and as
long<00:01:29.759> as<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.720> put<00:01:30.990> something<00:01:31.650> good

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
long as you can like put something good

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.090 
long as you can like put something good
out<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.520> loss<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.299> always<00:01:33.720> valuable<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.799> if

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
out of a loss it's always valuable so if

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
out of a loss it's always valuable so if
you<00:01:35.250> got<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.460> professional<00:01:36.270> mindset<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you got that professional mindset and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
you got that professional mindset and
the<00:01:36.900> players<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.610> make<00:01:38.820> sure

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the players do have that you make sure

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.359 
the players do have that you make sure
automatically<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.990> almost<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:41.159> better

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
automatically like almost you get better

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.490 
automatically like almost you get better
so<00:01:41.960> even<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.200> lose<00:01:43.380> today<00:01:44.750> I'm<00:01:45.750> always

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
so even if we lose today I'm always

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.260 
so even if we lose today I'm always
interested<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> performance<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.149> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
interested in the performance this is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.359 
interested in the performance this is
what<00:01:48.420> counts<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.840> me<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.979> win<00:01:50.189> or

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
what counts for me it's not if we win or

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.370 
what counts for me it's not if we win or
if<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.670> lose<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.180> how<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.540> play<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> game<00:01:52.020> this

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
if we lose but how we play the game this
