00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.210
 who is demanding yet announced in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.340
 current February top of the line 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.960
 manufacturer came to compete with the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.539
 galaxy s 3 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.590
 specifications are very advanced to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.119
 start with the nvidia tegra 3 processor 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.460
 as well as competitor this apparatus 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.369
 brings to high definition screen and camera 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.710
 of 8 megapixels a premium product brings 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.630
 differentiated design and resources for 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.190
 cater for all tastes 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.320
 but does this device meet the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.579
 expectations is what you get 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:47.340
 In this analysis optimus 4x HD design 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.270
 is used the manufacturer managed to escape the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.100
 sameness 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.480
 adopting a rather square look but 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.600
 Very elegant 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 the lateral flares give safety at the time 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.109
 to use the device 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 the buttons are not too high and 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.940
 fit with discretion on the edges 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 the back cover with special texture 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 is also a differential that leaves the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.130
 more beautiful set 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.700
 the front is fine 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.920
 leveraged with the 4.7-inch screen 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.299
 the capacitive buttons dialogue it occupies 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.770
 little space 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.360
 who looks at the appliance is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.030
 love to connect the smartphone comes 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.130
 main surprise the high definition and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.700
 an incredibly wide screen 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.119
 are 720 pixels wide and 1,280 pixels wide 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.880
 height of the display density is 312 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.009
 pixels per inch or whatever 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.119
 content is very clear in this 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.700
 the display has a high level of 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.290
 bright colors and good response 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 touch commands 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.820
 we were satisfied with the display for 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 play photos videos and games 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.990
 it is a comfortable experience that 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.380
 eyes and makes it possible to enjoy 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 content without seeing you all the details 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.020
 glamor of lg optimus 4x HD is possible 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.990
 thanks to the powerful hardware inside 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.500
 of the appliance 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.390
 with chip nvidia tegra 3 this smartphone 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.330
 ensures high performance for any 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.480
 tasks are four cores operating at 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.849
 1.5 ghz which allows you to try 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.970
 more advanced apps for android 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.120
 the graphic processing unit is a 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.370
 of power the lp that offers a lot of power 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.400
 when facing games in some 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 benchmarks the optimus 4x hd got 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.250
 better results than the galaxy s 3 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.190
 you can enjoy games 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.709
 three-dimensional without major difficulties 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.150
 the qualities of this appliance are not 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.130
 hardware only 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.680
 additional resources ensure good 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.810
 experiences for any occasion 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.700
 the 8-megapixel camera for example 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.790
 shows high quality 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.850
 exposure balance focus adjustment 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.230
 white and scene modes the flash helps in 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.130
 moments in which there is not much 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.709
 lighting 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.690
 but do not expect anything grandiose 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.640
 contrary to what we expected 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.620
 caprichou on the battery of this smartphone 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.709
 even if it has screen size 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.540
 and powerful hardware 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.120
 save energy and enjoy the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.010
 load available in an exemplary way 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.600
 in our tests the battery offered 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.769
 power for more than six hours 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.690
 followed 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.790
 a good value considering that the brightness 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.829
 was configured at maximum and that 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.280
 we played games and we used it and went for 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:33.790
 long time to complete the set 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.920
 Optical 4x HD comes with stickers for 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.900
 use nfc technology 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.200
 in this case the device worked very 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.390
 well inclusive with the android bin the sound of 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.250
 speaker is not great but it is 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.980
 possible to use dolby mobile technology 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.660
 with the use of headphones and enjoy music 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.660
 and movies with the perfect audio 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.790
 even though it is an optimus premium product 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.099
 top of the line disappointed us 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.650
 profoundly with its low performance 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.879
 in games 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.099
 unfortunately the device could not 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.430
 good results when running the game 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.260
 batman the dark knight resurfaces 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.690
 apparently the problem may be in the 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.209
 bad use of the hardware because the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.269
 tegra 3 is more than enough to 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.709
 run any game 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.169
 in other product tests if 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.210
 behaved normally and even managed to 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.630
 better frame rate than some 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.120
 competitors all the splendor of this 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.090
 smartphone is overshadowed by a 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.970
 small detail he has only 12 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.490
 Internal storage gb even though 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.530
 has space for sd card this limitation 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.000
 can frustrate who likes to save 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.949
 videos or install many games for 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.830
 to conclude, we should point out that the 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.870
 optimus 4x HD has a number of small 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.240
 but in the operating system 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.060
 lg's default interface leaves everything 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.389
 very strange because the - the area of 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.590
 job and all the minute details are 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.080
 personalized who likes the visual 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.550
 android original will suffer for 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.550
 reverse so many changes 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.910
 when the device is very expensive any 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.110
 hasty decision may cause 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.620
 repentance 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.350
 in the case of the lg optimus 4x hd it seems that the 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.100
 investment of 1,800 reais is not very 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.170
 valid 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.290
 even more because there are more options 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.240
 advantageous in the same price range yet 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.550
 which offers a very complete set 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.700
 this phone ends up leaving 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.580
 different aspects and thus not worth 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.590
 the same as a superior competitor 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.630
 of course if you find an offer not 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.520
 You need to think twice because this 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.650
 smartphone is great 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.550
 complete analysis of the world and 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.550
