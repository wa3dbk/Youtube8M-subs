starting<00:00:09.240> with<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> tapestry<00:00:09.630> needle<00:00:10.050> I

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
starting with a tapestry needle I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.290 
starting with a tapestry needle I
actually<00:00:10.620> prefer<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.309> metal<00:00:11.700> kind<00:00:11.849> over<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
actually prefer the metal kind over the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.270 
actually prefer the metal kind over the
plastic<00:00:12.750> sometimes<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.500> plastic<00:00:13.920> will<00:00:14.070> grab

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
plastic sometimes the plastic will grab

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.129 
plastic sometimes the plastic will grab
your<00:00:14.429> fibers<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.780> won't<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.109> that

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
your fibers and you won't have that

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.980 
your fibers and you won't have that
issue<00:00:16.289> with<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.740> metal<00:00:17.240> it<00:00:18.240> has<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.449> blunt<00:00:18.779> tip

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
issue with the metal it has a blunt tip

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.679 
issue with the metal it has a blunt tip
and<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.529> large<00:00:19.800> enough<00:00:20.070> eye<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.510> can

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
and a large enough eye so that you can

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.220 
and a large enough eye so that you can
thread<00:00:21.960> yarn<00:00:22.410> through<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.930> feel

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
thread yarn through it so if you feel

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.259 
thread yarn through it so if you feel
more<00:00:25.470> comfortable<00:00:25.880> blocking<00:00:26.880> your<00:00:27.000> pieces

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
more comfortable blocking your pieces

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.589 
more comfortable blocking your pieces
before<00:00:27.930> seaming<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:28.859> even<00:00:29.429> ironing<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:30.179> flat

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
before seaming or even ironing them flat

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.680 
before seaming or even ironing them flat
so<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:31.590> won't<00:00:32.099> curl<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.579> much<00:00:32.820> definitely

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
so they won't curl as much definitely

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.590 
so they won't curl as much definitely
takes<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.050> couple<00:00:34.200> minutes<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.570> when<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
takes a couple minutes to do that when I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.270 
takes a couple minutes to do that when I
originally<00:00:36.930> did<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> pattern<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.920> earned

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
originally did the pattern I earned

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.069 
originally did the pattern I earned
those<00:00:38.520> pieces<00:00:38.820> flat<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.510> could<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.930> them

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
those pieces flat so you could see them

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
those pieces flat so you could see them
in<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> pictures<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> did<00:00:41.340> make<00:00:41.520> seaming

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
in the pictures and it did make seaming

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.709 
in the pictures and it did make seaming
a<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.600> bit<00:00:42.719> easier<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.140> me<00:00:44.570> starting<00:00:45.570> with

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
a little bit easier for me starting with

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
a little bit easier for me starting with
the<00:00:45.840> toe<00:00:46.020> ends<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.590> take<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> top<00:00:47.039> two<00:00:47.280> pieces

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the toe ends you take the top two pieces

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
the toe ends you take the top two pieces
lay<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.629> flat<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.530> where<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
lay them flat so you can see where the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
lay them flat so you can see where the
toe<00:00:50.039> end<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> two<00:00:51.539> ends<00:00:51.780> will<00:00:51.899> have

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
toe end is one of the two ends will have

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.020 
toe end is one of the two ends will have
the<00:00:52.230> long<00:00:52.440> yarn<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.489> left<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the long yarn that you left when you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.930 
the long yarn that you left when you
found<00:00:54.629> off<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.649> other<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
found off the other one it will be the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.990 
found off the other one it will be the
other<00:00:57.149> bound<00:00:57.510> off<00:00:57.690> edge<00:00:57.800> but<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.670> don't<00:00:59.820> need

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
other bound off edge but you don't need

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.599 
other bound off edge but you don't need
long<00:01:00.210> strands<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.960> those<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:02.370> take

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
long strands and those at all you take

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.149 
long strands and those at all you take
the<00:01:02.850> shorter<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> two<00:01:03.629> long<00:01:04.049> yarns<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the shorter of the two long yarns that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.000 
the shorter of the two long yarns that
you<00:01:05.339> left<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.970> near<00:01:06.210> bound<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:07.290> for

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
you left and near bound off this for

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.160 
you left and near bound off this for
this<00:01:08.100> demonstration<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:09.030> tied<00:01:10.020> on

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this demonstration I actually tied on

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
this demonstration I actually tied on
this<00:01:10.320> different<00:01:10.710> color<00:01:10.860> thread<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> could

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this different color thread so you could

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.130 
this different color thread so you could
see<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.600> clearly

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
see it more clearly

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.179 
see it more clearly
you<00:01:14.130> thread<00:01:14.430> your<00:01:14.460> needle<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.470> hold<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you thread your needle and you hold the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.429 
you thread your needle and you hold the
pieces<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.390> sides<00:01:18.689> facing<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
pieces with right sides facing out so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
pieces with right sides facing out so
the<00:01:20.340> v's<00:01:20.549> from<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> stockinette<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.900> be

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the v's from the stockinette will be

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.289 
the v's from the stockinette will be
facing<00:01:22.290> out<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.119> put

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
facing out and you can just kind of put

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.530 
facing out and you can just kind of put
them<00:01:24.450> flat<00:01:24.659> against<00:01:25.229> each<00:01:25.380> other

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
take the tapestry needle and you can tie

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
take the tapestry needle and you can tie
it<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> yarn<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.930> top<00:01:31.799> piece<00:01:32.130> and

we're going to go straight down into the
first<00:01:36.180> stitch<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> bottom<00:01:38.310> piece
