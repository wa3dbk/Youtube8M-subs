00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
beside the shed it's under this tarp

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.869 
beside the shed it's under this tarp
here<00:00:49.010> already<00:00:50.010> used<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.219> good<00:00:50.370> portion<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
here already used a good portion of it

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.130 
here already used a good portion of it
we<00:00:50.969> actually<00:00:51.090> bought<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.600> wood<00:00:51.780> back<00:00:51.960> in

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
we actually bought this wood back in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.799 
we actually bought this wood back in
2011<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:53.789> used<00:00:54.030> about<00:00:54.120> half<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
2011 and I've only used about half of it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.130 
2011 and I've only used about half of it
and<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.379> pallet<00:00:55.710> was<00:00:55.829> filled<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.190> wood<00:00:56.340> too

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
and this pallet was filled with wood too

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.869 
and this pallet was filled with wood too
in<00:00:58.140> reality<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.800> probably<00:00:59.250> cheaper<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.820> us

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
in reality it's probably cheaper for us

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
in reality it's probably cheaper for us
to<00:00:59.940> use<00:01:00.329> natural<00:01:00.570> gas<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> figure<00:01:01.829> since<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
to use natural gas but I figure since I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.439 
to use natural gas but I figure since I
already<00:01:02.250> bought<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.120> makes<00:01:03.300> sense

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
already bought this it just makes sense

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
already bought this it just makes sense
to<00:01:03.690> use<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> saves<00:01:04.710> us<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:04.979> bit

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to use it and it saves us a little bit

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
to use it and it saves us a little bit
on<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.250> gas<00:01:05.489> bill<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.659> there's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
on our gas bill so you can see there's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
on our gas bill so you can see there's
some<00:01:06.930> other<00:01:07.070> wood<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.400> -<00:01:08.549> there's
