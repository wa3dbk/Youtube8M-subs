00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 another culture that is high in the region 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.069
 is the okra and mira star our team 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.440
 met his walter and according to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.360
 producer does not need a large 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.009
 investment in order to maintain a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.650
 productivity 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.990
 the flowers present throughout the cycle give 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.270
 a special touch to the plantation in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.180
 property of walter the okra produced 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.130
 is the result of 430 pits that are 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.300
 harvested continuously with the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.650
 body more or less by collection of 10 8 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.660
 10 12 kilograms 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.520
 according to the producer the investment 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 needs to be too loud for a good 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.700
 productivity 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.730
 he often works with pruning 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.219
 irrigation and prevents the use of agrochemicals 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.039
 preferring a natural pest control 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.309
 but some leave walter worried 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.289
 they directly attack the flowers for 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.260
 this leading to abortion and 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.340
 decrease in production not so high but 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.070
 decreases 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.969
 now looks very villainous in the part of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.489
 Citrus right he works explain 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.790
 best for those who understand - how to type 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.600
 ant it cuts everything to the new pointer 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.430
 of the plant 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.260
 agronomist and sees a point 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.600
 positive in planting 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 the producer uses the rotation method 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.080
 of culture 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.100
 preventing other vegetable infestations 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.509
 he is not doing is that abu e tomate 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 okra all rolled into the same area 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.810
 because this would lead to the plagues of the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.560
 Okra or tomato are the same UOL 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.509
 pests and they affect productivity at 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.939
 family farming there is no 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.200
 better than the right to horticulture 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.729
 olericultura is an activity so it is a 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.799
 great investment 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.140
 for walter is a culture that compensates 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.229
 has its differential is a culture that 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.020
 Come on then, turn around quickly and 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.149
 mainly this year 2013 was very 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.649
 good price 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.950
 this is one of the reasons and for having a 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.390
 small property does not have as if it wants 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.530
 make an investment in other types of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.540
 very high cost plant does not pay 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.390
 so here I am messing with that part 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.050
 in 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.990
 lyric vegetable to cassava because we see 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.540
 there is a need to make fast and 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.310
 mainly at okra and at cost 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.040
 low 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.540
 and it's just interesting to provide 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.060
 few calories 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.820
 okra can also be present in 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.010
 calorie restriction diets 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.910
 with the advantage of being a food of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.910
 easy digestion
