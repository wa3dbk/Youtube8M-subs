00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.460
 a good morning sambro 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.440
 the Rome victim still the Rome does not 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.710
 stopped and reached a height, he became a leader if 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.710
 it goes 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:40.879
 we notice maximum kissing short for us 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.860
 since 27 May and 27 as Kaka could 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.830
 stay alessandro straw hello hello 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.620
 hello from me and from nino the painter who 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.809
 it was michael was maicon and they decided 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.089
 who decided this dear game 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.930
 alessandro alla roma that does not stop e 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:00.440
 not even with the wind in our sails we go 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.210
 let's present the themes of the day 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.220
 touching the dots 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.250
 rome rome that years ago a rome that 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.510
 leave the crumbs to the opponent 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.670
 It looms far and wide too 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.020
 when it suffers and partly happened yesterday 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.520
 also with naples 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.560
 in the end he can find those 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.799
 unexpected resources even in inferiority 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.510
 numerical room will ask for the Rome search 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.070
 we have waited for it we return of test 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.340
 I believe that there is a proof 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.710
 worst to play in 10 for half an hour 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.780
 on a field where those in did not win 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.649
 travel for one year on average a year e 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.020
 two months 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.320
 how many without totti karzai gervinho la 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.719
 Rome won with the heart to victory 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.090
 of the heart or it is limiting not to have a thousand 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.920
 calm evening I apologize to steri is 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.980
 come back imported determined you want 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.130
 to go 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.480
 yes yes reductive reductive if we think 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.970
 who won only with the heart 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.520
 but then the life of Rome this year 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.260
 all in all different ways dominating 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.840
 matches played on the break as a 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.000
 milano also making strength of the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.560
 weaknesses of the opposing teams yesterday 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.880
 put another thing in here 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.710
 the one who didn't have it put in 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.130
 actually night tensions need ie 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.750
 trying to put everyone there 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.370
 something more to go and get yourself 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.470
 these three points is proof of this 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.560
 team is something else on an opponent who 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.280
 not losing at home from 22 games here 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.150
 they are monstrous numbers including nano that 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.450
 individual performance update 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.580
 within a of a collective of 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.580
 a reality that does not have at European level 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.130
 this could provide a billion 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.330
 michael song we had stayed at 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.860
 calabria mario the painter and when if 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.900
 we were not talking about the rome we would say 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.850
 that the social team is back on 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.770
 stick but and just go back to school 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.300
 stick no I said if we were talking 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.670
 of another team 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.530
 we will say cabbage however enters what is the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.630
 best in the field enters bradley after 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.540
 a long time to solve one 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.130
 match is the year of that team there is 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.680
 what the rome 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.830
 you got it over again because then you are 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.230
 talked so much also about good luck 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.080
 there is a fate because in a couple of 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.739
 matches the rome has also been kissed 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.010
 from the goddess from the blindfolded goddess said ha 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.560
 said rudi garcia quoted that is not 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.640
 he didn't really say that old though 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.730
 tallis schooner 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.060
 it was the thought thought is that they are 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.310
 let us say less that he wanted to make it understood 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.720
 just that because luck 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.510
 helps the bold 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.300
 this attests to the sundance is exactly 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.340
 but you have to go looking for him with 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.300
 the Rome in ten the Udine that pushes 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.130
 which is played by midfields, one thinks perhaps 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.440
 conserved changes etc. instead of instead 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.620
 the various of aids leverages a center that 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.530
 judges how much you see home also 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.790
 read the matches that you go to 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.380
 elections but must be careful now 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.140
 because he is good he was fundamental in 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.269
 referred to by him after the launch of de 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.709
 red for strootman who was which he has 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.860
 made this parade done this 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.079
 da baiocco has been hospitalized there 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.169
 can indeed placed alessandro is one 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.829
 rome real struggles now enter see 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.720
 its limits 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.020
 we have seen group rejoicing 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.410
 Inordinate celebrations but it is also 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.600
 complicated to remain with the thesis 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.240
 africa lights of a moment so enemy 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.479
 he succeeds and will be called he really is 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.460
 the nine test of the 10 say is over 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.340
 oh well battemmo chievo by thinks if it beats 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.130
 because this is what we cover asking ourselves 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.440
 or not knows that we are thank you 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.720
 obviously alessandro straw 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.040
 we thank him for having arrived 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.040
 redemption but the case 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:09.300
 net size thanks to the May tool 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.869
 thanks to Rome 24 the Rome leader list 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.869
 Hi everyone
