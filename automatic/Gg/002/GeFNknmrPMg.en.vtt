00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.010
 Hello everyone and welcome back with the veil 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.490
 of the week you find all the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.029
 Monday at 2 on my channel 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.640
 today we will see a nice level 8 town hall 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.610
 farming as you see I have already arranged the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.820
 walls and we go immediately to insert the 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.430
 things inside first 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.950
 insert the clan's castle in the center 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.570
 and as you can see it covers almost all of the well 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.970
 village anyway all the walls at 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.680
 it covers well then they have to admit 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:52.010
 around gold and black deposit well in 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:57.980
 these 2x2 spaces we put 3 tesla is one 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:00.200
 giant bomb ok so as you already see 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.240
 the black stamp and gold deposits are 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.950
 very protected for what one right at 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.509
 second layer of walls starting 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.360
 from the inside therefore there is the castle is 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.030
 immediately around gold and black elixir 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.020
 after that we go to fill these 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.020
 spaces of two 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.900
 well as you see we have arranged the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.299
 mortars so that they create perfectly 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.840
 therefore framed really in the best 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.880
 of the ways 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.570
 and I put the deposit here 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.830
 elixir air defense wizards for the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.840
 moment there is little to say 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.840
 we continue to make the village 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.960
 well we have filled all the walls 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.700
 internal as you see the over the mortars 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.310
 that I know they perfectly form a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.829
 the sorcerer's reader is also square 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.560
 which are three form a triangle 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.690
 same thing for air defenses then 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.870
 there is a good triangulation of sorcerers 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.140
 and air defense is a good square 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.190
 action yes if mortars are said like this 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.950
 seen so it may seem that in any case the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.650
 air defense are very external then 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.090
 easily destructible but let's go to 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.090
 fill other spaces 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.560
 well I told you it was a base 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.870
 very original and now you can understand 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.260
 because it is full of open defenses then 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.560
 not completely protected by the walls 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.739
 so we have to go and put the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.739
 traps 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.910
 well as you see these traps make 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.660
 really very difficult life for 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.580
 invaders 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:21.900
 because if the enemy puts his own here 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.590
 giants will go to free defenses 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.580
 therefore without walls and above all 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.160
 they will jump away with snap traps 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.280
 and they will be damaged by bombs 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.420
 after which they will head towards the tower 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.950
 of the waxy and also here other giants 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.340
 all of this will skip workers while 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.880
 sorcerer's tower mortar and tower 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.610
 of the archer they rage against them 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.710
 so it may seem not a very basic basis 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.350
 pretty but I think it's really a lot 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.350
 working for this reason once 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.420
 that we will have completed the village vi 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.860
 I will show that it is really very good 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.450
 as a basis then we complete 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.450
 outside the village 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.349
 accusation 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.750
 well we're almost done shortage 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:46.120
 only the aerial traps which 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:49.660
 skeletons we go to put them well the 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.250
 village is completed here it is like 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.230
 we can see the skeletal traps 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.450
 they are very internal so they do 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.960
 really a good job that is defending 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.270
 well this department here of the deposit 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.940
 gold this with the deposit of elixir the 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.570
 mortar and this curator of the sorcerer 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.040
 same thing the other skeleton trap is 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.410
 another point in favor of this 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.320
 village are the aerial bombs that it 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.350
 climber to undermine all of them inside 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.430
 in the village they protect very well from 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:25.140
 aerial assaults as you see there are many 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.830
 spaces the 2x2 left empty like this 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:33.370
 this this and so on 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.950
 in this way the opponent does not understand 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.310
 well where such traps are located 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.470
 bombs and tesla because we say to how 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.870
 spoiled for choice in understanding where 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.870
 and also because internally anyway 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:50.230
 will see that there is an empty 2x2 space either 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.400
 these out there and then it will be a little 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.950
 disadvantage 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.780
 after which the bombs all have the 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:01.160
 their job because they keep defenses 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.050
 external from the giants 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.110
 therefore the traps are well placed and 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.420
 more difficult to identify 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.370
 another point in favor of the drill 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.810
 of the internal black elixir 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:17.360
 if I have to find a negative side of 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.030
 this village is certainly the king 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.850
 barbarian, a bit external indeed who has 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.920
 enough just because I think it is 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.540
 a great village 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.360
 hope you like it you have in 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.170
 description all the necessary links one 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.860
 of reading 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.510
 put it excel veil you liked it for 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.180
 keep following me join the 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.760
 commented channel to show me the 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.550
 your children then write me the name 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.100
