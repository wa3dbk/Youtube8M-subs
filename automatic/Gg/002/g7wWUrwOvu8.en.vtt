the<00:04:45.030> blender<00:04:45.479> slows<00:04:45.750> down<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:48.180> can<00:04:48.360> stop<00:04:48.810> it

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
the blender slows down you can stop it

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.279 
the blender slows down you can stop it
anytime<00:04:49.229> by<00:04:49.710> hitting<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.190> X<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:51.840> can<00:04:51.990> start

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
anytime by hitting the X you can start

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.830 
anytime by hitting the X you can start
and<00:04:52.530> stop<00:04:52.560> any<00:04:53.009> cycle<00:04:53.580> in<00:04:53.759> progress<00:04:54.090> by

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
and stop any cycle in progress by

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.800 
and stop any cycle in progress by
touching<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.319> X<00:04:55.349> and<00:04:55.800> turn<00:04:56.009> off<00:04:56.190> your<00:04:56.370> blender

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
touching the X and turn off your blender

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.140 
touching the X and turn off your blender
let's<00:04:57.810> look<00:04:57.960> at<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.110> blender<00:04:58.409> now<00:04:58.879> with<00:04:59.879> water

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
let's look at the blender now with water

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.820 
let's look at the blender now with water
in<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.449> just<00:05:00.659> so<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:00.810> can<00:05:00.930> see<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.409> vortex

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
in it just so you can see the vortex

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.149 
in it just so you can see the vortex
we're<00:05:02.220> gonna<00:05:02.310> look<00:05:02.490> at<00:05:02.669> this<00:05:02.849> in<00:05:03.389> slow<00:05:03.780> motion

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
we're gonna look at this in slow motion

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.830 
we're gonna look at this in slow motion
see<00:05:05.159> how<00:05:05.310> things<00:05:05.580> get<00:05:05.759> pulled<00:05:06.060> down<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.750> the

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
see how things get pulled down to the

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.790 
see how things get pulled down to the
bottom<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:08.099> unique<00:05:08.430> shape<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.090> jar

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
bottom the unique shape of the jar

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.249 
bottom the unique shape of the jar
achieves<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:11.159> vortex<00:05:11.970> where<00:05:12.180> everything<00:05:12.719> gets

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
achieves a vortex where everything gets

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.029 
achieves a vortex where everything gets
swirled<00:05:13.740> from<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.460> top<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:14.969> the<00:05:15.060> bottom<00:05:15.210> to

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
swirled from the top to the bottom to

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:29.709 
swirled from the top to the bottom to
achieve<00:05:17.039> a<00:05:17.210> smooth<00:05:18.560> blended<00:05:19.560> consistency

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.609 

and<00:05:29.809> now<00:05:30.559> let's<00:05:30.799> try<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.339> smoothie<00:05:31.849> recipe

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:32.619 
and now let's try a smoothie recipe

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:35.379 
and now let's try a smoothie recipe
right<00:05:33.619> from<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:33.919> book<00:05:34.069> this<00:05:34.549> recipe<00:05:35.330> is

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
right from the book this recipe is

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.839 
right from the book this recipe is
called<00:05:35.539> the<00:05:35.779> buried<00:05:36.169> up<00:05:36.319> to<00:05:36.349> here<00:05:36.709> and<00:05:39.849> we'll

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
called the buried up to here and we'll

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.689 
called the buried up to here and we'll
just<00:05:41.029> run<00:05:41.179> the<00:05:41.329> blender<00:05:41.479> on<00:05:41.839> the<00:05:42.110> suggested

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
just run the blender on the suggested

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.949 
just run the blender on the suggested
smoothie<00:05:43.699> cycle<00:05:46.119> also<00:05:47.119> good<00:05:47.449> sometimes<00:05:47.659> to

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:47.959 
smoothie cycle also good sometimes to
