00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
two-axis brushless gimbal it came fully

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.570 
two-axis brushless gimbal it came fully
assembled<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.800> does<00:00:28.980> include<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
assembled and it does include the

brushless<00:00:29.970> gimbal<00:00:30.449> controller<00:00:31.520> back<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:32.790> so

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
brushless gimbal controller back here so

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.600 
brushless gimbal controller back here so
the<00:00:34.500> soonest<00:00:34.680> fully<00:00:34.920> assembled<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.399> said

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the soonest fully assembled like I said

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.430 
the soonest fully assembled like I said
I<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.969> had<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.120> mount<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.660> quadcopter

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
I just had to mount it to the quadcopter

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.889 
I just had to mount it to the quadcopter
and<00:00:37.640> provide<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> power<00:00:38.910> source<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.450> requires<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and provide a power source it requires a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.069 
and provide a power source it requires a
3s<00:00:40.379> lipo<00:00:40.559> pack<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.030> either<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.870> run

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
3s lipo pack you can either you know run

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.990 
3s lipo pack you can either you know run
another<00:00:43.320> pair<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.890> paralyzed<00:00:44.730> off<00:00:44.879> your

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
another pair of a paralyzed off your

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.330 
another pair of a paralyzed off your
main<00:00:45.149> battery<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.140> hook<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.070> little

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
main battery or you can hook up a little

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.869 
main battery or you can hook up a little
smaller<00:00:47.579> battery<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.239> did<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:49.879> but

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
smaller battery like I did for it but

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.670 
smaller battery like I did for it but
anyway<00:00:51.180> i<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.690> made<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> quick<00:00:52.050> video<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.379> some

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
anyway i just made a quick video of some

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
anyway i just made a quick video of some
flying<00:00:52.949> around<00:00:53.100> doing<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.430> initial<00:00:53.789> tests<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
flying around doing my initial tests and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660 
flying around doing my initial tests and
we'll<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:55.079> into<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.590> bit<00:00:55.800> but

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
we'll get into that a little bit but

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.880 
we'll get into that a little bit but
real<00:00:56.850> quick<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.989> thing<00:00:58.199> does<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.620> thing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
real quick this thing does have thing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.229 
real quick this thing does have thing
where<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.070> plug<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.489> if<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.059> x

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
where you plug it in if you have x

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
where you plug it in if you have x
channel<00:01:00.629> i<00:01:00.780> plugged<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.530> where<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.160> can

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
channel i plugged in here where you can

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.359 
channel i plugged in here where you can
adjust<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.640> tilt<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.860> gimbal<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.070> it'll

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
adjust the tilt on the gimbal and it'll

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.330 
adjust the tilt on the gimbal and it'll
state<00:01:05.580> leveled<00:01:06.830> wherever<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> tilt

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
state leveled wherever you have it tilt

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.920 
state leveled wherever you have it tilt
the<00:01:08.430> two<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.950> rock<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
the two so you can see I can rock the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.260 
the two so you can see I can rock the
quadcopter<00:01:12.930> stays<00:01:13.350> pretty<00:01:13.500> much<00:01:13.710> level<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
quadcopter stays pretty much level and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.940 
quadcopter stays pretty much level and
the<00:01:15.500> two<00:01:16.500> accesses<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.150> let<00:01:18.630> me<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the two accesses so let me just get to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
the two accesses so let me just get to
the<00:01:20.040> video<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.119> kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.479> how

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the video and you can kind of see how

00:01:21.720 --> 00:05:24.180 
the video and you can kind of see how
performed<00:01:22.229> actually<00:01:22.680> while<00:01:22.799> flying

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:06:04.510 

you

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.519 

and

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:09.529 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:41.920 

Oh
