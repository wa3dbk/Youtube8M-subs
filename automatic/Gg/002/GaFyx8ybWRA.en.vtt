 so for more experienced 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.260
 Well, for starters, I think it's worth talking about 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.420
 tom who such as most 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.119
 prepare the bull for us had to western 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.310
 countries and times are kiltered as player killers 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.559
 le poher peeling knife in fact it does not change 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.059
 and is given as a killer player or player 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.329
 killing fungus by the way in crucian it 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.710
 the expression is officially put into play 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.660
 also in the mites themselves are covered such 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.850
 expressions how to leave mean it meanwhile 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.649
 take up killing other players full 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.190
 a list of his which is found in the game 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.079
 like crucians and most other mom 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.079
 You can look at my website by clicking 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.800
 on this window here which only 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.780
 that slept 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.219
 attack site is not yet ready to link 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.989
 may not be as soon as everyone will 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.640
 ready to be able to see it first 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.500
 I will put the link to the site back in 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.490
 comments on this video if its there 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.810
 no, you see, not everyone is ready to become 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.729
 while the game is pretty simple for that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.009
 just need to kill the player in one of 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.899
 the main locations that you kill 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.399
 Make to say and playing for your 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.500
 coalition or murder which you 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.390
 do in the arena will not make you yet 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.849
 and you probably ask how 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.740
 mark packs of the crowd or why i have 

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.270
 I would like to say the color of nickname red 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.009
 that after killing a player you immediately 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.530
 reputation goes minus that is if you have 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.720
 was 50 to 1200 killed and bitterly tight 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.090
 Immediately will become reputation negative 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.649
 what will happen to me if I kill and slide 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.170
 reputation of your little thing well first 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.880
 I think that it is important to say or if you 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.580
 notice terrible hetony immediately begin 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.349
 attack you and hit I would say no 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.050
 quite a lot for me at ninety second level 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:53.450
 they take a little more than 1000 damage 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.570
 and that they fall from me with two blows 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.950
 however run through the guards out 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.380
 the city is quite real 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.990
 even the way to get into the city which they 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.000
 guards guard this obskazal even in 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.640
 some cities such chase know but 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.860
 except for tan thuron and also if you 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.870
 went to the cat in the event that you coal 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.820
 another fruit will only be worse for you 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.400
 you will have about 4 experience 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.130
 percent and may drop something out of the bags 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 or from your character such as armor 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.870
 jewelry and weapons mount chance 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.390
 loss depends on how much 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.570
 heavily you are gone for a time then influence also 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.580
 the color of your nick protected pink there 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.600
 then red and then gradually comes 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.950
 until purple and removable violet in 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.660
 every kill your character 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.130
 reputation will go away more and 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.810
 more in the minus until it reaches 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.730
 maximum at minus fifty one 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.260
 one thousand two hundred fifty one thousand 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.060
 two hundred is the maximum like 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.520
 negative and positive 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.250
 reputations like this one asking dropout 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.930
 amber items and bags and loss of experience 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.310
 in order to level this 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.290
 opportunity need to buy a protective 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.570
 a capsule that will disappear after death and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.770
 and eliminate up to 100 percent chance 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.209
 that something might fall out of you also 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.000
 in order to level that chance 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.860
 what comes out of you 4 prasadam of experience you need 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.310
 have a platinum guardian angel they 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.530
 there are such low quality 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.180
 ordinary guardian angel and and platinum 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.730
 they reduce to one hundred percent what 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.290
 more precisely reduce the dropout penalty 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.150
 prepare from maybe you want 2 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.040
 percent if you have some sort of shit 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.280
 eu affairs about sleeping another angel of him 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.670
 Stoongov worth bring to you to interfere to 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.459
 100 percent chance of being me chance of being 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.880
 fine experience that is out of you and fall 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.920
 general experience how wrong 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.030

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.900
 experience how to stop being poo foam for 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.000
 order to stop being needed 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.890
 just do the killing of your mobs 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.540
 level or those who are closer to your level 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.340
 with killing every mob you will have 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.400
 increase reputation out of negative 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.510
 positive you will be what they call it 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.790
 common people 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.099
 wash over time you come to 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.930
 Mark 0 and your nickname will also change 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.680
 from purple to red from red and 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.109
 you about 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.329
 from white to blue from biloxi him this 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:15.799
 already from 0 to 10 to 1200 white when white 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.479
 them is a reputation closer to zero 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.039
 that's all guys i wanted to say u 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.970
 me on the site you can see a chance 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.070
 fallout 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.900
 with you depending on the color 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.910
 Your nickname link will be in the description and 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.410
 if it is not there then, and let's not all 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.940
 is ready 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.100
 I also think that in this video you can 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.810
 will tell more about eco things for now 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.870
 run and so on but finally decided that 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.260
 I will dedicate this separate video because 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.060
 data in 95 while stockpiles while fluff it 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.680
 everything is very interesting has changed because 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.020
 that they have their stats there which 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.270
 relatively interesting points vary 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.650
 so it will all be in the following videos 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.570
