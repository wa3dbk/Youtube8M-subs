way for fishtails you would have

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.490 
way for fishtails you would have
obviously<00:01:24.090> found<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.050> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.440> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
obviously found out that this is a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.120 
obviously found out that this is a
two-door<00:01:26.040> car<00:01:26.370> well<00:01:27.330> yes<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.680> two<00:01:28.860> doors

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
two-door car well yes this the two doors

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.670 
two-door car well yes this the two doors
at<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.460> could<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.240> critical

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
at the back could be a critical

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.550 
at the back could be a critical
it<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.670> easy<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.270> recline<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.110> seats<00:01:34.350> in

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it is so easy to recline the seats in

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.510 
it is so easy to recline the seats in
front<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:36.020> it's<00:01:37.020> sort<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.260> and<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
front and it's sort of and you can just

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.320 
front and it's sort of and you can just
put<00:01:38.730> your<00:01:38.760> stuff<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.700 

and<00:01:45.830> get<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:46.950> back<00:01:47.570> this<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.750> parading<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and get it back this is parading as the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.080 
and get it back this is parading as the
people<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.190> myself<00:01:50.370> who<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:50.880> actually

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
people like myself who would actually

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.210 
people like myself who would actually
probably<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.690> using<00:01:52.080> just<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:52.560> seats<00:01:52.860> two

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
probably be using just the two seats two

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
probably be using just the two seats two
front<00:01:53.520> seats<00:01:53.790> most<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.300> time<00:01:54.480> third<00:01:55.050> bag

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
front seats most of the time third bag

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560 
front seats most of the time third bag
actually<00:01:55.830> would<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.160> driving<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.030> all<00:01:57.210> by<00:01:57.420> our

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
actually would be driving it all by our

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
actually would be driving it all by our
own<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.230> I<00:01:58.290> think<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> very<00:01:59.130> very<00:01:59.310> thin

going<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.260> start<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.620> now<00:02:13.650> right<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.910> we<00:02:15.330> head

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
going to start it now right so we head

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.730 
going to start it now right so we head
off<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:20.870> think<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.080> very<00:02:22.260> good<00:02:22.440> thing<00:02:22.620> about

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
off I think the very good thing about

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.530 
off I think the very good thing about
this<00:02:23.100> which<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.520> am<00:02:23.640> totally<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.090> love<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.300> is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
this which I am totally in love with is

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.540 
this which I am totally in love with is
the<00:02:24.630> fact<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.440> absolutely<00:02:25.770> silent<00:02:26.280> I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the fact that it is absolutely silent I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.020 
the fact that it is absolutely silent I
cannot<00:02:26.970> hear<00:02:27.300> any<00:02:28.020> noise<00:02:28.470> at<00:02:28.770> all<00:02:28.910> which<00:02:29.910> is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
cannot hear any noise at all which is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200 
cannot hear any noise at all which is
either<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.270> big<00:02:30.600> relief<00:02:30.990> after<00:02:31.830> driving<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
either the big relief after driving a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.290 
either the big relief after driving a
diesel<00:02:33.930> powered<00:02:34.500> car<00:02:34.740> which<00:02:35.640> where<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
diesel powered car which where the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.120 
diesel powered car which where the
diesel<00:02:36.510> clattered<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.260> absolutely<00:02:37.860> killing

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
diesel clattered is absolutely killing

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.730 
diesel clattered is absolutely killing
and<00:02:38.520> there's<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.270> much<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.420> noise<00:02:39.660> pollution

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
and there's so much of noise pollution

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.320 
and there's so much of noise pollution
that<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.800> don't<00:02:41.190> want<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.580> even<00:02:41.790> lower<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
that I don't want to even lower the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.460 
that I don't want to even lower the
volume<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.780> my<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.540> music<00:02:45.840> system<00:02:45.990> as

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
volume of my of the music system as

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.680 
volume of my of the music system as
opposed<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.520> I<00:02:47.580> think<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.180> totally

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
opposed to that I think this is totally

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.780 
opposed to that I think this is totally
a<00:02:48.900> boo<00:02:51.980> apart<00:02:52.980> from<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.190> noise<00:02:53.340> control

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
a boo apart from the noise control

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.210 
a boo apart from the noise control
levels<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.390> also<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.350> wacky<00:02:55.680> electric

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
levels and also the wacky electric

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.490 
levels and also the wacky electric
technology<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.880> am<00:02:56.940> talking<00:02:57.270> about

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
technology that I am talking about

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.570 
technology that I am talking about
there's<00:02:58.500> something<00:02:58.830> else<00:02:59.010> also<00:02:59.310> which<00:02:59.430> is

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
there's something else also which is

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.130 
there's something else also which is
absolutely<00:02:59.940> brilliant<00:03:00.150> about<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> car<00:03:00.840> which

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
absolutely brilliant about the car which

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.229 
absolutely brilliant about the car which
is<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.410> pin<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.739> press<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.790> brakes

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
is the pin you press the brakes

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.460 
is the pin you press the brakes
there's<00:03:03.570> something<00:03:03.840> about<00:03:03.900> brake<00:03:04.230> energy

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
there's something about brake energy

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.080 
there's something about brake energy
restoration<00:03:05.190> system<00:03:05.340> which<00:03:05.610> actually<00:03:05.760> comes

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
restoration system which actually comes

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.780 
restoration system which actually comes
into<00:03:06.239> function<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.959> there's<00:03:07.410> also<00:03:07.560> uh<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
into function and there's also uh on the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.940 
into function and there's also uh on the
liver<00:03:08.970> there's<00:03:09.330> there's<00:03:09.690> an<00:03:10.260> alphabet<00:03:10.770> which

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
liver there's there's an alphabet which

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.949 
liver there's there's an alphabet which
is<00:03:10.980> B<00:03:11.310> which<00:03:11.850> means<00:03:12.090> boost<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.690> gives<00:03:12.840> you

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
is B which means boost so it gives you

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.080 
is B which means boost so it gives you
an<00:03:13.080> extra<00:03:13.380> oomph<00:03:13.739> whenever<00:03:14.520> you<00:03:14.610> need<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.820> so

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
an extra oomph whenever you need it so

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.660 
an extra oomph whenever you need it so
which<00:03:15.209> what<00:03:15.630> happens<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.920> brake

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
which what happens is that the brake

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.810 
which what happens is that the brake
energy<00:03:17.940> recuperation<00:03:18.480> system<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.350> actually

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
energy recuperation system that actually

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.460 
energy recuperation system that actually
puts<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.030> power<00:03:21.180> back<00:03:21.390> on<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.050> wheels<00:03:22.230> and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
puts the power back on the wheels and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:39.590 
puts the power back on the wheels and
gives<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.130> added<00:03:23.640> food

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.010 

how<00:03:40.600> do<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.780> see<00:03:41.050> in<00:03:41.290> Delhi<00:03:41.530> industries

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
how do you see in Delhi industries

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.060 
how do you see in Delhi industries
well<00:03:43.980> electric<00:03:44.460> vehicles<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.840> think<00:03:46.500> ideal<00:03:46.860> for

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
well electric vehicles I think ideal for

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.120 
well electric vehicles I think ideal for
India<00:03:47.310> because<00:03:47.880> of<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.120> stop-and-go<00:03:48.570> driving

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
India because of a stop-and-go driving

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.470 
India because of a stop-and-go driving
slower<00:03:50.130> speeds<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.210> our<00:03:51.330> city

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
slower speeds that we have in our city

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.860 
slower speeds that we have in our city
centers<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.260> fact<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.620> we<00:03:52.770> import<00:03:53.160> our<00:03:53.310> oil

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
centers the fact that we import our oil

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.000 
centers the fact that we import our oil
the<00:03:54.870> fact<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.290> we<00:03:55.410> have<00:03:55.500> an<00:03:55.620> abundant

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
the fact that we have an abundant

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.770 
the fact that we have an abundant
availability<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.490> other<00:03:56.640> energy<00:03:57.060> sources<00:03:57.420> I

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
availability of other energy sources I

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.780 
availability of other energy sources I
think<00:03:58.350> those<00:03:58.500> features<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.280> high<00:03:59.460> price<00:03:59.760> of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
think those features and high price of

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.030 
think those features and high price of
oil<00:04:00.090> make<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.450> ideal<00:04:00.600> for<00:04:00.750> India<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.350> also<00:04:01.770> have

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
oil make it ideal for India I also have

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.830 
oil make it ideal for India I also have
to<00:04:02.190> agree<00:04:02.490> with<00:04:02.520> Jatin<00:04:03.000> many<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.390> founder<00:04:03.750> of

mine and Rory of ebony says that India
is<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.700> country<00:04:05.760> which<00:04:06.180> is<00:04:06.210> absolutely<00:04:06.720> fit<00:04:07.020> by

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
is a country which is absolutely fit by

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.810 
is a country which is absolutely fit by
electric<00:04:07.590> cars<00:04:07.800> because<00:04:08.130> we<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.640> much<00:04:08.760> a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
electric cars because we have so much a

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.150 
electric cars because we have so much a
stop-and-go<00:04:09.360> traffic<00:04:09.800> now<00:04:10.800> we<00:04:10.860> just

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
stop-and-go traffic now we just

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.090 
stop-and-go traffic now we just
absolutely<00:04:11.880> right<00:04:12.510> because<00:04:13.290> when<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.650> have<00:04:14.040> a

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
absolutely right because when you have a

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.800 
absolutely right because when you have a
lot<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.430> stop<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.640> go<00:04:14.820> traffic<00:04:15.180> there<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.600> a

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
lot of stop and go traffic there is a

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.990 
lot of stop and go traffic there is a

lot of redundant fuel consumption
whereas<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:19.560> bring<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:19.950> cold<00:04:20.190> car

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
whereas in here you bring the cold car

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.790 
whereas in here you bring the cold car
to<00:04:20.610> a<00:04:20.640> halt<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.270> electric<00:04:22.020> motor<00:04:22.230> shuts<00:04:22.530> off

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.560 
to a halt and electric motor shuts off
so<00:04:22.980> there<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.280> absolutely<00:04:23.820> no<00:04:24.120> way<00:04:24.300> stage

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
so there is absolutely no way stage

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.840 
so there is absolutely no way stage
happening<00:04:25.020> here<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.310> not<00:04:26.460> also<00:04:26.670> a

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
happening here and it is not also a

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.600 
happening here and it is not also a
compromise<00:04:27.360> in<00:04:27.510> your<00:04:27.660> range<00:04:27.900> why<00:04:28.710> should<00:04:29.040> I<00:04:29.280> be

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
compromise in your range why should I be

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.340 
compromise in your range why should I be
getting<00:04:30.060> into<00:04:30.600> electric<00:04:30.960> vehicle<00:04:31.260> and

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
getting into electric vehicle and

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.070 
getting into electric vehicle and
compromise<00:04:31.830> on<00:04:32.040> anything<00:04:32.630> that's<00:04:33.630> where<00:04:33.900> the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
compromise on anything that's where the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.290 
compromise on anything that's where the
real<00:04:34.230> answer<00:04:34.680> would<00:04:34.830> come<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:36.060> what<00:04:36.180> I'm

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
real answer would come and what I'm

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.000 
real answer would come and what I'm
hoping<00:04:36.480> is<00:04:36.690> there<00:04:36.930> enough<00:04:37.230> people<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.710> India

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
hoping is there enough people in India

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.610 
hoping is there enough people in India
and<00:04:38.790> of<00:04:39.030> consumers<00:04:39.450> in<00:04:39.570> India<00:04:39.810> would<00:04:40.260> think

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
and of consumers in India would think

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.090 
and of consumers in India would think
that<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:41.070> am<00:04:41.280> without<00:04:41.990> compromising<00:04:43.100> making

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
that I am without compromising making

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.690 
that I am without compromising making
contribution<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.660> environment<00:04:46.220> ok<00:04:47.220> then

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
contribution to the environment ok then

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.220 
contribution to the environment ok then
I<00:04:47.730> think<00:04:48.090> it's<00:04:48.360> going<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.630> take<00:04:48.780> off<00:04:48.930> very<00:04:49.140> well

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
I think it's going to take off very well

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.820 
I think it's going to take off very well
and<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.950> truly<00:04:50.850> believe<00:04:51.320> truly<00:04:52.320> believe<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
and I truly believe truly believe the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.010 
and I truly believe truly believe the
Younger<00:04:53.100> purpose<00:04:53.370> in<00:04:53.460> India<00:04:53.790> has<00:04:54.750> that

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
Younger purpose in India has that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.880 
Younger purpose in India has that
mindset<00:04:55.380> where<00:04:56.040> they<00:04:56.220> feel<00:04:56.520> guilt<00:04:57.060> about

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
mindset where they feel guilt about

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.330 
mindset where they feel guilt about
polluting<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.190> feel<00:04:59.730> guilt<00:04:59.940> about<00:05:00.090> consuming

polluting the feel guilt about consuming

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.010 
polluting the feel guilt about consuming
energy<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.700> then<00:05:02.850> don't<00:05:03.120> need<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:03.810> I

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
energy and then don't need to and I

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.210 
energy and then don't need to and I
would<00:05:04.200> think<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.470> those<00:05:04.620> people<00:05:04.680> when<00:05:05.100> they

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
would think that those people when they

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.710 
would think that those people when they
say<00:05:05.340> yes<00:05:05.430> it's<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.730> good<00:05:05.880> looking<00:05:06.120> vehicle<00:05:06.330> it

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
say yes it's a good looking vehicle it

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.070 
say yes it's a good looking vehicle it
is<00:05:06.750> convenient<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.650> does<00:05:07.800> not<00:05:08.690> it's<00:05:09.690> not<00:05:09.810> sort

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
is convenient it does not it's not sort

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.530 
is convenient it does not it's not sort
of<00:05:10.170> painful<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.620> drive<00:05:10.890> it<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.420> therefore<00:05:12.420> why

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
of painful to drive it and therefore why

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.810 
of painful to drive it and therefore why
should<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.840> not<00:05:13.110> come<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:14.070> buy<00:05:14.190> this<00:05:14.250> vehicle<00:05:14.580> I
