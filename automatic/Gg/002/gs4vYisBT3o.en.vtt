was<00:04:26.970> literally<00:04:27.270> grinding<00:04:28.080> into<00:04:28.350> my<00:04:28.620> bone<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:30.120> I

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
was literally grinding into my bone so I

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.420 
was literally grinding into my bone so I
think<00:04:30.270> that's<00:04:30.510> why<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:31.740> hurt<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.070> little<00:04:32.190> bit

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
think that's why it hurt a little bit

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.990 
think that's why it hurt a little bit
but<00:04:33.650> my<00:04:34.650> foot<00:04:34.950> peeled<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.490> lot<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.290> got<00:04:37.650> ah<00:04:38.160> it

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
but my foot peeled a lot so I got ah it

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.140 
but my foot peeled a lot so I got ah it
touched<00:04:39.780> up<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.520> really<00:04:41.520> needed<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.820> be<00:04:41.910> touched

touched up I really needed to be touched
up<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:43.230> second<00:04:43.680> time<00:04:43.830> hurt<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.940> bad<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.450> was

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290

obviously ribs and stuff to be really
painful<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:06.480> didn't<00:05:06.900> hurt<00:05:07.080> me<00:05:07.290> at<00:05:07.410> all<00:05:07.440> the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
painful it didn't hurt me at all the

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.310 
painful it didn't hurt me at all the
knuckles<00:05:08.580> did<00:05:08.940> not<00:05:09.090> hurt<00:05:09.330> at<00:05:09.510> all<00:05:09.600> like<00:05:10.290> the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
knuckles did not hurt at all like the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.100 
knuckles did not hurt at all like the
first<00:05:10.590> time<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.800> got<00:05:10.980> it<00:05:11.070> done<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:12.110> obviously

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
first time I got it done and obviously

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.260 
first time I got it done and obviously
you<00:05:13.770> need<00:05:13.920> to<00:05:14.010> get<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.220> shaded<00:05:14.490> like<00:05:14.790> every<00:05:15.060> six

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
you need to get it shaded like every six

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.750 
you need to get it shaded like every six
months<00:05:15.600> because<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.860> ink<00:05:17.010> tends<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.520> fall<00:05:17.730> out

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
months because the ink tends to fall out

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.520 
months because the ink tends to fall out
because<00:05:18.300> you're<00:05:18.450> always<00:05:18.660> like<00:05:18.960> washing<00:05:19.260> your

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
because you're always like washing your

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.850 
because you're always like washing your
hand<00:05:20.000> why<00:05:21.000> did<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.240> just<00:05:21.450> do<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.080> head<00:05:22.350> motion

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
hand why did I just do that head motion

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.360 
hand why did I just do that head motion
but<00:05:23.900> anyway<00:05:24.900> you're<00:05:25.590> always<00:05:25.680> washing<00:05:26.280> your

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
but anyway you're always washing your

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.580 
but anyway you're always washing your
hands<00:05:26.640> and<00:05:27.000> like<00:05:27.150> touching<00:05:27.960> things<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.410> stuff

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
hands and like touching things and stuff

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.310 
hands and like touching things and stuff
so<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.820> had<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.240> go<00:05:30.480> back<00:05:32.300> like<00:05:33.300> three<00:05:33.960> months

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
so I had to go back like three months

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.560 
so I had to go back like three months
later<00:05:34.590> to<00:05:35.340> get<00:05:35.490> just<00:05:35.850> touched<00:05:36.060> up<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.360> little

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
later to get just touched up a little

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.770 
later to get just touched up a little
bit<00:05:36.720> and<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:38.160> second<00:05:38.490> time<00:05:38.670> hurt<00:05:38.940> I<00:05:39.150> find

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
bit and the second time hurt I find

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.920 
bit and the second time hurt I find
touch-ups<00:05:40.620> to<00:05:40.800> her<00:05:40.950> way<00:05:41.310> way<00:05:41.640> more<00:05:41.930> than

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
touch-ups to her way way more than

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.620 
touch-ups to her way way more than
actually<00:05:43.740> getting<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:44.040> tattoo<00:05:44.430> done

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
actually getting the tattoo done

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.060 
actually getting the tattoo done
probably<00:05:45.630> because<00:05:46.080> it's<00:05:46.320> like<00:05:46.440> scar<00:05:46.770> tissue

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
probably because it's like scar tissue

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.220 
probably because it's like scar tissue
and<00:05:47.490> you're<00:05:47.640> like<00:05:47.790> grinding<00:05:48.270> into<00:05:48.450> it<00:05:48.720> so<00:05:48.990> I

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
and you're like grinding into it so I

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.600 
and you're like grinding into it so I
can<00:05:49.710> understand<00:05:50.070> why<00:05:50.130> that<00:05:50.310> would<00:05:50.340> hurt<00:05:50.870> um<00:05:51.870> I

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
can understand why that would hurt um I

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.060 
can understand why that would hurt um I
