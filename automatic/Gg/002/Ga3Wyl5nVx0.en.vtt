won't because there is a rare chance
that<00:02:22.000> he<00:02:22.150> won't<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.629> now<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.379> cool<00:02:23.560> thing

that he won't and now the cool thing

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.430 
that he won't and now the cool thing
about<00:02:23.799> this<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.549> they<00:02:25.269> can<00:02:25.510> climb<00:02:25.780> ladders<00:02:26.260> as

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
about this is they can climb ladders as

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.170 
about this is they can climb ladders as
well<00:02:26.830> which<00:02:27.069> is<00:02:27.099> really<00:02:27.220> really<00:02:27.580> sneaky

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
well which is really really sneaky

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180 
well which is really really sneaky
because<00:02:28.840> if<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.470> if<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.799> think<00:02:29.980> you're<00:02:30.069> going

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
because if you if you think you're going

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.440 
because if you if you think you're going
to<00:02:30.220> escape<00:02:30.430> them<00:02:30.760> because<00:02:31.120> you're<00:02:31.209> above

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
to escape them because you're above

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.910 
to escape them because you're above
ground<00:02:31.510> but<00:02:31.959> it's<00:02:31.989> not<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.260> case<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.739> will

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
ground but it's not the case they will

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.369 
ground but it's not the case they will
climb<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> ladders<00:02:33.700> as<00:02:33.909> well<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.599> if<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.079> do

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
climb the ladders as well and if you do

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.259 
climb the ladders as well and if you do
a<00:02:35.409> drop<00:02:36.010> armor<00:02:36.340> because<00:02:36.489> they've<00:02:36.760> killed<00:02:36.970> you

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
a drop armor because they've killed you

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.509 
a drop armor because they've killed you
they<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.290> like<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.620> synonym<00:02:38.890> our<00:02:39.040> chances

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
they have a like a synonym our chances

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.220 
they have a like a synonym our chances
are<00:02:39.640> picking<00:02:39.940> them<00:02:40.060> up<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.079> will

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
are picking them up and but it will

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.170 
are picking them up and but it will
shrink<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.680> fit<00:02:41.709> them<00:02:42.099> so<00:02:42.340> because<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.909> armor

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
shrink to fit them so because the armor

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.520 
shrink to fit them so because the armor
is<00:02:43.209> naturally<00:02:43.599> bigger<00:02:43.810> than<00:02:44.049> what<00:02:44.200> their<00:02:44.349> baby

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
is naturally bigger than what their baby

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.410 
is naturally bigger than what their baby
zombie<00:02:44.739> looks<00:02:45.099> like<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.610> will<00:02:45.879> shrink<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.390> fit

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
zombie looks like it will shrink to fit

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.149 
zombie looks like it will shrink to fit
the<00:02:46.720> actual<00:02:46.989> zombie<00:02:47.019> which<00:02:47.470> i<00:02:47.590> think<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.890> cool

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
the actual zombie which i think is cool

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.009 
the actual zombie which i think is cool
now<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> lot<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.120> people<00:02:49.269> don't<00:02:49.599> know<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.959> but

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
now a lot of people don't know this but

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.949 
now a lot of people don't know this but
baby<00:02:50.440> zombies<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.129> fit<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.970> one<00:02:52.209> by<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.690> gap

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
baby zombies can fit in a one by one gap

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.750 
baby zombies can fit in a one by one gap
so<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.379> place<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.829> block<00:02:54.069> on<00:02:54.250> here<00:02:54.519> and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
so if I place this block on here and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.759 
so if I place this block on here and
break<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.209> he<00:02:55.720> can<00:02:55.930> actually<00:02:56.079> fit<00:02:56.500> out<00:02:56.650> of

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
break this he can actually fit out of

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.680 
break this he can actually fit out of
here<00:02:56.980> I'm<00:02:57.819> just<00:02:58.000> trying<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.209> push<00:02:58.390> him<00:02:58.420> out<00:02:58.629> the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
here I'm just trying to push him out the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.500 
here I'm just trying to push him out the
TV<00:02:58.959> fits<00:02:59.230> gon<00:02:59.579> make<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.640> break<00:03:00.910> for<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.450> fact

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
TV fits gon make a break for it in fact

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.240 
TV fits gon make a break for it in fact
what<00:03:02.079> we'll<00:03:02.200> do<00:03:02.349> is<00:03:02.500> we'll<00:03:02.620> place<00:03:02.829> them<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.099> all

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
what we'll do is we'll place them on all

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.390 
what we'll do is we'll place them on all
four<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.819> that<00:03:04.329> CV<00:03:04.690> does<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:05.019> whole<00:03:05.400> place

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
four and that CV does this whole place

varies on all types of difficulty so if

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.860 
varies on all types of difficulty so if
