okay<00:02:06.500> now<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:07.040> we're<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:07.220> Windows<00:02:07.730> you<00:02:07.970> can

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
okay now that we're in Windows you can

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.170 
okay now that we're in Windows you can
see<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:08.479> we're<00:02:08.990> at<00:02:09.140> four<00:02:09.520> zero<00:02:10.520> zero<00:02:10.610> six

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.780 
which I think comes out to eleven forty
four<00:02:36.680> or<00:02:36.920> something<00:02:37.070> like<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:40.580> eight

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
have to back the timings down on the RAM

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.370 
have to back the timings down on the RAM
to<00:02:45.830> get<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.310> push<00:02:47.210> up<00:02:47.450> over<00:02:47.780> four<00:02:48.020> gigahertz

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380
