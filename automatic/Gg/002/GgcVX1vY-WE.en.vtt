00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.090 

so<00:00:14.090> then<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.870> problem<00:00:15.290> you<00:00:15.410> have<00:00:15.590> here<00:00:15.620> is

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
so then the problem you have here is

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.900 
so then the problem you have here is
that<00:00:16.400> zero<00:00:17.150> is<00:00:17.360> smaller<00:00:18.020> than<00:00:18.290> one<00:00:18.580> so<00:00:19.580> we<00:00:19.790> need

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
that zero is smaller than one so we need

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.890 
that zero is smaller than one so we need
to<00:00:20.060> borrow<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:23.080> unit<00:00:24.099> from<00:00:25.099> this<00:00:25.369> one<00:00:25.730> next<00:00:26.689> to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
to borrow a unit from this one next to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.480 
to borrow a unit from this one next to
it<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.349> that<00:00:27.650> one<00:00:27.890> becomes<00:00:28.250> a<00:00:28.460> zero<00:00:30.190> but<00:00:31.190> that

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
it so that one becomes a zero but that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.850 
it so that one becomes a zero but that
unit<00:00:31.850> that<00:00:32.059> we<00:00:32.360> borrow<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.080> it<00:00:33.410> from<00:00:33.620> this

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
unit that we borrow and it from this

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.790 
unit that we borrow and it from this
place<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.489> worth<00:00:35.800> two<00:00:36.800> in<00:00:37.100> this<00:00:37.580> place<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.800> the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
place is worth two in this place and the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.530 
place is worth two in this place and the
reason<00:00:40.100> for<00:00:40.129> that<00:00:40.280> is<00:00:40.610> if<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:40.940> think<00:00:40.970> about<00:00:41.239> it

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
reason for that is if you think about it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.149 
reason for that is if you think about it
let's<00:00:41.720> say<00:00:41.809> we<00:00:41.989> had<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.260> number<00:00:43.239> 24<00:00:44.860> minus<00:00:45.860> 9

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.910 

we<00:00:49.159> would<00:00:49.370> have<00:00:49.519> to<00:00:49.820> borrow<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.690> unit<00:00:51.320> from<00:00:51.739> the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
we would have to borrow a unit from the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.289 
we would have to borrow a unit from the
2<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.479> this<00:00:53.479> one<00:00:53.720> will<00:00:53.930> become<00:00:54.080> a<00:00:54.440> 14<00:00:55.220> so<00:00:56.030> that

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
2 and this one will become a 14 so that

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.310 
2 and this one will become a 14 so that
means<00:00:56.540> we<00:00:56.659> borrow<00:00:57.019> 10<00:00:58.780> even<00:00:59.780> though<00:00:59.900> for<00:01:00.140> this

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
means we borrow 10 even though for this

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.600 
means we borrow 10 even though for this
tool<00:01:00.620> was<00:01:00.920> only<00:01:01.250> worth<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.670> 1<00:01:02.979> so<00:01:03.979> what<00:01:04.430> we're

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
tool was only worth a 1 so what we're

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.060 
tool was only worth a 1 so what we're
doing<00:01:04.640> is<00:01:04.970> we<00:01:05.180> are<00:01:05.360> borrowing<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.170> base<00:01:06.440> for

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
doing is we are borrowing the base for

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.539 
doing is we are borrowing the base for
this<00:01:07.310> case<00:01:07.640> we're<00:01:07.880> borrowing<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.540> 10<00:01:09.549> because

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
this case we're borrowing a 10 because

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.840 
this case we're borrowing a 10 because
that's<00:01:10.760> base<00:01:11.420> 10<00:01:11.780> arithmetic<00:01:12.190> for<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.369> binary

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
that's base 10 arithmetic for the binary

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.359 
that's base 10 arithmetic for the binary
case<00:01:14.180> we're<00:01:14.510> borrowing<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:15.080> 2<00:01:15.159> because<00:01:16.159> that's

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
case we're borrowing a 2 because that's

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.679 
case we're borrowing a 2 because that's
a<00:01:16.520> binary<00:01:16.880> number<00:01:18.369> which<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.549> base<00:01:19.789> 2<00:01:20.149> 4<00:01:20.479> we're

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
a binary number which is base 2 4 we're

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.569 
a binary number which is base 2 4 we're
borrowing<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.259> base<00:01:21.469> every<00:01:21.890> unit<00:01:22.189> is<00:01:22.340> worth

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
borrowing the base every unit is worth

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:30.130 
borrowing the base every unit is worth
the<00:01:22.820> base<00:01:23.619> so<00:01:24.619> 2<00:01:24.950> minus<00:01:25.340> 1<00:01:26.770> 1<00:01:27.770> 0<00:01:28.100> minus<00:01:29.030> 0<00:01:29.060> C<00:01:29.750> 1

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
the base so 2 minus 1 1 0 minus 0 C 1

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.440 
the base so 2 minus 1 1 0 minus 0 C 1
minus<00:01:30.619> 1<00:01:30.829> 0<00:01:31.359> so<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.539> answer<00:01:32.899> is<00:01:33.079> 1<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.450> that's

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
minus 1 0 so the answer is 1 and that's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.980 
minus 1 0 so the answer is 1 and that's
what<00:01:35.659> we<00:01:35.780> should<00:01:35.990> get<00:01:36.140> since<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:36.740> was<00:01:36.979> 6<00:01:37.340> and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
what we should get since this was 6 and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.450 
what we should get since this was 6 and
this<00:01:38.990> was<00:01:39.259> 5<00:01:39.850> 6<00:01:40.850> minus<00:01:41.179> 5<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.390> 1<00:01:42.039> so<00:01:43.039> let's<00:01:43.369> go

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
this was 5 6 minus 5 is 1 so let's go

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.330 
this was 5 6 minus 5 is 1 so let's go
ahead<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.289> look<00:01:45.289> at<00:01:45.499> a<00:01:45.530> more<00:01:45.890> complicated

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
ahead and look at a more complicated

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.389 
ahead and look at a more complicated
example<00:01:49.119> so<00:01:50.119> let's<00:01:50.329> say<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:50.630> have<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.990> number

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.649 

24<00:01:56.259> in<00:01:57.259> binary<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.189> we<00:01:58.460> wanted<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.819> subtract<00:01:59.479> a

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
24 in binary and we wanted to subtract a

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:09.410 
24 in binary and we wanted to subtract a
9<00:02:00.939> from<00:02:01.939> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.140 

so<00:02:10.420> we

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
so we

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.440 
so we
have<00:02:11.269> is<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:15.099> need<00:02:16.099> say<00:02:16.280> unit<00:02:16.730> so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
have is that this you need say unit so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.110 
have is that this you need say unit so
that<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.720> can<00:02:17.900> subtract<00:02:18.379> one<00:02:18.739> from<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:19.120> but

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
that we can subtract one from it but

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.670 
that we can subtract one from it but
they<00:02:20.329> came<00:02:20.569> borrow<00:02:20.840> from<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.290> next<00:02:21.560> year

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
they came borrow from the next year

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.710 
they came borrow from the next year
because<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.159> one<00:02:22.489> also<00:02:22.700> doesn't<00:02:23.450> have

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
because that one also doesn't have

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.949 
because that one also doesn't have
anything<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.439> lend<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:26.209> go<00:02:26.450> through<00:02:26.689> the<00:02:26.750> next

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
anything to lend so go through the next

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.960 
anything to lend so go through the next
one<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.829> one<00:02:28.040> doesn't<00:02:28.250> have<00:02:28.459> anything<00:02:28.700> to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
one that one doesn't have anything to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.860 
one that one doesn't have anything to
lend<00:02:29.209> either<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.349> then<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.650> get<00:02:30.829> to<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.129> one<00:02:31.870> so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
lend either so then we get to the one so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.740 
lend either so then we get to the one so
then<00:02:33.049> we<00:02:33.170> borrow<00:02:33.409> a<00:02:33.650> unit<00:02:34.069> from<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.459> one<00:02:34.750> so

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
then we borrow a unit from this one so

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.890 
then we borrow a unit from this one so
becomes<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.349> 0<00:02:36.799> now<00:02:37.659> this<00:02:38.659> 0<00:02:39.310> becomes<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.489> 2<00:02:40.900> but

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
becomes a 0 now this 0 becomes a 2 but

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.819 
becomes a 0 now this 0 becomes a 2 but
it's<00:02:42.079> it<00:02:42.319> wants<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.069> lend<00:02:43.280> one<00:02:44.319> unit<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.799> the

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
it's it wants to lend one unit to the

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.910 
it's it wants to lend one unit to the
other<00:02:45.980> zero<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.530> remember<00:02:48.650> that

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
other zero but you have to remember that

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.530 
other zero but you have to remember that
that<00:02:48.980> unions<00:02:49.579> work<00:02:49.849> to<00:02:50.569> in<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.920> place<00:02:52.540> but

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
that unions work to in this place but

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.629 
that unions work to in this place but
we're<00:02:54.170> not<00:02:54.319> done<00:02:54.500> yet<00:02:54.530> because<00:02:55.069> we<00:02:55.310> need<00:02:55.340> to

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
we're not done yet because we need to

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:02.199 
we're not done yet because we need to
lend<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.359> 1<00:02:56.629> to<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.859> last<00:02:58.099> zero<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:01.209> so

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
lend a 1 to the to the last zero and so

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.190 
lend a 1 to the to the last zero and so
this<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.659> what<00:03:02.840> happens<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.409> now<00:03:03.769> 2<00:03:03.829> minus<00:03:04.549> 1<00:03:04.730> is

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
this is what happens so now 2 minus 1 is

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.690 
this is what happens so now 2 minus 1 is
1<00:03:06.200> 1<00:03:06.470> minus<00:03:06.980> 0<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.549> 1<00:03:07.579> 1<00:03:08.480> minus<00:03:08.510> 0<00:03:09.049> is<00:03:09.290> 1<00:03:09.700> once

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
1 1 minus 0 is 1 1 minus 0 is 1 once

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.759 
1 1 minus 0 is 1 1 minus 0 is 1 once
again<00:03:10.970> we<00:03:11.090> have<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.329> same<00:03:11.540> problem<00:03:12.049> we<00:03:12.170> have<00:03:12.319> 0

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
again we have the same problem we have 0

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.819 
again we have the same problem we have 0
minus<00:03:13.159> 1<00:03:13.359> just<00:03:14.359> borrow<00:03:14.629> a<00:03:14.930> unit<00:03:15.410> from<00:03:15.530> here

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
minus 1 just borrow a unit from here

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.439 
minus 1 just borrow a unit from here
that<00:03:16.819> makes<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.269> 0<00:03:17.569> a<00:03:17.629> 2<00:03:17.750> 2<00:03:18.560> minus<00:03:18.590> 1<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.489> this

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
that makes this 0 a 2 2 minus 1 and this

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:21.819 
that makes this 0 a 2 2 minus 1 and this
should<00:03:20.599> be<00:03:20.629> a<00:03:20.750> 0<00:03:21.019> I'm<00:03:21.139> sorry<00:03:21.379> since<00:03:21.650> we

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
should be a 0 I'm sorry since we

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.300 
should be a 0 I'm sorry since we
borrowed<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.370> unit<00:03:22.699> so<00:03:23.359> 2<00:03:23.419> minus<00:03:24.019> 1<00:03:24.199> is<00:03:24.440> 1<00:03:24.709> and

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
borrowed a unit so 2 minus 1 is 1 and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.619 
borrowed a unit so 2 minus 1 is 1 and
our<00:03:25.940> answer<00:03:26.389> is<00:03:27.699> 15<00:03:28.699> and<00:03:28.970> that's<00:03:29.359> what<00:03:29.510> we

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
our answer is 15 and that's what we

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.069 
our answer is 15 and that's what we
expected<00:03:30.139> since<00:03:30.409> this<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.919> 24<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:32.780> other

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
expected since this is 24 and this other

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.459 
expected since this is 24 and this other
number<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.799> 9
