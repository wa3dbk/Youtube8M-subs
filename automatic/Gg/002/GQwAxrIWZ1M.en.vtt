 Today, referring to the people of New York blaspheme 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.759

 what are used for people so percent 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.159
 in connection to 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.540
 a sole in the end 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.030

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.690
 Darnell others you meet as a man in the train many people and what 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.819
 it is noticeable in 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.160
 next to me at everyone 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.850

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 complete Apropos and 9 turns 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.340

 and where I sure if then it will disappear 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.180
 So always a pleasure is always nice her point of view never 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.050
 let this go 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.840
 min after 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.799
 four days 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.569
 Fourth place came 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.149

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.299
 This slowed down conviction that people are standing still because 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.439
 they agree on 9 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.749
 It's kinda flippant, in general, smile is also ending 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.289
 Later, there was not really so if I have a four percent so 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.049
 in addition to the investor no longer be 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.569
 the 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
 Yes, it is 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.529
 the look of their website, the people that they are 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:04.129
 When you realize that has partially refuse to operate a bit 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.999
 around 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.940
 less 4 percent why 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.119
 for less problems so 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.359

 almost as far on the chest as that 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.029
 and if you put 2 on 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:34.169
 or truth percent what you really something cool is always there 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.459

 Look at schalke-keeper incredibly friendly 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.189
 one of the most unnecessary 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.849
 but not at all 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.629
 "Of course that's the happy ending, there is one of the lead too and 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.589
 close 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.519
 Anyone who gets a picture of it in the individual wagons in the middle 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.209

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.909
 Ishmael traced back between waiting 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.680

 He talked about giving to many 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.270
 and also in point 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.539
 What else is there, what I hope, that it is still a bouncer so people 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.539
 stand a door and say hello 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.150

 Isis is like that 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:49.920

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.069
 All agreed that this was not an American markets I believe 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.069
 where the couple but that interested 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:14.629
 but if you meet people in New York, then who would be brittle? 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.039
 the way here always action it also worries me 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.500
 and percent 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.770
