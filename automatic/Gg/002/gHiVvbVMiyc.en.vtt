levitation<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.060> believe<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.689> is

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
levitation now I believe this is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
levitation now I believe this is
something<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.039> put<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.580> you'll

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
something you can just put on so you'll

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.339 
something you can just put on so you'll
put<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> power<00:00:30.179> disk<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.599> display<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
put the power disk on the display and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.780 
put the power disk on the display and
then<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> character<00:00:32.250> you're<00:00:32.340> playing<00:00:32.489> as

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
then the character you're playing as

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.299 
then the character you're playing as
will<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.420> cape<00:00:33.930> it'll<00:00:34.680> probably<00:00:35.010> be

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
will have that cape it'll probably be

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
will have that cape it'll probably be
able<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.880> something<00:00:36.180> maybe<00:00:36.480> glide<00:00:36.930> or

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
something because basically in 1.0 we do

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.940 
something because basically in 1.0 we do

and there's also with 2.0 there's going

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.729 
and there's also with 2.0 there's going
to<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.570> Falcon<00:00:49.230> you're<00:00:49.620> gonna

Gamora and star-lord and rocket are so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.080 
Gamora and star-lord and rocket are so
that's<00:02:35.100> why<00:02:35.340> they're<00:02:35.550> doing<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.060> think

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
that's why they're doing it and I think

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.910 
that's why they're doing it and I think
that<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.990> why<00:02:37.170> they're<00:02:37.380> doing<00:02:37.620> Doctor<00:02:37.860> Strange

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
that is why they're doing Doctor Strange

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.520 
that is why they're doing Doctor Strange
both<00:02:38.550> for<00:02:38.820> fanservice<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.780> because<00:02:40.410> they

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
both for fanservice and because they

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.470 
both for fanservice and because they
want<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.800> get<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.220> character<00:02:41.730> more<00:02:41.940> popular

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
want to get this character more popular

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.440 
want to get this character more popular
now<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.070> from<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.250> run-up<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.120> actual

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
now so from the run-up to the actual

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.540 
now so from the run-up to the actual
movie<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.990> releases<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.280> think

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
movie that releases so I really think

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.730 
movie that releases so I really think
that<00:02:47.640> we're<00:02:48.390> gonna<00:02:48.510> see<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> lot<00:02:48.990> more<00:02:49.050> rare

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
that we're gonna see a lot more rare

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.130 
that we're gonna see a lot more rare
characters<00:02:50.520> hopefully<00:02:51.390> be<00:02:51.540> added<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.020> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
characters hopefully be added to the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.449 
characters hopefully be added to the
game<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> near<00:02:52.890> future

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
game in the near future

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.640 
game in the near future
so<00:02:53.850> yeah<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.750> don't<00:02:54.989> really<00:02:55.200> know<00:02:55.380> what<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
so yeah this I don't really know what it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.520 
so yeah this I don't really know what it
could<00:02:55.770> be<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.580> think<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.900> could<00:02:58.410> be<00:02:58.500> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
could be it's I think it could be a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.110 
could be it's I think it could be a
team-up<00:02:58.830> power<00:02:59.130> disc<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.580> could<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.850> something

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
team-up power disc it could be something

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.430 
team-up power disc it could be something
else<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.510> could<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.750> mission<00:03:01.230> because

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
else it could be a mission because

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.320 
else it could be a mission because
there's<00:03:01.800> like<00:03:01.980> little<00:03:02.250> mini<00:03:02.520> games

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
there's like little mini games

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.870 
there's like little mini games
well<00:03:04.080> not<00:03:04.200> mini<00:03:04.380> games<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:04.770> like<00:03:04.920> tower

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
well not mini games it's like tower

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.630 
well not mini games it's like tower
defense<00:03:06.360> where<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.959> would<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.950> you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
defense where you would like have to you

from<00:03:14.250> platform<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:15.000> platform<00:03:15.200> just<00:03:16.200> fighting

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
from platform to platform just fighting

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.280 
from platform to platform just fighting
enemies<00:03:17.209> it's<00:03:18.209> kind<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.510> similar<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.959> how<00:03:18.989> like

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
enemies it's kind of similar to how like

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.380 
enemies it's kind of similar to how like
Marvel<00:03:19.620> open<00:03:19.860> alliances<00:03:20.489> layout<00:03:20.820> was<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.209> think

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
Marvel open alliances layout was I think

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.350 
Marvel open alliances layout was I think
that's<00:03:21.570> what<00:03:21.720> they<00:03:22.280> give<00:03:23.280> an<00:03:23.400> example<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.910> so

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
that's what they give an example to so

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.240 
that's what they give an example to so
it's<00:03:24.600> similar<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.890> yeah<00:03:26.010> guys<00:03:26.190> that's

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
it's similar to that so yeah guys that's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.320 
it's similar to that so yeah guys that's
pretty<00:03:26.640> much<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.390> power<00:03:27.690> disc

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
pretty much it on this power disc

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.550 
pretty much it on this power disc
