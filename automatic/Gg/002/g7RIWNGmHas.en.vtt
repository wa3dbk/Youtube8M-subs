00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.510
 today we are going to prepare cake pops of donuts 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.510
 original 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.210
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.360
 There are 4 donuts 100 grams of cheese in 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.330
 cream 100 ml of cream to assemble and 50 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.079
 grams of icing sugar and we already have the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.789
 donuts cheese cream sugar icing 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.849
 and the cream 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.679
 now to start we take the mincer and 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.180
 we are going to introduce the donuts to 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.280
 pieces so you can shred the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.810
 guys I forgot to tell you that the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.900
 donuts must be from the previous day 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.400
 so they are a little dry yes I know 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.400
 rarely are there 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.559
 As you can see, they are going to be like that 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.920
 we have to do this with all the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.920
 donuts 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.610
 and here you can see them once 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.560
 we have all crumbled now let's 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.110
 take the cream cheese and we will overturn 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.930
 over a bowl of small size and with 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.850
 help of a rod blender let's go 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.810
 to beat it so that it softens and is no longer 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.810
 easy to work 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.659
 once it is creamy we are adding the 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.290
 sugar glas little by little until it is 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.290
 all integrated 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.540
 this is the texture that will leave you 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.160
 Now let's take the cream and let's 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.350
 put in a bowl and what are we going to 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.540
 to do is to mount it, so we take a 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.610
 rod blender and let's beat the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.560
 the secret for the cream to mount 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.650
 well is to always keep the bank or the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.930
 cool bowl once you see that it is 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.700
 heavy as you can see that it does not fall 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.160
 rods and when turning the bowl 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.650
 it does not fall and we'll have it ready now 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.960
 let's take the whipped cream and we're going 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.000
 to add to the cream cheese and we're going to 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.580
 Mix with enveloping movements to 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.100
 that the cream does not go down 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.570
 this cream that we are preparing is 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.570
 cheese frosting flame 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.500
 now let's take the donuts 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.659
 crushed and we're going to add a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.079
 teaspoon of the mixture that we just 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.150
 prepare and we will stir well once 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.860
 of ais that the dough has been well 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.020
 compact already we will have it ready 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.090
 it depends on the dry ones that are yours 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.600
 donuts are going to need more or less 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.600
 frosting 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.870
 our mass should not stay very 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.850
 dry or too wet so to know if 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.070
 it's already done we're going to take a little ball and 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.840
 we are going to give it shape and it does not have 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.840
 to crack or to stick 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.370
 and now comes the easy thing so we're going to 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.709
 shape our cake pops we go to 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.379
 take a little ball and we will shape it 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.629
 we're going to flatten it a bit and we're going to 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.790
 make a little hole in the center I 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.440
 I'm going to help with this utensil but if 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.440
 you can not use anything else 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.160
 we have to do this with the whole mass 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.100
 As you can see we are already having some 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.540
 cake pops few donut-shaped one 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.550
 Once we have them, we are going to leave them 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.650
 rest in the fridge for half an hour 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.650
 so that the dough becomes more compact 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.980
 the ingredients that you are going to need 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.019
 for coverage are white chocolate 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.209
 to melt and color gel dye 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.010
 orange if you do not have coloring 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.230
 orange angel you will need to combine 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.000
 yellow and magenta gel dye for 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.000
 so achieve an orange hue 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.960
 and we have chocolate ready here 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.000
 white so let's put a 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.610
 pan to the bain-marie and we're going to 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.260
 melt and once it is melted it 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.270
 remove from heat let cool 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.820
 a little 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.920
 now let's take the stick and let's 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.170
 make a small hole in our cake 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.050
 pop in the form of donut for later that we 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.820
 it is easier to introduce the stick as well 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.340
 that now we introduce the chocolate 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.830
 white and in the hole that we had 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.890
 marked and so on with all our cake 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.890
 pops 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.459
 You must be very careful not to 

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:55.379
 pierce through the little hole in our 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:58.759
 cake pop otherwise when 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.759
 we will be broken 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.920
 now to our chocolate coverage 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.500
 white we add the color and we will 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.090
 cover our cake pops so with 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.820
 help from a spoon we cover them with 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.890
 careful not to weigh much and we're going 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.740
 to give him a few taps to 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.140
 eliminate excess coverage once 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.090
 we have it, we are going to let it rest 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.800
 I recommend that you let it rest in the 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.550
 refrigerator to harden more 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.550
 quickly 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.280
