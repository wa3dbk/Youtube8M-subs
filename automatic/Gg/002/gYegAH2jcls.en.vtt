00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.420 
because when you put the flowers in it
will<00:01:26.220> cover<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.549> lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.330> imperfections

our next step is to prepare several

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.910 
our next step is to prepare several
short<00:01:32.490> stem<00:01:32.820> flowers<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:34.110> cover<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> surface

short stem flowers to cover the surface
of<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> egg<00:01:35.420> we've<00:01:36.420> chosen<00:01:37.610> button<00:01:38.610> mums<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.119> a

of the egg we've chosen button mums in a
green<00:01:39.479> color<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.400> you<00:01:41.400> simply<00:01:41.610> clip<00:01:42.090> them<00:01:42.299> off

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
green color and you simply clip them off

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.219 
green color and you simply clip them off
with<00:01:43.649> about<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> half<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.670> inch<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.180> 3/4<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.079> an

inch stem on each flower

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.370 
inch stem on each flower
next<00:01:51.330> we<00:01:51.450> simply<00:01:51.840> take<00:01:52.100> each<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.550> mums<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
next we simply take each of the mums and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.290 
next we simply take each of the mums and
start<00:01:56.150> inserting<00:01:57.150> them<00:01:57.480> into<00:01:59.030> the<00:02:00.030> egg-shaped

start inserting them into the egg-shaped

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.690 
start inserting them into the egg-shaped
foam<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:03.270> helps<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:04.050> insert<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.920> flowers<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.640> a
