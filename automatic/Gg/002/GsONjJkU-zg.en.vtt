00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
go so the speed should be about the same

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.859 
go so the speed should be about the same
because<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> same<00:01:24.119> network<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.750> as

the full side so let me try another side
how<00:02:09.570> about<00:02:09.750> ESPN<00:02:11.480> yes<00:02:12.480> p<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:14.570> calm<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.600> over

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
how about ESPN yes p and calm and over

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:30.640 
how about ESPN yes p and calm and over
here<00:02:16.530> yes<00:02:18.650> PM<00:02:27.110> hit<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.130> let<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.610> go

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
here yes PM hit this this and let it go

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.790 
here yes PM hit this this and let it go
so<00:02:31.650> now<00:02:31.800> they're<00:02:32.040> loading<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.580> same<00:02:32.820> site<00:02:33.300> I

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
so now they're loading the same site I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.010 
so now they're loading the same site I
mean<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.550> speeds<00:02:35.880> would<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.330> pretty<00:02:36.840> much

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
mean that speeds would be pretty much

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.610 
mean that speeds would be pretty much
the<00:02:37.080> same<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:38.670> because<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.930> both<00:02:40.110> android

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the same just because it's both android

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.330 
the same just because it's both android

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
the Wi-Fi so go on the 3g network i can

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.150 
the Wi-Fi so go on the 3g network i can
do<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> speedtest<00:02:59.760> real<00:03:00.239> quick<00:03:00.590> which<00:03:01.590> pretty

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
do a speedtest real quick which pretty

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.830 
do a speedtest real quick which pretty
much<00:03:02.220> tells<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.790> how<00:03:03.180> fast<00:03:03.450> they<00:03:03.720> would<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:04.610> so

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
much tells you how fast they would be so

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.590 
much tells you how fast they would be so
do<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.989> again<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:10.489> get<00:03:11.489> full<00:03:11.700> signal<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:12.330> for

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
do that again I get full signal here for

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
if that's because this one took you know

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.710 
if that's because this one took you know
it<00:06:33.100> could<00:06:33.220> be<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.520> packets<00:06:34.150> but<00:06:34.420> let<00:06:34.540> me<00:06:34.570> try

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
it could be the packets but let me try

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.340 
it could be the packets but let me try
again<00:06:34.930> just<00:06:35.440> to<00:06:35.560> confirm<00:06:39.900> yeah<00:06:40.900> it<00:06:41.080> should<00:06:41.260> be

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
again just to confirm yeah it should be

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.740 
again just to confirm yeah it should be
about<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.650> same<00:06:41.830> very<00:06:42.100> good<00:06:42.390> i'll<00:06:43.390> do<00:06:43.540> it<00:06:43.630> one

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
about the same very good i'll do it one

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.990 
about the same very good i'll do it one
more<00:06:43.810> time<00:06:43.930> just<00:06:44.260> to<00:06:44.380> see<00:06:45.100> it<00:06:45.220> i<00:06:45.400> think<00:06:45.760> it<00:06:45.970> just

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
more time just to see it i think it just

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.730 
more time just to see it i think it just
depends<00:06:46.480> this<00:06:46.690> one<00:06:46.870> starts<00:06:47.290> you<00:06:47.710> know

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
depends this one starts you know

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.710 
depends this one starts you know
downloading<00:06:48.490> a<00:06:48.640> little<00:06:49.030> bit<00:06:49.150> first<00:06:49.390> so<00:06:49.600> it

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
downloading a little bit first so it

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.870 
downloading a little bit first so it
gets<00:06:49.840> the<00:06:50.020> better<00:06:51.750> download<00:06:52.750> speed<00:06:53.050> maybe

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
gets the better download speed maybe

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.370 
gets the better download speed maybe
because<00:06:54.880> every<00:06:55.270> time<00:06:55.300> this<00:06:55.690> one<00:06:55.900> is<00:06:56.050> trying<00:06:56.260> to

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
because every time this one is trying to

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.890 
because every time this one is trying to
download<00:06:56.830> this<00:06:57.160> one<00:06:57.370> is<00:06:57.520> going<00:06:57.700> you<00:06:58.150> know<00:06:58.240> so

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
download this one is going you know so

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.540 
download this one is going you know so
it's<00:06:59.350> gonna<00:06:59.500> be<00:06:59.560> about<00:06:59.710> the<00:06:59.890> same<00:07:00.100> we<00:07:00.310> track

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
it's gonna be about the same we track

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:10.770 
it's gonna be about the same we track
down<00:07:05.400> hmm<00:07:06.930> interesting<00:07:08.010> to<00:07:09.010> note<00:07:09.190> that<00:07:09.780> the

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
down hmm interesting to note that the

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.600 
down hmm interesting to note that the
droid<00:07:11.050> x<00:07:11.320> it<00:07:11.530> might<00:07:11.770> be<00:07:11.950> a<00:07:11.980> little<00:07:12.190> bit<00:07:12.400> faster

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
droid x it might be a little bit faster

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.410 
droid x it might be a little bit faster
it<00:07:13.000> could<00:07:13.240> be<00:07:13.390> due<00:07:13.690> to<00:07:13.720> the<00:07:14.020> fact<00:07:14.200> that<00:07:14.410> the

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
it could be due to the fact that the

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.960 
it could be due to the fact that the
system<00:07:16.420> is<00:07:16.510> a<00:07:16.570> bit<00:07:16.810> little<00:07:17.110> bit<00:07:17.230> faster<00:07:17.970> so

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
system is a bit little bit faster so

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.480 
system is a bit little bit faster so
that<00:07:19.330> could<00:07:19.690> be<00:07:19.780> it<00:07:19.930> so<00:07:20.890> now<00:07:21.010> i<00:07:21.040> just<00:07:21.130> showed

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490 
that could be it so now i just showed

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.550 
that could be it so now i just showed
you<00:07:21.700> the<00:07:22.000> speed<00:07:22.240> test<00:07:22.510> of<00:07:22.810> the<00:07:23.050> both<00:07:23.230> phones

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
you the speed test of the both phones

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.110 
you the speed test of the both phones
and<00:07:24.150> next<00:07:25.150> up<00:07:25.300> we'll<00:07:25.510> have<00:07:25.690> the<00:07:25.900> speed<00:07:26.200> test<00:07:27.120> of

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
and next up we'll have the speed test of

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.850 
and next up we'll have the speed test of
menus<00:07:28.840> and<00:07:29.020> stuff<00:07:29.140> so<00:07:29.650> next<00:07:30.550> video
