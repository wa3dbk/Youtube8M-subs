on<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.480> middle<00:04:06.750> row<00:04:06.959> you're<00:04:07.319> going<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.530> go<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
on the middle row you're going to go the

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.809 
on the middle row you're going to go the
opposite<00:04:08.250> way<00:04:08.310> you're<00:04:08.669> gonna<00:04:08.819> fold<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.419> back

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:24.330 
this one back and the little flap will
go<00:04:17.229> forward<00:04:18.329> like<00:04:19.329> that<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.710> on<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.039> bottom

go forward like that and on the bottom
section<00:04:24.580> you'll<00:04:25.150> go<00:04:25.330> up<00:04:25.960> again<00:04:26.289> one<00:04:26.889> up

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
section you'll go up again one up

section you'll go up again one up
another<00:04:27.820> one<00:04:28.060> up<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:30.460> then<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.849> piece<00:04:31.210> right

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
another one up and then this piece right

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.960 
another one up and then this piece right
here<00:04:31.710> you're<00:04:32.710> actually<00:04:33.009> going<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.340> score<00:04:33.669> this

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
here you're actually going to score this

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.210 
here you're actually going to score this
half<00:04:34.720> an<00:04:34.900> inch<00:04:35.080> right<00:04:35.470> down<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.800> middle<00:04:35.949> and

half an inch right down the middle and

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.219 
half an inch right down the middle and
then<00:04:36.669> this<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.120> going<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.360> fold<00:04:37.570> in<00:04:37.750> half<00:04:37.960> and

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
then this is going to fold in half and

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.070 
then this is going to fold in half and
be<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.759> little<00:04:40.090> piece<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:40.419> you<00:04:40.690> see

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
be the that little piece that you see

this particular one also I went through

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.219 
this particular one also I went through
and<00:05:24.130> rounded<00:05:24.699> all<00:05:24.970> of<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.270> corners<00:05:25.659> so<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.080> was

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
and rounded all of the corners so it was

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.620 
and rounded all of the corners so it was
a<00:05:26.259> rounded<00:05:26.830> look<00:05:27.009> you<00:05:28.000> could<00:05:28.180> do<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.419> or<00:05:28.599> you

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
a rounded look you could do that or you

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.230 
a rounded look you could do that or you
could<00:05:28.870> keep<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.199> square<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:30.039> then<00:05:30.639> see<00:05:31.150> it

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
could keep it square and then see it

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.149 
could keep it square and then see it
flops<00:05:31.539> down<00:05:31.810> that<00:05:32.560> would<00:05:32.680> be<00:05:32.800> glued<00:05:33.039> down

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
flops down that would be glued down

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.120 
flops down that would be glued down
there's<00:05:33.520> your<00:05:33.669> slap<00:05:33.880> for<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.180> tag<00:05:34.620> another<00:05:35.620> spot

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
and you'd have another spot for a tag

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.649 
and you'd have another spot for a tag
and<00:05:41.620> fotomat<00:05:42.099> and<00:05:42.400> then<00:05:42.520> another<00:05:42.759> spot<00:05:43.180> here

make<00:06:13.599> it<00:06:13.780> so<00:06:13.960> that<00:06:13.990> when<00:06:14.199> everything<00:06:14.710> is<00:06:14.800> all

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
make it so that when everything is all

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.370 
make it so that when everything is all
folded<00:06:15.130> up<00:06:15.340> together<00:06:16.169> everything<00:06:17.169> will<00:06:17.259> be

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
folded up together everything will be

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.600 
folded up together everything will be
right<00:06:17.530> side<00:06:17.740> up<00:06:17.800> because<00:06:18.280> this<00:06:18.460> particular

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
right side up because this particular

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.370 
right side up because this particular
one<00:06:18.880> it<00:06:19.150> looks<00:06:19.330> like<00:06:19.509> it's<00:06:19.659> upside<00:06:20.050> down<00:06:20.080> when

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
one it looks like it's upside down when

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.909 
one it looks like it's upside down when
it's<00:06:20.500> here<00:06:20.830> but<00:06:21.460> it's<00:06:21.699> actually<00:06:21.880> a<00:06:22.120> flop<00:06:22.919> flop

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
it's here but it's actually a flop flop

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.410 
it's here but it's actually a flop flop
piece<00:06:24.340> when<00:06:24.580> you<00:06:24.669> get<00:06:24.789> around

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
piece when you get around

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.630 
piece when you get around
besides<00:06:25.750> so<00:06:26.020> anyway<00:06:26.980> if<00:06:27.040> that<00:06:27.250> makes<00:06:27.430> it<00:06:27.550> any

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
besides so anyway if that makes it any

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.820 
besides so anyway if that makes it any
easier<00:06:27.760> for<00:06:28.090> you<00:06:28.420> and<00:06:28.630> hopefully<00:06:29.530> that<00:06:29.710> was

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
easier for you and hopefully that was

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.710 
easier for you and hopefully that was
helpful<00:06:30.040> and<00:06:30.340> I<00:06:31.090> will<00:06:31.480> I<00:06:32.820> will<00:06:33.820> put<00:06:34.030> list<00:06:34.300> the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
helpful and I will I will put list the

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.960 
helpful and I will I will put list the
sizes<00:06:35.290> of<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.650> mats<00:06:35.860> for<00:06:36.100> everything<00:06:36.580> and<00:06:36.820> the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
sizes of the mats for everything and the

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.630 
sizes of the mats for everything and the
sizes<00:06:37.330> of<00:06:37.450> the<00:06:37.600> tags<00:06:38.250> probably<00:06:39.250> in<00:06:39.460> the

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
sizes of the tags probably in the

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.780 
sizes of the tags probably in the
beginning<00:06:39.940> of<00:06:40.150> the<00:06:40.240> video<00:06:40.360> so<00:06:41.260> that<00:06:41.790> you'll
