00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.500
 This time against the ball in front of the Mac 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.460
 Which leg should I use? 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:17.640
 Because there was to say and do not know I think I want a little doing about it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:24.320
 I wonder if I put out the right foot by the technology I do 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.320
 I think I have to do something about whether I'm going left and I'm going to put out my left foot 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.630
 Well it will stop but I'll say from conclusion 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.809
 Slow technology is slow 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.320
 When doing the technology to return in the lower rotation 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.320
 Right foot 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.829
 It will shed yourself Nari early 5 Well flick 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.140
 When you have a left foot 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 It is a place to put out 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.420
 Say or why 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.200
 Lower rotation type 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 When you do this stop Tsutsuzuki, the ball you send is also slow 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.950
 Bourbon come back from the other party to say that slow is expected Well 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.730
 fine 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:10.010
 There is no such thing as a child whose technology is easy to do 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.010
 In put the fire out a fair right foot 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.520
 We can put in the body and process the technique 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.520
 That's right, next time 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.659
 When doing flicks or sinks or other quick techniques, it's the left foot , but with this right foot 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.990
 It's so hard to do 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.420
 Hard You die is also painful'm Ku will take doing it in the way in what before back spears 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.480
 Nunn 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.700
 Out the left foot 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:48.360
 Flick and sink , then return with this left foot 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 Then it is easy to get even if the ball size does not get in the way too much 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.979
 Long ball car easy to hit the next ball without coming home 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.310
 I can do that kind of system or something like that I try to reference by all means 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.310
 Please give me 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.479
