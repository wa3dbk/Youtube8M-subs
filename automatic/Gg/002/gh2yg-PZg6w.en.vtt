activate movement Brian uses hip
placement<00:01:51.009> it's<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.490> pretty<00:01:51.670> easy<00:01:51.759> movement

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420

you<00:01:52.720> know<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.200> just<00:01:53.350> lean<00:01:53.680> him<00:01:53.770> leaning<00:01:54.220> to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
you know you just lean him leaning to

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.700 
you know you just lean him leaning to
the<00:01:54.460> left<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.850> little<00:01:55.030> put<00:01:55.570> your<00:01:55.720> weight<00:01:55.900> lean

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
the left a little put your weight lean

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.260 
the left a little put your weight lean
to<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:56.920> right<00:01:57.009> it's<00:01:57.850> going<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.030> take<00:01:58.150> another

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
to the right it's going to take another

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.260 
to the right it's going to take another
step<00:01:58.660> and<00:01:58.960> with<00:01:59.650> even<00:02:00.070> more<00:02:00.250> practice<00:02:00.850> Brian

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
step and with even more practice Brian

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.480 
step and with even more practice Brian
should<00:02:01.690> be<00:02:01.869> able<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.320> make<00:02:02.470> advanced<00:02:03.220> moves

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
should be able to make advanced moves

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.230 
should be able to make advanced moves
