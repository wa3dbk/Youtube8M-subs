here's dry and I do it this way too

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.570 
here's dry and I do it this way too
because<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:20.359> have<00:00:21.169> a<00:00:21.259> lot<00:00:21.289> more<00:00:21.619> hair<00:00:21.890> now<00:00:22.099> so<00:00:22.460> it

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
because I have a lot more hair now so it

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.849 
because I have a lot more hair now so it
takes<00:00:22.730> my<00:00:22.970> hair<00:00:23.179> forever<00:00:23.419> to<00:00:23.990> dry<00:00:24.169> if<00:00:24.529> I<00:00:24.650> just

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
takes my hair forever to dry if I just

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.609 
takes my hair forever to dry if I just
leave<00:00:25.160> it<00:00:25.339> down<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.660> i'll<00:00:26.779> pull<00:00:27.050> it<00:00:27.199> up<00:00:27.380> it

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
leave it down so i'll pull it up it

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.319 
leave it down so i'll pull it up it
stretches<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.249> out<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:28.699> it<00:00:28.910> lets<00:00:29.119> the

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
stretches it out and it lets the

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.170 
stretches it out and it lets the
perimeter<00:00:29.810> drive<00:00:30.079> first<00:00:30.499> so<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:31.519> way<00:00:31.820> it's

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
perimeter drive first so that way it's

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.670 
perimeter drive first so that way it's
not<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:33.410> dim<00:00:34.570> underneath<00:00:35.570> when<00:00:36.230> it's<00:00:36.380> time<00:00:36.440> for

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
not so dim underneath when it's time for

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.700 
not so dim underneath when it's time for
me<00:00:36.770> to<00:00:36.860> go<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:36.980> sleep<00:00:37.310> ok<00:00:38.060> so<00:00:38.690> I'm<00:00:38.960> going<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.500> let

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
think because it's so soft you would

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.020 
think because it's so soft you would
think<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.259> can<00:04:54.440> use<00:04:54.650> more<00:04:54.949> and<00:04:55.069> more<00:04:55.280> but<00:04:56.000> I

not drag runchy the only negative I
would<00:05:02.750> say<00:05:03.849> micros<00:05:04.849> are<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.210> lot<00:05:05.599> more<00:05:05.629> defined

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
would say micros are a lot more defined

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.360 
would say micros are a lot more defined
so<00:05:07.009> I<00:05:07.039> do<00:05:07.220> get<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.639> little<00:05:07.940> bit<00:05:08.150> more<00:05:08.240> shrinkage

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
so I do get a little bit more shrinkage

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.619 
so I do get a little bit more shrinkage
there's<00:05:10.370> Leila<00:05:12.430> she<00:05:13.430> hears<00:05:13.639> me<00:05:13.819> talking<00:05:13.849> just

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629 
there's Leila she hears me talking just

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.529 
there's Leila she hears me talking just
like<00:05:14.690> why<00:05:15.020> are<00:05:15.050> you<00:05:15.289> not<00:05:15.440> in<00:05:15.470> here<00:05:16.300> don't<00:05:17.300> think

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
like why are you not in here don't think

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.279 
like why are you not in here don't think
this<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:18.199> um<00:05:18.860> I<00:05:19.270> do<00:05:20.270> get<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.810> little<00:05:21.050> bit

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
this is um I do get a little bit

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.469 
this is um I do get a little bit
shrinkage<00:05:21.860> with<00:05:22.099> this<00:05:22.310> but<00:05:22.880> it's<00:05:23.060> okay

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
shrinkage with this but it's okay

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.320 
shrinkage with this but it's okay
because<00:05:23.509> my<00:05:23.840> hair<00:05:24.080> looks<00:05:24.409> so<00:05:24.710> good<00:05:25.009> I<00:05:25.490> feel

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
because my hair looks so good I feel

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.170 
because my hair looks so good I feel
like<00:05:26.509> the<00:05:26.750> crows<00:05:27.020> look<00:05:27.259> better<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:28.180> they're

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
like the crows look better and they're

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.689 
like the crows look better and they're
more<00:05:29.479> defined<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.889> don't<00:05:31.370> mind<00:05:31.580> the

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
more defined so I don't mind the

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.089 
more defined so I don't mind the
shrinkage<00:05:32.060> at<00:05:32.210> all<00:05:32.360> and<00:05:32.770> after<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.860> day<00:05:34.039> too

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
shrinkage at all and after the day too

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.760 
shrinkage at all and after the day too
it's<00:05:34.880> okay<00:05:35.449> like<00:05:35.780> my<00:05:35.960> hair<00:05:36.169> is<00:05:36.199> stretched<00:05:36.560> out

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
it's okay like my hair is stretched out

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.999 
it's okay like my hair is stretched out
or<00:05:37.069> I<00:05:37.159> could<00:05:37.400> just<00:05:37.430> use<00:05:37.699> a<00:05:38.120> diffuser<00:05:38.539> and<00:05:39.020> a

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
or I could just use a diffuser and a

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.559 
or I could just use a diffuser and a
concentrator<00:05:40.639> should<00:05:40.849> stretch<00:05:41.030> them<00:05:41.180> out<00:05:41.270> so

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
concentrator should stretch them out so

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.719 
concentrator should stretch them out so
that<00:05:41.599> that's<00:05:41.960> not<00:05:42.139> a<00:05:42.199> problem<00:05:42.440> for<00:05:42.560> me<00:05:42.740> I<00:05:43.009> love

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
that that's not a problem for me I love

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.080 
that that's not a problem for me I love
the<00:05:43.849> way<00:05:43.969> it<00:05:44.150> feels<00:05:44.560> it's<00:05:45.560> inexpensive<00:05:46.280> it's

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
the way it feels it's inexpensive it's

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.110 
the way it feels it's inexpensive it's
comparable<00:05:47.870> to<00:05:48.050> eco<00:05:48.289> styler<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:49.099> yes<00:05:49.729> if<00:05:50.030> I

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
comparable to eco styler and yes if I

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.909 
comparable to eco styler and yes if I
don't<00:05:50.300> have<00:05:50.419> one<00:05:50.719> I<00:05:50.960> just<00:05:51.139> use<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.440> other<00:05:51.590> and

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
don't have one I just use the other and

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.909 
don't have one I just use the other and
this<00:05:52.699> is<00:05:52.849> going<00:05:52.969> to<00:05:53.090> get<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.210> heavy<00:05:53.419> rotation

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
this is going to get a heavy rotation

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.610 
this is going to get a heavy rotation
