online so I literally just measure it to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.310 
online so I literally just measure it to
be<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.429> okay<00:01:56.789> about<00:01:57.060> how<00:01:57.299> far<00:01:57.630> okay<00:01:58.170> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
be like okay about how far okay that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.320 
be like okay about how far okay that
seems<00:01:58.470> right<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:58.799> my<00:01:59.070> head<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.090> could<00:02:00.240> do

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
seems right for my head and you could do

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.730 
seems right for my head and you could do
like<00:02:00.450> any<00:02:00.659> color<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.110> comes<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:01.409> all<00:02:01.530> colors

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
like any color it comes in all colors

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.770 
like any color it comes in all colors
and<00:02:02.159> then<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.610> cool<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.000> bandit<00:02:03.600> keep
