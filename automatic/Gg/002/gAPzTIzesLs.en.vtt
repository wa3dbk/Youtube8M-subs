on<00:01:38.319> some<00:01:38.679> people<00:01:38.920> say<00:01:39.100> yes<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.369> some<00:01:39.640> people

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
on some people say yes and some people

on some people say yes and some people
say<00:01:40.149> no<00:01:40.329> I<00:01:40.569> think<00:01:40.899> that<00:01:41.140> when<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:41.409> watch<00:01:41.560> it

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
say no I think that when you watch it

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.830 
say no I think that when you watch it
you<00:01:42.130> definitely<00:01:42.729> have<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.240> story<00:01:43.539> in<00:01:43.659> your<00:01:43.689> head

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
I think that the opening formation is

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.719 
I think that the opening formation is
what<00:01:50.740> he<00:01:50.860> saw<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.340> orange<00:01:51.850> groves

what he saw in orange groves

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.999
