I<00:00:36.140> know<00:00:36.199> it's<00:00:36.530> important<00:00:37.040> if<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:37.250> have<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
I know it's important if you have the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.160 
I know it's important if you have the
first<00:00:37.640> couple<00:00:37.940> of<00:00:38.120> pics<00:00:38.360> grab<00:00:38.720> with<00:00:38.870> Danny<00:00:39.050> and

Tomlinson go ahead grab Steven Jackson

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.970 
Tomlinson go ahead grab Steven Jackson
but<00:00:41.690> if<00:00:42.110> you're<00:00:42.320> a<00:00:42.350> little<00:00:42.559> later<00:00:42.769> in<00:00:42.949> that

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
but if you're a little later in that

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.770 
but if you're a little later in that
first<00:00:43.309> round<00:00:43.400> nothing<00:00:43.940> wrong<00:00:44.089> with<00:00:44.330> grabbing

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
first round nothing wrong with grabbing

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.229 
first round nothing wrong with grabbing
a<00:00:44.930> wide<00:00:45.170> receiver<00:00:45.739> assuming<00:00:46.430> they<00:00:46.790> are<00:00:46.820> much

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
a wide receiver assuming they are much

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.939 
a wide receiver assuming they are much
better<00:00:47.510> than<00:00:47.720> anyone<00:00:48.110> else<00:00:48.409> on<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.680> field

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
better than anyone else on the field

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.609 
better than anyone else on the field
that<00:00:49.190> being<00:00:49.430> said<00:00:49.670> Randy<00:00:50.479> Moss<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:51.019> exactly

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:51.619 
that being said Randy Moss is exactly

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.170 
that being said Randy Moss is exactly
that<00:00:51.710> he's<00:00:52.040> coming<00:00:52.280> off<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.489> record-breaking

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
that he's coming off a record-breaking

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.549 
that he's coming off a record-breaking
year<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:53.720> while<00:00:53.839> I<00:00:53.869> don't<00:00:54.199> think<00:00:54.440> he'll

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
year and while I don't think he'll

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.410 
year and while I don't think he'll
follow<00:00:54.799> suit<00:00:55.190> with<00:00:55.400> those<00:00:55.790> type<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.030> numbers

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
follow suit with those type of numbers

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.270 
follow suit with those type of numbers
this<00:00:56.600> year<00:00:56.659> I<00:00:57.080> still<00:00:57.470> do<00:00:57.680> think<00:00:57.949> he<00:00:58.040> could

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
this year I still do think he could

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.420 
this year I still do think he could
hover<00:00:58.519> around<00:00:58.729> 15<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.540> 18<00:00:59.900> touchdowns<00:01:00.409> I<00:01:00.920> think

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
hover around 15 to 18 touchdowns I think

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.820 
hover around 15 to 18 touchdowns I think
he<00:01:01.549> can<00:01:01.760> get<00:01:02.000> over<00:01:02.059> 1200<00:01:02.900> yards<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:03.440> that

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
he can get over 1200 yards and that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.740 
he can get over 1200 yards and that
should<00:01:04.070> be<00:01:04.190> much<00:01:04.489> much<00:01:04.790> better<00:01:05.119> than<00:01:05.390> anyone

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
should be much much better than anyone

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.830 
should be much much better than anyone
else<00:01:06.110> at<00:01:06.409> his<00:01:06.619> position<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.369> for<00:01:07.549> that<00:01:07.640> reason

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
else at his position so for that reason

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.390 
else at his position so for that reason
nothing<00:01:08.840> wrong<00:01:09.049> at<00:01:09.290> all<00:01:09.409> with<00:01:09.680> grabbing<00:01:09.920> Randy

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
nothing wrong at all with grabbing Randy

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.219 
nothing wrong at all with grabbing Randy
Moss<00:01:10.580> with<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.909> seventh<00:01:11.299> eighth<00:01:11.510> ninth<00:01:11.869> pick

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
Moss with the seventh eighth ninth pick

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.870 
Moss with the seventh eighth ninth pick
in<00:01:12.380> fact<00:01:12.650> I<00:01:12.799> would<00:01:12.979> argue<00:01:13.010> that<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.850> a

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
in fact I would argue that that is a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.359 
in fact I would argue that that is a
steal<00:01:14.450> moving<00:01:15.260> on<00:01:15.380> let's<00:01:15.560> take<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:15.830> look<00:01:16.100> at<00:01:16.250> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
steal moving on let's take a look at the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.099
