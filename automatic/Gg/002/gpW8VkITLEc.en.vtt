as<00:00:00.120> you<00:00:00.210> can<00:00:00.329> see<00:00:00.539> now<00:00:01.530> that<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.770> painted<00:00:02.040> over

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
as you can see now that I painted over

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.650 
as you can see now that I painted over
it<00:00:02.720> the<00:00:03.720> background<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> solid<00:00:04.710> black<00:00:05.660> and

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
it the background is a solid black and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.730 
it the background is a solid black and
you're<00:00:06.960> gonna<00:00:07.049> want<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.350> repeat<00:00:07.589> this

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
you're gonna want to repeat this

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.680 
you're gonna want to repeat this
processes<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.460> go<00:00:08.580> up<00:00:08.790> as<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.300> can<00:00:09.510> see<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
processes you go up as you can see the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.350 
processes you go up as you can see the
gray<00:00:09.900> has<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> same<00:00:10.349> cutout<00:00:10.679> issue<00:00:11.240> so<00:00:12.240> I'll

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
gray has the same cutout issue so I'll

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.259 
gray has the same cutout issue so I'll
just<00:00:12.540> repeat<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.929> process<00:00:13.610> using<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.820> light

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
just repeat the process using the light

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.330 
just repeat the process using the light
gray<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> white<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.070> then<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> light

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
gray in the white and then the light

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340 
gray in the white and then the light
gray<00:00:17.490> we've<00:00:17.670> got<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> same<00:00:18.000> treatment<00:00:18.350> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
gray we've got the same treatment the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.420 
gray we've got the same treatment the
white<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.650> don't<00:00:19.800> need<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.160> for

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
white you don't need to do it for

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.010 
white you don't need to do it for
because<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> light<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.600> white<00:00:21.750> will<00:00:21.900> be

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
because the light is the white will be

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.279 
because the light is the white will be
top<00:00:22.289> layer<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> now<00:00:27.810> they<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.080> selected

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
top layer and now they have it selected

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.620 
top layer and now they have it selected
I'm<00:00:28.830> gonna<00:00:29.039> want<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> show<00:00:29.429> use<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.820> dropper

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
I'm gonna want to show use my dropper

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.130 
I'm gonna want to show use my dropper
tool<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.859> proper<00:00:32.250> tone<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.579> gray

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
tool so I get that proper tone of gray

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:49.130 
tool so I get that proper tone of gray
and<00:00:34.140> take<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> brush<00:00:34.739> tool<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:47.899> don't<00:00:48.899> want

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and take the brush tool you don't want

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.479 
and take the brush tool you don't want
to<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.260> sure<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.500> use<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.920> dropper<00:00:50.280> tool<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to make sure you use this dropper tool a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
to make sure you use this dropper tool a
lot<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> proper<00:00:51.629> tones<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
lot so you have the proper tones of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.619 
lot so you have the proper tones of
Gray's<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.410> such<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> little

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
Gray's and such it can get a little

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
Gray's and such it can get a little
confusing<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.980> than<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.309> tone

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
confusing if you have more than one tone

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.970 
confusing if you have more than one tone
of<00:00:56.670> gray<00:00:57.199> even<00:00:58.199> though<00:00:58.440> they're<00:00:58.590> separated

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
of gray even though they're separated

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
of gray even though they're separated
out<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> different<00:00:59.460> ways<00:00:59.780> alright<00:01:00.780> now<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
out in the different ways alright now I

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.260 
out in the different ways alright now I
have<00:01:01.199> my<00:01:01.320> image<00:01:01.350> totally<00:01:01.890> layered<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
have my image totally layered out as you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.109 
have my image totally layered out as you
can<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.080> undo<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> layers<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.280> you

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can see if I undo the layers here you

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.340 
can see if I undo the layers here you
can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> progression<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.930> which<00:01:07.049> they<00:01:07.170> go

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
can see the progression at which they go

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.179 
can see the progression at which they go
you<00:01:07.560> start<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.040> black<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:09.360> gray<00:01:10.189> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you start off with black then gray and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.340 
you start off with black then gray and
light<00:01:11.430> gray<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:12.600> white<00:01:14.630> now<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:16.200> you're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
light gray then white now when you're

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
light gray then white now when you're
making<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> stencil<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.400> want<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.850> one

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
making the stencil you want to have one

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.539 
making the stencil you want to have one
thing<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> definitely<00:01:18.720> check<00:01:19.549> your

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
thing that you definitely check your

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.910 
thing that you definitely check your
solid<00:01:21.210> black<00:01:21.240> layer<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.869> gonna<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.200> fine<00:01:22.439> but

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
solid black layer is gonna be fine but

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.740 
solid black layer is gonna be fine but
once<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> start<00:01:23.400> layering<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
once you start layering up you have to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.060 
once you start layering up you have to
make<00:01:24.869> sure<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.530> floating

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
make sure that you don't have floating

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.830 
make sure that you don't have floating
islands<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.330> by<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.630> those

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
islands and what I mean by that those

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.039 
islands and what I mean by that those
are<00:01:27.960> areas<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> are<00:01:29.390> inside<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.750> gray

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
are areas that are inside of your gray

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.859 
are areas that are inside of your gray
or<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.890> other<00:01:31.979> layer<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.299> black<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
or your other layer that are black and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.230 
or your other layer that are black and
see-through<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.540> let's<00:01:36.540> say<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.380> layer

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
see-through so let's say on this layer

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.819 
see-through so let's say on this layer
this<00:01:39.240> area<00:01:39.509> right<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.750> whereas<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.650> be

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
this area right here whereas I would be

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.240 
this area right here whereas I would be
is<00:01:41.810> completely<00:01:42.810> open<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.950> won't<00:01:44.070> work

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
is completely open and that won't work

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889 
is completely open and that won't work
because<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> cut<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> stencil

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
because when you go to cut the stencil

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.600 
because when you go to cut the stencil
that<00:01:46.229> piece<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.860> can't<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.220> hanging<00:01:47.579> there

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that piece just can't be hanging there

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.639 
that piece just can't be hanging there
it<00:01:47.790> has<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.180> attached<00:01:48.420> salta<00:01:49.110> stencils

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it has to be attached salta stencils

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
it has to be attached salta stencils
have<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.950> solid<00:01:50.310> pieces<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.390> let's<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.720> this

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
have to be solid pieces so let's do this

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
have to be solid pieces so let's do this
I'll<00:01:51.930> take<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> brush<00:01:52.350> tool<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.159> I'll<00:01:53.310> touch

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I'll take the brush tool and I'll touch

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.080 
I'll take the brush tool and I'll touch
up<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.909> these<00:01:54.270> floating<00:01:54.659> areas<00:01:55.969> you<00:01:56.969> don't

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
up all these floating areas you don't

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.429 
up all these floating areas you don't
always<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> fill<00:01:57.750> them<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:57.990> sometimes

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
always have to fill them in sometimes

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.810 
always have to fill them in sometimes
you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> little<00:01:58.979> creative<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.460> find

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
you can get a little creative and find

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.850 
you can get a little creative and find
ways<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> work<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.570> using<00:02:00.780> bridges<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
ways to work them in using bridges and

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.670 
ways to work them in using bridges and
lines<00:02:02.540> but<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> make<00:02:04.290> sure<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.560> you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
lines but you have to make sure that you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.170 
lines but you have to make sure that you
have<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.070> otherwise<00:02:05.399> your<00:02:05.640> stencil<00:02:06.000> will

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
have this otherwise your stencil will

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.869 
have this otherwise your stencil will
not<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:06.659> solid<00:02:07.079> piece<00:02:07.550> there<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.640> some

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
not be one solid piece there are some

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.979 
not be one solid piece there are some
areas<00:02:09.030> though<00:02:09.270> where<00:02:09.420> you're<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.690> going

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
areas though where you're not just going

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.540 
areas though where you're not just going
to<00:02:10.110> want<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> fill<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.069> with<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> paintbrush

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
to want to fill in with the paintbrush

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.960 
to want to fill in with the paintbrush
and<00:02:11.879> you're<00:02:12.060> going<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
and you're going to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.880 
and you're going to
make<00:02:13.360> actual<00:02:13.750> bridges<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> way<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.800> do

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
make actual bridges and the way to do

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.280 
make actual bridges and the way to do
that<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.160> just<00:02:15.370> take<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.610> erase<00:02:15.910> tool<00:02:16.290> and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
that is just take the erase tool and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.110 
that is just take the erase tool and
just<00:02:17.500> kind<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.710> erase<00:02:18.010> lines<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:18.970> don't

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
just kind of erase lines in so you don't

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.230 
just kind of erase lines in so you don't
lose<00:02:19.240> some<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.510> your<00:02:19.600> detail<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.940> best<00:02:22.120> way

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
lose some of your detail the best way

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.550 
lose some of your detail the best way
when<00:02:22.330> you're<00:02:22.450> making<00:02:22.990> bridge<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.410> make

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
when you're making bridge is to make

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.810 
when you're making bridge is to make
sure<00:02:23.680> you're<00:02:23.800> not<00:02:23.890> making<00:02:24.040> straight<00:02:24.580> lines

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
sure you're not making straight lines

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.670 
sure you're not making straight lines
and<00:02:25.180> you're<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:25.510> making<00:02:25.750> lines<00:02:25.930> across<00:02:26.230> areas

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
and you're not making lines across areas

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.900 
and you're not making lines across areas
where<00:02:27.210> they<00:02:28.210> will<00:02:28.780> seem<00:02:29.110> odd<00:02:29.380> or<00:02:29.650> out<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.860> place

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
where they will seem odd or out of place

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.860 
where they will seem odd or out of place
you<00:02:30.910> always<00:02:31.030> want<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.330> make<00:02:31.480> sure<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.750> when

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
you always want to make sure that when

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.150 
you always want to make sure that when
you<00:02:31.960> make<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.170> line<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.950> seems<00:02:34.320> somewhat<00:02:35.320> fluid

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
you make a line it seems somewhat fluid

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.910 
you make a line it seems somewhat fluid
and<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.610> actually<00:02:36.910> part<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.180> image<00:02:37.920> so

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
and it is actually part of the image so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.590 
and it is actually part of the image so
as<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.160> look<00:02:39.310> over<00:02:39.370> my<00:02:39.610> image<00:02:39.910> here<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.270> can<00:02:40.450> see

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
as I look over my image here I can see

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.090 
as I look over my image here I can see
that<00:02:40.750> I've<00:02:40.900> gotten<00:02:41.260> rid<00:02:41.350> of<00:02:41.410> pretty<00:02:41.710> much<00:02:41.740> all

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
that I've gotten rid of pretty much all

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.520 
that I've gotten rid of pretty much all
the<00:02:42.760> islands<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:44.350> there<00:02:44.590> are<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:47.410> you're

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
the islands that there are and you're

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.660 
the islands that there are and you're
gonna<00:02:47.620> want<00:02:47.800> repeat<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.130> step<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.340> every

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
gonna want repeat this step for every

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.280 
gonna want repeat this step for every
single<00:02:48.970> layer<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.600> as<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.780> go<00:02:49.840> up<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.170> light

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
single layer so as I go up to the light

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.950 
single layer so as I go up to the light
gray<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.880> see<00:02:52.000> others<00:02:52.180> use<00:02:52.330> floating<00:02:52.720> areas

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
gray I can see others use floating areas

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.290 
gray I can see others use floating areas
here<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.310> want<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.760> leave<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.030> some<00:02:55.240> of

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
here but I want to leave in some of

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.610 
here but I want to leave in some of
these<00:02:55.360> floating<00:02:55.690> areas<00:02:56.020> because<00:02:56.290> they<00:02:56.440> add<00:02:56.590> a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
these floating areas because they add a

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.650 
these floating areas because they add a
lot<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:56.860> good<00:02:57.070> detail<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.240> I'll<00:02:58.330> just<00:02:58.480> take<00:02:58.630> my

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
lot of good detail so I'll just take my

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:10.809 
lot of good detail so I'll just take my
erase<00:02:59.500> tool<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.010> kind<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:01.680> fill<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.920> gaps

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.020 

you<00:03:11.420> see<00:03:11.569> his<00:03:11.689> eye<00:03:11.840> here<00:03:12.140> it's<00:03:12.290> kind<00:03:12.469> of

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
you see his eye here it's kind of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.429 
you see his eye here it's kind of
swingoff<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.329> I'll<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.569> erase<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:14.900> back

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439 
swingoff so I'll just erase that back

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.629 
swingoff so I'll just erase that back
looks<00:03:16.069> alright<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:19.099> from<00:03:19.280> what<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.430> can<00:03:19.519> tell

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
looks alright and from what I can tell

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.379 
looks alright and from what I can tell
they're<00:03:20.060> pretty<00:03:20.599> much<00:03:20.689> no<00:03:20.930> other<00:03:21.139> islands<00:03:22.389> and

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
they're pretty much no other islands and

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.899 
they're pretty much no other islands and
then<00:03:23.900> go<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.829> white<00:03:24.980> layer<00:03:25.219> that<00:03:25.760> looks

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
then go to the white layer that looks

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.160 
then go to the white layer that looks
just<00:03:26.060> fine<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:27.709> I<00:03:27.739> have<00:03:28.129> my<00:03:29.170> completed

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
just fine so now I have my completed

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.300 
just fine so now I have my completed
stencil<00:03:30.650> image<00:03:31.000> from<00:03:32.000> here<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.299> can<00:03:32.450> print<00:03:33.310> as

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
stencil image from here you can print as

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.759 
stencil image from here you can print as
you<00:03:34.519> can<00:03:34.639> see<00:03:34.849> it's<00:03:35.629> totally<00:03:35.900> layered<00:03:36.290> out<00:03:36.530> and

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
you can see it's totally layered out and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.259 
you can see it's totally layered out and
ready<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.069> go<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:40.459> print<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.879> can<00:03:40.999> be<00:03:41.090> very

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
ready to go and to print it can be very

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.420 
ready to go and to print it can be very
simple<00:03:41.659> if<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.290> just<00:03:42.439> want<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.680> make<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.829> small

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
simple if you just want to make a small

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.059 
simple if you just want to make a small
sized<00:03:43.669> image<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.870> only<00:03:45.379> have<00:03:45.530> one<00:03:45.799> layer

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
sized image just only have one layer

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.459 
sized image just only have one layer
visible<00:03:47.060> at<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.150> time<00:03:47.359> go<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.900> file<00:03:49.150> print<00:03:50.150> and

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:50.469 
visible at a time go to file print and

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.869 
visible at a time go to file print and
then<00:03:51.469> you're<00:03:51.650> going<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.829> want<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.159> fit<00:03:52.609> scale

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
then you're going to want to fit scale

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.159 
then you're going to want to fit scale
the<00:03:53.030> media<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.599> will<00:03:53.750> fit<00:03:54.049> it

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
the media and that will fit it

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.890 
the media and that will fit it
completely<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.799> your<00:03:54.980> piece<00:03:55.159> of<00:03:55.280> paper<00:03:55.459> and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
completely to your piece of paper and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.800 
completely to your piece of paper and
then<00:03:56.900> just<00:03:56.930> print<00:03:57.319> each<00:03:57.590> layer<00:03:57.889> once<00:03:58.810> making

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
then just print each layer once making

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.390 
then just print each layer once making
sure<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.260> each<00:04:00.379> time<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.159> only

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
sure that each time that is the only

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.849 
sure that each time that is the only
visible<00:04:01.849> layer<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.510> it'll<00:04:03.349> separate<00:04:03.680> them

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
visible layer and it'll separate them

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.800 
visible layer and it'll separate them
all<00:04:03.980> out<00:04:04.159> a<00:04:04.519> good<00:04:05.239> thing<00:04:05.419> to<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:05.599> when<00:04:05.719> you're

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
all out a good thing to do when you're

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.110 
all out a good thing to do when you're
printing<00:04:05.930> though<00:04:06.230> is<00:04:06.519> go<00:04:07.519> through<00:04:07.549> your<00:04:07.790> image

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
printing though is go through your image

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.110 
printing though is go through your image
and<00:04:08.949> of<00:04:09.949> course<00:04:10.159> save<00:04:10.430> before<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:10.849> do<00:04:10.969> this

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
and of course save before you do this

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.159 
and of course save before you do this
but<00:04:11.389> go<00:04:11.900> through<00:04:11.930> image<00:04:12.409> and<00:04:13.719> take<00:04:14.719> everything

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
but go through image and take everything

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.379 
but go through image and take everything
and<00:04:15.349> turn<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.799> to<00:04:15.829> black<00:04:16.190> or<00:04:16.459> whatever<00:04:17.000> gray

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
and turn it to black or whatever gray

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.289 
and turn it to black or whatever gray
you'd<00:04:17.599> like<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.900> use<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:19.669> way<00:04:19.909> it'll<00:04:20.180> be<00:04:20.239> a

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
you'd like to use this way it'll be a

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.200 
you'd like to use this way it'll be a
lot<00:04:20.509> easier<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.520> cut<00:04:22.520> out<00:04:22.699> and<00:04:23.000> it'll

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
lot easier to cut out and it'll

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:42.630 
lot easier to cut out and it'll
definitely<00:04:23.539> stand<00:04:23.810> out<00:04:23.990> more<00:04:24.139> from<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.380> paper

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.500 

am<00:04:43.640> I<00:04:43.700> doing<00:04:43.910> this<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.090> get<00:04:44.240> more<00:04:44.330> of<00:04:44.450> a

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
am I doing this to get more of a

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.540 
am I doing this to get more of a
contrast<00:04:44.990> with<00:04:45.170> the<00:04:45.320> white<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.430> also

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
contrast with the white and you also

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.650 
contrast with the white and you also
want<00:04:46.730> to<00:04:46.760> make<00:04:46.880> sure<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.090> do<00:04:47.240> this<00:04:47.390> on<00:04:47.510> any

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
want to make sure you do this on any

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.240 
want to make sure you do this on any
layers<00:04:47.930> that<00:04:48.200> are<00:04:48.290> light<00:04:48.500> gray<00:04:48.770> or<00:04:49.220> light

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
layers that are light gray or light

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.580 
layers that are light gray or light
because<00:04:50.210> they<00:04:50.330> might<00:04:50.510> not<00:04:50.660> show<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:50.930> up<00:04:51.140> at<00:04:51.380> all

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
because they might not show it up at all

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:00.730 
because they might not show it up at all
on<00:04:51.740> your<00:04:51.770> paper<00:04:55.750> all<00:04:56.750> right<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:59.590> that's<00:05:00.590> how

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
on your paper all right and that's how

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.930 
on your paper all right and that's how
you<00:05:00.800> make<00:05:01.010> yourself<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.670> multi<00:05:02.480> layer<00:05:02.660> step
