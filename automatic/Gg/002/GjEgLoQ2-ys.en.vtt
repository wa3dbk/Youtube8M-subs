can<00:04:11.480> be<00:04:11.660> tricky<00:04:12.169> because<00:04:12.380> he<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.829> very

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
can be tricky because he is a very

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.220 
can be tricky because he is a very
optional<00:04:13.760> boss<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.239> I<00:04:14.299> say<00:04:14.450> very<00:04:14.690> optional

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
optional boss and I say very optional

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.990 
optional boss and I say very optional
because<00:04:15.380> it's<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:16.070> easy<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.489> miss<00:04:16.789> if<00:04:16.820> you

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
because it's so easy to miss if you

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.240 
because it's so easy to miss if you
don't<00:04:17.239> know<00:04:17.299> what<00:04:17.419> you're<00:04:17.570> looking<00:04:17.810> for<00:04:17.989> he<00:04:18.979> is

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
don't know what you're looking for he is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.920 
don't know what you're looking for he is
the<00:04:19.430> guardian<00:04:19.639> of<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.180> dark<00:04:20.359> moon<00:04:20.510> blade<00:04:20.750> he

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
the guardian of the dark moon blade he

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.990 
the guardian of the dark moon blade he
owns<00:04:21.140> it<00:04:21.380> basically<00:04:21.799> and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
owns it basically and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.270 
owns it basically and
you<00:04:23.510> have<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:23.750> go<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.140> find<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.590> place<00:04:24.710> where

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
you have to go and find the place where

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.820 
you have to go and find the place where
you<00:04:25.790> can<00:04:26.180> go<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:26.510> join<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.170> Darkmoon<00:04:27.590> blood

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
you can go to join the Darkmoon blood

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.620 
you can go to join the Darkmoon blood
covenant<00:04:28.040> and<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.240> don't<00:04:29.420> know<00:04:29.480> where

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
covenant and if you don't know where

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.030 
covenant and if you don't know where
there<00:04:29.780> is<00:04:29.900> I'd<00:04:30.110> advise<00:04:30.410> getting<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.800> video

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
there is I'd advise getting a video

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.840 
there is I'd advise getting a video
walkthrough<00:04:31.220> because<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.670> will<00:04:31.760> be<00:04:31.820> very

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
walkthrough because it will be very

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.600 
walkthrough because it will be very
tricky<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.510> explain<00:04:32.960> now<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:33.920> need<00:04:34.340> to<00:04:34.460> get

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
tricky to explain now you need to get

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.590 
tricky to explain now you need to get
gwyndolin<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.330> twice<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:36.970> you'll<00:04:37.970> need<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.210> bow

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
gwyndolin so twice and you'll need a bow

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.580 
gwyndolin so twice and you'll need a bow
of<00:04:38.630> +10<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:40.070> get<00:04:40.280> his<00:04:40.460> Darkmoon<00:04:40.970> bow<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.600> you

actually need to be upgraded you could

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.530 
actually need to be upgraded you could
do<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.220> right<00:04:52.250> off<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.610> bat<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.420> it
