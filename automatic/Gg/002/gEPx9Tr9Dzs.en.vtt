00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.860 
good but just make sure you get that
left<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.660> right<00:02:47.810> motion<00:02:47.990> going

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
left and right motion going

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.110 
left and right motion going
eventually<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.800> can<00:02:51.830> actually<00:02:52.160> get<00:02:52.760> tired<00:02:53.030> of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
eventually you can actually get tired of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.420 
eventually you can actually get tired of
going<00:02:53.180> after<00:02:53.570> bite<00:02:53.959> will<00:02:54.470> attract<00:02:54.800> general<00:02:55.220> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
going after bite will attract general to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.700 
going after bite will attract general to
a<00:02:55.459> corner<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.000> turn<00:02:56.209> this<00:02:56.510> family

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
a corner and turn this family

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.570 
a corner and turn this family
Oh<00:02:57.740> what<00:02:58.280> happened<00:02:58.430> that

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.220 

I<00:03:01.610> did<00:03:02.450> spin<00:03:03.349> out<00:03:03.560> home<00:03:04.690> that's<00:03:05.690> because<00:03:06.050> we

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
I did spin out home that's because we

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.790 
I did spin out home that's because we
didn't<00:03:06.500> get<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.800> referent<00:03:07.250> motion<00:03:07.640> to

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
didn't get that referent motion to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.680 
didn't get that referent motion to
attempt<00:03:09.800> ballast<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.519> car<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.970> just<00:03:11.000> Chinese

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
attempt ballast the car you just Chinese

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.020 
attempt ballast the car you just Chinese
objecting<00:03:12.440> trying<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.010> hold<00:03:13.220> position<00:03:13.459> and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
objecting trying to hold position and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.699 
objecting trying to hold position and
we'll<00:03:14.300> see<00:03:14.480> what<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.840> was<00:03:14.959> perfect

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
we'll see what that was perfect

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.449 
we'll see what that was perfect
it<00:03:15.829> was<00:03:15.980> not<00:03:16.390> here<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:18.680> you're<00:03:18.859> Chinese<00:03:19.280> for

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
it was not here if you're Chinese for

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.250 
it was not here if you're Chinese for
calling<00:03:19.730> electro<00:03:20.180> steering<00:03:20.840> well<00:03:20.989> that's

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
calling electro steering well that's

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.940 
calling electro steering well that's
what<00:03:21.409> happens

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
what happens

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.470 
what happens
seeing<00:03:22.579> we're<00:03:22.760> going<00:03:22.969> to<00:03:23.060> keep<00:03:23.239> training

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
seeing we're going to keep training

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.020 
seeing we're going to keep training

won't<00:03:26.269> stapler<00:03:26.750> let's<00:03:27.530> see<00:03:27.709> if<00:03:27.829> you<00:03:27.950> let<00:03:28.129> go

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
won't stapler let's see if you let go

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.009 
won't stapler let's see if you let go
and<00:03:28.370> keep<00:03:28.819> catching<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.420> going<00:03:29.689> left<00:03:29.900> to

and keep catching and going left to
right<00:03:30.140> left<00:03:30.650> right<00:03:31.010> until<00:03:31.939> you<00:03:32.060> find<00:03:32.269> that

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
right left right until you find that

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.270 
right left right until you find that
perfect<00:03:32.780> spot<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.349> try<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.560> minimize<00:03:34.099> the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
perfect spot and you try to minimize the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.800 
perfect spot and you try to minimize the
left<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.639> right<00:03:34.790> motion<00:03:35.030> let's<00:03:35.389> move<00:03:35.629> almost

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
left and right motion let's move almost

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.170 
left and right motion let's move almost
possible<00:03:36.579> then<00:03:37.579> you're<00:03:37.760> going<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:37.939> end<00:03:38.090> up

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
possible then you're going to end up

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.009 
possible then you're going to end up
just<00:03:38.420> like<00:03:38.599> that

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
just like that

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.660 
just like that
you<00:03:39.469> can<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.739> slick<00:03:39.950> Willie<00:03:40.129> we'll<00:03:40.430> catch<00:03:40.639> it

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
you can you slick Willie we'll catch it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.550 
you can you slick Willie we'll catch it
but<00:03:41.060> go<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.450> traffic<00:03:41.689> turn<00:03:42.170> left

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
but go to the traffic turn left

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.800 
but go to the traffic turn left
this<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.389> spanner<00:03:44.389> that<00:03:44.540> passes<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.109> up

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
this is spanner that passes it up

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.149 
this is spanner that passes it up
doesn't<00:03:47.889> it

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
doesn't it

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:57.880 
doesn't it
there<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:49.700> go

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.310 

lest<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.100> sleep<00:03:59.160> over<00:03:59.640> but<00:04:00.390> then<00:04:00.570> some<00:04:00.930> time<00:04:01.140> to

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
lest I sleep over but then some time to

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.250 
lest I sleep over but then some time to
train<00:04:01.560> hard<00:04:01.800> that<00:04:02.310> stuff<00:04:02.520> happens<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.150> lot<00:04:03.690> but

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
train hard that stuff happens a lot but

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.930 
train hard that stuff happens a lot but
then<00:04:04.440> again<00:04:04.590> missus<00:04:05.160> kragnes<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.760> gotta

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
then again missus kragnes you gotta

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.400 
then again missus kragnes you gotta
figure<00:04:06.210> out<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.570> gotta<00:04:06.750> get<00:04:06.870> used<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.170> your

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
figure out you gotta get used to your

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.750 
figure out you gotta get used to your
car<00:04:07.680> not<00:04:07.950> every<00:04:08.370> car

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
car not every car

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.580 
car not every car
same<00:04:10.480> drift

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590

it<00:04:44.230> up<00:04:44.350> seven<00:04:44.710> types<00:04:44.949> of<00:04:45.220> gas<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:47.230> recipe

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
it up seven types of gas that recipe

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.350 
it up seven types of gas that recipe
then<00:04:49.289> when<00:04:49.439> you're<00:04:49.559> going<00:04:49.739> up<00:04:49.979> here<00:04:50.339> it's<00:04:51.089> all
