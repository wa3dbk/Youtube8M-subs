00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello everyone, let's talk about 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.059
 because of what we can push the ambassador to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.969
 expansion tank is not necessary to 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.690
 we have a gasket burnt them 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.550
 that is natural and the reasons are many 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.480
 and start with the very first exchange of this 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.490
 we have a pair of diverting pipes 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.189
 the principle of operation of the steam discharge pipe is its 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 the purpose is perry let the steam out 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.510
 cooling radiator in the expansion 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 cooling process cooling tank 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.750
 engine in naturally we can 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.309
 form steam and it forms and in 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.260
 that moment when we have a thermostat 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.210
 open in principle on a hot engine 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.370
 we are open all the time naturally 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.899
 steam along with the ambassador will go to the radiator 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.520
 steam cooling discharge pipe 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.320
 picks up the top of the radiator and 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:07.229
 naturally steam to hoard 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 to the top he does not go down with us 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.869
 then a word through the radiator in principle and not 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.159
 accumulates top he comes with us 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.369
 through the steam outlet 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.890
 pipe in the expansion tank if we 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.140
 clogged pipe then we will have it 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.479
 pile up at the top and go away 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.909
 he has nowhere because we know that hot steam 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.579
 down pushing is hard enough if 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.680
 we have a continuous layer of fluid then 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.650
 it will circulate more or less 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.750
 OK, but when we have a couple 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.380
 naturally he crowds crowding out 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 its own volume and time this volume 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.220
 no longer busy with antifreeze naturally 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.930
 antifreeze surplus we go 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.390
 expansion tank through a large cube 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.880
 further in one of the videos I talked about 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.570
 that and when airing the stove with us then 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.070
 the same thing will happen that is the volume 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.350
 antifreeze that we have in the stove 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.720
 he has nowhere to go and he and the system 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.180
 will go expansion tank 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.380
 now the most unpleasant reason which 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.780
 we can have it 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.870
 head gasket burned 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.240
 cylinders either the head is cracked or 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.970
 sink and connected cooling systems and 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.690
 cracks this is in above the piston 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.230
 space that is inside the cylinder on 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.910
 cylinder head 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.980
 naturally when we have 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.959
 the engine is running and we give more gas 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.330
 we have increased pressure and we 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.630
 exhaust gases will go cooling system 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.910
 but the principle is the same antifreeze 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.060
 pushed out and the personal surplus of this one 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.570
 the volume we will be through the antifreeze out 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.590
 in the expansion tank further system 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.230
 cooling we have it broken when u 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.940
 us not injection engine lead 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.170
 temperature sensor fails 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.410
 which turns on the fan naturally 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.630
 engine is overheating 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.940
 antifreeze boiling point 105 110 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.720
 degrees and according to the program in the injector 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.160
 fan start temperature is 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:23.220
 101 and turning off the fan at 97 98 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.320
 degrees now how much did I work with 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.320
 temperature sensors in principle output 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.000
 out of order goes by temperature to low 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.060
 that is, if we should 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.060
 shift at 95 degrees for example 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.850
 then in the process of wearing the sensor we will have 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.420
 already included in 90 but there are cases 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.480
 when the fan turns on too 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.810
 late and naturally with overheating 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.420
 antifreeze at the moment when he before 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.260
 how does it begin to boil 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.799
 dramatic expansion and in this pre boiling 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.510
 states that is the temperature we have in 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.720
 engine blocks will naturally 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.549
 more and all the main extensions will be 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.630
 happen that way and in the process 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.549
 extensions 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.650
 this all pressure will act on 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.780
 the whole system as a whole and naturally we 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.910
 again start to push it myself 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.170
 expansion tank is such a major 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.580
 reasons which 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.430
 everything that I said is easily verified 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.220
 For example, a steam pipe can 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.590
 easy to take and products to see if 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.330
 do not remove it can heat the engine in 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.530
 within 80 70 degrees and giving a sharp 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.740
 more momentum 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.270
 we will not go through antifreeze that is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.050
 an antifreeze jet will run 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.490
 this is natural without increasing the level 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.950
 antifreeze in the expansion tank if we have 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.980
 antifreeze does not run then everything is clear that 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.250
 our pipe clogged further 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.010
 For example, turning on the fan is also possible 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.450
 In principle, you can determine 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.550
 temperature on the panel and of course if 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.680
 we have a car operated 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.740
 long enough we have about all of it 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.900
 We know the symptoms and we can see that there 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.790
 something does not correspond in principle 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.670
 sensor replacement is not so expensive 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.520
 element temperature sensor can even 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.490
 try to change it , that is, no 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.550
 there is no problem further if we have 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.390
 breaks through the gasket it burns through either 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:36.300
 burns through part of the cylinder head 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:40.440
 over the piston this too we will 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.710
 This situation with this crap will be 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.990
 air stove that is the thing all the gases on 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.510
 go we will go to the stove with our stove 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.780
 Naturally will be cool 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.640
 by air while let's say at 80 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.410
 degrees she should burn already 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.090
 fingers 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.370
 we also have an antifreeze level 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.560
 increase some squeeze antifreeze 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.810
 if you donâ€™t add antifreeze 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.840
 will begin to fall in the process of riding that is 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.800
 antifreeze we will eat and also 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.290
 after a long trip for example 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.280
 opening the expansion tank cap there 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.340
 will be 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.790
 exhaust fumes are essentially not even steam there 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.850
 it can be seen that it will be exhaust gases 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.500
 then many can say what will happen 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.540
 bubble up if gasket burns or else 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.930
 something in the expansion tank but not a fact 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.450
 because for example when I have gases 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.240
 direct cooling system from 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.210
 cylinder by microcracks in the cylinder head 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.480
 cylinders nothing bubbled me 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.280
 just increased the volume of antifreeze in 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.700
 expansion tank and everything and in the process 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.660
 riding at high rpm its just 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.480
 threw through the cork expansion 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.910
 tank all 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.910
 Well, who have any additional 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:01.040
 questions you can ask in principle what 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.040
 I can answer well and good luck everyone bye
