 lara croft returns to the consoles of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 this generation does it to please 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.689
 above all he does it to win new 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 adepts we could be before the tom 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.770
 most ambitious raider in the history of 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.230
 the video games are ryder comes the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.550
 normal to see one news behind another 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 about this new renaissance of lara croft 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.440
 this time a md has distributed 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.530
 new images in tomb raider for 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.020
 show 3 fx technology and in what 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.510
 consists of this technology because look at 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.880
 the hair of lara croft you do not notice that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.280
 it's a lot more realistic than in 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.720
 any other video game we have ever 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.150
 could see in the world of 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.159
 video games a hair like this and in 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.229
 this time we will see it in tomb 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.200
 raider thanks to that technology 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.810
 3 fx despite being still images 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.340
 look how your hair reacts and is that 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.979
 depending on what situation we 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.540
 let's find Lara's hair will react 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.820
 one way or another 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.220
 the graphics cards recommended for 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.310
 enjoy this technology are the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.040
 radeon hd 7000 is evident that in xbox 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.290
 360 and playstation3 we will not be able to 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.990
 Enjoy this technology called 3 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.080
 fx but all those who have a pc 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.240
 with a hd 7000 radio they can do it is 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.880
 more is expected than the games of the future 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.250
 in playstation 4 they can use this 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 technology certainly sounds more than 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.140
 interesting and it's a pretty detail 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.390
 curious and is that lara croft not only 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.550
 comes in this reboot of the saga for 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.040
 show us that you can adapt to the 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.020
 current times of the gamer world but 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.720
 that pretends to be a pioneer in 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.640
 show us the technology of the future in 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.190
 As for videogame graphics and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.440
 we have it right now we touch it by 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.080
