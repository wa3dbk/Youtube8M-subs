time we're always doing something funny
so<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.069> placeholder

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
so it's just going to be placeholder

so it's just going to be placeholder
would<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.270> rather<00:02:12.390> not<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> video

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
would you rather not see a video

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
would you rather not see a video
uh in<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.670> couple<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.060> days<00:02:15.270> or<00:02:15.780> would<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
uh in a couple of days or would you

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.589 
uh in a couple of days or would you
rather<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.380> maybe<00:02:16.650> two<00:02:16.950> GTA<00:02:17.849> videos<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
rather see maybe two GTA videos in the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.630 
rather see maybe two GTA videos in the
gap<00:02:18.810> between<00:02:19.160> ultimate<00:02:20.160> team<00:02:20.280> that's<00:02:20.459> my

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
gap between ultimate team that's my

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.210 
gap between ultimate team that's my
theory<00:02:20.940> right<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.840> lot<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.800> people<00:02:22.950> may

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
theory right here a lot of people may

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.550 
theory right here a lot of people may
seem<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.819> well<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:24.930> upload<00:02:25.110> videos

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
seem like well you don't upload videos

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.640 
seem like well you don't upload videos
anymore<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.430> take<00:02:26.690> about<00:02:27.690> two<00:02:27.959> three<00:02:28.260> maybe

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
anymore you take about two three maybe

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.699 
anymore you take about two three maybe
even<00:02:28.800> four<00:02:28.980> days<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:30.030> upload<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> video<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:31.050> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
even four days to upload a video and I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.290 
even four days to upload a video and I
mean<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.069> said<00:02:32.100> ultimate<00:02:32.430> team<00:02:32.850> guys<00:02:33.030> it's

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300

get whatever cards we make they're going
to<00:04:19.739> get<00:04:19.889> so<00:04:20.370> there's<00:04:20.549> going<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.729> be<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.880> lot<00:04:21.180> of

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
to get so there's going to be a lot of

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.969 
to get so there's going to be a lot of
content<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:21.870> tax<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.470> do<00:04:22.530> think<00:04:22.890> there

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
content and tax and I do think there

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.760 
content and tax and I do think there
will<00:04:23.070> be<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.190> couple<00:04:23.400> more<00:04:23.669> collections<00:04:24.770> not

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
will be a couple more collections not

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.790 
will be a couple more collections not
counting<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.610> positional<00:04:27.360> collection

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
counting the positional collection

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.189 
counting the positional collection
so<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:28.940> think<00:04:29.389> there's<00:04:29.720> going<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.930> be<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.020> lot

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
so I think there's going to be a lot

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.070 
so I think there's going to be a lot
more<00:04:30.259> stuff<00:04:30.740> coming<00:04:31.030> within<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.240> next<00:04:32.419> week

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080
