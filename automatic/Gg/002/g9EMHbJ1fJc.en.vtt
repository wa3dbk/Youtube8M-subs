this<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.240> actual<00:02:06.659> program<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.590> 80

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
this is actual program as you can see 80

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
they will be processes run here and only

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.900 
they will be processes run here and only
see<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.470> cpu<00:03:22.040> running<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.459> hundred<00:03:22.820> percent

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
see the cpu running a hundred percent

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.270 
see the cpu running a hundred percent
and<00:03:23.450> that's<00:03:23.900> because<00:03:24.050> it's<00:03:24.440> it's<00:03:24.980> actually

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
and that's because it's it's actually

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.729
