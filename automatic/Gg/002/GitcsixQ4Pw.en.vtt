but<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.279> guess<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.760> should<00:00:17.910> talk<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.060> little<00:00:18.300> bit

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480

a<00:00:27.510> theory<00:00:27.840> when<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.140> comes<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.410> Sonic<00:00:28.710> games

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
a theory when it comes to Sonic games

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
a theory when it comes to Sonic games
someone<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.150> sega<00:00:30.449> hates<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.289> hedgehog<00:00:31.679> with

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
someone at sega hates the hedgehog with

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
someone at sega hates the hedgehog with
all<00:00:32.130> his<00:00:32.279> might<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.730> he's<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.390> about

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
all his might and he's going about

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
all his might and he's going about
trying<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> sabotage<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> franchise<00:00:35.100> with

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
trying to sabotage the franchise with

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.220 
trying to sabotage the franchise with
these<00:00:35.610> awful<00:00:35.940> games<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> only

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
these awful games this is the only

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
these awful games this is the only
explanation<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.920> makes<00:00:38.010> any<00:00:38.250> sense<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.670> me

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
explanation that makes any sense to me

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
explanation that makes any sense to me
pretty<00:00:39.390> much<00:00:39.510> every<00:00:39.840> decision<00:00:40.110> made<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.590> this

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
pretty much every decision made for this

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
pretty much every decision made for this
game<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> wrong<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.850> Sonic<00:00:42.450> ends<00:00:42.690> up

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
game was the wrong one and Sonic ends up

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.270 
game was the wrong one and Sonic ends up
taking<00:00:42.930> more<00:00:43.320> beating<00:00:43.710> than<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> pinata

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
taking more beating than a pinata

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.080 
taking more beating than a pinata
because<00:00:46.070> gameplay<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> Sonic<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.760> leashes

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
because gameplay and Sonic and leashes

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.330 
because gameplay and Sonic and leashes
split<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.450> into<00:00:48.600> three<00:00:48.660> equal<00:00:49.079> parts<00:00:49.559> there

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
split up into three equal parts there

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.709 
split up into three equal parts there
are<00:00:50.430> daytime<00:00:50.789> stages<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.570> actually

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
are daytime stages which are actually

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.260 
are daytime stages which are actually
very<00:00:52.140> good<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.070> 19<00:00:53.489> stages<00:00:53.969> which<00:00:54.120> are

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
very good there are 19 stages which are

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
very good there are 19 stages which are
actually<00:00:54.420> complete<00:00:55.050> rubbish<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.649> then

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
actually complete rubbish and then

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.130 
actually complete rubbish and then
there's<00:00:56.550> also<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.180> hub<00:00:57.360> city<00:00:57.629> where<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
there's also the hub city where you do a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
there's also the hub city where you do a
lot<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> exploration<00:00:59.039> stuff<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.460> that's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
lot of exploration stuff and that's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
lot of exploration stuff and that's
boring<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> date-time

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
boring as can be now the date-time

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.070 
boring as can be now the date-time
stages<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.190> actually<00:01:02.699> pretty<00:01:02.820> fun<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.719> fast

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
stages are actually pretty fun it's fast

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.960 
stages are actually pretty fun it's fast
platforming<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> mostly<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.519> Rails<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
platforming that is mostly on Rails and

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.280 
platforming that is mostly on Rails and
for<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> brief<00:01:06.330> moment<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.900> might<00:01:07.020> actually

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
for a brief moment you might actually

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.020 
for a brief moment you might actually
think<00:01:07.619> yourself<00:01:07.950> wow<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
think yourself wow this is what a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
think yourself wow this is what a
current-gen<00:01:09.390> sonic<00:01:09.869> game<00:01:10.020> should<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
current-gen sonic game should be of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.440 
current-gen sonic game should be of
course<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.460> hopes<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.909> brutally<00:01:12.270> dash

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
course your hopes will be brutally dash

course your hopes will be brutally dash
later<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.200> never<00:01:13.530> mind<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
later on but never mind that for now the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
later on but never mind that for now the
daytime<00:01:15.240> sections<00:01:15.659> aren't<00:01:15.960> perfect<00:01:16.229> by<00:01:16.320> any

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
daytime sections aren't perfect by any

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
daytime sections aren't perfect by any
mean<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.100> jump<00:01:17.340> button<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.880> fatally

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
mean the jump button can be fatally

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
mean the jump button can be fatally
unresponsive<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.409> times<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
unresponsive at times and it's just a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.490 
unresponsive at times and it's just a
lot<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.820> trial<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.509> error<00:01:21.630> gameplay<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> can

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
lot of trial and error gameplay that can

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.810 
lot of trial and error gameplay that can
get<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.070> repetitive<00:01:23.280> after<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
get a little bit repetitive after a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.749 
get a little bit repetitive after a
while<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> game<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.460> 3

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
while you know if the game was just 3

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
while you know if the game was just 3
hours<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.210> only<00:01:27.540> contain<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:27.990> daytime

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
hours and only contain these daytime

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.899 
hours and only contain these daytime
section<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.159> wouldn't<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.460> such<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> bad<00:01:29.850> thing

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
section it wouldn't be such a bad thing

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.910 
section it wouldn't be such a bad thing
and<00:01:30.420> actually<00:01:30.509> it'd<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> pretty<00:01:31.560> good<00:01:31.740> game

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and actually it'd be a pretty good game

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
and actually it'd be a pretty good game
you<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.150> even<00:01:33.240> overlook<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> stupid

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you know I can even overlook the stupid

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
you know I can even overlook the stupid
airplane<00:01:34.770> part<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.130> they<00:01:35.189> stuck<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.640> which

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
airplane part that they stuck in which
