00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.670
 in windows 8 or windows 8.1 there are 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.919
 unfortunately the popular recorded solitaire 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.440
 not for years at windows xp 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.870
 The user has excited that is indeed a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.210
 but has very simple card game 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 found friends for years and years 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.830
 among the xp users yes there are 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 that with windows 8 and 8 points 1 not 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.680
 more 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.320
 but there is a little trick around too 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.810
 under windows 8 and 81 again solitary 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.010
 to be able to study and how that works 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.010
 we show them now 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 All you need is an old windows 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.350
 xp installation cd no matter which one 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 that is whether the windows xp home or 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.309
 professional or one of these 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.809
 preinstalled cds is or one 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.250
 completely original version 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.809
 you can also do this for example 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.649
 For example, we take one at a time 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.190
 dell calculator 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.110
 Here it was only this cd 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.170
 insert and on it one finds the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.789
 whole games files the solitaire or 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.489
 frisell or mainz insert the cd and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.400
 copy the specific files 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.020
 if you do not have this cd you can play the games 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 also download files 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.390
 how it works and where to download 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.780
 find link below in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.479
 description text of the video now but 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.850
 once the way short if you this cd 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.689
 have and have inserted these as they do 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.090
 come to the games of windows xp and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.280
 play them again under windows 8.1 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.710
 and it works like this after you 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.150
 which windows xp cd has inserted opens 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.409
 you the windows explorer and click 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.360
 then right mouse button on the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.360
 cd drive and say open 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.370
 so here you will find all the files 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:58.470
 from windows xp and the important files 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:02.200
 are in the folder ii 386 each the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.420
 we open and now they have to be in 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.259
 principle only the games files you 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.490
 now from windows xp under windows 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.300
 want to use 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.900
 in a folder on windows 8 0 1 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.600
 copy 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.850
 This is best done first one 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.040
 in windows 8 1 a new folder 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.150
 the one for example on the desktop with 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.459
 the right mouse button and the command new 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:35.260
 and folder sets up a new folder 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:39.040
 because now if we play xp and 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.800
 a copy of the files from the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.900
 play comes from sp which files 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.550
 they are also experienced in the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.600
 description text below the videos 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.010
 that's a whole lot 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.590
 we'll do it here now 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.660
 as an example of the game solitary there are 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.000
 namely only three files in the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.140
 area solitary is namely at 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.060
 windows 8 windows xp only svl like as well 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.720
 solitaire down to the asco files 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.720
 reach 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.170
 these are the three files for 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.720
 windows xp solitaire are in charge of it 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.330
 this should be ch ex and should hl 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.760
 the underlined in the file name 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.799
 indicates that it is a packed one 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.630
 file is still the first 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.600
 has to be unpacked as the show goes 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.690
 So we also have these three files 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.709
 For example, we can mark 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.239
 several files are best marked 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.239
 pressed by the button control 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.310
 stops and then one after the other 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.110
 marked files clicks are these 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.630
 Now you can mark the with 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.769
 pressed mouse button from the cd in the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.769
 folder xp games 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.410
 then release the mouse button 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.980
 the files are copied and located 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.360
 now in the folder xp games 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.670
 This is best done for all games 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.160
 which you can do under windows 8.1 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.750
 like I said the files that the 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.330
 are below in the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.440
 description text of the video we make 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.230
 this is another example here 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.280
 based on the solitary files so this 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.050
 files are currently still in the 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.950
 packed format before and must first 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.600
 be unpacked 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.669
 this is not possible with windows 7 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.630
 on board but one uses for it 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.150
 s.besten the pack program winzip or 7 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.440
 zip where you get that is also 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.150
 under the videos and description text 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.760
 as soon as 7-zip is installed you can do this 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.060
 For example, mark files while holding down 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.729
 mouse button and then right 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.570
 click mouse button and here over the 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:58.000
 command 7 zip files unpack 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:59.830
 start the impaq program then asked 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.650
 he already where to unpack that 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.850
 would like and there you could go now 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.750
 example, the proposed folder 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.600
 maintain 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.890
 that is here in the desktop xp games and 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.620
 Here is also the subfolder 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.060
 ul created that's not really 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.430
 so bad that let's go that way 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:21.390
 slow as ok so now you can find here 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.560
 a new folder is opel for solitaire 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.220
 if you go in here you can see that 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.940
 one here is these three files has the 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.160
 be unpacked form and was 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.630
 it's just because the game is solitary 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.270
 You can now start by just one 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.169
 here double on the israel point 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.169
 exe-file clicks 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.820
 h &amp; m still reports some card 11 well then 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.500
 let's do that for almost 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.000
 all xp games you need the cath 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.740
 dll file unpack now so short 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.220
 You can also find them in the folder him 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:08.400
 386 on the cd so then you go in here 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:11.320
 folder 186 the file calc 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.690
 there is the katz dl underlined because it 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.920
 yes a packed file is and that 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.450
 we do the same now we pull the 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:25.690
 with pressed mouse button in the folder 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:26.440
 xp games again kcl the file this 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.250
 again with the right mouse button 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.419
 Click and say 7 zip files 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:47.560
 Unzip it and we will unpack it now 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:50.700
 best in the folder it's okay that is 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.200
 he really unpacks with the ten 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.860
 So now you can find a measurement folder 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.960
 on the file cut dnl the solitaire though 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.720
 also for many other games of xp 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.280
 So you need to be used 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.880
 always unpack every case if you like 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.200
 now the swl points started 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:13.270
 he seems the good old solitaire game 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.110
 and that under windows 8.1 which actually 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.110
 not possible
