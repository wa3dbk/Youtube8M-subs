00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.869
 paola artists 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:06.580
 from architects to photographers to designers all have 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.940
 seen how computer science has greatly improved his professional life 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.649
 or not 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.869
 the truth is that there are a lot of tools that serve this type 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.820
 of people who work with the image 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.800
 none is as powerful as a digitel tablet will look 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.909
 and as it is ideal and mobile we were not able to 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.909
 we have brought ourselves to the best lamas in the world 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.340
 the water continent 12 wx 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.720
 the idea is that once 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.960
 this really is not a digitizing tablet is a tablet are 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.530
 but we go in parts 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.430
 what is more striking is that it has a touch surface that also 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.930
 it is pure screen 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.920
 st lcd to look like an inch where you can see in real time the image will 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.250
 You will see that the band is working and offers more than 16 million colors 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 that is trivial and mopar those people who work with drawings or with 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.270
 Photography 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.020
 It has got a rough one contrast and about it is 180 candles per 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.280
 square meter with a refresh rate speak of you 5 milliseconds 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.140
 the 12 as a rise up reach up to thousand 260 by 400 pixels of 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.460
 resolution 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.940
 to 60 ejidos 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.950
 what comes the tactile surface those minds is by 16 centimeters 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.080
 weigh one in the credits 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.960
 here 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.940
 it turns on i turns off 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
 these kids the this information 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.040
 i on this side 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.549
 there a band called castelli 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.830
 what serves 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.930
 move is casual 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 iniesta is here are the five express kiss 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.439
 which are configurable buttons that serve to change the view to 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.010
 configure the tools 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.350
 whoever wants 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.700
 on both sides 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.909
 we have the same 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.289
 have what 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.109
 what he allows to be 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.249
 almost vertical 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.849
 or almost horizontally 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.929
 around here behind 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.479
 we can put or not these little girls and be able to fix it on a base 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.889
 pacino we can use it by freehand 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:28.969
 as if it were 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.559
 a block 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.559
 2 na min no 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.800
 the environment is 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.779
 Easy to use 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.779
 like a pencil here painted 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.019
 the one who might be going 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.279
 are you another type of pencils and another type of tip so you can buy 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.279
 separately 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.389
 but the best part is that 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.900
 Stele you can use it as if it were a pen an airbrush 15m 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.579
 What you feel like 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.189
 Bush the prestigious technology buah blunt in the electromagnetic 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.049
 is what allows this pencil genre 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.049
 Up to one thousand 24 different pressure levels 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.599
 also 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.899
 d you know 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:21.189
 what is the slope with which you are expelling 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.249
 on the track do not discuss them 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.790
 and this here is 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.709
 the 2000 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.950
 that the epen and that switch between two different tools 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.560
 the only bad thing is that the connection to the computer is a bit messy since 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.439
 you have to connect 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.759
 three cables 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.259
 the first what is in electricity 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.299
 the second who expected it 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.379
 p the third one that is the one of the video output 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.480
 but good to see you in this is that the three 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.870
 are connected to a box from which comes a single cable of two meters which is the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.419
 what's going to stop 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.909
 the only nima mini mishima stick 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.009
 what can we put to this 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.499
 is that it costs almost almost 1200 euros 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.809
 because of course it's a team a bit professional 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:09.289
 but if you work on this you will surely appreciate it 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:13.279
 we are going to see if I am now a little bit because we can get to buy it 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:16.279
 because the truth is that it is painful completely fascinated 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.439
 we are not on the next track
