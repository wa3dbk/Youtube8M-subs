make themselves in the yard and I came

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.450 
make themselves in the yard and I came
out<00:00:13.080> back<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.530> thought<00:00:13.740> hey<00:00:14.070> did<00:00:14.280> Tony

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460

shovel those down there and then I

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.349 
shovel those down there and then I
looked<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.770> them<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.190> sure<00:00:17.670> enough<00:00:17.699> if<00:00:18.330> you

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
looked at them and sure enough if you

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.220 
looked at them and sure enough if you
look<00:00:18.630> closely<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:19.890> little<00:00:20.279> trails

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
look closely you can see little trails

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.179 
look closely you can see little trails
and<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.439> snowballs<00:00:23.010> make<00:00:23.340> themselves<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
and the snowballs make themselves a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:55.160 
and the snowballs make themselves a
couple<00:00:26.189> there<00:00:51.559> see<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:54.170> most

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
couple there see if you can get it most

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.600 
couple there see if you can get it most
of<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.530> look<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.770> they've<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.250> they've

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
of them look like they've all they've

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:34.110 
of them look like they've all they've
made<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> trails

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.600 

it's<00:01:35.120> also<00:01:35.360> warming<00:01:35.990> up<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:36.560> they<00:01:37.100> were<00:01:37.220> really

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
it's also warming up so they were really

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.550 
it's also warming up so they were really
light<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:37.940> fluffy<00:01:38.090> while<00:01:38.480> it<00:01:38.660> was<00:01:38.780> super<00:01:39.410> cold

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
light and fluffy while it was super cold

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.730 
light and fluffy while it was super cold
and<00:01:39.940> now<00:01:40.940> it's<00:01:41.450> warming<00:01:41.930> up<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.290> think<00:01:42.470> that

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
and now it's warming up so I think that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.200 
and now it's warming up so I think that
they're<00:01:42.920> getting<00:01:43.040> happier<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:43.820> they're<00:01:43.970> less

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
they're getting happier so they're less

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.560 
they're getting happier so they're less
likely<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.570> move<00:01:44.810> as<00:01:45.110> piglets
