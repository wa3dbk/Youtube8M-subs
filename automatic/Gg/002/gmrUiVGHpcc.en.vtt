00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.450
 I'll take a look today at the new 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.119
 pump shotgun ksg 12 for g of g12 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.520
 this debut in the battlefield game series earlier 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.220
 he appeared in the call of duty game series 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.140
 when 12 entered the composition of the new addition 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.310
 crime activity which will become 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.019
 accessible to all already June 30th . 12 is 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.369
 american shotgun made by 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.800
 the layout of bullpup 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.150
 and he possesses two tubes which 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.920
 can keep 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.649
 14 rounds of 2.75 inches 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.809
 switching between tubes occurs in 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.420
 manual mode but this fact was not taken into account 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.390
 in the game but the switching of the types of patrons 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.010
 on the go we became available for opening 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.590
 this shotgun you need to have 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.350
 addition crime activity shotgun 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.690
 immediately available for purchase from the police 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.170
 to open with bandits you will need 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 shoot 1250 carcasses and throw in 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.590
 shop another 50 thousand dollars the main 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.450
 ksg characteristics can be considered temp 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.910
 firing and ammo count 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.640
 Damage standard for pump action shotguns 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.070
 maximum damage to one path 25 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 minimum six in one ksg cartridge 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.270
 stored 10 pellets maximum damage 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.340
 BPS with 100 minimum 38 pace of shooting 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.300
 550 rounds per minute reload 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.520
 one cartridge will take 0.95 seconds to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.800
 full recharge all 14 rounds 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.240
 require 13 point and three tenths 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.980
 seconds ksg 12 continues the concept 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.740
 excellent shotguns unlike 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.100
 shotgun battlefield 4 in hardline they 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.910
 all are very effective and good in a hut 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.340
 there is an analogue in the game and this is remington 870 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.430
 Ukrainian same rate of fire and he 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.210
 is 550 minute shots and this is on 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.340
 just a minute 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.890
 highest in class 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.080
 pump-action shotguns such a high figure 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.270
 allows you to actively work against 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.400
 large enemy forces on small 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.010
 distances the second advantage to the hut can be 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.819
 call of course the number of rounds 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.400
 There are 14 of them and this is at least 7 kills 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.829
 no reload minuses decrees too 2 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.200
 the first is the number of fractions in the cartridge 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.900
 only 10 pellets is the lowest 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.480
 figure in the class of pump-action shotguns 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.849
 and this slightly degrades the performance on 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.439
 medium distance spam capability 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:40.139
 fraction as in the case of and 37 or 870 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.120
 the second minus is not available to us is the speed 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:46.590
 recharge for recharge one 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.430
 chuck we need 0.95 seconds y and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.510
 and 870 reload speed one 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.819
 chuck takes only 0.68 seconds but 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.549
 this is the right way to balance 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.889
 shotgun with such an incredible ammo 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.689
 modules for fractions set alsu for 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.849
 reduce scatter when shooting from 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.969
 hips full choke to reduce scatter 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.189
 fraction and for pps cartridges replaced 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.980
 the amount for this type of ammunition a barrel 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.199
 leave empty rooms to the pariah excellent 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.540
 shotgun which is very nice to run 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:21.359
 on compact offline maps say 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.489
 that he is the best is very difficult but for sure 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.389
 You can say that he will take an honorary 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.579
 place on the podium with the great 870 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.099
 m but I think that's all thanks that 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:37.099
 watched subscribe comment 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.099
 put the huskies see you on the battlefield bye
