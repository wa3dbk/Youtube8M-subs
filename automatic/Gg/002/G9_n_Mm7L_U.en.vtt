Ross<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:52.190> thought<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.730> was<00:02:52.820> pretty<00:02:52.970> cool

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180

that<00:02:53.450> quiet<00:02:53.780> lazy<00:02:53.960> design<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:54.680> Batmobile

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that quiet lazy design of this Batmobile

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.210 
that quiet lazy design of this Batmobile
was<00:02:55.430> based<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:55.880> Ross's<00:02:56.240> work<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.840> we<00:03:00.740> also<00:03:00.920> have

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220

actually at this point they're they're

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.890 
actually at this point they're they're

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
the cockpit you can kind of see it there

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.000 
the cockpit you can kind of see it there
the<00:05:07.130> windshield<00:05:07.760> is<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.240> thick<00:05:08.960> red<00:05:09.710> plastic

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
the windshield is this thick red plastic

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.850 
the windshield is this thick red plastic
on<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.520> model<00:05:10.850> so<00:05:11.510> you<00:05:11.570> can't<00:05:12.080> really<00:05:12.470> see

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
on the model so you can't really see

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.120 
on the model so you can't really see
inside<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.820> cockpit<00:05:14.000> especially<00:05:14.870> if<00:05:15.050> if<00:05:15.530> the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
inside the cockpit especially if if the

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.540 
inside the cockpit especially if if the
model<00:05:16.430> is<00:05:16.520> inside<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.330> diorama<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.170> I<00:05:19.070> think

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
model is inside the diorama so I think

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.280 
model is inside the diorama so I think
it's<00:05:19.640> awesome<00:05:19.790> that<00:05:20.080> even<00:05:21.080> though<00:05:21.170> it's

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
it's awesome that even though it's

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.230 
it's awesome that even though it's
something<00:05:21.530> you<00:05:21.620> don't<00:05:21.740> really<00:05:21.890> see<00:05:22.240> eagle

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
something you don't really see eagle

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.870 
something you don't really see eagle

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
Moss took that extra step and included

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.250 
Moss took that extra step and included
that<00:05:26.000> little<00:05:26.270> detail<00:05:28.420> and<00:05:29.420> just<00:05:29.900> looking<00:05:30.140> at

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
that little detail and just looking at

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.070 
that little detail and just looking at
the<00:05:30.380> car<00:05:30.560> from<00:05:30.770> from<00:05:31.070> different<00:05:31.250> angles<00:05:32.080> again

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
now you can see that that they were

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.550 
now you can see that that they were
really<00:05:36.530> faithful<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.490> source<00:05:37.520> material

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
something else I didn't notice until I

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.270 
something else I didn't notice until I
took<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:44.360> out<00:05:44.420> of<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.660> case<00:05:44.900> when<00:05:45.890> you<00:05:45.980> look<00:05:46.160> at

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
took it out of the case when you look at

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.370 
took it out of the case when you look at
it<00:05:46.370> from<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.640> top<00:05:46.850> of<00:05:47.750> course<00:05:47.990> you<00:05:48.080> get<00:05:48.200> the

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
something

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.590 
something
the<00:06:29.630> way<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:30.530> material<00:06:31.040> kind<00:06:31.880> of<00:06:31.940> shines
