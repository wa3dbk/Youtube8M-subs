right<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.360> quads<00:01:42.750> stronger<00:01:43.260> my<00:01:43.380> quads<00:01:43.650> not

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
right my quads stronger my quads not

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.040 
right my quads stronger my quads not
only<00:01:44.070> stronger<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:45.060> look<00:01:45.270> better<00:01:45.510> so<00:01:45.780> I

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
only stronger but look better so I

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.540 
only stronger but look better so I
switched<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.920> started<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.190> do<00:01:47.310> front

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
switched it up I started to do front

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.310 
switched it up I started to do front
squats<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:48.300> often<00:01:48.570> than<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:48.720> did<00:01:48.870> back<00:01:49.020> squats

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
squats more often than I did back squats

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.320 
squats more often than I did back squats
and<00:01:50.010> not<00:01:50.280> only<00:01:50.460> did<00:01:50.580> my<00:01:50.670> quads<00:01:51.000> start<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
and not only did my quads start to

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.469 
and not only did my quads start to
develop<00:01:51.510> faster<00:01:52.760> size<00:01:53.760> definition<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.420> also

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
develop faster size definition but also

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.900 
develop faster size definition but also
my<00:01:54.930> strengths<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.710> deadlift<00:01:56.070> my

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
my strengths and the deadlift my

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.310 
my strengths and the deadlift my
strengthen<00:01:57.300> overhead<00:01:57.750> pressing<00:01:58.110> stuff

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
strengthen overhead pressing stuff

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.930 
strengthen overhead pressing stuff
because<00:01:58.590> my<00:01:58.770> core<00:01:59.220> is<00:01:59.310> getting<00:01:59.550> stronger

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
because my core is getting stronger

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.700 
because my core is getting stronger
my<00:02:00.360> body<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.690> able<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.960> stay<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.260> more<00:02:01.410> upright

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
my body is able to stay up more upright

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.840 
my body is able to stay up more upright
more<00:02:01.830> rigid<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.460> other<00:02:02.610> movements

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
the only way is like one I'm the white

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.750 
the only way is like one I'm the white
170<00:02:30.739> weight<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.890> light<00:02:32.100> like<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.370> always<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
170 weight is light like I always like a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.410 
170 weight is light like I always like a
thousand<00:02:33.270> pounds<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.750> anyways<00:02:34.530> point<00:02:34.770> is

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
thousand pounds so anyways point is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
thousand pounds so anyways point is
there's<00:02:36.420> two<00:02:36.570> different<00:02:36.690> ways<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.170> so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
there's two different ways to do it so

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.259 
there's two different ways to do it so
what's<00:02:37.799> going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:38.100> best<00:02:38.580> becoming<00:02:39.030> most<00:02:39.180> of

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
what's going to be best becoming most of

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.600 
what's going to be best becoming most of
you<00:02:39.330> guys<00:02:39.450> because<00:02:39.720> if<00:02:39.900> flexibility<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
you guys because if flexibility is the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.130 
you guys because if flexibility is the
front<00:02:41.820> rack<00:02:41.970> how<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.209> did<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> where<00:02:42.690> he's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
front rack how we did it where he's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.170 
front rack how we did it where he's
thinking<00:02:43.170> about<00:02:43.440> pushing<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.010> weight<00:02:44.250> into

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
thinking about pushing the weight into

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.270 
thinking about pushing the weight into
his<00:02:45.540> upper<00:02:46.320> chest<00:02:46.350> into<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> top<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.160> his

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
his upper chest into the top of his

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.979 
his upper chest into the top of his
clavicle<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.730> keeping<00:02:48.000> his<00:02:48.090> elbow<00:02:48.390> low<00:02:48.450> so

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
clavicle and keeping his elbow low so

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.479 
clavicle and keeping his elbow low so
