00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
looking at the classic electric football

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.680 
looking at the classic electric football
from<00:01:12.770> tutor<00:01:13.100> games<00:01:13.400> this<00:01:13.970> is<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.300> redzone

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
from tutor games this is the redzone

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.660 
from tutor games this is the redzone
edition<00:01:15.260> now<00:01:15.620> this<00:01:15.860> has<00:01:16.010> been<00:01:16.160> around<00:01:16.400> forever

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
edition now this has been around forever

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.760 
edition now this has been around forever
but<00:01:16.850> there's<00:01:17.180> some<00:01:17.330> neat<00:01:17.690> new<00:01:18.050> twist<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.740> it

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
but there's some neat new twist to it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.280 
but there's some neat new twist to it
here<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.820> play<00:01:20.030> action<00:01:20.210> remote<00:01:20.660> anyone

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
here is the play action remote anyone

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.780 
here is the play action remote anyone
who's<00:01:21.380> play<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:21.860> familiar<00:01:21.980> you<00:01:22.520> hold

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
who's play this is familiar you hold

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.310 
who's play this is familiar you hold
down<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:22.970> button<00:01:23.210> on<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.540> side<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.170> table

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
down that button on the side the table

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.560 
down that button on the side the table
vibrates<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.100> guys<00:01:25.250> move<00:01:25.550> around<00:01:25.820> here's<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
vibrates the guys move around here's the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.300 
vibrates the guys move around here's the
difference<00:01:26.870> of<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.080> speed<00:01:27.440> dial<00:01:27.620> on<00:01:27.890> top<00:01:28.100> now

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
difference of the speed dial on top now

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.650 
difference of the speed dial on top now
you<00:01:28.400> can<00:01:28.610> control<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.030> speed<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
you can control the speed of the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.720 
you can control the speed of the
vibrations<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:30.800> makes<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.160> players<00:01:31.400> move

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
vibrations that makes the players move

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.950 
vibrations that makes the players move
at<00:01:31.850> different<00:01:31.970> rates<00:01:32.330> so<00:01:32.480> you<00:01:32.540> can<00:01:32.690> kind<00:01:32.900> of

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
at different rates so you can kind of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.330 
at different rates so you can kind of
see<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.350> background<00:01:33.770> here<00:01:33.950> as<00:01:34.040> we<00:01:34.130> turn

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
see it in the background here as we turn

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.830 
see it in the background here as we turn
this<00:01:34.460> up<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.820> down<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.480> that's<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.690> neat

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
this up and down so that's a neat

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.000 
this up and down so that's a neat
element<00:01:36.260> -<00:01:36.410> it<00:01:36.500> feels<00:01:36.650> like<00:01:36.800> you're<00:01:36.980> actually

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
element - it feels like you're actually

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.130 
element - it feels like you're actually
controlling<00:01:37.520> how<00:01:37.850> they're<00:01:38.090> running<00:01:38.300> on<00:01:38.570> this

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
controlling how they're running on this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.200 
controlling how they're running on this
uses<00:01:39.530> two<00:01:39.770> double-a<00:01:40.160> batteries<00:01:40.640> that's<00:01:41.000> all

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
uses two double-a batteries that's all

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.150 
uses two double-a batteries that's all
there<00:01:41.360> is<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.660> it<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> very<00:01:42.560> simple

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
there is to it this is a very simple

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.130 
there is to it this is a very simple
game<00:01:43.400> it's<00:01:44.060> been<00:01:44.180> around<00:01:44.360> forever<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.050> it

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
game it's been around forever but it

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.600 
game it's been around forever but it
still<00:01:45.410> works<00:01:45.650> a<00:01:45.800> lot<00:01:45.950> of<00:01:46.100> strategy<00:01:46.580> involved

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
still works a lot of strategy involved

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.330 
still works a lot of strategy involved
in<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.330> let's<00:01:47.750> show<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.080> players<00:01:48.350> here<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:49.280> you

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
in it let's show the players here so you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.740 
in it let's show the players here so you
get<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.520> number<00:01:49.730> of<00:01:49.850> different<00:01:50.120> players<00:01:50.360> this

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
get a number of different players this

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.810 
get a number of different players this
might<00:01:50.960> be<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.140> lineman<00:01:51.470> or<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:51.830> blocker<00:01:52.220> you're

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
might be a lineman or a blocker you're

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.220 
might be a lineman or a blocker you're
going<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.000> use<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.210> same<00:01:53.390> players<00:01:53.660> offense

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
going to use the same players offense

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.690 
going to use the same players offense
and<00:01:54.410> defense<00:01:54.800> but<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> number<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.430> different

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
and defense but a number of different

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.460 
and defense but a number of different
positions<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.660> have<00:01:56.690> some<00:01:56.900> all-purpose

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
positions you have some all-purpose

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.320 
positions you have some all-purpose
players<00:01:57.950> going<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.370> show<00:01:58.460> another<00:01:58.730> one<00:01:58.940> here

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
players going to show another one here

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.720 
players going to show another one here
maybe<00:01:59.780> an<00:01:59.930> all-purpose<00:02:00.350> player<00:02:00.770> or<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.100> running

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
maybe an all-purpose player or a running

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.640 
maybe an all-purpose player or a running
back<00:02:01.940> or<00:02:01.970> receiver<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:03.200> these<00:02:03.380> are<00:02:03.560> different

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
back or receiver so these are different

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.620 
back or receiver so these are different
players<00:02:04.070> what<00:02:04.520> gets<00:02:04.670> interesting<00:02:05.330> now<00:02:05.450> are

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
players what gets interesting now are

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.410 
players what gets interesting now are
these<00:02:05.780> invisible<00:02:06.410> eats<00:02:07.400> so<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.149> what<00:02:08.300> you

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
these invisible eats so this is what you

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.120 
these invisible eats so this is what you
put<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.170> bottom<00:02:09.320> of<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.649> players<00:02:09.920> to

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
put on the bottom of the players to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.830 
put on the bottom of the players to
control<00:02:10.429> how<00:02:10.640> they<00:02:10.790> move<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:11.540> would<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.810> a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
control how they move this would be a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.810 
control how they move this would be a
strength<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.709> larger<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:13.370> more<00:02:13.520> power

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
strength one it's larger for more power

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.699 
strength one it's larger for more power
blocking<00:02:14.450> then<00:02:14.959> you've<00:02:15.080> got<00:02:15.260> these<00:02:15.380> thinner

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
blocking then you've got these thinner

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.410 
blocking then you've got these thinner
smaller<00:02:15.980> one<00:02:16.400> these<00:02:16.730> were<00:02:16.880> they<00:02:17.000> call<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
smaller one these were they call the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.390 
smaller one these were they call the
speed<00:02:17.780> cleats<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:18.920> would<00:02:19.070> be<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:19.340> your

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
speed cleats and this would be for your

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.550 
speed cleats and this would be for your
running<00:02:19.610> backs<00:02:19.940> or<00:02:20.239> your<00:02:20.600> wide<00:02:20.780> receivers<00:02:21.410> and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
running backs or your wide receivers and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.440 
running backs or your wide receivers and
the<00:02:22.100> angle<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.670> put<00:02:22.880> them<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.330> we're

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the angle you put them on so we're

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.180 
the angle you put them on so we're
showing<00:02:23.570> them<00:02:23.720> here<00:02:24.110> with<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.440> tabs<00:02:24.709> facing<00:02:25.100> a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
showing them here with the tabs facing a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.130 
showing them here with the tabs facing a
certain<00:02:25.370> way<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.820> may<00:02:26.239> make<00:02:26.480> him<00:02:26.690> turn<00:02:26.900> off

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
certain way that may make him turn off

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.810 
certain way that may make him turn off
to<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.470> left<00:02:27.739> but<00:02:28.160> if<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.310> have<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.760> way

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
to the left but if you have it this way

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.910 
to the left but if you have it this way
that<00:02:29.480> might<00:02:29.660> make<00:02:29.810> him<00:02:29.930> hook<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.500> right<00:02:30.709> or

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
that might make him hook to the right or

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.130 
that might make him hook to the right or
hook<00:02:31.190> back<00:02:31.400> around<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> lot<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.720> strategy
