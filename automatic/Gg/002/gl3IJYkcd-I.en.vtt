hey what's going on YouTube I figured

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.349 
hey what's going on YouTube I figured
I'd<00:00:03.270> do<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.480> quick<00:00:04.020> little<00:00:04.380> video<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.359> recent

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
I'd do a quick little video on a recent

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.700 
I'd do a quick little video on a recent
tank<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.720> purchased<00:00:07.400> about<00:00:08.400> three<00:00:08.639> weeks<00:00:08.849> ago

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
tank I purchased about three weeks ago

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.850 
tank I purchased about three weeks ago
uh<00:00:10.710> it's<00:00:11.190> kind<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> my<00:00:11.550> false<00:00:12.440> saltwater<00:00:13.440> tank

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
uh it's kind of my false saltwater tank

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.660 
uh it's kind of my false saltwater tank
it's<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> freshwater<00:00:15.120> tank<00:00:16.490> as<00:00:17.490> I'm

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it's really a freshwater tank as I'm

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.250 
it's really a freshwater tank as I'm
sure<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> lot<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> y'all<00:00:18.449> can<00:00:18.600> tell<00:00:18.750> by<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.930> fish

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
sure a lot of y'all can tell by the fish

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.359 
sure a lot of y'all can tell by the fish
um<00:00:20.000> like<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.150> said<00:00:21.180> I've<00:00:21.920> always<00:00:22.920> been<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> big

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
um like I said I've always been a big

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.420 
um like I said I've always been a big
fan<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.640> saltwater<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> fish<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:26.310> R

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
fan of saltwater in the fish and that R

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.240 
fan of saltwater in the fish and that R
in<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.180> due<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:29.000> limited<00:00:30.000> funds<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.250> not

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
in it but due to limited funds and not

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.740 
in it but due to limited funds and not
really<00:00:32.550> want<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> dive<00:00:33.030> into<00:00:33.239> some<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
really want to dive into some of the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
really want to dive into some of the
chemistry<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.829> decided<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.280> start<00:00:35.520> with

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
chemistry to it I decided to start with

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610 
chemistry to it I decided to start with
freshwater<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.960> always<00:00:37.230> convert<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
freshwater and I can always convert to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.450 
freshwater and I can always convert to
saltwater<00:00:37.950> later<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.950> let's<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.070> into<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
saltwater later so let's get into it a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
saltwater later so let's get into it a
little<00:00:41.610> bit<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.680> I<00:00:43.680> went<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:45.180> local<00:00:45.530> pet

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
little bit here I went to my local pet

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.310 
little bit here I went to my local pet
store<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.340> purchased<00:00:47.610> some<00:00:48.320> live

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
store here and I purchased some live

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
store here and I purchased some live
rock<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:50.850> live<00:00:51.120> rock<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.570> should

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
rock or not really live rock I should

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.279 
rock or not really live rock I should
say<00:00:51.899> dead<00:00:52.140> Rock<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.620> Florida<00:00:53.070> Rock<00:00:54.079> they<00:00:55.079> just

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
say dead Rock or Florida Rock they just

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.500 
say dead Rock or Florida Rock they just
dig<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> ground<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.510> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
dig it up out of the ground really and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.479 
dig it up out of the ground really and
like<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.750> said<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.020> went<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:59.219> me

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
like I said I went and got I know me

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.220 
like I said I went and got I know me
stuck<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.879> about<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> pound<00:01:00.480> per<00:01:00.690> gallon<00:01:01.050> this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
stuck to about a pound per gallon this

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.860 
stuck to about a pound per gallon this
is<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> 55<00:01:01.829> gallon<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:02.850> 50<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.780> 55

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
is a 55 gallon so I got about 50 to 55

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.280 
is a 55 gallon so I got about 50 to 55
pounds<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.890> got<00:01:05.189> nice<00:01:06.060> little<00:01:06.299> close

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
pounds of it I got nice little close

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.880 
pounds of it I got nice little close
tree<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.970> got<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> bigger<00:01:09.530> closer<00:01:10.530> over

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
tree here and I got a bigger closer over

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.510 
tree here and I got a bigger closer over
here<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.170> said<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.530> works<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.250> mean

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
here and like I said it works I mean

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.450 
here and like I said it works I mean
it'll<00:01:14.670> work<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.210> well<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> kind<00:01:17.369> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it'll work just as well I got to kind of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.520 
it'll work just as well I got to kind of
watch<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.210> having<00:01:18.689> my<00:01:18.900> cichlids<00:01:19.380> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
watch it with having my cichlids in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.660 
watch it with having my cichlids in
there

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
there

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.550 
there
obviously<00:01:21.540> it'll<00:01:21.720> leach<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.520> it'll<00:01:23.520> cost<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
obviously it'll leach and it'll cost the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.170 
obviously it'll leach and it'll cost the
hardness<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> water<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.700> course<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
hardness of the water and of course the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.719 
hardness of the water and of course the
pH<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.650> significantly<00:01:28.650> lower<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> got<00:01:29.610> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
pH to significantly lower so I got to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.179 
pH to significantly lower so I got to
monitor<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.380> pretty<00:01:31.380> well<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.860> got<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> keep

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
monitor it pretty well and I got to keep

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.230 
monitor it pretty well and I got to keep
my<00:01:32.340> pH<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.820> stuff<00:01:36.060> down

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
my pH up there I have some stuff down

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
my pH up there I have some stuff down
here<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.780> uh<00:01:37.130> works<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.430> well<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.740> keeps

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
here that uh works really well and keeps

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.819 
here that uh works really well and keeps
it<00:01:40.979> nice<00:01:41.520> ed<00:01:41.759> keeps<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.299> good<00:01:42.829> um

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it nice ed keeps it pretty good um

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.440 
it nice ed keeps it pretty good um
anyway<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.450> said<00:01:46.640> yeah<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> got<00:01:47.729> those<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
anyway like I said yeah I got those and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.240 
anyway like I said yeah I got those and
like<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.659> said<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.200> did<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.130> your

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
just kind of some fake coral I got a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.980 
just kind of some fake coral I got a
little<00:01:56.280> bit<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.850> pier<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:58.140> pylon<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:59.130> here

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
little bit of a pier a pylon over here

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.219 
little bit of a pier a pylon over here
they<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.140> had<00:02:01.619> some<00:02:02.540> some<00:02:03.540> real<00:02:03.750> coral

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
they actually had some some real coral

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.010 
they actually had some some real coral
that<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> was<00:02:06.210> dying<00:02:06.540> so

55-gallon I said this comes up when you

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.790 
55-gallon I said this comes up when you
walk<00:04:31.190> in<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:31.910> then<00:04:32.330> here's<00:04:32.840> my<00:04:33.080> couch<00:04:33.560> over

walk in and then here's my couch over
here<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.220> like<00:04:34.400> it<00:04:34.430> just<00:04:34.730> so<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:35.690> can<00:04:35.750> kind<00:04:35.990> of

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
here and I like it just so I can kind of

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.790 
here and I like it just so I can kind of
sit<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.680> do<00:04:36.890> this<00:04:37.660> filtration<00:04:38.660> real<00:04:39.080> fast<00:04:39.350> I

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
sit and do this filtration real fast I

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.930 
sit and do this filtration real fast I
went<00:04:40.490> with<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.670> flu<00:04:40.820> ball<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:42.110> CSeries<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:43.520> got

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
went with the flu ball the CSeries I got

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.660 
went with the flu ball the CSeries I got
a<00:04:43.970> c2<00:04:44.480> over<00:04:44.780> here<00:04:45.050> which<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:45.920> believe<00:04:46.190> is<00:04:46.340> rated

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
a c2 over here which I believe is rated

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
a c2 over here which I believe is rated
from<00:04:47.330> twenty<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.260> forty<00:04:48.590> gallon<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.390> got<00:04:50.540> it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
from twenty to forty gallon and I got it

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.970 
from twenty to forty gallon and I got it
kind<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:50.960> as<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.290> secondary<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.700> my<00:04:52.970> flu<00:04:53.870> ball<00:04:54.080> c4

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
kind of as a secondary to my flu ball c4

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.150 
kind of as a secondary to my flu ball c4
series<00:04:56.170> which<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.290> believe<00:04:57.530> can<00:04:57.770> go<00:04:57.890> all<00:04:58.130> the

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
series which I believe can go all the

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.620 
series which I believe can go all the
way<00:04:58.250> up<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.520> seventy<00:04:58.940> gallon<00:04:59.270> forty<00:04:59.540> to

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
way up to seventy gallon forty to

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.140 
way up to seventy gallon forty to
seventy<00:04:59.780> gallon<00:05:00.320> so<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.340> wanted<00:05:01.640> to<00:05:01.790> go<00:05:01.910> with

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
seventy gallon so I wanted to go with

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.710 
seventy gallon so I wanted to go with
the<00:05:02.530> dual<00:05:03.530> filtration<00:05:04.240> it's<00:05:05.240> going<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.510> you

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
the dual filtration it's going to you

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.510 
the dual filtration it's going to you
know<00:05:05.840> even<00:05:06.170> help<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.770> know<00:05:06.860> in<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.070> long<00:05:07.220> run

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
know even help you know in the long run

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.700 
know even help you know in the long run
it'll<00:05:07.790> help<00:05:08.000> keep<00:05:08.240> things<00:05:08.630> kind<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:08.960> clean

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
it'll help keep things kind of clean

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.350 
it'll help keep things kind of clean
because<00:05:10.040> as<00:05:10.160> we<00:05:10.370> know<00:05:10.400> with<00:05:10.760> those<00:05:10.910> you<00:05:11.180> know<00:05:11.300> -

because as we know with those you know -

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.170 
because as we know with those you know -
crayfish<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.200> there<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:13.730> cichlids

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
crayfish in there and the cichlids

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.610 
crayfish in there and the cichlids
they're<00:05:14.300> they're<00:05:14.600> pretty<00:05:14.630> messy<00:05:15.140> as<00:05:15.320> far<00:05:15.500> as

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
they're they're pretty messy as far as

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.210 
they're they're pretty messy as far as
ammonia<00:05:15.890> goes<00:05:17.770> yeah<00:05:18.770> that's<00:05:19.420> pretty<00:05:20.420> much<00:05:20.540> it

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
ammonia goes yeah that's pretty much it

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.150 
ammonia goes yeah that's pretty much it
like<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.120> said<00:05:23.180> between<00:05:23.450> my<00:05:23.720> carbons<00:05:24.230> and<00:05:24.710> I

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
like I said between my carbons and I

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.750 
like I said between my carbons and I
always<00:05:25.790> like<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.090> monitor<00:05:26.330> my<00:05:26.690> ammonia

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
always like to monitor my ammonia

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.710 
always like to monitor my ammonia
nitrate<00:05:28.760> nitrites<00:05:29.270> are<00:05:29.420> setting<00:05:29.660> up

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
nitrate nitrites are setting up

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.720 
nitrate nitrites are setting up
beautifully<00:05:30.260> like<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.040> said<00:05:31.220> this<00:05:31.340> tanks<00:05:31.610> only

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
beautifully like I said this tanks only

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.600 
beautifully like I said this tanks only
about<00:05:32.030> three<00:05:32.270> weeks<00:05:32.480> old<00:05:32.980> but<00:05:33.980> it's<00:05:34.130> cycling

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
about three weeks old but it's cycling

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.400 
about three weeks old but it's cycling
really<00:05:34.970> well<00:05:35.150> obviously<00:05:35.510> it's<00:05:35.990> not<00:05:36.110> fully

really well obviously it's not fully

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.070 
really well obviously it's not fully

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
cycled yet but I am seeing some nitrates

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.800 
cycled yet but I am seeing some nitrates
in<00:05:39.410> there<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:40.640> there<00:05:40.940> is<00:05:41.090> some<00:05:41.270> conversion

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
in there so there is some conversion

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.160
