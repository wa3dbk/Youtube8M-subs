hello<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.200> doing

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
hello are you doing

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.859 
hello are you doing
so<00:00:26.009> what<00:00:26.369> tell<00:00:26.610> us<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.060> go<00:00:27.210> ahead<00:00:27.240> what

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
so what tell us what you go ahead what

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.560 
so what tell us what you go ahead what
so<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.670> prototype<00:00:30.330> of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
so what you see here is a prototype of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.600 
so what you see here is a prototype of
one<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> concepts<00:00:32.010> we<00:00:32.070> were<00:00:32.220> working<00:00:32.519> at

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
one of the concepts we were working at

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.119 
one of the concepts we were working at
at<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> MIT<00:00:33.030> Media<00:00:33.239> Lab<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.050> we're<00:00:34.769> bringing

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
at the MIT Media Lab and we're bringing

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.530 
at the MIT Media Lab and we're bringing
this<00:00:35.220> here<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> conference<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.360> we've

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
this here to the conference and we've

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
this here to the conference and we've
also<00:00:36.660> been<00:00:36.840> out<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.830> Spain<00:00:38.100> particularly

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
also been out here in Spain particularly

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
also been out here in Spain particularly
to<00:00:38.879> actually<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.960> concept<00:00:40.410> become<00:00:40.949> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to actually see this concept become a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.520 
to actually see this concept become a
real<00:00:41.220> car<00:00:41.540> it<00:00:42.540> feels<00:00:42.720> like<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.900> can<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.199> to<00:00:43.379> show

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
real car it feels like I can get to show

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.689 
real car it feels like I can get to show
you<00:00:43.589> a<00:00:43.650> second<00:00:44.010> about<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> concept

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
you a second about what the concept

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.000 
you a second about what the concept
really<00:00:44.790> is<00:00:45.440> what<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:46.530> looking<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:46.799> around

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
really is what we're looking at around

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.890 
really is what we're looking at around
right<00:00:47.549> now<00:00:47.580> is<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.909> half-scale<00:00:48.330> version<00:00:48.720> of<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
right now is a half-scale version of the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.420 
right now is a half-scale version of the
vehicle<00:00:49.260> obviously<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.040> wouldn't<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.339> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
vehicle obviously this wouldn't be the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
vehicle obviously this wouldn't be the
real<00:00:50.580> size<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> key<00:00:51.900> thing<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.409> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
real size but the key thing is is to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.829 
real size but the key thing is is to
look<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:52.830> mobility<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.089> city<00:00:54.330> and<00:00:54.540> how<00:00:54.780> we

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
look at mobility in this city and how we

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.410 
look at mobility in this city and how we
can<00:00:55.019> design<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.290> car<00:00:55.589> specifically<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.820> better

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
can design a car specifically to better

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.660 
can design a car specifically to better
serve<00:00:57.720> mobility<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.339> can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.580> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
serve mobility as you can see the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.090 
serve mobility as you can see the
vehicle<00:00:59.790> folds<00:01:00.269> up<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.320> part<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.979> one

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
vehicle folds up when it's part so one

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
vehicle folds up when it's part so one
of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> biggest<00:01:02.670> issues<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.299> urban<00:01:03.839> area

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
of the biggest issues in the urban area

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.450 
of the biggest issues in the urban area
is<00:01:04.260> space<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.799> when<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.010> parked<00:01:08.340> up

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is space so when when it is parked up

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.910 
is space so when when it is parked up
it's<00:01:09.000> easy<00:01:09.150> also<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.689> exit<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.560> into<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it's easy also to exit it into the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.060 
it's easy also to exit it into the
vehicle<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.810> what<00:01:12.810> you'll<00:01:12.930> notice<00:01:13.170> also<00:01:13.380> on

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
vehicle and what you'll notice also on

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.650 
vehicle and what you'll notice also on
the<00:01:14.159> vehicle<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.700> each<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.479> wheels

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
the vehicle is that each of the wheels

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.930 
the vehicle is that each of the wheels
can<00:01:15.840> independently<00:01:16.050> steer<00:01:16.670> what<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.760> can<00:01:17.880> do

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
can independently steer what we can do

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.100 
can independently steer what we can do
right<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.300> what<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.480> call<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.660> no<00:01:18.870> turn

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
right here is what we call a no turn

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.030 
right here is what we call a no turn
where<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.410> will

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
where it will

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.700 
where it will
so<00:01:20.610> well<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.510> can<00:01:21.780> spin<00:01:21.990> around<00:01:22.050> so

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so well and if you can spin around so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.640 
so well and if you can spin around so
this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.010> half-scale<00:01:23.340> vehicle<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.140> how<00:01:25.470> will

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
this is a half-scale vehicle so how will

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.690 
this is a half-scale vehicle so how will
this<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.830> used<00:01:26.160> if<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.120> comes<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.700> full-size

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this be used if it comes to full-size

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
this be used if it comes to full-size
use<00:01:30.090> yes<00:01:30.690> so<00:01:30.870> it's<00:01:31.050> actually<00:01:31.230> being<00:01:31.560> produced

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
use yes so it's actually being produced

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.250 
use yes so it's actually being produced
right<00:01:32.160> now<00:01:32.370> for<00:01:32.580> full-size<00:01:32.970> use<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
right now for full-size use with the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.200 
right now for full-size use with the
company<00:01:34.650> called<00:01:34.830> Hideko<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.030> both

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
company called Hideko and that both

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
company called Hideko and that both
sides<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> vehicle<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.990> about<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.650> scale

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
sides of the vehicle is about the scale

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
sides of the vehicle is about the scale
of<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.130> smart<00:01:38.550> vehicle<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:39.120> little<00:01:39.750> bit<00:01:39.840> larger

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of a smart vehicle a little bit larger

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.110 
of a smart vehicle a little bit larger
when<00:01:40.650> you're<00:01:40.770> driving<00:01:40.980> it<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.760> falls<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
when you're driving it but it falls to a

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.750 
when you're driving it but it falls to a
significantly<00:01:42.630> smaller<00:01:42.780> size<00:01:43.520> when<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.550> are

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
significantly smaller size when you are

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.120 
significantly smaller size when you are
used<00:01:45.000> when<00:01:45.300> you<00:01:45.390> are<00:01:45.420> parking<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.980> key

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
used when you are parking it but the key

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.650 
used when you are parking it but the key
thing<00:01:47.190> is<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> vehicle<00:01:48.000> itself<00:01:48.300> is<00:01:48.480> just

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
thing is is the vehicle itself is just

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.870 
thing is is the vehicle itself is just
an<00:01:48.780> enabler<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:49.440> services<00:01:49.880> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
an enabler for other services of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.940

the vehicle for when he or she needs it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.860 
the vehicle for when he or she needs it
and<00:01:58.920> drops<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.370> off<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.700> they're<00:01:59.820> done<00:02:00.000> and

and drops it off when they're done and
the<00:02:00.960> key<00:02:01.110> thing<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.650> that<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.920> used<00:02:02.130> for

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
the key thing is is that it's used for

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.700 
the key thing is is that it's used for
one-way<00:02:02.670> sharing<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.350> pick<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.620> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
one-way sharing you can pick it up to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.990 
one-way sharing you can pick it up to
one<00:02:04.860> spot<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.400> worry<00:02:05.580> about<00:02:05.670> where<00:02:05.940> you

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
one spot and not worry about where you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.180 
one spot and not worry about where you
drop<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.330> off<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.680> could<00:02:07.800> literally<00:02:08.040> just

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
drop it off so you could literally just

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.910 
drop it off so you could literally just
hire<00:02:08.850> one<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.570> then<00:02:09.990> drop<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.350> off<00:02:10.530> when<00:02:10.830> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
hire one and then drop it off when you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.190 
hire one and then drop it off when you
finish<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.520> yes<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.300> not<00:02:13.050> quite

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
finish with it so yes kind of not quite

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.560 
finish with it so yes kind of not quite

disposable but on demand vehicles as you

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.449 
disposable but on demand vehicles as you
need<00:02:15.720> them<00:02:15.930> exactly<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.920> part<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.400> the

need them exactly and a part of the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.490 
need them exactly and a part of the
issue<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.850> when<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> own<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> vehicle<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
issue is when you own a vehicle in the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.920 
issue is when you own a vehicle in the
city<00:02:19.680> you're<00:02:19.830> only<00:02:19.950> using<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.340> maybe<00:02:21.060> 10<00:02:21.390> 15

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
city you're only using it maybe 10 15

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.170 
city you're only using it maybe 10 15
percent<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> day<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.120> a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
percent of the day and it's really not a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.020 
percent of the day and it's really not a
smart<00:02:24.720> utilization<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.530> vehicle<00:02:26.030> which

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
smart utilization of the vehicle which

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.670 
smart utilization of the vehicle which
takes<00:02:27.270> up<00:02:27.390> space<00:02:27.510> uses<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> lot<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.110> energy<00:02:28.500> so

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
takes up space uses a lot of energy so

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.990 
takes up space uses a lot of energy so
like<00:02:29.070> some<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.370> other<00:02:29.489> vehicles<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
like some of the other vehicles the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.340 
like some of the other vehicles the
sharing<00:02:30.330> systems<00:02:30.630> are<00:02:30.720> doing<00:02:30.959> we're

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
sharing systems are doing we're

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.100 
sharing systems are doing we're
designing<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.709> car<00:02:31.860> specifically<00:02:32.459> for<00:02:33.110> vehicle

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
designing a car specifically for vehicle

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.949 
designing a car specifically for vehicle
sharing<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:36.269> like<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.540> said<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:36.930> really

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
sharing and like I said this is really

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.800 
sharing and like I said this is really
an<00:02:37.200> enabler<00:02:37.410> for<00:02:37.560> other<00:02:37.890> services<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.030> it's

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
an enabler for other services so it it's

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.479 
an enabler for other services so it it's
not<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.110> an<00:02:40.290> electric<00:02:40.709> car<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:41.040> electronic

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
not just an electric car but electronic

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.640 
not just an electric car but electronic
car<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.510> knows<00:02:42.720> about<00:02:42.870> its<00:02:43.080> environment<00:02:43.500> it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
car it knows about its environment it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.830 
car it knows about its environment it
notice<00:02:43.890> say<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.640> charge<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.120> knows<00:02:45.269> who<00:02:45.540> needs

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
notice say to charge it knows who needs

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.280 
notice say to charge it knows who needs
it<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.800> do<00:02:46.920> things<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:48.290> all

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
it so that you can do things like all

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.810 
it so that you can do things like all
for<00:02:49.470> charging<00:02:49.830> at<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> peak<00:02:50.190> times<00:02:50.430> when<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
for charging at the peak times when the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.430 
for charging at the peak times when the
Tony<00:02:51.209> companies<00:02:51.570> maybe<00:02:51.720> need<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.080> offload<00:02:52.320> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
Tony companies maybe need to offload a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.590 
Tony companies maybe need to offload a
little<00:02:52.680> bit<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.860> renewable<00:02:53.130> energy<00:02:53.489> or<00:02:54.000> let

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
little bit of renewable energy or let

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.090 
little bit of renewable energy or let
you<00:02:54.720> know<00:02:54.840> about<00:02:54.959> latest<00:02:55.560> things<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.890> are<00:02:56.010> in

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
you know about latest things that are in

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.410 
you know about latest things that are in
town

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
town

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.970 
town
so<00:02:57.990> just<00:02:58.200> trying<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.440> approach<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:58.890> a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
so just trying to approach it on a

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.250 
so just trying to approach it on a
different<00:02:59.400> level<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.670> its<00:03:00.260> intelligent

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
different level of its intelligent

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.860 
different level of its intelligent
mobility<00:03:01.700> but<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> when<00:03:03.150> might<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.390> see<00:03:03.690> they

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
mobility but and when might we see they

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.740 
mobility but and when might we see they
set<00:03:04.290> one<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.560> these<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.830> use<00:03:05.240> so<00:03:06.240> we're<00:03:06.450> gonna

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
set one of these in use so we're gonna

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.500 
set one of these in use so we're gonna
see<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.110> first<00:03:07.340> show<00:03:08.340> car<00:03:08.580> come<00:03:08.819> out<00:03:08.970> well

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
see the first show car come out well

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.140 
see the first show car come out well
with<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> neck<00:03:10.050> next<00:03:10.800> year<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.220> go<00:03:12.000> into

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
with the neck next year and go into

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.500 
with the neck next year and go into
production<00:03:12.480> by<00:03:12.720> 2013
