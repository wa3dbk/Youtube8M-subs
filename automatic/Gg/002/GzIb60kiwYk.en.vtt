jobs difficult he's one job bigger than
the<00:04:18.799> next<00:04:19.100> well<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.850> know<00:04:19.970> that's<00:04:20.720> what<00:04:21.230> two

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
the next well you know that's what two

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.650 
the next well you know that's what two
people<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.880> people's<00:04:22.880> perceptions<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.450> that

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
people to people's perceptions of that

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.200 
people to people's perceptions of that
yes<00:04:23.990> he's<00:04:24.169> coming<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.560> squad<00:04:25.220> which<00:04:26.060> is<00:04:26.180> a

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
yes he's coming to a squad which is a

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.050 
yes he's coming to a squad which is a
lot<00:04:26.360> larger<00:04:26.480> than<00:04:26.690> when<00:04:26.840> he<00:04:26.900> left

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
lot larger than when he left

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.770 
lot larger than when he left
expectations<00:04:29.060> are<00:04:29.150> probably<00:04:29.389> a<00:04:29.450> lot<00:04:29.600> higher

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
expectations are probably a lot higher

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.360 
expectations are probably a lot higher
because<00:04:30.530> we<00:04:30.710> spent<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:30.980> little<00:04:31.130> bit<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.340> money

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
because we spent a little bit of money

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.680

at<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.639> club<00:04:31.820> we've<00:04:31.940> got<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.150> bit<00:04:32.330> more<00:04:32.510> money

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
at the club we've got a bit more money

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.170 
at the club we've got a bit more money
than<00:04:32.840> we've<00:04:32.960> ever<00:04:33.050> had<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.940> in<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.120> aspect

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
than we've ever had so in that aspect

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.440 
than we've ever had so in that aspect
that<00:04:35.630> suppose<00:04:35.900> yeah<00:04:36.710> he<00:04:36.860> did<00:04:37.300> difficult<00:04:38.300> but

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
that suppose yeah he did difficult but

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.180 
that suppose yeah he did difficult but
how<00:04:38.780> much<00:04:39.410> more<00:04:39.590> different<00:04:39.740> looking<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.100> get

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
how much more different looking to get

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.590 
how much more different looking to get
from<00:04:40.340> when<00:04:40.430> he<00:04:40.490> first<00:04:40.700> took<00:04:40.820> over<00:04:40.940> with
