00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello nearby old post to do 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.799
 actually a fast video of the series 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.300
 of videos I'll tell you about a product that 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.830
 I see you like them a lot and I find a lot 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
 useful especially for people who don't 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 they want to follow a video too 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.910
 long where they are actually interested in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.949
 understand and analyze a single 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.230
 produced today the product of which there is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.970
 I'll talk to him and he's a makeup remover 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 biphasic of the garnier you have me 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.820
 seen use many times is a 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.219
 then phasic product that goes 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.980
 mixed you see that it becomes one 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.399
 color then the two parts that are the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.180
 injured party and the part is not mixed 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.040
 is a two-phase 2- in- 1 makeup remover 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.980
 without wasting special waterproof 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.690
 therefore suitable and it is divided to 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.309
 bales the waterproof sheet tricks of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.600
 so black bed that heavy because 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.969
 even those who do not wear make-up 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.489
 waterproof but you give black pencil you give to 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.109
 eyeliner gives an abundant amount of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.059
 mascara obviously needs one 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.300
 make-up remover that is a little bit more 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.090
 powerful and suitable despite this is the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.920
 line sensitive extension and is suitable 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 even for sensitive skin 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.369
 here I recommend advise me 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.240
 use them on the face to use it on 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.100
 face and eyes 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.200
 honestly I never have it on my face 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.140
 used I use it right in the part 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.210
 of the eyes and of course in the area 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.520
 around so also for the eyebrows 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 but then the fool then anyway afterwards 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.909
 having taken your eyes off this 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.799
 Proceed to the cleansing product allin 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.409
 face and then then rinse away too 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.439
 the oily, greasy parts of the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.900
 tormenting I made some cards 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.040
 as I read you I will tell you 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.920
 a product made of cards 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.070
 specific where I read the quantity that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.070
 are 200 ml the pao is six months 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.120
 you know that pao is the period for 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.850
 period after opening for the period not 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.050
 I know how to say it anyway is the duration 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.159
 which has the product after its opening 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.910
 this is here for six months if not 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.680
 yes yes the 200 ml ingredients ve 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.390
 I put them on the blog 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.319
 you know that is the philosophy of these 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.560
 products 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.540
 it's kind of not having perfume not having 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.269
 alcohol having no dyes is that of 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.249
 insert as ingredients of 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.579
 most possible ingredients with active ingredients 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:24.139
 pure close to the natural ones anyway 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.329
 always have me on the factors 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.680
 ingredients that you know I'm not one 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.739
 big tritsch and del gaffer 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.379
 biodizionario and company 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:38.060
 what else to say about the price of 45 euros 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.689
 once they even found the bill 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.819
 353 I don't know why but between 53 mi 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.439
 I love it so I bought hundreds 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.930
 of times and it is truly one of the few 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.939
 products that does not give me any problems 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.980
 eyes when I travel I take it 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.900
 because even if I have to participate in 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.549
 events or things I can't use 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.629
 really other products because it comes to me 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.609
 perfumes come just the eyes 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.500
 red was the course of the years 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.750
 having also had the opportunity to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.459
 try many brands and lots of make-up removers 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.889
 of phases I've always always had 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.209
 problems this here I must say that it is 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.150
 was what you years or more 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.480
 bought back and with which I find myself the most 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.420
 good for me is great 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.129
 like other things to tell you it's very easy 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.230
 to use because you put it 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.640
 you have to mix and put it on 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.310
 diskette you don't even have much 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.750
 need to go to work it on 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.080
 eyes wide power diskette him 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.260
 let it act a little and then start all us 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:39.959
 make up and then what else I had written 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:42.470
 to tell you anything but how much I do 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.780
 their super advice is 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.250
 absolutely alcohol 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.269
 the other thing I don't know if I said yes 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.480
 but without perfume alcohol and dyes e 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:58.310
 just say it has a plant extract 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.379
 softening to the first pro vitamin b5 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.010
 then I will put the lynx in detail 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.709
 on the blog 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.540
 let me know if you have tried it if 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.459
 you have tried other products or 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.099
 line always in the garnier I tried 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.470
 other make-up removers also the green type 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.079
 but I never found myself as well as 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.120
 with this one here if you have other steps there 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.639
 you have tried it for yourself

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.400
