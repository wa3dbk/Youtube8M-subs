making at 1.6 mil an hour now that might

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.430 
making at 1.6 mil an hour now that might
be<00:04:50.319> its<00:04:50.470> had<00:04:50.889> bit<00:04:51.220> too<00:04:51.460> high<00:04:51.810> but<00:04:52.810> in<00:04:53.080> the

minute at that and I made around a good
fork<00:05:23.440> a<00:05:23.800> profit<00:05:24.400> or<00:05:24.819> more<00:05:25.060> around<00:05:25.810> a<00:05:25.900> fork<00:05:26.169> a

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
fork a profit or more around a fork a

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.999 
fork a profit or more around a fork a
profit<00:05:26.889> in<00:05:27.099> about<00:05:27.340> 20<00:05:28.270> seconds<00:05:28.719> or<00:05:28.930> so<00:05:29.169> maybe

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
profit in about 20 seconds or so maybe

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.370 
profit in about 20 seconds or so maybe
maybe<00:05:30.819> a<00:05:30.940> little<00:05:31.090> bit<00:05:31.270> less<00:05:31.449> you<00:05:31.719> know<00:05:31.840> 20<00:05:32.199> goes

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
maybe a little bit less you know 20 goes

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.909 
maybe a little bit less you know 20 goes
into<00:05:32.680> a<00:05:32.710> minute<00:05:33.360> three<00:05:34.360> times<00:05:34.599> times<00:05:35.590> that<00:05:35.860> by

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
into a minute three times times that by

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.459 
into a minute three times times that by
60<00:05:36.880> that's<00:05:37.240> 180<00:05:37.900> x<00:05:38.229> times<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.340> 4k<00:05:40.199> just<00:05:41.199> simple

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
60 that's 180 x times the 4k just simple

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.649 
60 that's 180 x times the 4k just simple
method<00:05:41.710> there<00:05:41.889> that's<00:05:42.069> 720<00:05:42.669> k<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.389> that's

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
method there that's 720 k and that's

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.140 
method there that's 720 k and that's
with<00:05:43.990> low<00:05:44.590> profit<00:05:45.159> as<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.750> guys<00:05:47.199> saw<00:05:47.500> so

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
with low profit as you guys saw so

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.550 
with low profit as you guys saw so
definitely<00:05:49.150> recommend<00:05:49.599> this<00:05:49.659> method<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.319> do

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
definitely recommend this method you do

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.800 
definitely recommend this method you do

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
need a 7 magic so it is a little bit of

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.670

that you can be making you know
potentially<00:06:00.430> even<00:06:01.150> though<00:06:01.449> this<00:06:01.629> was<00:06:01.900> pretty

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
potentially even though this was pretty

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.610 
potentially even though this was pretty
low<00:06:02.560> in<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:03.759> point<00:06:04.210> of<00:06:04.270> this<00:06:04.389> video<00:06:04.569> you<00:06:05.289> still

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
low in the point of this video you still

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.189 
low in the point of this video you still
can<00:06:05.889> make<00:06:06.190> like<00:06:06.430> that<00:06:06.610> 720<00:06:07.419> k<00:06:07.539> like<00:06:07.690> i<00:06:07.719> just<00:06:07.810> did

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
can make like that 720 k like i just did

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.709 
can make like that 720 k like i just did
in<00:06:08.500> my<00:06:08.560> head<00:06:08.710> and<00:06:09.029> that's<00:06:10.029> not<00:06:10.240> even<00:06:10.419> as

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:10.719 
in my head and that's not even as

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.930 
in my head and that's not even as
accurate<00:06:11.379> it<00:06:11.500> you<00:06:11.650> it's<00:06:11.979> probably<00:06:12.639> more

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
accurate it you it's probably more

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.420 
accurate it you it's probably more
because<00:06:13.479> I<00:06:13.719> just<00:06:13.810> said<00:06:14.169> 20<00:06:14.500> seconds<00:06:14.979> throwing

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
because I just said 20 seconds throwing

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.680 
because I just said 20 seconds throwing
that<00:06:15.610> out<00:06:15.729> there<00:06:15.759> i'm<00:06:16.000> sure<00:06:16.240> i<00:06:16.270> made<00:06:16.509> the

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
that out there i'm sure i made the

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.990 
that out there i'm sure i made the
hundred<00:06:16.990> bolts<00:06:17.289> faster<00:06:17.860> than<00:06:18.039> 20<00:06:18.310> seconds<00:06:18.699> so

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
hundred bolts faster than 20 seconds so
