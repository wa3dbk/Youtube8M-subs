00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hello, I'm Miguel Lamas, well, let's go 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.750
 to learn a little about what is the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.750
 technique 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.119
 how is it done in catalan 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.119
 it is very important to know that for 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.910
 flamenco has been presented to have the 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.910
 long nails of life 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.879
 and above all, it will allow us to have 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.449
 agility in the brand as happens with 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.449
 The rhythms 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.399
 to be able to give him that stamp 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.730
 characteristic of the reef in which we are going to 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.730
 start 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.079
 pretty simple 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.079
 and I will explain it in parts 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.329
 with using a first 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.550
 the index finger raising it 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.720
 nothing else the first three strings 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.810
 the cousins 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.930
 then it goes up then we go down with all 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.930
 the fingers that this would be our accent 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.490
 we go up with the thumb again to the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:27.290
 three cousins ​​and a tap on the guitar 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:32.830
 hand rope fully open then 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.830
 explained again string index 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.729
 for the new gypsies in these 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.220
 moments still do not have a 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.119
 structure on the wrist can you go 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.450
 practicing a simple movement 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.450
 would be 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.240
 once we have more agility 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.190
 we can go expanding the range 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.500
 where are we going to touch the beginning on 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.510
 range of motion 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.439
 the doll 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.680
 forearm which will allow us greater 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.760
 weight and give a more sound to the itching 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.110
 to our 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.110
 in this work 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.989
 A) Yes 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.150
 for example a pair of chords 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.930
 we will talk about what the auctions are 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.239
 for songs for example dramas 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.010
 of the simple using the rumba 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.010
 Catalan would be something like that 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.000
 see you soon
