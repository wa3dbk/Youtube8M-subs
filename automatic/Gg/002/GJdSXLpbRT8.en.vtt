00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:10.910
 an accident against the curbstone starts 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.340
 on guitar but in my farrow 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 under the always dream of the good times at 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.109
 low with me 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.510
 tommaso spinelli and when I am so colored 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:28.699

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.840
 but he plays the drums there are 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.059
 twinning, in short, that of the heart which 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.059
 displaces hunger and health 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.350
 I left 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.780
 the back door looks a little who it is 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.210
 state 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.210
 only past in the form of you 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.470

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.190

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.290
 my asynchronous adolescence 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.680
 the idea itself to become a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.250

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.750
 to adolescence and from there we will make a sort 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.390
 of excursus to tell the dream 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.490
 of the band starting from the snacks from 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.450
