00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
think everybody's just having a really

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.040 
think everybody's just having a really
great<00:02:12.440> time<00:02:13.180> uniting<00:02:14.180> together<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.750> then

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
great time uniting together and then

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.870 
great time uniting together and then
having<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.739> little<00:02:16.670> bit<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:16.880> laugh<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.819> I

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
having a little bit of a laugh and and I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.699 
having a little bit of a laugh and and I
think<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.269> majority<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.900> contributions<00:02:21.590> are

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
think the majority of contributions are

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.720 
think the majority of contributions are
coming<00:02:21.739> in<00:02:22.010> at<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.190> one<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.459> two<00:02:22.550> dollar

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
coming in at the one and two dollar

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.640 
coming in at the one and two dollar
