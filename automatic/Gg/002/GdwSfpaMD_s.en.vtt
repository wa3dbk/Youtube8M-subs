the wood and add the convenience of
natural<00:00:13.980> gas<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:15.000> there's<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> number<00:00:15.690> of

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
natural gas but there's a number of

controlled by well in this particular
case<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.650> an<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.040> off<00:00:32.099> switch<00:00:32.210> but<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.300> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
case is an on and off switch but as you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
case is an on and off switch but as you
can<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.870> homeowner<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.410> not<00:00:34.440> decided<00:00:35.310> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
can see the homeowner is not decided to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.700 
can see the homeowner is not decided to
do<00:00:35.610> anything<00:00:36.180> whatsoever<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.260> screened

do anything whatsoever with the screened

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.550 
do anything whatsoever with the screened
front<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.580> screen<00:00:38.850> doors<00:00:39.210> allowing<00:00:40.110> air

front or the screen doors allowing air
at<00:00:40.740> all<00:00:40.860> times<00:00:41.220> to<00:00:41.460> pass<00:00:41.700> into<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.150> fireplace

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
at all times to pass into the fireplace

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.480 
at all times to pass into the fireplace
and<00:00:42.810> on<00:00:43.290> up<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> chimney<00:00:43.830> not<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.340> you'd

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
and on up the chimney not what you'd

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.610 
and on up the chimney not what you'd
call<00:00:44.630> energy-efficient<00:00:45.630> especially<00:00:46.440> when

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
call energy-efficient especially when

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
call energy-efficient especially when
the<00:00:46.770> fire<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.010> off<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.790> when<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.330> fire<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the fire is off and when the fire the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
the fire is off and when the fire the
burner<00:00:49.290> is<00:00:49.590> off<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:50.400> you<00:00:50.520> still<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
burner is off then you still have a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.480 
burner is off then you still have a
standing<00:00:51.420> fire<00:00:51.720> being<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.740> pilot<00:00:53.100> light<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
standing fire being the pilot light and

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.850 
standing fire being the pilot light and
you<00:00:54.000> must<00:00:54.210> always<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.810> that<00:00:55.020> vent<00:00:55.320> open<00:00:55.680> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
you must always have that vent open so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
you must always have that vent open so
therefore<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.400> can<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.600> damper

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
therefore you can see here the damper

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.080 
therefore you can see here the damper
has<00:00:58.230> been<00:00:58.530> fixed<00:00:58.740> open<00:00:59.130> by<00:00:59.280> using<00:00:59.520> double

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
has been fixed open by using double

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.330 
has been fixed open by using double
acorn<00:01:00.510> nuts<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> there's<00:01:01.350> an<00:01:01.470> actual<00:01:01.740> locking

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
acorn nuts and there's an actual locking

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
acorn nuts and there's an actual locking
material<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:03.990> threads<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
material that is put on the threads that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
material that is put on the threads that
way<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.830> no<00:01:05.159> way<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> remove<00:01:06.450> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
way there no way can you remove that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.389 
way there no way can you remove that
without<00:01:06.960> breaking<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.710> therefore<00:01:08.280> it's

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
without breaking it so therefore it's

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.969 
without breaking it so therefore it's
always<00:01:08.880> fixed<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.420> an<00:01:09.539> open<00:01:09.869> position<00:01:10.049> well

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
always fixed in an open position well

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
always fixed in an open position well
I've<00:01:11.250> decided<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.060> would<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.659> in

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
I've decided what we would do here in

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.359 
I've decided what we would do here in
order<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.109> make<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.469> more<00:01:13.649> energy-efficient

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
order to make it more energy-efficient

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
order to make it more energy-efficient
and<00:01:14.429> certainly<00:01:14.969> power<00:01:15.179> smart<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.719> home

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and certainly power smart for the home

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.859 
and certainly power smart for the home
we<00:01:16.289> want<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.649> take<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> put<00:01:17.460> glass<00:01:17.850> doors<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
we want to take and put glass doors so I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.450 
we want to take and put glass doors so I
thought<00:01:19.079> what<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.619> call<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.249> of<00:01:20.340> my

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
thought what I do is call it one of my

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.459 
thought what I do is call it one of my
buddies<00:01:20.789> and<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.359> will<00:01:21.719> talk<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.200> glass

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
buddies and that will talk about glass

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.169 
buddies and that will talk about glass
doors<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.249> efficiency<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.939> and

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
doors and the efficiency of them and

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.630 
doors and the efficiency of them and
with<00:01:24.749> me<00:01:24.960> I've<00:01:25.140> got<00:01:25.380> John<00:01:25.710> journey<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.340> Burnaby

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
with me I've got John journey of Burnaby

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.279 
with me I've got John journey of Burnaby
fire<00:01:26.909> screen<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.359> you<00:01:27.450> doing<00:01:27.630> John<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:28.170> too

bad<00:01:28.469> you<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.890> Burnaby<00:01:29.340> fire<00:01:29.640> screen<00:01:30.149> also

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
bad you know Burnaby fire screen also

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.889 
bad you know Burnaby fire screen also
make<00:01:30.960> doors<00:01:31.469> and<00:01:31.890> glass<00:01:32.729> doors<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
make doors and glass doors is what I

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.480 
make doors and glass doors is what I
think<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.439> should<00:01:34.469> have<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.039> tell<00:01:35.219> me<00:01:35.310> why

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
think we should have here tell me why

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
think we should have here tell me why
well<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.600> reason<00:01:36.899> you<00:01:36.990> should<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.259> glass

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
well the reason you should have glass

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.340 
well the reason you should have glass
doors<00:01:37.560> they'll<00:01:38.399> they'll<00:01:38.850> cut<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.210> 70%<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
doors they'll they'll cut out 70% of the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.889 
doors they'll they'll cut out 70% of the
heat<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.880> chimney<00:01:42.119> now

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
heat that's now going up the chimney now

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.020 
heat that's now going up the chimney now
what<00:01:43.289> you<00:01:43.439> mean<00:01:43.649> by<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.039> then<00:01:44.249> I<00:01:44.280> assume<00:01:44.789> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
what you mean by that then I assume is

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
that with it burning like it is now it's

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.309 
that with it burning like it is now it's
just<00:01:47.819> going<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.929> chimney<00:01:49.139> I'm

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
just going right on up the chimney I'm

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.770 
just going right on up the chimney I'm
not<00:01:49.469> getting<00:01:49.710> any<00:01:50.060> saving<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.240> energy

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
not getting any saving of energy

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.289

well<00:01:52.409> no<00:01:52.740> you're<00:01:53.100> saving<00:01:53.549> energy<00:01:53.969> when<00:01:54.179> you're

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.710 
can see that it really looks great make
sure<00:03:31.739> brass<00:03:31.980> look<00:03:32.220> much<00:03:32.459> better<00:03:32.700> too<00:03:33.030> right

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
sure brass look much better too right

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.300 
sure brass look much better too right
how<00:03:33.959> long<00:03:34.109> is<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.200> gonna<00:03:34.349> take<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.709> installers

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
how long is it gonna take the installers

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.370 
how long is it gonna take the installers
Oh<00:03:35.340> half<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.569> three<00:03:36.780> quarters<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.170> an<00:03:37.260> hour

switch<00:04:13.480> will<00:04:14.079> activate<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:15.040> gas<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.640> also

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
switch will activate the gas and also

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.060 
switch will activate the gas and also
light<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.720> flame<00:04:16.959> so<00:04:17.229> we'll<00:04:17.380> turn<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.889> on

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
light the flame so we'll turn it to on

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.640 
light the flame so we'll turn it to on
and<00:04:18.430> we'll<00:04:18.880> open<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.299> other<00:04:19.389> door<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:20.410> way

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
and we'll open the other door that way

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.100 
and we'll open the other door that way
we<00:04:20.889> give<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.970> air<00:04:22.180> from<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.750> room<00:04:22.900> the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
we give the the air from the room the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.469 
we give the the air from the room the
opportunity<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.889> go<00:04:24.039> into<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> fireplace<00:04:24.639> now

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
opportunity to go into the fireplace now

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.570 
opportunity to go into the fireplace now
you<00:04:25.539> can<00:04:25.810> see<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.770> gas<00:04:26.979> is<00:04:27.280> burning

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
you can see that the the gas is burning

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.670 
you can see that the the gas is burning
and<00:04:27.820> it's<00:04:28.270> venting<00:04:28.720> right<00:04:28.930> on<00:04:29.080> up<00:04:29.289> the<00:04:29.440> chimney

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
and it's venting right on up the chimney

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.520 
and it's venting right on up the chimney
now<00:04:30.370> once<00:04:30.639> those<00:04:30.820> ceramic<00:04:31.210> logs<00:04:31.690> get<00:04:32.050> warm

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
now once those ceramic logs get warm

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.830 
now once those ceramic logs get warm
then<00:04:33.160> they<00:04:33.340> start<00:04:33.669> reading<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.510> heat<00:04:34.660> out

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
then they start reading the heat out

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.390 
then they start reading the heat out
into<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.320> room<00:04:35.530> that's<00:04:35.889> where<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.130> get<00:04:36.280> the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
into the room that's where you get the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.029 
into the room that's where you get the
efficiency<00:04:36.880> from<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.389> gas<00:04:37.630> log<00:04:38.020> units<00:04:38.500> now

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
efficiency from the gas log units now

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.120 
efficiency from the gas log units now
the<00:04:39.100> gas<00:04:39.400> log<00:04:39.729> units<00:04:40.120> once<00:04:40.510> turned<00:04:40.930> off<00:04:41.229> which

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
the gas log units once turned off which

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.790 
the gas log units once turned off which
I'll<00:04:42.310> do<00:04:42.460> here<00:04:42.490> I'll<00:04:43.240> shut<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.780> off<00:04:43.960> now<00:04:44.590> that

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
I'll do here I'll shut it off now that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.310 
I'll do here I'll shut it off now that
the<00:04:44.889> gas<00:04:45.039> log<00:04:45.430> unit<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.060> off<00:04:46.240> we<00:04:46.690> don't<00:04:47.080> want

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
the gas log unit is off we don't want

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.710 
the gas log unit is off we don't want
that<00:04:47.530> air<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.979> continue<00:04:48.460> chimney<00:04:49.090> out<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.660> the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
that air to continue chimney out of the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.360 
that air to continue chimney out of the
home<00:04:49.900> because<00:04:50.110> that's<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.710> energy<00:04:50.860> that<00:04:51.220> we

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
home because that's the energy that we

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.500 
home because that's the energy that we
want<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.699> retain<00:04:51.820> so<00:04:52.690> we'll<00:04:52.870> close<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.349> doors

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
want to retain so we'll close the doors

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.379 
want to retain so we'll close the doors
now<00:04:55.510> we<00:04:55.570> have<00:04:56.139> control<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:57.520> air<00:04:57.789> flow<00:04:58.090> out

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
now we have control that air flow out

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.390 
now we have control that air flow out
the<00:04:58.450> chimney<00:04:58.960> making<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.770> hole<00:04:59.950> much<00:05:00.160> more

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
the chimney making the hole much more

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.560 
the chimney making the hole much more
energy<00:05:00.700> efficient<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.180> certainly<00:05:01.419> making

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
energy efficient and certainly making

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.750 
energy efficient and certainly making
the<00:05:01.810> fireplace<00:05:02.229> very<00:05:02.860> inner<00:05:03.160> energy

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
the fireplace very inner energy

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.920 
the fireplace very inner energy
efficient<00:05:04.120> compared<00:05:04.389> to<00:05:04.450> what<00:05:04.599> was<00:05:04.750> before

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
efficient compared to what was before

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.370 
efficient compared to what was before
now<00:05:05.680> around<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.099> side<00:05:06.340> here<00:05:07.260> there<00:05:08.260> was

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
now around the side here there was

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.980 
now around the side here there was
installed<00:05:08.770> a<00:05:08.950> side<00:05:09.280> panel<00:05:09.639> that<00:05:10.389> for

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
installed a side panel that for

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.050 
installed a side panel that for
convenience<00:05:11.440> of<00:05:11.530> cleaning<00:05:12.010> but<00:05:12.520> also<00:05:12.729> it

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
convenience of cleaning but also it

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.330 
convenience of cleaning but also it
shows<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.450> air<00:05:14.169> flow<00:05:14.500> let's<00:05:14.950> take<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.130> look

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
shows the air flow let's take a look

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.159 
shows the air flow let's take a look
here<00:05:15.550> when<00:05:15.789> I<00:05:15.820> get<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.300> almost<00:05:16.870> closed

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
here when I get that almost closed

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.930 
here when I get that almost closed
you'll<00:05:17.440> see<00:05:17.620> what<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:17.770> mean<00:05:17.830> by<00:05:18.130> air<00:05:18.340> drawing<00:05:18.729> up

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
you'll see what I mean by air drawing up

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.400 
you'll see what I mean by air drawing up
the<00:05:19.060> chimney<00:05:19.270> it'll<00:05:19.780> actually<00:05:19.930> pull<00:05:20.289> it

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
the chimney it'll actually pull it

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.189 
the chimney it'll actually pull it
closed<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:21.070> that<00:05:21.720> is<00:05:22.720> where<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.110> energy

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
closed and that is where the energy

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.920 
closed and that is where the energy
