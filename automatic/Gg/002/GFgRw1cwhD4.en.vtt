last<00:02:46.340> throughout<00:02:46.670> his<00:02:47.060> rookie<00:02:47.420> season<00:02:47.680> my

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
last throughout his rookie season my

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.900 
last throughout his rookie season my
whole<00:02:48.860> life<00:02:49.070> I've<00:02:49.220> always<00:02:49.310> put<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.700> pressure

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
whole life I've always put the pressure

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.180 
whole life I've always put the pressure
on<00:02:50.090> myself<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.260> that's<00:02:51.590> why<00:02:51.860> it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
on myself and so I think that's why it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.710 
on myself and so I think that's why it
hasn't<00:02:52.400> been<00:02:52.610> very<00:02:52.730> difficult<00:02:53.270> for<00:02:53.480> me<00:02:53.600> to

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
hasn't been very difficult for me to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.570 
hasn't been very difficult for me to
handle<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.050> pressure<00:02:54.290> because<00:02:54.740> when<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.370> look

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
handle the pressure because when I look

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.580 
handle the pressure because when I look
in<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.730> mirror<00:02:55.820> in<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.090> morning<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.600> know<00:02:57.200> that
