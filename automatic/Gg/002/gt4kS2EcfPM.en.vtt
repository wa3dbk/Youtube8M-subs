00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.039 
also have contagion clasp to proliferate
and<00:01:38.000> contagion<00:01:39.000> engine<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.869> two

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and contagion engine we have two

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.330 
and contagion engine we have two
contagion<00:01:40.500> engines<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.070> used<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
contagion engines actually I used to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.609 
contagion engines actually I used to
have<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
have just one but it was it's I just I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.859 
have just one but it was it's I just I
one<00:01:43.920> more<00:01:44.280> after<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.090> got<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> contagion<00:01:45.780> engine

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
one more after I got a contagion engine

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
one more after I got a contagion engine
out<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.560> even<00:01:46.860> when<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.159> wurmcoil<00:01:47.549> engine

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
out then even when I got wurmcoil engine

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.359 
out then even when I got wurmcoil engine
out<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.450> put<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> second<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.409> so

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
out so we put a second one in there so

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.819 
out so we put a second one in there so
that's<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.210> good<00:01:51.329> idea<00:01:51.450> yeah<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.590> also<00:01:52.740> have

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
that's a good idea yeah and we also have

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
that's a good idea yeah and we also have
ratchet<00:01:53.250> bumps<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.000> ratchet<00:01:54.240> up<00:01:54.479> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
ratchet bumps that can ratchet up to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
ratchet bumps that can ratchet up to
with<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> help<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> surge<00:01:56.189> nodes<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

it<00:02:25.910> works<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.360> testing<00:02:26.810> grind<00:02:27.470> clock<00:02:27.620> is

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
it works in testing grind clock is

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.290 
it works in testing grind clock is
usually<00:02:28.010> only<00:02:28.160> been<00:02:28.340> good<00:02:28.550> against<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.880> aggro

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
usually only been good against the aggro

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.759 
usually only been good against the aggro
matchups<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.959> mean<00:02:30.140> not<00:02:30.170> yet<00:02:30.349> it's<00:02:30.650> been

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
matchups I mean not yet it's been

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:31.990 
matchups I mean not yet it's been
terrible<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.310> aggro<00:02:31.550> matchups<00:02:31.940> up

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
terrible in the aggro matchups up

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.350 
terrible in the aggro matchups up
against<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.269> control<00:02:32.660> matchups<00:02:33.080> but<00:02:34.360> yeah

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
against the control matchups but yeah

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.869 
against the control matchups but yeah
well<00:02:35.780> give<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.319> chance<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.459> yeah<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.819> mean

obviously<00:02:38.720> looking<00:02:39.049> at<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.319> deck<00:02:39.560> we<00:02:39.860> could

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
obviously looking at this deck we could

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.190 
obviously looking at this deck we could
put<00:02:40.459> any<00:02:40.700> color<00:02:40.880> we<00:02:41.060> wanted<00:02:41.390> in<00:02:41.480> here<00:02:41.660> we<00:02:42.049> could

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
put any color we wanted in here we could

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.100 
put any color we wanted in here we could
put<00:02:42.380> white<00:02:42.769> blue<00:02:43.160> black<00:02:43.519> red<00:02:44.090> or<00:02:44.390> green<00:02:44.840> just

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
put white blue black red or green just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
put white blue black red or green just
to<00:02:45.200> splash<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:46.400> yeah<00:02:46.910> honestly<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:48.130> it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
to splash but yeah honestly like it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.380 
to splash but yeah honestly like it
feels<00:02:49.340> kind<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.670> naked<00:02:49.849> without<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.150> color

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
feels kind of naked without a color

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.850 
feels kind of naked without a color
because<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.780> think<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.079> artifacts<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.709> kind

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
because I think of artifacts it's kind

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.920 
because I think of artifacts it's kind
of<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.040> sprinkle<00:02:52.519> on<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.819> dinner<00:02:53.090> mm-hmm<00:02:53.690> you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930

know yeah it's like we're nothing but
ketchup<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.730> know<00:02:55.849> it's<00:02:56.030> like<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.420> really

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
ketchup I know it's like it's really

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.940

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
sprinkles all right well the reason

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.420 
sprinkles all right well the reason
we're<00:03:00.140> running<00:03:00.380> mono<00:03:00.560> artifacts<00:03:01.099> here<00:03:01.280> rather

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
we're running mono artifacts here rather

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.160 
we're running mono artifacts here rather
than<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.670> color<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.120> because<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:02.989> want<00:03:03.110> to

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
than a color is because I just want to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.710 
than a color is because I just want to
see<00:03:03.290> how<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.530> works<00:03:03.799> first<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.700> mean<00:03:05.360> if<00:03:05.480> mono

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
see how it works first I mean if mono

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.780 
see how it works first I mean if mono
are<00:03:05.930> brown<00:03:06.230> works<00:03:06.560> well<00:03:06.860> then<00:03:07.250> maybe<00:03:07.519> we<00:03:07.640> don't

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
are brown works well then maybe we don't

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.280 
are brown works well then maybe we don't
need<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.090> splash<00:03:08.269> color<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.599> really<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:09.019> so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
need to splash color I really just so

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.509

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
maybe we'll have thinking of life I

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.510 
off of a kicked into the Royal or
something<00:04:53.260> so<00:04:53.350> you<00:04:53.410> have<00:04:53.680> just<00:04:53.860> in<00:04:53.950> case<00:04:54.160> yeah

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
something so you have just in case yeah

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.850 
something so you have just in case yeah
and<00:04:54.930> obviously<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:56.020> would<00:04:56.380> like<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.530> put<00:04:56.770> in

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
and obviously I would like to put in

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.860 
and obviously I would like to put in
like<00:04:57.010> mystifying<00:04:57.580> mazes<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.270> tectonic<00:04:58.690> edges

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
like mystifying mazes and tectonic edges

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.570 
like mystifying mazes and tectonic edges
but<00:04:59.169> those<00:04:59.380> rotated<00:04:59.800> out<00:04:59.919> so<00:05:00.220> we're<00:05:00.370> going<00:05:00.490> to

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
but those rotated out so we're going to

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.490 
but those rotated out so we're going to
see<00:05:00.820> how<00:05:01.300> this<00:05:01.450> works<00:05:01.630> by<00:05:01.900> itself<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.410> the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
see how this works by itself and the

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.960 
see how this works by itself and the
reason<00:05:02.770> if<00:05:02.919> you're<00:05:03.280> wondering<00:05:03.430> why<00:05:03.790> we<00:05:03.940> only

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
reason if you're wondering why we only

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.570 
reason if you're wondering why we only
have<00:05:04.360> planes<00:05:04.630> is<00:05:04.930> because<00:05:05.770> no<00:05:06.010> creatures<00:05:06.430> in

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
have planes is because no creatures in

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.490 
have planes is because no creatures in
standard<00:05:06.910> have<00:05:07.030> planes<00:05:07.270> walk<00:05:07.510> that's<00:05:08.260> nice

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
standard have planes walk that's nice

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.409 
standard have planes walk that's nice
yeah<00:05:08.889> so<00:05:09.610> we<00:05:09.700> don't<00:05:09.850> have<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.090> worry<00:05:10.270> about

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
yeah so we don't have to worry about

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.580 
yeah so we don't have to worry about
unblock<00:05:10.990> damage<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.430> yeah<00:05:12.610> that's<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:13.120> deck

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590
