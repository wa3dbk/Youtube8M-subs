00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.269
 on day 11 or challenge and that we had was the very needy era 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.019
 why last year was a year where we opened the club left and more 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.239
 democratic 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.569
 with réver should be light bil with fucking assumption we wanted 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.440
 continue with this footprint in 2011 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.070
 but how do we still take this campaign to the next level 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.960
 bringing 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.520
 a story of someone 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.620
 had a lot of integrity has been a lot to conquer 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.620
 do not have a side to account that no one knew father and son 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.030
 a jump from other years 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.220
 which is the first 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.440
 he is a very famous personality 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.330
 a very well-known personality 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.730
 and how was it? 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.140
 silence in the club nextel pc is a process in which I get excited 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.239
 in person 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.490
 to unitel 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.720
 I know these people because it's us, we're not after 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.879
 cover boy 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.720
 we are behind 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.650
 of a story, we are behind the privilege of signing this 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
 story 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.870
 while we thought about the possible protagonists in the possible stories 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.610
 start thinking about football is not because soccer does not that machine 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.479
 that moves hearts and minds in Brazil and in the world 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.350
 Teams Are Beyond The Weapon Legend 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.350
 how much sooner to say whether or not father is soccer because 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.140
 football is controversial and has a team has another 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.450
 and I had it in my head there, I never believed that in this law nor 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 I thought it was possible and behind 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.260
 the aed some history inside the soccer was when it appeared 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.030
 the name of neymar 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.290
 ef 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.920
 My name is at the beginning. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.740
 For some people it did not even make much sense because guns is a young man of 18 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 19 years a star why do we want a star 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.110
 and then you start this process of impeachment jerez action showing that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.409
 there is no one to really want 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.739
 to portray the ace the guy everyone already knows we already know what 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.249
 behind the crime the coupon of the relation with the invoice 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.069
 he does not like 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.979
 so this fan of 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.049
 in the recap of the tournament of atp 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.219
 It's very good, his story was told in the fields. 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:33.019
 and by the perception that the people who had one of what he did or did not 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:33.609
 field 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.930
 then get this guy and bring neymar come here and tried the contact story 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.219
 I try to tell people 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.619
 What do you want to talk about your life? 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.849
 this is very cool nextel supports the people's life story and why 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 not from someone who is very famous 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:58.549
 neymar has a caring relationship of authenticity of complicity with the father 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.549
 from him that's what really very very beautiful 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.439
 and for the first time we were able to show 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.670
 this relationship in a nextel campaign and it was the relationship we chose to 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.949
 relationship 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.399
 maybe it was one of the strongest things 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:14.600
 from your neymar 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.910
 and the junior neymar is what they get on well the Congolese worried about the 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.689
 another like 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.689
 neymar the video makes this relationship 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.699
 since I was born 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.079
 He sat down with a whole career, my life. 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.079
 they still keep running 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.240
 long time 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.439
 she was very cut out taton or not father 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.439
 despite the difficulties in Brazil 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:43.309
 near there

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.919
 apple the backflip 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.889
 What are you thinking about your performance? 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.329
 How are you? 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.329
 This will see you. 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.239
 You're just watching the commercial until 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.549
 see the commercial 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.459
 opera i 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.459
 after noting that the cplp 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.499
 more and more people are very happy to be here 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.499
 practically half trying 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.369
 not just my life 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.409
 is going from 1 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.099
 here in our story 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.559
 despite being 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.849
 the moment but you will know the true 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.099
 léo neymar warrior 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.340
 What do we feel in the future with family members? 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.340
 it's like a father 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.749
 the barbarian delegate lomba 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.749
 all right 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120
 tyler autarch 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.249
 I'm very start talking to the camera. 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.529
 just like all the other movies and the text seems to be being spruced up 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:55.939
 for another they sinner 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.569
 in the measure he will speak of it will question the life questioned person 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.150
 creating a dialogue 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.000
 and then we realize that in fact this text of the belt steppe was a 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.580
 declaration of love and affection, the relationship between father and son and 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.570
 neymar in a picture we realize the weather is talking about everything pro-childbirth 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.389
 with my father after the game, right? 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.889
 I was running the bleachers told 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.909
 betina coming here 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.240
 the coach himself 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.120
 I continue my father asked to take the body. 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 was six years old 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.580
 From then on I went training 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.479
 the player 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.469
 I did not make it 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.409
 I was very happy 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:39.589
 the fabric 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.729
 invited for doing it there 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.729
 he is because you can thank for the invitation 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.599
 how are they seeing 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.580
 It's worth playing around and playing with his father, Messi Neymar. 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.499
 to portray is the boy who is behind the crack that he is crack everyone 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.860
 knows but we want to show the person behind the crime by the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.599
 The first time we can show this story with the two main 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.199
 protagonists are innovating again and recreating the campaign that is already a 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.360
 success to three years
