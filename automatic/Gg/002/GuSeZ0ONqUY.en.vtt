00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
like that and then you like look at the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.740 
like that and then you like look at the
graphics<00:02:52.550> too<00:02:52.790> they're<00:02:52.970> not<00:02:53.120> too<00:02:53.360> impressive

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
graphics too they're not too impressive

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.380

the<00:02:54.050> backgrounds<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.709> offer<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.970> character

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
the backgrounds of offer the character

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.860 
the backgrounds of offer the character
models<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.140> they<00:02:57.740> could<00:02:57.890> look<00:02:58.010> better<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.660> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
models and they could look better and I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.810 
models and they could look better and I
got<00:03:00.080> owned<00:03:00.440> right<00:03:00.800> there<00:03:01.010> but<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> got<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.700> to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
got owned right there but I got it to

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.979 
got owned right there but I got it to
throw<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.209> time<00:03:02.420> which<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:02.840> really<00:03:03.080> weird<00:03:03.260> I

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
throw that time which is really weird I

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.590 
throw that time which is really weird I
think<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.500> fourth<00:03:07.130> touchdown<00:03:07.610> for

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
think this is the fourth touchdown for

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.520 
think this is the fourth touchdown for
fourth<00:03:09.140> down<00:03:09.350> or<00:03:09.590> something

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
