picture a monster that can attack at any
time<00:00:11.480> that<00:00:12.469> can<00:00:12.740> change<00:00:13.250> itself<00:00:13.849> to<00:00:14.150> evade<00:00:14.480> the

time that can change itself to evade the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.839 
time that can change itself to evade the
weapons<00:00:14.990> used<00:00:15.200> against<00:00:15.710> it<00:00:15.860> and<00:00:16.490> can<00:00:16.700> come

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
weapons used against it and can come

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.480 
weapons used against it and can come
back<00:00:17.000> to<00:00:17.300> life<00:00:17.330> from<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:17.869> dead<00:00:18.189> it<00:00:19.189> sounds

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
back to life from the dead it sounds

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.640 
back to life from the dead it sounds
like<00:00:19.640> something<00:00:20.210> from<00:00:20.240> a<00:00:20.480> horror<00:00:20.660> movie<00:00:20.779> but

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
like something from a horror movie but

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.460 
like something from a horror movie but
this<00:00:21.770> monster<00:00:22.009> is<00:00:22.340> real<00:00:22.599> its<00:00:23.599> killed<00:00:24.020> Steve

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
this monster is real its killed Steve

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.210 
this monster is real its killed Steve
Jobs<00:00:24.970> Patrick<00:00:25.970> Swayze<00:00:26.450> and<00:00:27.169> when<00:00:27.320> I<00:00:27.410> was<00:00:27.560> 14<00:00:28.009> my

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
Jobs Patrick Swayze and when I was 14 my

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.540 
Jobs Patrick Swayze and when I was 14 my
mother<00:00:29.410> now<00:00:30.410> my<00:00:30.680> slide<00:00:30.919> gives<00:00:31.160> away<00:00:31.309> the

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
mother now my slide gives away the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.090 
mother now my slide gives away the
mystery<00:00:32.000> but<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.540> monster<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.260> cancer<00:00:33.770> and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
mystery but the monster is cancer and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.130 
mystery but the monster is cancer and
just<00:00:34.760> like<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.059> different<00:00:35.540> image<00:00:35.870> of<00:00:36.079> a

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
just like the different image of a

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.689 
just like the different image of a
monster<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:36.739> all<00:00:36.890> have<00:00:37.130> in<00:00:37.250> your<00:00:37.370> minds

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
monster you all have in your minds

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.900 
monster you all have in your minds
cancer<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.780> always<00:00:39.260> different<00:00:39.579> even<00:00:40.579> in<00:00:40.699> one

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
cancer is always different even in one

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.790 
cancer is always different even in one
person<00:00:41.420> over<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.140> course<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.649> their

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
person over the course of their

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.189 
person over the course of their
treatment<00:00:43.300> because<00:00:44.300> you<00:00:44.449> see<00:00:44.629> when<00:00:44.809> we<00:00:44.929> treat

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
treatment because you see when we treat

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.139 
treatment because you see when we treat
cancer<00:00:45.649> with<00:00:45.679> a<00:00:45.829> drug<00:00:46.160> there's<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.820> potential

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
cancer with a drug there's the potential

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.090 
cancer with a drug there's the potential
for<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.539> to<00:00:47.629> mutate<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.230> become<00:00:48.559> resistant

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
for it to mutate and become resistant

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.060 
for it to mutate and become resistant
well<00:00:49.999> how<00:00:50.089> does<00:00:50.149> it<00:00:50.269> do<00:00:50.510> this<00:00:50.890> cancer<00:00:51.890> actually

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
well how does it do this cancer actually

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.099 
well how does it do this cancer actually
has<00:00:52.429> a<00:00:52.460> variety<00:00:52.699> of<00:00:53.059> mechanisms<00:00:53.269> it<00:00:53.809> can<00:00:53.960> use

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
has a variety of mechanisms it can use

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.529 
has a variety of mechanisms it can use
to<00:00:54.289> survive<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:55.460> when<00:00:55.640> we<00:00:55.789> inhibit<00:00:56.179> one

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
to survive and so when we inhibit one

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.419 
to survive and so when we inhibit one
with<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.749> drug<00:00:57.079> there<00:00:57.589> is<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.859> potential<00:00:58.219> for

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
with a drug there is the potential for

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.189 
with a drug there is the potential for
it<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:58.760> become<00:00:58.909> dependent<00:00:59.359> on<00:00:59.629> a<00:00:59.659> secondary

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
it to become dependent on a secondary

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.040 
it to become dependent on a secondary
mechanism<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.129> continue<00:01:01.519> to<00:01:01.640> ravage<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:02.269> great

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
mechanism and continue to ravage a great

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.720 
mechanism and continue to ravage a great
example<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.620> this<00:01:03.769> was<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.070> clinical<00:01:04.460> trial

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
example of this was a clinical trial

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.149 
example of this was a clinical trial
looking<00:01:05.150> at<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.360> effect<00:01:05.659> of

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
looking at the effect of

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.980 
looking at the effect of
anti-angiogenesis<00:01:07.159> drugs<00:01:07.670> these<00:01:08.540> are<00:01:08.600> drugs

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
anti-angiogenesis drugs these are drugs

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.289 
anti-angiogenesis drugs these are drugs
that<00:01:09.110> stop<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.740> mechanism<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.399> cancer<00:01:10.579> that

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
that stop the mechanism of cancer that

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.120 
that stop the mechanism of cancer that
allow<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.689> to<00:01:11.840> grow<00:01:12.020> new<00:01:12.439> blood<00:01:12.619> vessels

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
allow it to grow new blood vessels

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.550 
allow it to grow new blood vessels
towards<00:01:13.549> itself<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.360> bring<00:01:14.479> fresh<00:01:14.869> oxygen<00:01:15.409> and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
towards itself to bring fresh oxygen and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.679 
towards itself to bring fresh oxygen and
nutrients<00:01:16.210> researchers<00:01:17.210> thought<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.570> if

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
nutrients researchers thought that if

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.450 
nutrients researchers thought that if
they<00:01:17.840> could<00:01:18.020> cut<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.350> off<00:01:18.590> they<00:01:19.159> would<00:01:19.280> be

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
they could cut this off they would be

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.999 
they could cut this off they would be
able<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.880> starve<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.990> blood<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.409> starve<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
able to starve the blood and starve the

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.370 
able to starve the blood and starve the
cancer<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.820> would<00:01:22.939> die<00:01:23.090> but<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.079> problem

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
cancer and it would die but the problem

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.990 
cancer and it would die but the problem
was<00:01:24.500> patients<00:01:25.040> died<00:01:25.189> in<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.430> same<00:01:25.640> amount<00:01:25.939> of

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
was patients died in the same amount of

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.569 
was patients died in the same amount of
time<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.479> instead<00:01:27.079> of<00:01:27.170> one<00:01:27.409> large<00:01:27.649> tumor<00:01:28.100> they

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
time and instead of one large tumor they

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.090 
time and instead of one large tumor they
had<00:01:28.790> multiple<00:01:29.030> small<00:01:29.750> aggressive<00:01:30.500> tumors<00:01:30.920> all

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
had multiple small aggressive tumors all

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.880 
had multiple small aggressive tumors all
over<00:01:31.130> their<00:01:31.460> body<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.869> if<00:01:32.960> these<00:01:33.140> these

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
over their body so if these these

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.789 
over their body so if these these
combinations<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:35.060> mechanisms<00:01:35.930> exist<00:01:36.110> how<00:01:36.740> do

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
combinations of mechanisms exist how do

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.910 
combinations of mechanisms exist how do
we<00:01:36.950> find<00:01:37.189> a<00:01:37.310> way<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.460> treat<00:01:38.329> them<00:01:38.539> together

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
we find a way to treat them together

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.830 
we find a way to treat them together
well<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.219> called<00:01:40.430> combination<00:01:41.329> therapy

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
well this is called combination therapy

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.929 
well this is called combination therapy
giving<00:01:42.469> multiple<00:01:42.649> drugs<00:01:43.159> at<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.460> same<00:01:43.670> time

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
giving multiple drugs at the same time

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.550 
giving multiple drugs at the same time
and<00:01:44.149> trying<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.570> predict<00:01:44.899> that<00:01:45.079> secondary

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
and trying to predict that secondary

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.219 
and trying to predict that secondary
mechanism<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.909> is<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.149> great<00:01:47.479> idea<00:01:47.659> in

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
mechanism and it is a great idea in

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.609 
mechanism and it is a great idea in
theory<00:01:48.829> because<00:01:49.990> 160<00:01:50.990> different<00:01:51.109> approved

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
theory because 160 different approved

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.289 
theory because 160 different approved
hemotherapy<00:01:52.100> drugs<00:01:52.670> finding<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.270> right

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
hemotherapy drugs finding the right

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.679 
hemotherapy drugs finding the right
combinations<00:01:54.140> is<00:01:54.259> not<00:01:54.740> only<00:01:54.920> challenging

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
combinations is not only challenging

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.969 
combinations is not only challenging
expensive<00:01:56.689> but<00:01:56.960> also<00:01:57.109> dangerous<00:01:57.710> because

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
expensive but also dangerous because

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.529 
expensive but also dangerous because
multiple<00:01:58.729> drugs<00:01:59.030> can<00:01:59.270> mean<00:01:59.420> multiple

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
multiple drugs can mean multiple

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.709 
multiple drugs can mean multiple
interactions<00:02:00.289> so<00:02:01.130> how<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:01.340> we<00:02:01.520> find<00:02:01.789> them<00:02:02.030> well

together<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:23.120> have<00:02:23.840> found<00:02:24.049> some<00:02:24.319> that

together I have found some that

together I have found some that
effectively<00:02:25.069> silenced<00:02:25.609> the<00:02:25.760> cancer<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.359> five

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
effectively silenced the cancer and five

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.739 
effectively silenced the cancer and five
specific<00:02:27.439> ones<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.370> make<00:02:28.760> cancer<00:02:29.150> worse
