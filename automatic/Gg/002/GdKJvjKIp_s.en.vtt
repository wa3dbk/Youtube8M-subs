sort you know allowed it graduated zoom
in<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.290> works<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.920> you're

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
in and out it works but if you're

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
in and out it works but if you're
looking<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.310> multi-touch<00:01:11.909> move<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.539 
looking for multi-touch move on it
doesn't<00:01:13.350> seem<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> work<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.400> this

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
doesn't seem it's going to work on this

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
doesn't seem it's going to work on this
since<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> hardware<00:01:15.299> limitation<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
since it's a hardware limitation not a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830 
since it's a hardware limitation not a
software<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.670> initially<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.360> thought<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
software one initially we thought it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
software one initially we thought it
might<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:19.290> software<00:01:19.799> now<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> looks<00:01:20.729> like

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
might be software now it looks like

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
might be software now it looks like
