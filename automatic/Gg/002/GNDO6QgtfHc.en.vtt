that<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.340> usually<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.460> by<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> end<00:01:03.000> boss<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that and usually it by the end boss it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.140 
that and usually it by the end boss it
would<00:01:04.019> usually<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.320> about<00:01:04.559> me<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.549> two

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
would usually be about me and about two

other<00:01:06.330> people<00:01:06.570> left<00:01:06.900> bare<00:01:07.530> mind<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.130> only

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
other people left bare mind I was only

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.490 
other people left bare mind I was only
like<00:01:08.400> level<00:01:08.729> 12<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> pretty<00:01:09.960> sure<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> rest

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
like level 12 and pretty sure the rest

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
like level 12 and pretty sure the rest
were<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.330> 1670s

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
were in the 1670s

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.929 
were in the 1670s
I<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.350> once<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.830> maximum<00:01:14.250> but

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939

I think once to was like maximum but

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.770 
crowd by making them go after his decoys
I<00:01:43.310> found<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> quite<00:01:44.549> difficult<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.149> he<00:01:45.390> killed

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
I found it quite difficult but he killed

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.319 
I found it quite difficult but he killed
the<00:01:45.990> crowd<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.860> usually<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.490> end<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.820> for

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the crowd I usually just end up for

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.260

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
it to be a bit of a drag to kill things

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.539 
it to be a bit of a drag to kill things
this<00:01:57.390> could<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.920> my<00:01:59.040> height<00:01:59.280> thing

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
this could be because of my height thing

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.130 
this could be because of my height thing
I've<00:01:59.729> noticed<00:01:59.850> European<00:02:00.570> players<00:02:00.899> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
I've noticed European players that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.109 
I've noticed European players that
usually<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.770> high<00:02:02.009> paying<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.579> not

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
usually get really high paying and not

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.319 
usually get really high paying and not
all<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.570> attacks<00:02:03.899> actually<00:02:04.439> register<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
all the attacks actually register so it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.510 
all the attacks actually register so it
could<00:02:06.570> either<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.110> me<00:02:07.290> or<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.860> could<00:02:08.220> be

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
could either just be me or it could be

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.040 
could either just be me or it could be
the<00:02:08.910> Fate<00:02:09.060> rack<00:02:09.239> server<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.539> got<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> feel<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the Fate rack server I got a feel and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.780 
the Fate rack server I got a feel and
it's<00:02:10.170> probably<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.560> bit<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.250> me

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
it's probably a bit of me

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.380 
it's probably a bit of me
on<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.269> part<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.989> my<00:02:13.170> five<00:02:13.379> points<00:02:13.799> though<00:02:13.980> I

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
on that part but my five points though I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.509 
on that part but my five points though I
don't<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.689> explained<00:02:16.110> um<00:02:16.349> yeah<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.069> kind

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.520 
don't know it explained um yeah I kind
of<00:02:17.579> thought<00:02:17.640> he<00:02:17.879> said<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.599> found<00:02:19.260> things

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
of thought he said of it I found things

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.069 
of thought he said of it I found things
really<00:02:20.040> difficult<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.549> kill<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.090> again<00:02:21.840> with

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
really difficult to kill and again with

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.319 
really difficult to kill and again with
the<00:02:22.409> pits<00:02:22.829> not<00:02:23.069> registering<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.939> would<00:02:24.150> usually

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
the pits not registering I would usually

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.080 
the pits not registering I would usually
find<00:02:24.540> fights<00:02:25.290> lasting<00:02:25.920> quite<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> while<00:02:26.760> and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
find fights lasting quite a while and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.270 
find fights lasting quite a while and
he'd<00:02:27.959> find<00:02:28.170> them<00:02:28.260> quite<00:02:28.440> difficult<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.010> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
he'd find them quite difficult and that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.890 
he'd find them quite difficult and that
was<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.700> annoying<00:02:29.909> I<00:02:30.239> didn't<00:02:30.480> find<00:02:30.659> things

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
was really annoying I didn't find things

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.490 
was really annoying I didn't find things
like<00:02:31.019> that

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
like that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.000 
like that
down<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.099> my<00:02:32.250> draft<00:02:32.489> like<00:02:32.760> um<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.620> don't<00:02:34.739> know

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
down in my draft like um so I don't know

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.559 
down in my draft like um so I don't know
I'm<00:02:35.310> gonna<00:02:35.430> compare<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.000> draft<00:02:36.239> light<00:02:36.420> as

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
I'm gonna compare to the draft light as

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.000 
I'm gonna compare to the draft light as
well<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:36.989> they're<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> only<00:02:37.379> two<00:02:37.650> staff

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
well because they're the only two staff

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:47.449 
well because they're the only two staff
magic<00:02:38.879> uses<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:46.019> wouldn't<00:02:46.769> say<00:02:46.829> too<00:02:46.890> difficult

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
magic uses I wouldn't say too difficult

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.030 
magic uses I wouldn't say too difficult
I<00:02:47.579> was<00:02:47.760> usually<00:02:48.079> surviving<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.799> just

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
I was usually surviving and I just

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.920 
I was usually surviving and I just
wasn't<00:02:50.220> able<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.549> kill<00:02:50.760> anything<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.480> was

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
wasn't able to kill anything I was

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
wasn't able to kill anything I was
usually<00:02:52.049> able<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.440> go<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.609> was<00:02:53.700> jumping

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
usually able to go I think I was jumping

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.520 
usually able to go I think I was jumping
too<00:02:54.180> quickly<00:02:54.450> into<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> next<00:02:55.109> series<00:02:55.260> by

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
too quickly into the next series by

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.339 
too quickly into the next series by
phone<00:02:55.739> by<00:02:56.159> some<00:02:56.430> bosses<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:57.180> dungeons<00:02:57.900> slow

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
phone by some bosses and dungeons slow

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.259 
phone by some bosses and dungeons slow
to<00:02:58.590> kill<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.519> think<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.849> was<00:02:59.940> quite

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
to kill and I think that was quite

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.750 
to kill and I think that was quite
annoying<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:01.109> very<00:03:01.409> wait<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.549> was<00:03:02.639> gonna

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
annoying and very wait if I was gonna

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.940 
annoying and very wait if I was gonna
have<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.940> final<00:03:03.359> Judah<00:03:03.599> for<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.989> guy<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.470> I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
have a final Judah for this guy and I

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.369 
have a final Judah for this guy and I
reckon<00:03:05.670> he's<00:03:05.819> fun<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.269> think<00:03:06.780> he's<00:03:06.870> good<00:03:07.049> crowd

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
reckon he's fun I think he's good crowd

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.759 
reckon he's fun I think he's good crowd
control<00:03:07.859> I<00:03:08.150> think<00:03:09.150> he's<00:03:09.450> well<00:03:09.840> optimized<00:03:10.500> when

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
control I think he's well optimized when

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.879 
control I think he's well optimized when
he's<00:03:10.950> playing<00:03:11.250> with<00:03:11.370> other<00:03:11.549> characters<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
he's playing with other characters I

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.110 
he's playing with other characters I
usually<00:03:13.889> find<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.190> more<00:03:14.340> fun<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:14.819> way<00:03:14.970> as

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
usually find it more fun that way as

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.470 
usually find it more fun that way as
well

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
well

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.569 
well
but<00:03:15.959> I'm<00:03:16.019> compared<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.799> my<00:03:16.889> draft<00:03:17.129> late<00:03:17.340> where

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
but I'm compared to my draft late where

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.339 
but I'm compared to my draft late where
I<00:03:17.609> can<00:03:17.790> usually<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.269> go<00:03:18.449> and<00:03:18.690> fly<00:03:18.989> into

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
I can usually just go and fly into

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.110 
I can usually just go and fly into
dungeons<00:03:19.919> and<00:03:20.099> fly<00:03:20.310> back<00:03:20.519> out<00:03:20.699> of<00:03:20.760> them<00:03:20.940> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
dungeons and fly back out of them and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.580 
dungeons and fly back out of them and
wipe<00:03:21.299> them<00:03:21.480> out<00:03:21.569> within<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:22.049> couple<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.500> minutes

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
wipe them out within a couple of minutes

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.009 
wipe them out within a couple of minutes
I<00:03:22.980> wasn't<00:03:23.609> able<00:03:23.699> to<00:03:23.819> do<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.269> my<00:03:24.480> fake

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
I wasn't able to do that with my fake

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
different that we have to use this guide

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.449 
different that we have to use this guide
like<00:03:52.680> everyone<00:03:53.040> else<00:03:53.190> but<00:03:53.489> yeah<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.569> unique

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
like everyone else but yeah is unique

that's the best I can describe the

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.399 
that's the best I can describe the
fittest<00:03:57.930> matrix<00:03:58.349> that<00:03:58.500> he<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:58.769> very<00:03:59.220> unique

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
fittest matrix that he is very unique
