00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
it I think that's really great because

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.070 
it I think that's really great because
I've<00:02:16.350> watched<00:02:16.680> kids<00:02:17.040> kids<00:02:17.670> learn<00:02:18.240> from<00:02:18.750> doing

I've watched kids kids learn from doing
these<00:02:19.260> things<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.740> they<00:02:19.920> carry<00:02:20.220> these<00:02:20.460> values

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
these things and they carry these values

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.540 
these things and they carry these values
into<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.690> future<00:02:21.960> so<00:02:22.290> they<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.770> create<00:02:23.100> great

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
into the future so they can create great

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.610 
into the future so they can create great
communities<00:02:24.150> when<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.750> on<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
communities when they go on and the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
communities when they go on and the

the<00:02:27.630> fresh<00:02:27.840> produce<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.610> win-win<00:02:29.790> when

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the fresh produce so it's a win-win when

unto others as we would want done unto
us<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:39.960> great<00:02:40.170> solutions

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
us and I just think great solutions

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.010 
us and I just think great solutions
