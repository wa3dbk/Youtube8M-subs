00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 as announced today comes a little 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.180
 spring cleaning video and I will be you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.160
 Do not just show what I'm doing 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.290
 About my body reasonably summer 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.969
 to do it, but you too 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.799
 another two impressions of 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.260
 few products give a small one here 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.810
 because he asked me to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.119
 but we start with a peeling 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.550
 i use the sugarcrm body scrub in the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.470
 moment totally like that comes from soap in 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.840
 glory i'll have you alot 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.470
 that's because it 's such a typical thing 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.520
 youtube product is it smells 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 fantastic me because it really looks 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.010
 not appealing but that's it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.719
 so much the better and I am very fast 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750
 very convinced of the product 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.030
 costs 20 euros but it really counts 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.610
 very nice the consistency is pretty 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.469
 tough holds the candy mass and the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.870
 peeling granules are pretty crude and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.840
 Big means it was already very intense 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.550
 but I like it very much sometimes and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.730
 I am from the smell as I said 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.680
 I absolutely love the number two 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.530
 use a bodylotion and that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.560
 balea brakes mango bodylotion from the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 This summer is a very 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.020
 beautiful body lotion costs around 150 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.509
 she is not very strong 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.820
 caring so not very rich 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.220
 but she pulls very nice fast 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.500
 the consistency is relatively fluid 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.299
 but I think for the price it is 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.070
 still a really good body lotion 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.650
 and it's fun to use them 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.200
 she can recommend you 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.490
 Step 3 I wash my hair 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.380
 for a shampoo and what a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.820
 flushing uses that you know 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.290
 probably best i use 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.240
 Today the shampoo of Elvis' Tal des 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.460
 antifa break shampoo and the col 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.750
 conditioner that something splendidly long 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.149
 but I probably something more 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.060
 the hak watch will be interesting 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.240
 is the aussies backlash reconstruction 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.090
 haarkur and it costs 7 95 is new in the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.579
 assortment is a bit different 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.259
 and well , I do not have that much 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.060
 So, say the only thing I can do about it 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.070
 I complain about the smell, the carbon 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.290
 pretty extreme about chewing gum what easy 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.119
 not my thing is otherwise she cares 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.810
 but very nice I have her as said 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.690
 now only one used twice 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.890
 It is really only a first impression me 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.540
 you will find something at first glance 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.970
 to be overpriced and honest 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.349
 but well, look like that 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.720
 few weeks will look like when I see them 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.180
 I have tested more often 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.069
 By the way, hair has a turban with the hak 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.680
 watch in the hair to make them a little better 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.330
 the next step moves in 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.550
 use a face mask that makes 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.069
 i like this during jaguar in the hair 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.750
 bit moves in and it is not really 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.690
 so easy a matching face mask too 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.630
 those are the moment I am like that 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.299
 from teste and I try moment very much 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.010
 like the balea face masks from today 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.140
 I use the pampering mask that is 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.480
 a strawberry mask I believe this too 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.920
 relatively new i do not even know me 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.500
 I was very satisfied with the mask 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.170
 costs 45 cents very nice I care 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.090
 needed after that no face cream 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.410
 judge wonderful plastic strawberry 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.750
 I'm totally on it 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.190
 and a little tip for you if 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.410
 Do it a bit more professional than 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.900
 I want to do you can great the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.209
 Apply mask with a make up brush 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.609
 with a flat foundation brush too 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.019
 Make beauticians feel that way 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.690
 It's a little different 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.880
 very nice, by the way, as you would 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.160
 really fondle you with a feather 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.109
 and yes the eyes and the lips partie 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.810
 of course you save that is you 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.459
 probably already in the meantime 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.930
 I made my little toe me 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.209
 I wanted you one more product 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.489
 fast also imagine from my Ford 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.829
 last hall the stick lembke that is 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.750
 green tea with ginger and lemon and he 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.139
 tastes so fantastic I was 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.090
 skeptical was not so little for that 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.859
 One topic was not so many people in it 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.810
 18 pieces but I almost got it 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.090
 drunk because I really like him so delicious 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.670
 find and green tea it can be very healthy 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.230
 I only recommend you 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.819
 the next step is one on the me 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.230
 can not do without the 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.209
 to share hair if I do not do it 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.590
 I look like a scarecrow as 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.810
 I would have plugged in the socket and 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.340
 that's not over the top and you 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.049
 Get back this one today 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.150
 small first impression of the dispute 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:12.459
 beach nothing from got to be packaging 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.829
 and smell fantastic but to be honest 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.639
 the rest does not matter to me at all 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.019
 like 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.000
 So first of all 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.799
 I have your four products needs around 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.060
 Any result on mine 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.610
 to be able to see hair 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.080
 and when she is so beautifully fastened 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.729
 were and a little bit 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.970
 more coherent and defined 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:34.509
 They looked extremely sticky 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.009
 somehow very firm and felt like 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.039
 I would have used foam stabilizer but 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.610
 not a very good foam maker 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.960
 and it costs 495 I 've been recently 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.360
 with the award missed a bit 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.849
 you have five euros for the spray and me 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.470
 First of all, that would save you that 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.180
 money but I will use it in the next 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.770
 a little more testing and weeks 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.909
 I hope I can do it a bit 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.069
 say more about it 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.470
 By the way, that's how the spray looks 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.810
 extremely compressed and I like that 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.789
 not too good either 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.539
 yes but as I said smell and packaging 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.219
 pull a totally looks great 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.050
 thick feeling I can do these days 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:13.259
 no longer abandon this 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.659
 angeles lips crÃªpes has me totally 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.490
 I love it it costs 10 euro 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.990
 but it will last you for a long time 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.550
 So now it has eight months for me 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.409
 passed soon, it is empty 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.960
 Unfortunately , I will definitely 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.919
 buy and by the way a small tip 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.900
 if you are such a lip piercing 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.550
 to make your own home 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.509
 just a teaspoon of sugar with 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.460
 about half a teaspoon 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.710
 sunflower oil then you have a great 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.440
 nourishing product and everyone has 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.300
 probably the ingredients at home and 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.610
 Of course, as a last step optional 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.169
 only if you both want to grow 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.479
 I have it the next day 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.159
 I would not recommend you 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.250
 to shower then use body lotion 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.990
 and only then grow because the 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.580
 Body lotion will prevent that from happening 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.520
 Apply stripes to skin well 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.050
 so it's best to shower and that's it 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.219
 the skin dries off well and then you can 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.289
 you start growing 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:04.690
 yes, so see this blowing cold white 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.800
 stripes are the ones for the legs 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.180
 the big green ones 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 they will be between your hands 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.479
 warmed up after a real time 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.770
 annoying if you do that frequently 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.900
 must and it takes a long time 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.580
 but still gives you a lot of effort 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.990
 because I think it makes real 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.940
 big difference always only ten or 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.919
 Rubs on the strip for 30 seconds 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.710
 they just stick better in the skin 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.930
 if you have warmed up nicely you 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.109
 are pulled apart and then on 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.859
 the skin glued 

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:31.419
 you do not need too much 

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:32.919
 German press when warmed up well 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.969
 then it just extends only over it 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.249
 to delete 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.549
 then they are deducted that is the 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:41.109
 funniest part of the whole 

00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:44.139
 Do not be compelled by the 

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:45.609
 media or by anyone that applies 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.949
 especially for the last video I 

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:51.339
 have done that only if you have it 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.619
 really want these towels for 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:55.239
 they look like they said afterwards 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.589
 wont remove them again 

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:59.249
 last bugs reste and are one 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.249
 really good idea 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:03.909
 Well maybe I have the one or 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:05.799
 others so much for it 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:07.599
 can make even the little ones 

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:09.819
 to make spring cleaning I tell you it 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:12.879
 First of all, doing your head well, of course 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:14.679
 also the body but it makes easy 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:16.299
 huge fun just when you like that 

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:18.489
 maybe doing a girls' evening 

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:22.259
 and that's exactly what I wish you a lot 

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:22.259
 fun and thank you for watching
