paid $5.99 for each of the individual

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.439 
paid $5.99 for each of the individual
shadow<00:00:25.260> pans<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.279> then<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.970> had<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.269> purchase

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
shadow pans and then I had to purchase

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.019 
shadow pans and then I had to purchase
the<00:00:27.779> Z<00:00:28.019> palette<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.680> put<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> pans<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the Z palette to put the pans in and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.040 
the Z palette to put the pans in and
this<00:00:30.869> small<00:00:31.260> Z<00:00:31.619> palette<00:00:31.830> cost<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.790> believe

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
this small Z palette cost I believe

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.930 
this small Z palette cost I believe
$14.99<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:34.860> correct<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.760> I'm

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
$14.99 if I'm correct about if I'm

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
$14.99 if I'm correct about if I'm
incorrect<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:36.630> any<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> prices<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.649> will

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
incorrect about any of the prices I will

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
incorrect about any of the prices I will
put<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> screen<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.790> believe<00:00:39.059> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
put it on the screen but I believe that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.190 
put it on the screen but I believe that
was<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> price<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.210> Z<00:00:42.390> palette<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.050> my

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
was the price so the Z palette in my

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
was the price so the Z palette in my
opinion<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.620> pretty<00:00:43.860> expensive<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
opinion is pretty expensive but I I

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.180 
opinion is pretty expensive but I I
think<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.050> way<00:00:46.649> they're<00:00:46.829> priced

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
think that's just the way they're priced

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
think that's just the way they're priced
because<00:00:47.610> when<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.329> went<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.629> amazon.com<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
because when I went on amazon.com to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
because when I went on amazon.com to
check<00:00:50.100> pricing<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:51.000> Z<00:00:51.180> pallets<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:51.899> I've

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
check pricing for Z pallets which I've

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
check pricing for Z pallets which I've
never<00:00:52.230> purchased<00:00:52.770> before<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> didn't

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
never purchased before so I didn't

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.400 
never purchased before so I didn't
realize<00:00:53.850> they're<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:55.050> even<00:00:55.289> more

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
realize they're actually even more

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.080 
realize they're actually even more
expensive<00:00:55.710> than<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.550> empty<00:00:56.850> matte

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
expensive than just like an empty matte

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.290 
expensive than just like an empty matte
palette<00:00:57.829> but<00:00:58.829> anyway<00:00:59.539> with<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.570> being<00:01:00.960> said

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
palette but anyway with that being said

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.080 
palette but anyway with that being said
the<00:01:03.300> shadows<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:04.049> awesome<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.850> try<00:01:06.030> to

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
texture not a lot of fall out when I

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.770

about<00:05:50.350> like<00:05:50.770> lorac<00:05:51.160> shadows<00:05:52.060> like<00:05:52.720> lorac<00:05:53.080> Pro

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
about like lorac shadows like lorac Pro

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.230 
about like lorac shadows like lorac Pro
palette<00:05:53.410> that<00:05:53.980> has<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.280> lot<00:05:54.490> of<00:05:54.610> Fallout<00:05:54.880> to<00:05:55.060> me

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
palette that has a lot of Fallout to me

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.820

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
so this in comparison to something like

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.390 
so this in comparison to something like
that<00:05:57.040> it<00:05:57.220> doesn't<00:05:57.370> have<00:05:57.550> a<00:05:57.610> lot<00:05:57.790> of<00:05:57.910> Fallout<00:05:59.400> to
