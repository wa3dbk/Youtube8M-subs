now<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.710> is<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.650 

yeah<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.400> act<00:03:47.640> out<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.880> power<00:03:48.270> there's<00:03:48.600> a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
yeah you act out that power there's a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.750 
yeah you act out that power there's a
lot<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.930> power<00:03:49.110> ground<00:03:49.470> there's<00:03:49.710> 130<00:03:50.250> LEDs

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
lot of power ground there's 130 LEDs

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.680

okay

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
okay

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.360 
okay
and<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.170> requires<00:03:52.440> log<00:03:52.710> power<00:03:52.980> and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
and that requires log power and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.790 
and that requires log power and
apparently<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.090> automation<00:03:54.660> controller<00:03:55.050> so

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
apparently with automation controller so

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.080
