00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.460
 I 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.520
 hello friends and friends of youtube 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.760
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.710
 realized by altair this tutorial is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.279
 the second and last part for the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.290
 remaining four gta 5 cabins where there is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.970
 I will tell all the best choices for the 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.890
 team selection and type of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 approach to get the most 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.910
 gain from these robberies 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.090
 so now call the talk and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.820
 let's start the tutorial then the second one 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
 robbery is the merryweather blow but 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.290
 as you well know it is a total fiasco 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.690
 and no gain is obtained from the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.640
 mission so we omit this 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.580
 inconvenience and let's move on 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.380
 now before starting the third robbery 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.810
 I recommend finding Italian 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.220
 martinez who will serve us for the fourth e 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.440
 fifth robbery 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.810
 his location is shown on the map 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.200
 possibly go to the place with three 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.200
 hours 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 Yes No 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.640
 do not lose too much during the journey 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.450
 Italian time could die for the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.040
 serious injuries he has reported 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.450
 in the incident 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.450
 so do the push 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.670
 which are innocent 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.579
 but c 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.979
 very well now let's move on to the third robbery 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.710
 or the trophy shot 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.869
 here the only member of the team 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.360
 select them will be the king mcqueen while 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.050
 the type of approach is the same for everyone 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.200
 the final gain amounts to 450 thousand 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.330
 dollars the next robbery broke 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.000
 at the bureau the kind of approach from 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.400
 choose will be the VIP or access from 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.550
 roof while as team members 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.730
 we must select luca with meagher 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.050
 richard rules as a marksman 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.160
 finally Italian martina 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.430
 the final gain 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.170
 around $ 180,000 now like 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.390
 this and the last robbery we have the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.340
 great shot to carry out this mission 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.530
 it is not at all easy to conclude 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.690
 in fact I will show you the highlights 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.820
 of robbery giving me advice that I don't 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.610
 should ignore in order to let go 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.740
 all smooth without too many people like 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.600
 approach we choose that of strength to 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.860
 regarding the team the choices do not 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.270
 will be the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.560
 but from the probes to get the most 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.560
 small gain 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.140
 so we can for Italian martinez 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.209
 that in dance the region richard standards 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.129
 after completing a robbery 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.230
 the final earnings will look at millions of 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.700
 dollars for each character the money 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.700
 obtainable only at the end of the game 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.299
 as I anticipated you before now vi 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.310
 I will show pieces of the robbery 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.840
 what we are going to meet 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.879
 after loading two carts of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 There are lots of gold bars 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.450
 shootings where we have to give our best 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.450
 of us not to die 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.979
 I have already described her husband 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.070
 once the machine is reached, it does not 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.270
 we have to do nothing but direct c 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.270
 parking nearby 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.330
 what the fancy starlets are 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.199
 to work launch from the ramp e 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.199
 fled 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:51.749
 Finally one last suggestion later rope 

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:53.609
 I tell you to protect promptly and 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:56.429
 adequately half the helicopter 

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:58.259
 Italian because while you run away you will come 

00:05:56.429 --> 00:06:01.129
 attacked and could be torn down 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.719
 losing a large amount of co 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.399
 but don't worry, it's not something 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.479
 impossible i'm sure there 

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:07.479
 you will succeed on the first attempt 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.040
 the tutorial has come to an end 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.919
 I hope it was useful for you 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.240
