how<00:01:20.280> much<00:01:20.430> that'll<00:01:20.670> affect<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.479> don't<00:01:22.259> have

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
how much that'll affect it I don't have

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.070 
how much that'll affect it I don't have
much<00:01:22.500> space<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> SSD<00:01:23.220> left<00:01:23.549> though<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
much space on the SSD left though so you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.390 
much space on the SSD left though so you
have<00:01:25.200> 16<00:01:25.560> gigabytes<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.100> RAM<00:01:26.369> GTX<00:01:27.860> 970<00:01:28.860> m<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
have 16 gigabytes of RAM GTX 970 m and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
have 16 gigabytes of RAM GTX 970 m and
the<00:01:30.079> 4710<00:01:31.079> processor<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> game<00:01:34.049> looks

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the 4710 processor so the game looks

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.140 
the 4710 processor so the game looks
great<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> water<00:01:34.829> looks<00:01:35.189> amazing<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> grass

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
great the water looks amazing the grass

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.840 
great the water looks amazing the grass
looks<00:01:36.450> pretty<00:01:36.689> cool<00:01:36.900> up<00:01:37.079> close<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.530> believe<00:01:37.850> or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
looks pretty cool up close I believe or

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.460 
looks pretty cool up close I believe or
is<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> same<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.659> can't<00:01:39.930> tell<00:01:40.110> something

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
is this the same I can't tell something

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.410 
is this the same I can't tell something
just<00:01:40.619> looks<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.040> different<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.520> me

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.580 

so<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.659> were<00:01:48.750> hoping<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.110> play<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
so if you were hoping to play the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.890 
so if you were hoping to play the
shaders<00:01:49.920> mod<00:01:49.970> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.000> definitely<00:01:51.479> play<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.810> I

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
shaders mod you can definitely play it I

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.110 
shaders mod you can definitely play it I
mean<00:01:52.080> it's<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.500> playable<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.909> like

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
mean it's not as playable as some like
