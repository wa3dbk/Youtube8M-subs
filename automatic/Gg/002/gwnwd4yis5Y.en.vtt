00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.900
 my name is tom schmidt i am 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.700
 Native North Rhine-Westphalia I come 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.960
 from East Westphalia and have lived for 30 years 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.189
 In Rhineland I think I bring too 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.080
 both a bit with the 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.090
 East Westphalian stubbornness and the 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.800
 joie de vivre from rheinland am 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.830
 married has four children and one 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.610
 grandchildren have been living in Bonn for a long time now 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.530
 works for 30 years in the 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.030
 municipal politics so I know like him 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.290
 and ground the municipal clock 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.330
 I think that's a piece of cake, too 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.489
 my qualifications and that motivates 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.750
 me also my hometown bonn this 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.530
 Now it has become a bit far 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.970
 advance 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.979
 I think I want a city with you 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.510
 a lot of potential and me 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.519
 believe the city is actually under 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.440
 their possibilities and that's why mine 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.690
 Being motivation and b is after 30 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.220
 years on the political side now 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.780
 even a piece in the administration so 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.549
 to organize that want his 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.930
 potential really exhausted and that 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.560
 What makes it good? 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.510
 can do 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.340
 with this job the op connects 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.470
 also just a management are 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.090
 over 4000 employees is so very 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.439
 important part of the post one says 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.790
 always the company is as good as 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.860
 his staff also applies to the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.810
 I think that city is important to us 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.369
 to create greater permeability 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.439
 not directly concerned so I'm fine 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.060
 because the good ideas are everywhere 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.259
 in the administration there are that on 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.030
 find the way up to the 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.890
 realization so I imagine 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.750
 flat hierarchies high 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.600
 self-responsibility but also clear 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.820
 distribution who has to answer for what 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.109
 In addition we need more guides 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.039
 I did not believe that last year 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.630
 so happened 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.829
 that means the management board has to 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.179
 like a group executive board the 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.740
 overall responsibility together with the 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.119
 mayor take the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.859
 mayor takes the deputy 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.329
 very serious but also the boss and 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.679
 must say when it matters also there 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.840
 it is long so I imagine that before 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.100
 I think my advantage is that me 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.020
 actually no major training period 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.640
 I need to know this for 30 years 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.380
 administration and this policy here in the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.729
 city ​​from the effeff and i can am 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.689
 The first day was the first thing I did 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.340
 is gonna do 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.380
 I'll get the heads together 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.330
 and tell everyone to say something 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.160
 a ten major projects in his 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.620
 Department are because what we have to do 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.150
 is we have to focus on that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.100
 important projects are too much in the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.360
 no one knows what's going on 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.970
 other power must focus on us 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.590
 need to apply our money efficiently and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.360
 this is important politically to me are the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.100
 especially the points future bonn me 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.270
 as a federal city, it's all in particular 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.400
 the un instead 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.260
 it's about the theme of living space we have 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.209
 too little living space the people reasonable 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.159
 to bring and it deals with third 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.480
 the topic of care and education is there 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.069
 it is especially about the care in the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.780
 kindergarten area but also in the ogs 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.819
 area these are the focal points 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.170
 I would tackle immediately and I believe 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.709
 that's what's hanging behind, too 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.319
 should stay 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.540
 our household has a dimension of 11 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.370
 billion and basically has three big ones 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.290
 blocks that once and the personnel costs 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.720
 which make up about 300 million 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.579
 the 2000 transfers the approximately 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.900
 Make up 280 million and it is the 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.640
 expenses the city, so to speak 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.170
 that's the third big one 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.090
 block also in the order of about 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.370
 400 million if you have the household 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.510
 you have to renovate these big ones 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.950
 blocks drangehen it does not go with it 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.209
 small individual measures are also 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.920
 But I have to look forward to the big blocks 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.299
 go to it and I have to believe 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.560
 especially first of all to the 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.569
 personnel costs go to it 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.340
 we will not be able to afford that 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.989
 the city more and more from her by her 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.250
 Total share of personnel costs 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.440
 that means we have to go with the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.599
 staff costs come down second 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.549
 point expenses the administration 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.900
 itself has also shortened 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.190
 are the last few years ever 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.930
 I think we can get there 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.609
 to accept a significant reduction 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.959
 third are the transfer performance after 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.389
 outside we can only partly 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.040
 determine because the partially legally 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.720
 but they are partly fixed 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.120
 a way and the order of magnitude 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.889
 definitely to be determined and there must apply 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.419
 that we work impact-oriented 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.370
 that means we have to watch with 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.810
 which issues we can also 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.099
 really achieve the effect around 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.579
 people become more independent again 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.109
 do 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.879
 even to bring in work 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.959
 even as force to raise itself 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.949
 to vote financially 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.019
 actually the three most important 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.669
 blocks that you have since you have to answer 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.889
 1 must be clear to everyone 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:05.139
 We will not continue like this 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.910
 We have to reduce our services 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.859
 need to make do with less in the future 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.269
 this is the requirement with bond 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.739
 remains autonomous municipal politics 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.660
 even decide on it yourself 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.609
 may like this city in the future 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.829
 is designed if this 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.090
 election period around is the people in the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.440
 afterwards think about what is 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.909
 actually now in the last five years 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.710
 what happened is in the bunch 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:26.349
 change then I would like that 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.470
 People think the distance between those 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.360
 up there who do the politics and the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.620
 those who think down there think oh 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.449
 can not do anything about that 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.970
 I would like to reduce that people 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.490
 better understand how politics in bonn 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.030
 why money is spent for what 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.580
 will and 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.470
 It's fun to get involved in Bonn 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.690
 as a citizen and that makes sense too 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.520
 because what are the citizens of this 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.110
 Mayor also noticed and 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.160
 has been implemented I have yes 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.560
 in fact theology and philosophy 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.240
 studied and that also influenced me 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.290
 in my life i believe it comes in 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.500
 live on values 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.420
 and what is my conviction that it is the 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.160
 Deep conviction is not measured 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.930
 how well someone can explain 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.870
 but alone with what he does 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.280
 does and that's why I say in the end 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.440
 always on what one has done 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.060
 and not what someone said that is 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.260
 For me, I believe the motto I choose 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.890
 also tried my own trade and 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.890
 do to judge
