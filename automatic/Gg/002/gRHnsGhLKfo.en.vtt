 the pharmacy I present the pre-bases 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.010
 regenerants also known as 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.900
 booster is a new generation of 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.600
 products that prepare and improve the

 treatment that is applied after are 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.120
 very technical products so this 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.920
 video is not going to be easy I can not 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.649
 explain how a test works without 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.110
 use technical terms if you like 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.629
 cosmetics you will love what it does 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.969
 a pre-base is to improve the state of 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.190
 epithelial cells producing a 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.140
 direct effect on them by improving their 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.989
 been above all his level of 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.760
 hydration and an indirect effect on 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.800
 the cosmetic treatment that is applied to 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.829
 continuation that will act and penetrate 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.139
 better on an optimized skin enhancing 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.789
 well and increasing its effectiveness it 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:00.559
 characterize prebases for their 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.510
 excellent biocompatibility with 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.370
 human tissues that allow you to moisturize 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.620
 nourish and regenerate the skin until its 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.630
 deeper layers his formula is 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.330
 biodegradable the active ingredients are 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.770
 degrade into amino acids 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.290
 cells are used for their feeding 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.360
 basic without additives without waste without 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.610
 non-comedogenic dyes and silicones 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.100
 Regenerative tests of 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.100
 biomimetics are a unique product today in 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.080
 Spain there are no other brands have been 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.030
 for me a find his kindness and his 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.430
 powerful effects reside in your

 uses technology based on 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.840
 polymers the same system of 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.310
 vehiculization of active principles that 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.000
 Many medications 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.370
 unai more of more and incredible that contains 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.020
 in the formula nothing is because if everything 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.170
 what it contains is in the formula of

 intentionally contains a hydrogel 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.990
 crosslinked hyaluronic acid and acid 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.820
 polyglot mico crisscrossed by in 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.260
 china 'that make it a serum of

 penetration and contains principles 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.780
 dwarf active polymer micelles in the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.120
 which are encapsulated these polymers are 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.739
 house and move in hydrogen to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.500
 be lipo rows and nanometer size 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.110
 very very very small for being an elevated 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.850
 to traverse the cell membranes 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.860
 what attached to its biodegradable character 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.110
 facilitates a controlled release of 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.750
 active principle the cell is capable of 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.610
 use them as of today there are two 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.670

 something that matures centes us 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.489
 it worries a lot you notice the effect from 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.489
 the first day see you soon
