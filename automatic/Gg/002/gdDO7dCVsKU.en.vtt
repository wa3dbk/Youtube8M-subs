00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.429 
Duty ever I think it's definitely going
to<00:04:34.669> change<00:04:34.939> the<00:04:35.180> way<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.659> eSports<00:04:36.199> for

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:36.439

to change the way that the eSports for
the<00:04:36.500> game<00:04:36.680> work<00:04:36.949> i<00:04:37.129> think<00:04:37.159> is<00:04:37.310> going<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.490> be

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
the game work i think is going to be

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.450 
the game work i think is going to be
very<00:04:37.789> very<00:04:37.909> fast<00:04:38.360> paced<00:04:38.780> i<00:04:39.080> think<00:04:40.009> that<00:04:40.340> the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
very very fast paced i think that the
