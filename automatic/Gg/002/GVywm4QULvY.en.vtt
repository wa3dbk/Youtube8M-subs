00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.630 
neck tightness from working long hours
at<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> computer<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.520> get

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
at a computer so what I'm going to get

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
at a computer so what I'm going to get
you<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.969> do<00:00:36.090> Nicola<00:00:36.450> sister<00:00:36.840> come<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> bed

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
you to do Nicola sister come up the bed

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.639 
you to do Nicola sister come up the bed
for<00:00:37.920> me<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.219> bit<00:00:38.899> keep<00:00:39.899> coming<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.350> until

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
for me a little bit keep coming up until

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
for me a little bit keep coming up until
you<00:00:40.739> shoulder<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> top<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you shoulder all the way to the top of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.549 
you shoulder all the way to the top of
the<00:00:42.329> bed<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.410> back<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the bed and just back there so this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.760 
the bed and just back there so this
technique<00:00:46.980> focuses<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.850> muscles<00:00:48.770> what

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
technique focuses on on muscles what

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
technique focuses on on muscles what
we're<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.160> doing<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.579> doing<00:00:50.789> some

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
we're going to be doing is doing some

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
we're going to be doing is doing some
manual<00:00:51.989> work<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> muscles<00:00:52.770> from<00:00:53.340> general

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
manual work on the muscles from general

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
manual work on the muscles from general
massage<00:00:54.090> mode<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.289> massage<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
massage mode that is we massage the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.990 
massage mode that is we massage the
muscle<00:00:56.160> we're<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> generally

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
muscle we're just going to generally

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.940 
muscle we're just going to generally
start<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.390> stretch<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.899> muscle<00:00:58.230> out

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.219 

so<00:01:09.580> what<00:01:09.729> this<00:01:09.850> technique<00:01:10.270> allows<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.930> do<00:01:11.080> is

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
so what this technique allows to do is

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.530 
so what this technique allows to do is
to<00:01:11.439> feel<00:01:11.710> how<00:01:11.950> muscle<00:01:12.460> feels<00:01:12.640> as<00:01:12.970> we<00:01:13.119> start<00:01:13.420> to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
to feel how muscle feels as we start to

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.980 
to feel how muscle feels as we start to
stretch<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.140> muscle<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:16.299> resistance<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:16.960> a

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
stretch the muscle the resistance of a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.960 
stretch the muscle the resistance of a
muscle<00:01:17.649> to<00:01:18.009> that<00:01:18.159> movement<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.729> very

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
muscle to that movement is very

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.660 
muscle to that movement is very
important<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:20.080> really<00:01:20.890> uncovering<00:01:21.399> how<00:01:21.610> the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
important in really uncovering how the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:34.630 
important in really uncovering how the
health<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.270> that<00:01:22.330> muscle<00:01:27.600> how's<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.810> feel

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.160 

so<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.820> we're<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.000> doing<00:01:36.120> at<00:01:36.480> any<00:01:36.630> time<00:01:36.900> here

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
so what we're not doing at any time here

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
so what we're not doing at any time here
is<00:01:37.350> moving<00:01:37.970> beyond<00:01:38.970> where<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> patient<00:01:39.660> is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is moving beyond where the patient is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.020 
is moving beyond where the patient is
comfortable<00:01:40.220> we're<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.370> applying<00:01:41.550> any<00:01:41.790> more

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
comfortable we're not applying any more

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.820 
comfortable we're not applying any more
pressure<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.630> comfortable<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> very

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
pressure is comfortable so it's a very

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.220 
pressure is comfortable so it's a very
gentle<00:01:44.100> technique<00:01:44.700> you're<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.750> effective

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
gentle technique you're very effective

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.320 
gentle technique you're very effective
at<00:01:46.380> helping<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.010> muscle<00:01:47.370> relax<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.090> grow

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
at helping that muscle relax and grow

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.170 
at helping that muscle relax and grow
longer<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.340> muscle<00:01:50.700> starts<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
longer and as that muscle starts to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.820 
longer and as that muscle starts to
release<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.840> patient's<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.440> feel<00:01:52.590> more

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
release the patient's going to feel more

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.290 
release the patient's going to feel more
comfortable<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.580> take<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> pressure<00:01:54.150> off

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
comfortable as we take the pressure off

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.520 
comfortable as we take the pressure off
the<00:01:54.450> joints<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.020> neck<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.990> technique<00:01:58.440> is

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the joints of the neck this technique is

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.770 
the joints of the neck this technique is
effective<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.310> areas<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> body<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.750> we

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
effective in all areas of the body so we

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.310 
effective in all areas of the body so we
use<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:02.000> from<00:02:03.000> neck<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.510> back<00:02:03.570> shoulder

one<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.050> other<00:02:22.200> advantages<00:02:22.710> this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
one of the other advantages this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.070 
one of the other advantages this
technique<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.520> through<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.570> treatment<00:02:24.990> we

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
technique is through the treatment we

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.720 
technique is through the treatment we
can<00:02:25.110> really<00:02:25.500> uncover<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.100> exactly<00:02:26.430> where<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
can really uncover the exactly where the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.000 
can really uncover the exactly where the
patient<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.180> time<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.720> means<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.830> never

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
patient is time that means we can never

the symptoms down down the arm it's a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.920 
the symptoms down down the arm it's a
very<00:03:57.130> safe<00:03:57.400> technique<00:03:57.880> for<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.180> woman<00:03:58.600> what

very safe technique for that woman what

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.420 
very safe technique for that woman what
we're<00:03:59.110> not<00:03:59.230> doing<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.620> performing<00:04:00.310> any

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
we're not doing is performing any

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.240 
we're not doing is performing any
manipulation<00:04:01.180> around<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.510> neck<00:04:01.740> really<00:04:02.740> in<00:04:03.130> a

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
manipulation around the neck really in a

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.400 
manipulation around the neck really in a
manipulation<00:04:03.790> you're<00:04:04.420> moving<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.990> joints

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
manipulation you're moving the joints

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.340 
manipulation you're moving the joints
beyond<00:04:05.920> where<00:04:06.160> they<00:04:06.280> naturally<00:04:06.850> move<00:04:07.350> with

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
beyond where they naturally move with

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.410 
beyond where they naturally move with
this<00:04:08.530> technique<00:04:08.920> we're<00:04:09.220> just<00:04:09.430> moving<00:04:09.670> as<00:04:10.120> far

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
this technique we're just moving as far

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.900 
this technique we're just moving as far
as<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.750> patient<00:04:11.170> can<00:04:11.350> comfortably<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.220> then

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
as the patient can comfortably and then

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.380 
as the patient can comfortably and then
returning<00:04:13.300> back<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.810> neutral<00:04:14.200> position

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
returning back to the neutral position

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.729 
returning back to the neutral position
through<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.450> repetition<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.350> movement

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
through the repetition of the movement

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.880 
through the repetition of the movement
with<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.040> muscle<00:04:18.370> is<00:04:18.459> crazy<00:04:18.760> in<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.150> release<00:04:19.890> so

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
with the muscle is crazy in a release so

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.380 
with the muscle is crazy in a release so
we'll<00:04:21.070> gradually<00:04:21.370> move<00:04:21.760> more<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.120> more

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
we'll gradually move more and more

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.060 
we'll gradually move more and more
through<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.930> course<00:04:23.170> the<00:04:23.350> treatment<00:04:23.800> but<00:04:23.950> at

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
through the course the treatment but at

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.520 
through the course the treatment but at

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
only the stage only moving as far as the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.180 
only the stage only moving as far as the
patient<00:04:26.710> can<00:04:27.090> contribute<00:04:28.090> tolerate<00:04:29.070> one<00:04:30.070> of

the advantages of treating necks in this
position<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.830> allows<00:04:33.250> exposure<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
position is it allows exposure to the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.960 
position is it allows exposure to the
whole<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.840> neck<00:04:35.100> when<00:04:36.100> when<00:04:36.520> you're<00:04:36.700> sort

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
whole of the neck when when you're sort

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.580 
whole of the neck when when you're sort
of<00:04:37.000> treating<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.420> neck<00:04:37.630> with<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.110> patient

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
of treating the neck with a patient

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.770 
of treating the neck with a patient
light<00:04:38.740> on<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:38.980> front<00:04:39.160> it's<00:04:39.430> very<00:04:39.640> hard<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.300> get

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
light on the front it's very hard to get

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.150 
light on the front it's very hard to get
to<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.020> muscles<00:04:41.380> around<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.680> front<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.100> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
to the muscles around the front of the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.040 
to the muscles around the front of the
net<00:04:42.370> muscles<00:04:43.210> around<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.510> from<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.870> neck

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
net muscles around the from the neck

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.920 
net muscles around the from the neck
also<00:04:44.500> get<00:04:44.770> very<00:04:45.010> tight<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.670> also<00:04:46.180> cause

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
also get very tight and also cause

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.350 
also get very tight and also cause
into<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.259> edge<00:04:47.350> of<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.590> jaw<00:04:51.060> so<00:04:52.060> in<00:04:52.240> this

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
into the edge of the jaw so in this

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.360 
into the edge of the jaw so in this
position<00:04:52.600> we<00:04:52.960> can<00:04:52.990> work<00:04:53.290> nicely<00:04:53.650> open<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.250> that

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
position we can work nicely open to that

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.450 
position we can work nicely open to that
angle<00:04:54.850> there<00:04:55.090> right<00:04:55.810> into<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.259> joint<00:04:57.250> between

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
angle there right into the joint between

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.029 
angle there right into the joint between
the<00:04:58.860> neck<00:04:59.860> and<00:04:59.889> the<00:05:00.130> skull<00:05:00.580> so<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:02.560> hope<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.919> can

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
the neck and the skull so I hope you can

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.890 
the neck and the skull so I hope you can
see<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.520> we've<00:05:03.789> started<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.210> really<00:05:04.479> loosen

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
see that we've started to really loosen

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.420 
see that we've started to really loosen
up<00:05:05.199> particularly<00:05:05.590> through<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.830> muscle<00:05:06.250> here

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
up particularly through the muscle here

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.610 
up particularly through the muscle here
which<00:05:06.580> is<00:05:06.759> the<00:05:06.850> upper<00:05:07.030> trapezius<00:05:07.210> muscle<00:05:07.960> we

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
which is the upper trapezius muscle we

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.409 
which is the upper trapezius muscle we
really<00:05:08.919> start<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.280> increase<00:05:09.639> that<00:05:09.970> movement

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
really start to increase that movement

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:28.250 
really start to increase that movement
there<00:05:11.370> how's<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:12.610> feel

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.530 

patients<00:05:29.100> will<00:05:29.220> often<00:05:29.370> notice<00:05:29.850> some<00:05:30.090> benefit

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
patients will often notice some benefit

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.930 
patients will often notice some benefit
from<00:05:30.780> treatment<00:05:31.340> even<00:05:32.340> after<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.670> first

increased<00:05:35.940> movement<00:05:36.380> after<00:05:37.380> three<00:05:37.920> or<00:05:37.950> four

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
increased movement after three or four

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.800 
increased movement after three or four
treatments<00:05:38.850> there<00:05:38.970> should<00:05:39.120> be<00:05:39.210> significant

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
treatments there should be significant
