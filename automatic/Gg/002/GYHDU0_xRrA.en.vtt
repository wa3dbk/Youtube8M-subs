00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
between the bindings here and here and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.419 
between the bindings here and here and
slightly<00:00:50.640> whipped<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.379> okay<00:00:52.379> lift<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.250> at

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429

the end on the tip and the tail this

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.079 
the end on the tip and the tail this
basically<00:00:55.530> helps<00:00:55.769> with<00:00:56.100> snowboarding<00:00:56.940> for

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
basically helps with snowboarding for

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.729 
basically helps with snowboarding for
freestyle<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.170> gives<00:00:58.379> them<00:00:58.499> a<00:00:58.559> little

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
freestyle because it gives them a little

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
freestyle because it gives them a little
bit<00:00:58.890> more<00:00:59.129> lift<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.670> they<00:01:00.089> don't<00:01:00.120> fold<00:01:00.449> over

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
bit more lift and they don't fold over

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.239 
bit more lift and they don't fold over
as<00:01:00.809> many<00:01:00.989> times<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.710> know<00:01:01.800> idiots

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
as many times so they don't know idiots

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.000 
as many times so they don't know idiots

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
this is what we cast as catch-free

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
technology they do again flat but this

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
technology they do again flat but this
some<00:01:49.469> rounds<00:01:49.770> rather<00:01:50.159> than<00:01:50.430> being<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.700> jib

the tip this contact point here is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.940 
the tip this contact point here is
lifted<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.539> aid<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:57.719> beginners<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.859> they

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
lifted up to aid with beginners so they

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
lifted up to aid with beginners so they
don't<00:01:59.130> fall<00:01:59.310> over<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.729> much<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.299> they<00:02:00.450> can

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
don't fall over so much and they can

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.539 
don't fall over so much and they can
actually<00:02:00.840> progress<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.380> snowboarding<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.340> lot

actually progress in snowboarding a lot

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.539 
actually progress in snowboarding a lot
quicker<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.079> has<00:02:04.289> again<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.340> same

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
quicker now this one has again the same

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.999 
quicker now this one has again the same
system<00:02:05.939> here<00:02:06.179> weight<00:02:07.020> variations<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:07.950> all

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
system here weight variations and all

system here weight variations and all
the<00:02:08.100> bits<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.310> pieces<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.729> need<00:02:08.910> now<00:02:09.210> we're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the bits and pieces we need now we're

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.120 
the bits and pieces we need now we're
the<00:02:09.479> beginners<00:02:09.899> board<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.649> similar<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.100> a

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
the beginners board very similar to a

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.500 
the beginners board very similar to a
freestyle<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.730> board<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.030> try<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:12.330> aim<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
freestyle is board we try and aim a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.940 
freestyle is board we try and aim a
little<00:02:12.750> bit<00:02:12.990> smaller<00:02:13.260> than<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.530> normal<00:02:13.620> board

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
little bit smaller than the normal board

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.440 
little bit smaller than the normal board
would<00:02:14.100> be<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.730> basically<00:02:15.030> gives<00:02:15.180> them<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
would be this basically gives them the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.630 
would be this basically gives them the
initiation<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.590> turn<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> lot<00:02:17.100> easier<00:02:17.460> so

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
initiation of a turn a lot easier so

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.860 
initiation of a turn a lot easier so
they<00:02:17.760> don't<00:02:17.940> have<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.210> worry<00:02:18.390> about<00:02:18.630> falling

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
they don't have to worry about falling

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.740 
they don't have to worry about falling
over

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
over

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.240 
over
gang<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.110> knocking<00:02:20.350> idiot<00:02:20.650> they<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.010> actually

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
gang of knocking idiot they can actually

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.120 
gang of knocking idiot they can actually
pick<00:02:21.370> up<00:02:21.460> smoking<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.880> lot<00:02:22.090> quicker<00:02:23.070> now<00:02:24.070> the

pick up smoking a lot quicker now the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.880 
pick up smoking a lot quicker now the
big<00:02:24.400> buzz<00:02:24.610> from<00:02:25.030> then<00:02:25.240> onwards<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:26.560> basically

its<00:03:40.960> Flex<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.710> a<00:03:41.740> lot<00:03:41.950> stiffer<00:03:42.310> than<00:03:42.640> the

have been going through okay

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.890 
have been going through okay
principally<00:03:46.120> because<00:03:46.300> you<00:03:46.570> need<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:46.750> little
