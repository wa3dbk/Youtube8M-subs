noticed about this crater population on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
Venus was that almost all of the craters

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
Venus was that almost all of the craters
were<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.490> very<00:01:59.940> good<00:02:00.000> condition<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:00.750> were

were in very good condition they were

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
with faults so what we think happened on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
with faults so what we think happened on
Venus<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.100> went<00:02:08.310> through<00:02:08.459> an<00:02:08.640> active

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
Venus was it went through an active

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.150 
Venus was it went through an active
period<00:02:09.209> until<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:10.020> 1<00:02:10.380> billion<00:02:10.619> years<00:02:11.009> ago

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
period until about 1 billion years ago

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.570 
period until about 1 billion years ago
and<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:12.600> was<00:02:12.810> followed<00:02:13.020> by<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.380> quiet<00:02:14.250> period

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and that was followed by a quiet period

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.850 
and that was followed by a quiet period
which<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.630> planet<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.050> still<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.440> when<00:02:16.709> it
