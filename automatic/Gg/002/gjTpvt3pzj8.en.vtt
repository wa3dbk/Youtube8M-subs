down over here now when I got this thing
I<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> case<00:01:06.090> for

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
I was going to use the case for

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.780 
I was going to use the case for
something<00:01:06.810> else<00:01:08.689> but<00:01:09.689> because<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.799> knew<00:01:11.010> they

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
something else but because I knew they

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.580 
something else but because I knew they
said<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> would<00:01:12.270> only<00:01:12.299> run<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.229> bit<00:01:13.470> when

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
said it would only run a little bit when

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.530 
said it would only run a little bit when
you<00:01:13.710> shook<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:16.280> now<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.460> property<00:01:18.000> closed<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you shook it now that property closed it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.870 
you shook it now that property closed it
you<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> press<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.560> crown<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.759> then

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you have to press the crown in and then

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.039 
you have to press the crown in and then
you<00:01:21.259> like<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:23.689> because<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> latch

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.630 

come<00:01:29.619> on<00:01:30.329> now<00:01:31.329> doesn't<00:01:31.689> one<00:01:31.780> open<00:01:32.280> yeah<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.510 
come on now doesn't one open yeah the
launch<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.119> there<00:01:34.329> is<00:01:34.570> steel<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.920> case<00:01:36.189> is

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
launch in there is steel the case is

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.070 
launch in there is steel the case is
silver<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:40.060> know<00:01:40.180> what<00:01:40.720> do<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.869> think<00:01:41.020> is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
silver you know what do you think is

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.770 
silver you know what do you think is
going<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.259> wear<00:01:41.470> out<00:01:41.500> first<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.450> we're<00:01:46.750> just

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
going to wear out first so we're just

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.810 
going to wear out first so we're just
gonna<00:01:47.080> use<00:01:47.649> this<00:01:47.860> for<00:01:47.920> its<00:01:48.250> case<00:01:48.549> for

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
gonna use this for its case for

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.779 
gonna use this for its case for
something<00:01:49.060> else<00:01:50.789> but<00:01:51.789> when<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.229> examined<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.350> I

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
something else but when I examined it I

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.980 
something else but when I examined it I
heared<00:01:54.789> another<00:01:55.060> thing<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.509> should<00:01:55.539> use<00:01:55.810> one

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
heared another thing you should use one

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.350 
heared another thing you should use one
of<00:01:56.020> these<00:01:56.170> knives

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
of these knives

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.859 
of these knives
let's<00:01:58.360> open<00:01:58.479> up<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.899> case<00:01:59.200> instead<00:01:59.649> of<00:01:59.740> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
let's open up the case instead of a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.169 
let's open up the case instead of a
pocket<00:02:01.869> knife<00:02:02.319> or<00:02:02.380> something<00:02:03.190> kitchen<00:02:04.000> knife

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
pocket knife or something kitchen knife

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.009 
pocket knife or something kitchen knife
this<00:02:04.630> thing<00:02:04.840> has<00:02:05.049> no<00:02:06.090> edge<00:02:07.090> there<00:02:07.539> so<00:02:07.869> it

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
this thing has no edge there so it

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.590 
this thing has no edge there so it
doesn't<00:02:08.310> cut<00:02:09.310> up<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.580> material<00:02:10.149> like<00:02:10.299> you<00:02:10.420> can

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
doesn't cut up the material like you can

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.130 
doesn't cut up the material like you can
see<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.140> there<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:13.569> just<00:02:13.709> pops<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.950> open<00:02:16.140> yeah

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
see in there it just pops it open yeah

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.479 
see in there it just pops it open yeah
he's<00:02:17.350> gonna<00:02:17.470> originally<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.400> use<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.760> case

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
he's gonna originally just use the case

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.610 
he's gonna originally just use the case
but<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:22.209> know<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.510> balance<00:02:22.690> staff<00:02:23.110> was<00:02:23.380> good

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
but you know the balance staff was good

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.860 
but you know the balance staff was good
on<00:02:23.769> this<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:26.170> when<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.350> took<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.160> apart<00:02:27.630> all<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
on this and when I took it apart all the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.479 
on this and when I took it apart all the
need<00:02:29.080> was<00:02:29.410> cleaning<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.519> oiling<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:32.489> that

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
need was cleaning and oiling and that

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.050 
need was cleaning and oiling and that
was<00:02:33.640> it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
was it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.800 
was it
it's<00:02:34.450> only<00:02:34.600> seven<00:02:35.019> joules<00:02:36.120> which<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.390> really

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it's only seven joules which is really

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.789 
it's only seven joules which is really
cheap<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.810> think<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.140> seal<00:02:41.380> numbers

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
cheap and I think the seal numbers

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:48.569 
cheap and I think the seal numbers
around<00:02:42.329> 1881<00:02:43.329> or<00:02:43.750> 1882<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.130> runs<00:02:48.280> pretty

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
around 1881 or 1882 and it runs pretty

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.150 
around 1881 or 1882 and it runs pretty
good<00:02:48.880> if<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.540> know<00:02:49.739> let<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.859> lay<00:02:50.980> flat

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.259 

he'll<00:02:54.160> keep<00:02:54.370> time<00:02:56.519> that's<00:02:57.519> why<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.730> decided<00:02:57.940> to

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
he'll keep time that's why I decided to

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.319 
he'll keep time that's why I decided to
keep<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.660> in<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.900> movement<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.970> one<00:03:01.180> is

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
keep it in the movement and this one is

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.470 
keep it in the movement and this one is
a<00:03:02.040> 3<00:03:03.040> ounce<00:03:03.220> case<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:04.000> don't<00:03:04.150> know<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.359> can

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480
