00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.150
 yesterday everyone and welcome 1 video in my 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.799
 channel I am from mega krauze and as 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.719
 always having the 12 million videos 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.779
 and let's start with the new analysis 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.250
 of the course video 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.680
 ok and the first thing we could appreciate 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.989
 well I can appreciate was the return 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.390
 of beloved characters like seeing 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.399
 querol to see is believed since it is female and 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.200
 the corset then I put the campaign 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.419
 If I'm going to feel a little more 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.280
 gears of war or not the following were 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.130
 the executions in this case the brand 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.590
 as it is a great stew in the ribs 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.239
 I think it's a bit aggressive but 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.609
 this difference from the bridget that is a 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.079
 cut in the neck where we could also 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.399
 appreciate there are cloud zac and the a 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.690
 characters so dear that we're just going to 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.179
 can see in the campaign because the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.039
 multiplayer is not going to be crazy but 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.489
 we can appreciate it until you 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.440
 they cut the neck ok and good the 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.449
 execution that everyone already knows is the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.609
 of the normal sniper who owns that 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.840
 nothing changed the following these 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.630
 Sirs 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.060
 to the hammer bus with the shield see how 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.700
 it does not move but not at all but 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.770
 nothing looks at her is extremely strange 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.860
 if you spend multiplayer I think it's going 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 to be terrible the next thing we can 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.360
 appreciate is this is the crimson omen and 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.890
 It is very beautiful and the truth is that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.900
 well now when we see an omen that 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.930
 Messi is not going to be just to pick up a 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.070
 cocktail but it's going to be a mission 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.650
 Declassified what is in these 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.900
 missions in killing the more we kill 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.780
 more stars while more stars 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.550
 let's get more benefits in the case of 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.720
 this mission that we can appreciate later 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.550
 it's like that in the in the omen I believe 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.530
 that the case of this mission was to kill 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.180
 all the crazy ones with normal pistolita already 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.680
 that were used and good missions in 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.780
 this is that we are only going to be able to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.770
 use specific weapons in a site 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.649
 unlocking as skins characters already 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.300
 be by I imagine that for multiplayer 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.180
 I do not know if we're going to unlock weapons 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.890
 all this kind of stuff and it even 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.110
 He said we could get to unlock 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.450
 extra missions 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.950
 ok as in the case of this is this one 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.240
 advance because you are and we could not 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.540
 appreciate anything in slow motion please 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.960
 so after we go to see cold grab and 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.670
 who is that back is described have 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.070
 written a crime 'two-sided very 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.770
 homosexuals but the question here is no 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.860
 is that it makes aitona and if not where it is 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.400
 sofia henrik king because our sofÃ­a 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.190
 because it is clayton that fart there good 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.690
 one of the theories could be that see 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.240
 we see it with his gears of 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.340
 war 3 so that's a lot later and 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.930
 it could not be that a low like that 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.600
 how it happened in the shadow of killing 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.640
 Valera and SofÃ­a could die I do not know 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.040
 why women are killed by the GDP of 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.010
 I hate the truth I hate you another thing 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.290
 we could appreciate was the cropped that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 sublime reach that you have in the campaign 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.220
 or in the missions the truth see that 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.700
 I hope it's only in the campaign because 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.410
 if it would not be terrible terrible 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.630
 terrible terrible or are we going to make a 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.700
 count of this we have a retro 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.209
 lancer that does not move looks 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.950
 and a cropped with an extreme reach 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.019
 really jokes of the multiplayer 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.790
 gentlemen let's hate more the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.500
 multiplayer if they already hated it 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.810
 another thing is the normal sniper 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.120
 this really did not have much change like that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.760
 that no top because not everything has to be 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.069
 bad does not even say that he's going to have more 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.050
 traspase and well this this I can 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.290
 appreciate is a blind fire and with this 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.780
 linda takes also I noticed that no 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.060
 there is or is not the stare that 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.530
 we saw we did not sing victory since this 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.549
 it could be only in the campaign but if the 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.160
 removed 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.799
 how well it is good 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.269
 gods that show the rangers me 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.099
 he remembered a lot the first time we saw 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.079
 a wedge in the campaign of gears of war 1 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.319
 Well I liked and so the cock 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.959
 wow 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.000
 another thing is the shield in this case 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.650
 we see the haula like this with his whole cock 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.709
 for outside shooting with the spear but 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.720
 it occurs to him to grab a shield this already 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.510
 is what is going to be super super 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.920
 important the shield in all kinds either 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.959
 multiplayer campaign because they see this 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.359
 you see here did not see anything let's see 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.769
 in slow motion we see almost everyone and not 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.709
 is that all because the other point is 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.340
 back with your shield ok with your shield and 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.570
 shooting is in making the enemies I 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.950
 I think there are many shields of 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.900
 suddenly on a map is going to be a weapon that 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.190
 is going to super fight and good levels of 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.200
 course all that I can appreciate 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.000
 the important thing of this trailer this 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.340
 remember that if you liked this analysis 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.930

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.580
