00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.830
 Dear friends 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.660
 Let's talk a little more today about 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.330
 the new product line of the yaws 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.939
 who partnered with the Swiss company benÃ© 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.830
 brings the national market micro motors 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.439
 excellent cyrus electric motors 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.449
 quality and high performance to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.669
 implantodontia has all the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.930
 specialties is that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.870
 that has developed the most in the last 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.180
 years in relation to the health area 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.739
 no surgical treatment has a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.309
 of such high success 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.260
 is greater than 96% but for 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.480
 treatment with implants may have 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.360
 this treatment is this high rate of 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.649
 success is fundamental as well as a good 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.690
 professional qualification 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 the use of reliable equipment and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.559
 excellent quality 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 the panel of much of the surgical motor and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.590
 in blessings specifically this is the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 xirÃº pro 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.070
 it allows you to access a single 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.229
 in the single panel all the menus 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.330
 then you have accessory keys and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
 also optional teacher buttons you 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.710
 you can walk with the cursor between the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.810
 main 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 in the first step you can select 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.740
 between pilot had not then had no 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.780
 or surgery that are pre- modules 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.759
 programmed but you can 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.729
 Let's personalize let's talk a little bit 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.850
 on the use of planting systems already 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.340
 new pre-programmed 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.530
 factory with the main 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 implant of the world market but 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 can be changed and can be 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.119
 added others 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.189
 for example we have here in plants 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.310
 have already been included in the 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.649
 let's just choose specifically the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.590
 hospital, for example, once the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.570
 click ok already loaded protocol it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.270
 we are making a modification to the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.360
 system has been selected until classic 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 system and in the main menu 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.479
 port, it loads the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.200
 central system with the cursor, I can 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.120
 walking by choosing the transmission with 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.090
 the bread reducer but I can 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.940
 modify according to google counter 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.590
 uses the very precise touch 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.260
 has a house upstairs after the comma 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.910
 it can be changed from 07 07 so that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.890
 I can customize according to each 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.840
 the implant system 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.099
 world polls every five 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.220
 units may change my will 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.049
 and irrigation five levels from the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.900
 moment that I passed first drill 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.910
 touch the world to the second I too 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.030
 can I modify it behind the dashboard? 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.099
 jumping or coming back then it follows the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.150
 programming that comes from the factory 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:57.329
 reach the route at implant insertion 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.160
 then micromotor that accompanies the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.170
 surgical motors that are born benÃ© 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.620
 it has a cooling system 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.340
 that decreases heating 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.769
 heating and the one that can 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.400
 both dentist and patient 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.530
 it is also to increase the quality and 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.170
 durability of these female parts 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.880
 maintenance angle counter 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.400
 specifically by finding the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.310
 reducer people for one who has a good 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.160
 economy and also for its elimination 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.130
 double through led would like 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.350
 up to 38 thousand lux the head of the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.299
 comtranblu has a small size and that 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.660
 has more tom tomio vacation than 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.000
 decreases the heating in this area is 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.489
 It is also important to emphasize that 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.430
 cooling CONTRAN gu it internal 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.200
 then your hose says gold 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.079
 does not need to come to your head then 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.660
 when the hilt is made you will not 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.060
 tighten over the hose by decreasing 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.069
 risk of reducing serum flow 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 during drilling which could lead 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.380
 to a bone necrosis with the 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.540
 overheating in relation to the set 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.790
 micromotor and counter the size of it is 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.299
 20% less than any similar 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.190
 market so that the micromotor 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.889
 finding were developed thinking 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.690
 in improving quality and also the 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.280
 success story however through 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.530
 of its reduction 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.440
 focusing the center of gravity 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.840
 about the news 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.540
 timothy fatigue and fatigue treatment 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.670
 daily care that accompanies your engine 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.520
 allows it to be 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.760
 controlled speed and speed 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.020
 through the pressure applied to the pedal 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.860
 increasing the pressure you increase the 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.920
 velocity 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.980
 another detail is that the blue button allows 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.990
 button on or off 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.320
 orange you toggle between the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.810
 the gray button you dial 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.730
 and off the reverse rotation system 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.680
 system of connection it a system 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.350
 different 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.100
 we will note that only a single 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.290
 you have access to much of the 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.300
 static that the kinks they are 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.750
 disposable single - use and comes 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.060
 sterilize them have access to the 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.960
 content 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:21.110
 this first part will fit it then 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.890
 not finding and then the next 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.890
 part 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:36.530
 is not so easily inserted closed and 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.010
 your helper will then be able to remove the 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.150
 lacko in being then the serum reveals its 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.240
 expectations 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.910
 know the ciro for the surgical and 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.669
 performance with lots of technology and 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.710
 aggregate quality in a single product 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.120
 so be sure to check out the new 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.700
 line products 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.790
 through the partnership is born a great 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.790
 hug
