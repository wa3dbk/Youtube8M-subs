00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.410
 Hello, we are once again 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.570
 at the chain show 2013 and came to the mobile 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.970
 visit the company trigger ready here 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.440
 quite an extensive stand because 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 company produces 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.590
 some kind of fantastic 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.220
 number of tablets and 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.160
 she has them with this company more than 70 if I 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.830
 all right, we remember, of course, all 70 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.080
 We will not review the four most 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.480
 perhaps interesting models are 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.000
 10-inch model with a diagonal 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.550
 9.7 inches 8 and 7 inches 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.260
 I'll probably use a little bit 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.850
 cheat sheet because you're so too 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.760
 many tablets a lot 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.920
 and the name of the tablet a little bit 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.170
 complex mostly alphabetic 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.519
 for example, this model is called axis 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.399
 10-20 a 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.300
 the pasture is pretty cool to me 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.660
 like the back 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.970
 a one-piece aluminum sheet to the solid model 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.210
 Here it is plastic inserts in order 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.310
 to keep it comfortable here 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.950
 various grooved surface on 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.330
 The top end has a micro-sd slot for 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.340
 memory cards 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.039
 volume control on / off button 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.130
 small is on the left audio jack 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.619
 and here there is a place for reserve 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 future future model will appear with 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.620
 lte support and that will 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.870
 support and Russian frequencies 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.940
 but for now this model is purely its own 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.070
 it works under control of android 4 0 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.430
 obviously 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.890
 for 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.600
 stability 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.790
 because it is one of the most stable 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.970
 versions today built 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.290
 ti omap 4 platform based gadget 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.080
 dual core processor with clock 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.060
 1 gigahertz frequency here gigabyte 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.250
 RAM and 16 gigs of memory 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.040
 The main which can already be as I said 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.330
 expand with micro sd cards 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.369
 of the interesting here is 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.159
 5 megapixel rear camera 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.820
 with LED flash on the front 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.780
 panels have a camera for video calls 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.780
 sensor resolution which is 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.880
 1.3 megapixels well naturally here 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.209
 there is a wi-fi standard bj uh and 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.190
 bluetooth version 30 also on the bottom 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.830
 the end of course there is a port micro-usb 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.769
 as well as in micro hdmi and using 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.220
 whose image can be displayed on 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.290
 big screen 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.260
 separate 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.420
 separate charging socket and 2 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.910
 loud enough speakers 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.940
 the next model is called with 97 18c 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.069
 look 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.299
 but 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.620
 a little more probably mainstream it than 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.230
 previous that is like this back 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.129
 plastic surface on top of it 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.120
 There is a SIM card slot and which 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.120
 opens enough 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.550
 Tuva in general will not open it to 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.560
 nails do not break 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.450
 now this model only works with 3g 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.440
 but in a few months will appear 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.050
 modification 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.600
 working with lt and like the previous one 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.760
 the model will support Russian 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.770
 frequency on / off buttons 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.570
 volume separate button for a discharge 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.700
 thank you very much because after all this 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.820
 android and sometimes systems starts to fail 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.560
 and I want to reboot when not 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.010
 it possible to remove the battery 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.920
 it becomes quite difficult 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.370
 the right end is empty but there is a port on the left 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.370
 microusb 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.650
 slot for micro sd card micro 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.960
 hdmi 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.820
 as well as a charging and audio jack 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.880
 the speakers are in the back here 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.610
 wide 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.890
 5 megapixel camera and camera for 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.510
 video calls with a resolution of 1.3 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.890
 megapixels this model is 8-inch 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.480
 called a minute 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.120
 Ersi 08 13 c she has a screen diagonal 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.110
 is 8 inches and a resolution of 1024 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.820
 at 768 points with a matrix here gps 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.130
 as in the previous two models and as in 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.709
 last same picture quality 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.620
 fairly good viewing angles 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.990
 also a good image does not fade 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.420
 I inverted everything works fine 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.730
 gadget running android 4 1 1 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.910
 it is rather smartly built on a chipset 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.650
 rockchip 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.670
 which includes a dual core processor with 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:43.030
 clock rate 1.66 gabay to 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.440
 RAM and 8 gigabytes main 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.250
 memory that can be expanded with 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.810
 slots with micro sd cards 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.710
 which is inserted here this slot on 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.750
 bottom panel 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.729
 up to 32 gigabytes 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.589
 a microphone is also seen on the bottom 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.430
 and on the top volume control and 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:06.150
 power button no this menu button 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.530
 sorry 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.020
 menu button and this button 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.220
 inclusion besides left 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.710
 there is a speaker port 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.020
 micro-usb and micro-hdmi as well as audio 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.510
 headphone jack 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.460
 perhaps the most interesting in this model 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.130
 back cover she's so interesting 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.070
 peach color besides that will also 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.750
 white model but this is perhaps unusual so 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.570
 this is not yet seen the surface 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.310
 glossy and basically fingerprints 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.960
 on them, though noticeable, but not very much 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.960
 which is not bad 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:45.890
 go ahead 7-inch model under 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:48.500
 name persin 07 22 this model by 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.330
 essentially functionally repeats the previous one 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.580
 model because it is built on the same 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.080
 chipset rock chip which come in 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.520
 dual core processor with clock 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.930
 1.69 bytes of RAM and 8 gigs 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.090
 main memory which can be expanded 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.860
 using the micro-sd slot which 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.710
 is on the top butt 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:10.130
 here you can see the audio jack 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.160
 power button right menu button 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:17.190
 volume control and 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.280
 I understand the return button 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.700
 previous menu level bottom port 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.520
 microusb to charge and the only thing 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.639
 didn't find it here 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.710
 micro hdmi card and that was in all 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.560
 previous models back panel 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.030
 It looks like this, too, it is plastic 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.950
 running device running everything 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.590
 the same android 4 1 1 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.700
 while doing it pretty quickly 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.210
 I especially 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.210
 here I am 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.639
 lag did not notice but again, perhaps 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.500
 for now because too much software 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.800
 not installed here 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.500
 actually it 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.220
 there was a model just pulled out 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.949
 the boxes 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.129
 well now about the most interesting about prices 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:11.039
 model 1020 will cost 13,000 rubles 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:12.430
 Recommended price is 997 31 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:15.659
 6.9 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:19.569
 thousand rubles or 6,900 next 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:22.569
 8-inch model 08 13 5 thousand rubles and 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:25.629
 This is the smallest with a diagonal of 7 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:27.840
 inches 4700 rubles all enough 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:30.969
 budget as I said myself the beginning of 3 square 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.650
 this is famous for giving out tablets 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:35.800
 acceptable quality 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:38.379
 again reasonable price but both yell.ru 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.190
 from the exhibition chain 2013 company booth 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:41.190
 the third
