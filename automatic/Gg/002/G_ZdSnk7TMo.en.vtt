00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.310 
Olympics I'm seated 6th right now in the
nation<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:16.280> they<00:01:16.460> take<00:01:16.670> two<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.050> can<00:01:18.200> do

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
nation and they take two so you can do

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.590 
nation and they take two so you can do
the<00:01:18.409> math<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.770> guess<00:01:18.979> because<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.240> difference

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
the math I guess because the difference

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.690 
the math I guess because the difference
between<00:01:20.650> second<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.770> sixth<00:01:22.280> place<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.670> a

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
between second and sixth place is a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.899 
between second and sixth place is a
matter<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.090> hundreds<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.200> tenths<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:24.979> I've

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
matter of hundreds and tenths so I've

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.039 
matter of hundreds and tenths so I've
been<00:01:26.030> working<00:01:26.330> pretty<00:01:26.450> hard<00:01:26.690> since<00:01:26.840> this
