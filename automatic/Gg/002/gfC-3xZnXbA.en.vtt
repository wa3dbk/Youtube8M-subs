00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:09.910
 at the request of the workers I am doing this 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:10.860
 review bike with motor in motion in 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.150
 a trip 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.150
 that is, drive almost plan to go 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.150
 pump over 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.750
 but 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.630
 bike and stayed that easy 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.000
 principle as it was without a motor 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.230
 Well, 5 kilogram extra is nothing 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.690
 means absolutely 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.820
 but we must remember that by setting on 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.060
 bike engine he did not from this 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.650
 motorcycle speed up increased 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.610
 to about forty kilometers per hour 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.070
 legs are less tired but comfort from him 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.830
 motorcycle nothing to wait for you nothing 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.560
 except the engine did not change more precisely not 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.620
 added so many wonder 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.420
 very crappy 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.400
 because i'm sorry you are normal 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.740
 bicycle 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.770
 only with a motor so there you have it 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:41.190
 fit freely in the elevator there is an elevator not 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.050
 running hands as usual 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.100
 bicycle 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.370
 there is nothing complicated about it 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.370
 until
