00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.810
 dvd criticism my further trailer check 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.030
 and after watching an animated movie 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.099
 were allowed to experience as the once from 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.719
 a jump plane into a race 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.250
 plane became and thus its own 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.960
 could realize dream now 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.090
 the question how are we going on in the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.130
 Continuing to plan the dhs planes 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.130
 two always in action 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.460
 Every day , you set your life up 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.460
 game 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.000
 it takes strength to trust 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.020
 and fashion 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.020
 save lives 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.300
 we have 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.690
 show me what you can they are in 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.690
 everyday life 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:08.000
 when others flee 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:13.180
 because we are one more rescue 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.920
 is an adventure rich 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.990
 even they have a rim from the b17 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.990
 thrown off you are a bomb 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.780
 plan 2 brings us walt disney 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.880
 expected from 14 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.380
 August 2014 in German cinemas and 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.450
 I have to say now of the trailer 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.190
 I did not quite like it and I liked it 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.600
 if I'm honest, it's not 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.640
 Plan the water that tries the world 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.110
 from cars to work for one 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.110
 world full of planes around the children 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.460
 to pick up what the spectator audience 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.380
 but the gags were pretty 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.420
 Learning animation level was not on 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.860
 the usual level and yet was pixar 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.060
 then not quite on board and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.800
 I I'm in two planes 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.300
 rather skeptical what that should but how 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.310
 that too is not about the 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.570
 history of dusty must learn that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.890
 has a motor damage and maybe 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.420
 no further than race plane 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.250
 should work because of his career 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.330
 otherwise completely at stake there 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.060
 He decides to become a volunteer fire department 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.980
 to go and fight as a delete 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.420
 plane to work with it he does 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.250
 with some cars together there 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.330
 directly before use or at the place of use 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.980
 be dropped 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.840
 with the wrong and it is about one 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.160
 secure and save national park 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.410
 and to fight thousands of flames 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.610
 So a little ecological 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 embassy that you can incorporate here 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.790
 want in the world of plains and i have 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.190
 the feeling of being a trailer here too 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.720
 more in it than in the first part of plains 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.400
 singer maybe trying this one 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.810
 little to remember well-tried 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.730
 but honestly I make the first one 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.930
 Part not the second one is now too 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.370
 not my thing what the trailer 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.480
 I am curious if you like that 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.070
 but I see similar 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.420
 I will love the animation films 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.070
 Definitely watch 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.110
 also comes in 3d in the German cinemas 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.760
 he is so standard in animated films 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.620
 as I said my skepticism big and me 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.940
 suspect too, but we are each 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.170
 like to write the comments for me 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.380
 am now through a short little one 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.820
 trailer james 2 is always in use the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.080
 like to thumb there would be like let it 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.180
 stay if otherwise you know that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.310
 There are still some interesting links left 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.739
