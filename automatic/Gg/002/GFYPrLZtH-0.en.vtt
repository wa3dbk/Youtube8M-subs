00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.420
 hello i'm constantin talker and i will tell 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.109
 about 5 of my favorite games game number five 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.289
 this 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.150
 rain, and it is interesting for two things in 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.280
 first heavy rain is perfect if you 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.020
 need to attach to the games of the person who 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.190
 never let them never seen before that is 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.399
 take the girl 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.010
 adult man give heavy rain he 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.739
 enjoys and after passing says 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.149
 want something else and if you need 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.170
 to teach someone close to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.630
 your hobby 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.360
 Toka is perfect ideally you should always have 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.700
 at home on the 2 advantages of heavy rain 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.160
 that the game really surprises when I first 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.200
 just I passed her I did not know what to expect from 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.219
 plot that in the game you can do that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.629
 where you can’t share your actions 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.730
 in the game it's really very cool 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.500
 so now heavy rain is no longer 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.629
 causes such a reaction since well we 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 everyone read the solution and see vidosiki on 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.369
 youtube but then in 2010 it was 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.950
 really an event on really blew the brain 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.520
 so severin I remember very much 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520
 I love her very much 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.619
 game number four is dance dance 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 revolution 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.640
 rather, well, the whole show dance dance 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.649
 revolution and all direction rhythm games from 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.939
 konami 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.590
 lately it is fashionable to say that 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.990
 you gnaw motion recognition this 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.479
 cool you kinect playstation 2 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.780
 we actually dance 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.179
 revolution began the revolution of games where 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.189
 gamer movement involved i.e. 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.310
 sdr you danced your body 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.110
 pressed down on the buttons and thus 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.539
 passed the game before really cool 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.549
 were playing like it's time it's time it's time were given 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.259
 where is his waving sensor 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.830
 recognized the movement you also passed 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.799
 the game is what created all the flow 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.289
 such casual games that were pushing 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.990
 boundaries jeanna and then already appeared and 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.190
 playstation already everything else i'm very 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.369
 played a lot in d &amp; d 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.920
 7 years ago now it is less but those 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.810
 times they really come to my mind as 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.250
 one of the brightest impressions 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.250
 my and for youth 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.790
 game number three is starcraft exactly 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.099
 The first part is my view all games for 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.920
 Pis must be exactly that is 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.950
 the point is that there really need 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.800
 keyboard mouse computer screen or 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.650
 laptop not tv this game 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.959
 trains the player’s managerial skills 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.130
 there is in contrast to the game for consoles she 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.049
 not so much entertaining as it teaches 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.150
 to train she is very close to the sport 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.569
 and knowingly in the morning crafting such at 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.060
 disciplines football trains the body of chess 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.010
 trains mind and starcraft trains 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.410
 mind in the same sense as chess 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.110
 therefore sharp craft is a sport 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.630
 electronic sport and this is a wonderful game 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.959
 number two is metal gear solid 3 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.220
 it reached the top of the game 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.090
 design art times 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.640
 playstation 2 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.370
 then the games were new to you hardcore 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.040
 complex and build according to such a scheme that you 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.630
 first pass level do it 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.609
 complicated things achieve results 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.510
 get a cool video from 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.350
 interesting plot 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.970
 gameplay video gameplay video metal gear 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.370
 solid 3 it was still combined in 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.459
 cult some global history when 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.959
 purely even game moments 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.000
 perceived as part of the story for example 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.329
 the brightest scene metal gear solid 3 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.609
 this is when you go this way forward 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.799
 to meet you meet the souls of enemies 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.329
 you killed at previous levels that 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.450
 the moment you understand what it is 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.310
 stealth action that you could stun them and you 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.260
 they were actually killed and what have you 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.000
 now the punishment is really very 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.430
 cool cop that could sneak right 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.170
 to the core and in this sense metal 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.739
 gear solid 3 game that really entered 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.280
 into history and hardly anyone else so far 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.299
 pore her 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.299
 surpassed and 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.150
 my most favorite game is guarantee 2 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.130
 this game for sega dreamcast which was 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.579
 ported like pics playstation 2 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.520
 the point is that grande 2 is the top 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.910
 golden age japanese in smt have it all 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.030
 remember there are fantasy files there 9 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.330
 senade 1 crown cross they were all on 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.120
 playstation 1 saturn on drimkaste out 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.680
 warranty 2 and she did what she did 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.700
 collected all the best that was in 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.700
 all the golden age 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.120
 cleaned up all the bad and now presented such 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.660
 cool story with vivid characters from 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.730
 the death of the main character with complex 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.430
 topics about the relativity of good and evil 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.160
 with love stories all all all that from 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.140
 really was good with no there 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.210
 characters kids no characters there 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.180
 bored adults is a real story 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.610
 which is interesting to people from 16 to 30 and 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.190
 It was implemented on a good technical 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.100
 level until that time, all that was 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.530
 later it is such 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.330
 Well, the century is already golden 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.810
 seek confusion Shoto not all wrong 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.340
 Grande 2 and then an incredible but if 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.860
 you want to get acquainted with the golden age 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.960
 start with it and then you can 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.270
 watch what was before hail 2 she 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.210
 may be interesting to all and those who 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.039
 love anime those who don't love anime 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.740
 financially cool choice it was my 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.419
 personal top games that are remembered 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.030

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.419

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.419
