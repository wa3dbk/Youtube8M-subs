there are three components to it the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
there are three components to it the
first<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> acceptance<00:01:14.310> which<00:01:14.580> means<00:01:14.790> totally

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
first is acceptance which means totally

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.359 
first is acceptance which means totally
acceptance<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.140> yourself<00:01:18.650> total<00:01:19.650> acceptance

acceptance of yourself total acceptance

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.200 
acceptance of yourself total acceptance
of<00:01:20.700> yourself<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.630> everybody<00:01:22.229> else<00:01:22.610> as<00:01:23.610> they

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
of yourself and everybody else as they

of yourself and everybody else as they
are<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.670> does<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.090> course<00:01:27.180> is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
are you know what that does of course is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.770 
are you know what that does of course is
removes<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.799> great<00:01:29.009> burden<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.640> judgment<00:01:30.420> and

responsibility the ability to respond

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.929 
responsibility the ability to respond
creative<00:01:50.880> live<00:01:51.119> without<00:01:51.299> reactivity<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.939> when

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
creative live without reactivity so when

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.420 
creative live without reactivity so when
you<00:01:54.119> step<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.140> you're<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.680> reactive

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you step back and you're not reactive

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.660 
you step back and you're not reactive
you<00:01:56.960> reach<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.140> hard<00:01:58.409> line<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.890> intuition<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you reach a hard line of intuition and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.910 
you reach a hard line of intuition and
creativity<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.810> imagination<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:04.380> third

creativity and imagination and the third
is<00:02:05.280> defenselessness<00:02:06.229> means<00:02:07.670> basically

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
is defenselessness means basically

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.680 
is defenselessness means basically

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.840 
point
to<00:02:13.230> view<00:02:13.440> doesn't<00:02:14.069> mean<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> don't<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.760> a

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
not attached to defending it so you give

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.430 
not attached to defending it so you give
up<00:02:23.130> being<00:02:23.430> right<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.750> when<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.170> give<00:02:25.350> up

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
up being right and when you give up

up being right and when you give up
being<00:02:25.680> right<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.430> ultimately<00:02:26.880> get<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.330> you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
being right you ultimately get what you

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.680 
being right you ultimately get what you
want<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.340> those<00:02:29.340> are<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.610> three<00:02:29.880> things<00:02:30.060> okay

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
want so those are the three things okay

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.290 
want so those are the three things okay

defenselessness<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.940> have<00:02:35.940> details<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.690> this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
defenselessness I have details of this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.250 
defenselessness I have details of this
in<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> seven<00:02:37.560> spiritual<00:02:38.040> hours<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.430> success

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
in the seven spiritual hours of success

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.630 
in the seven spiritual hours of success
but<00:02:41.120> ultimately<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.300> means<00:02:42.510> living<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.140> life

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
but ultimately it means living a life

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.440 
but ultimately it means living a life
without<00:02:44.640> resistance<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.670> ultimately<00:02:47.670> also

going with the flow letting go and

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.290 
going with the flow letting go and
allowing<00:02:52.769> yourself<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.310> flow<00:02:54.110> with<00:02:55.110> the
