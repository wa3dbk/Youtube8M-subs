that<00:01:55.950> mower<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.490> need<00:01:56.670> something<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.090> a

probably<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> best<00:02:03.270> thing<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.840> footprint

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
probably the best thing is the footprint

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.709 
probably the best thing is the footprint
because<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> pretty<00:02:05.100> small<00:02:05.430> shed<00:02:05.790> I'd

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
oh I suppose 300 feet long it's got a

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.860 
oh I suppose 300 feet long it's got a
real<00:02:14.840> small<00:02:15.110> footprint<00:02:15.680> that's<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.670> good<00:02:16.849> thing

the tires are absolutely horrible to

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.849 
the tires are absolutely horrible to
change<00:03:32.600> what<00:03:32.930> happens<00:03:33.230> they<00:03:33.319> lose<00:03:33.500> their<00:03:33.709> air

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
change what happens they lose their air

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.569

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
tires pretty closely to make sure

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.349 
tires pretty closely to make sure
they're<00:03:41.120> not<00:03:41.950> getting<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.040> low<00:03:43.160> I'd<00:03:43.400> lean

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
over and look behind me and check them

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.180 
over and look behind me and check them
about<00:03:46.220> every<00:03:46.489> three<00:03:47.120> or<00:03:47.209> four<00:03:47.389> minutes<00:03:48.190> you

about every three or four minutes you

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.530 
about every three or four minutes you

change<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.989> inner<00:03:51.560> tubes<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.549> rims<00:03:52.760> are<00:03:52.940> too

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
change the inner tubes the rims are too

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.920 
change the inner tubes the rims are too
small<00:03:53.389> that's<00:03:54.260> probably<00:03:54.560> only<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:55.540> 12<00:03:56.540> inches

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
small that's probably only a 12 inches

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.390 
small that's probably only a 12 inches
outside<00:03:57.170> diameter<00:03:57.590> they're<00:03:58.069> little<00:03:58.370> tiny

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
outside diameter they're little tiny

outside diameter they're little tiny
tires<00:03:58.940> now<00:03:59.600> I<00:03:59.660> haven't<00:03:59.930> had<00:04:00.019> trouble<00:04:00.230> with<00:04:00.440> the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
tires now I haven't had trouble with the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.140 
tires now I haven't had trouble with the
front<00:04:00.829> ones<00:04:00.980> but<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.280> imagine<00:04:01.670> those<00:04:01.819> are<00:04:02.000> going

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
front ones but I imagine those are going

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.240 
front ones but I imagine those are going
to<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.299> even<00:04:02.510> worse<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.930> change<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.560> don't<00:04:03.950> have

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
to be even worse to change I don't have

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.530 
to be even worse to change I don't have
any<00:04:04.400> spare<00:04:04.670> tubes<00:04:04.910> yet<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.180> should<00:04:05.299> probably

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
any spare tubes yet I should probably

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.160 
any spare tubes yet I should probably
get<00:04:05.750> some<00:04:06.019> but<00:04:06.940> so<00:04:07.940> far<00:04:08.209> in<00:04:08.389> one<00:04:08.569> season<00:04:09.019> I've

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
get some but so far in one season I've

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.059 
get some but so far in one season I've
put<00:04:10.090> four<00:04:11.090> tubes<00:04:11.389> plus<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.139> original<00:04:12.889> fight

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
put four tubes plus the original fight

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.680 
put four tubes plus the original fight
two<00:04:13.250> factory<00:04:13.639> tubes<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:13.970> came<00:04:14.180> in<00:04:14.329> it<00:04:14.480> so

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
two factory tubes that came in it so

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.379 
two factory tubes that came in it so
this<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.010> sixth<00:04:16.430> tube<00:04:16.850> that's<00:04:17.209> in

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
this is the the sixth tube that's in

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.750 
this is the the sixth tube that's in
there<00:04:17.630> it's<00:04:17.900> pretty<00:04:18.139> ridiculous<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.100> the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
there it's pretty ridiculous and the

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.370 
there it's pretty ridiculous and the
ones<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.060> get<00:04:20.269> from<00:04:20.419> tractor<00:04:20.750> supply<00:04:20.870> I'm<00:04:21.229> not

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
ones I get from tractor supply I'm not

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.450 
ones I get from tractor supply I'm not
sure<00:04:21.530> they're<00:04:21.709> any<00:04:21.859> better<00:04:21.919> everything's

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
sure they're any better everything's

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.210

now<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:24.180> things<00:04:24.390> just<00:04:24.630> aren't<00:04:24.810> worth<00:04:24.990> a

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
now and the things just aren't worth a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.960 
now and the things just aren't worth a
crap<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:27.570> motors<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.140> Briggs<00:04:28.440> &amp;<00:04:28.620> Stratton<00:04:28.970> 8

and<00:04:30.180> 3/4<00:04:30.690> horse<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:31.140> believe<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.500> what<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.830> is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
and 3/4 horse I believe is what that is

and 3/4 horse I believe is what that is
oh<00:04:32.810> no<00:04:34.340> 8.75<00:04:35.340> foot-pounds<00:04:36.000> torque<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.480> don't

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
oh no 8.75 foot-pounds torque I don't

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.000 
oh no 8.75 foot-pounds torque I don't
know<00:04:36.750> how<00:04:36.900> many<00:04:37.110> horsepower<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.740> probably

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
know how many horsepower it is probably

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.320 
know how many horsepower it is probably
5<00:04:38.220> horse<00:04:38.550> or<00:04:38.790> 3<00:04:39.000> horse<00:04:40.580> pretty<00:04:41.580> much<00:04:41.790> adequate

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
5 horse or 3 horse pretty much adequate

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.290 
5 horse or 3 horse pretty much adequate
for<00:04:42.510> what<00:04:42.540> you're<00:04:42.870> using<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.350> for<00:04:44.150> it's<00:04:45.150> got

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
for what you're using it for it's got

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.870 
for what you're using it for it's got
the<00:04:45.450> adjustable<00:04:45.930> cut<00:04:46.140> for<00:04:46.470> positions<00:04:47.070> the

the adjustable cut for positions the

the adjustable cut for positions the
steering<00:04:48.390> on<00:04:48.510> this<00:04:48.690> thing<00:04:48.900> is<00:04:49.020> really<00:04:49.350> really

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
steering on this thing is really really

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.770 
steering on this thing is really really
light<00:04:50.430> duty<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.000> think<00:04:51.270> it's<00:04:51.360> got<00:04:51.510> plastic

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
light duty I think it's got plastic

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.050 
light duty I think it's got plastic
gears<00:04:52.410> up<00:04:52.590> in<00:04:52.770> there<00:04:52.980> when<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.580> crank<00:04:53.850> the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
gears up in there when you crank the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.540 
gears up in there when you crank the
wheels<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.690> you're<00:04:55.470> moving<00:04:55.890> sometimes<00:04:56.160> they

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
wheels and you're moving sometimes they

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.700 
wheels and you're moving sometimes they
don't<00:04:56.700> want<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.030> come<00:04:57.210> back<00:04:57.450> it<00:04:58.350> can<00:04:58.500> be<00:04:58.680> a

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
don't want to come back it can be a

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.930 
don't want to come back it can be a
little<00:04:58.980> bit<00:04:59.100> tricky<00:04:59.490> if<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.670> get<00:04:59.790> in<00:04:59.880> the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
little bit tricky if you get in the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.030 
little bit tricky if you get in the
corner<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:00.480> you<00:05:00.600> might<00:05:00.780> want<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.740> work<00:05:01.860> the

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
corner so you might want to work the

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.350 
corner so you might want to work the
clutch<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.310> little<00:05:02.640> bit<00:05:02.790> keep<00:05:02.940> your<00:05:03.090> foot<00:05:03.240> up

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
clutch a little bit keep your foot up

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.650 
clutch a little bit keep your foot up
there<00:05:03.480> in<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.630> clutch<00:05:03.870> so<00:05:04.170> there's<00:05:05.070> no

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
there in the clutch so there's no

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.880 
there in the clutch so there's no
crashing<00:05:06.660> into<00:05:07.020> stuff<00:05:07.080> when<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.620> steering

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
crashing into stuff when the steering

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:15.530 
crashing into stuff when the steering
locks<00:05:08.250> up<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:13.490> looks<00:05:14.490> really<00:05:14.880> super<00:05:15.300> cheap

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
locks up it looks really super cheap

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.200 
locks up it looks really super cheap
with<00:05:15.720> these<00:05:15.870> little<00:05:16.430> steel<00:05:17.430> light<00:05:17.910> steel

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
tubes here but it seems to be adequate

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.240

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
is cutting a pretty level yard if you

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.300 
is cutting a pretty level yard if you

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
want this thing this thing's for in town

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.290 
want this thing this thing's for in town
where<00:05:31.350> you<00:05:31.410> don't<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.740> huge<00:05:32.070> yard<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.730> you

don't have a lot of obstacles because

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.350 
don't have a lot of obstacles because
it's<00:05:35.070> pretty<00:05:35.250> awkward<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.760> put<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.030> thing<00:05:36.210> in

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
it's pretty awkward to put the thing in

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.310 
it's pretty awkward to put the thing in
Reverse<00:05:38.360> it's<00:05:39.360> certainly<00:05:39.750> nothing<00:05:40.169> like<00:05:40.290> a

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
Reverse it's certainly nothing like a

00:05:40.320 --> 00:06:29.800 
Reverse it's certainly nothing like a
zero<00:05:40.740> radius

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:40.930 

I<00:06:39.280> think<00:06:40.280> one<00:06:40.430> thing<00:06:40.580> that<00:06:40.700> would<00:06:40.760> probably

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
I think one thing that would probably

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.580 
I think one thing that would probably
concern<00:06:41.330> me<00:06:41.510> a<00:06:41.540> little<00:06:41.780> bit<00:06:41.990> for<00:06:42.050> durability

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
concern me a little bit for durability

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.620 
concern me a little bit for durability
is<00:06:42.980> when<00:06:43.250> you<00:06:43.340> engage<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:43.850> mower<00:06:44.030> it<00:06:44.270> catches

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
is when you engage the mower it catches

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.470 
is when you engage the mower it catches
on<00:06:44.750> a<00:06:44.810> little<00:06:45.110> plastic<00:06:45.620> hook<00:06:45.880> which<00:06:46.880> I<00:06:47.120> don't

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
on a little plastic hook which I don't

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.320 
on a little plastic hook which I don't
see<00:06:47.720> that<00:06:47.930> lasting<00:06:48.500> forever

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
see that lasting forever

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.490 
see that lasting forever
and<00:06:50.330> I<00:06:50.570> don't<00:06:50.780> think<00:06:50.960> this<00:06:51.050> mower<00:06:51.260> was

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
and I don't think this mower was

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.190 
and I don't think this mower was
designed<00:06:51.889> to<00:06:52.010> last<00:06:52.220> forever<00:06:52.460> I<00:06:52.910> was<00:06:53.480> paying<00:06:53.690> at

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
designed to last forever I was paying at

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.330 
designed to last forever I was paying at
least<00:06:54.310> $600<00:06:55.310> a<00:06:55.400> year<00:06:55.490> for<00:06:55.820> lawn<00:06:56.030> here<00:06:56.389> and<00:06:57.340> I

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
least $600 a year for lawn here and I

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.830 
least $600 a year for lawn here and I
don't<00:06:58.550> even<00:06:58.790> think<00:06:58.910> I<00:06:59.060> could<00:06:59.150> replace<00:06:59.480> it<00:06:59.540> for

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
don't even think I could replace it for

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.969 
don't even think I could replace it for
that<00:07:01.389> that<00:07:02.389> was<00:07:02.570> really<00:07:02.870> cheap<00:07:03.110> 25<00:07:03.560> bucks<00:07:03.800> a

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
that that was really cheap 25 bucks a

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.140 
that that was really cheap 25 bucks a
week<00:07:04.160> I<00:07:05.950> figure<00:07:06.950> if<00:07:07.190> this<00:07:07.370> thing<00:07:07.610> makes<00:07:07.820> it<00:07:08.000> two

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150 
week I figure if this thing makes it two

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.260 
week I figure if this thing makes it two
years<00:07:08.450> I'm<00:07:08.660> money<00:07:08.870> ahead<00:07:09.220> and<00:07:10.220> I<00:07:10.820> figure<00:07:11.120> after

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
years I'm money ahead and I figure after

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.760 
years I'm money ahead and I figure after
two<00:07:11.540> years<00:07:11.810> I'd<00:07:11.960> probably<00:07:12.110> sell<00:07:12.440> the<00:07:12.590> thing

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
two years I'd probably sell the thing

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.350 
two years I'd probably sell the thing
and<00:07:12.919> buy<00:07:13.070> another<00:07:13.340> one<00:07:13.550> because<00:07:13.760> I<00:07:13.880> don't<00:07:14.180> know

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
and buy another one because I don't know

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.030 
and buy another one because I don't know
if<00:07:14.540> it<00:07:14.630> would<00:07:14.720> last<00:07:14.990> three<00:07:15.290> years<00:07:15.560> it's<00:07:15.770> pretty

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
if it would last three years it's pretty

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.580 
if it would last three years it's pretty
cheaply<00:07:16.460> constructed<00:07:17.210> it<00:07:17.960> is<00:07:18.020> what<00:07:18.350> it<00:07:18.470> is

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
cheaply constructed it is what it is

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.620 
cheaply constructed it is what it is
about<00:07:18.770> a<00:07:18.970> $750<00:07:19.970> lawn<00:07:20.240> mower

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:20.630 
about a $750 lawn mower

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.800 
about a $750 lawn mower
it<00:07:21.380> beats<00:07:21.710> pushing<00:07:22.130> the<00:07:22.190> mower<00:07:22.430> but<00:07:23.300> only<00:07:23.479> by

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.810 
it beats pushing the mower but only by

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.830 
it beats pushing the mower but only by
one<00:07:24.290> step<00:07:24.740> so<00:07:25.160> if<00:07:25.610> you<00:07:25.729> have<00:07:25.910> a<00:07:25.940> big<00:07:26.180> yard<00:07:26.210> don't
