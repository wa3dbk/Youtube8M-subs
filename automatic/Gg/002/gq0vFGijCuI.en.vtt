00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.789 

so<00:01:36.070> let's<00:01:36.490> find<00:01:36.729> our<00:01:37.079> mutual<00:01:38.079> safety<00:01:38.530> strip

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
so let's find our mutual safety strip

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.440 
so let's find our mutual safety strip
here

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.280 

the<00:01:45.900> neutral<00:01:46.229> safety<00:01:46.439> stickers<00:01:47.009> right<00:01:47.189> there

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290
