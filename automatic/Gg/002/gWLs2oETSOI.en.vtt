00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.220
 do not 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.719
 and all and welcome universal networks 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.309
 how are we today 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.109
 good excuse that yesterday we would have 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 video but it's that this last week well 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.890
 before the holidays is a bit like 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.980
 say it 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.859
 good is busy are the last days 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.919
 and such truth is that there is no task 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.199
 I did not have time to climb 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.800
 jet videos and I hope tomorrow I can 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.480
 upload it I do not know I hope so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 well said this today yes there is video and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 follow the video is called text hilux the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.370
 application available for ipad in the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.559
 apple store and basically it is an editor 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.050
 of texts and as simple as this a 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.820
 text editor text editor 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.149
 will allow us to make texts both 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 for office as for pdf from the cetra 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.030
 let's see how babies work 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.070
 it's very minimalist it's very good very 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.340
 simple we have here the adjustments part 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.870
 good nonsense that the application has 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.240
 edit that helps us to move 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.009
 basically the texts and the together 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.800
 you can do a libretica as you are 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.179
 seeing and the truth is that it is quite 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.729
 pretty good although this from the 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:18.660
 libretite has its function in the version 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.130
 pro but in this in this version no 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.130
 the truth has too much function 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.780
 and we return 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.520
 exact I say that in this version it does not have 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.950
 a lot of function and why you will see 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.149
 because in the free version only 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.350
 We can store three new documents 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.360
 Instantly let's say I mean here 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.680
 you see that I have one and in the folder I have 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.290
 two more no 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.370
 what do we have to do well then we have 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.330
 what to do is eliminate one to be able to 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.750
 create another be now you are going to see 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.520
 you see now that I only have here this 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.690
 so if I created a new document 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.950
 will leave me ok if he created another one too 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.540
 I'm going to leave because it's the second 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.030
 new document these two that you see here 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.619
 that you are designed are examples but 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.770
 another one does not let me know what the trick is 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.910
 Well, the trick is to open 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.070
 the document and export it as it can be 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.230
 by email if it suits you better or with dropbox 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.600
 what I recommend most is dropbox the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.110
 truth we put it in dropbox in the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.270
 format that we want impact and 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.680
 we already have it that simple and then 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.930
 we can delete it from this application 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.420
 because we will have it in dropbox and 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.970
 we can create infinite documents this 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.040
 It is the real trick you almendruco 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.690
 you are very, very good if you apply this trick 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.280
 and so you will not have to buy the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.890
 payment application that I think is worth 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.930
 about five arms good now we're going to 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.930
 see how the theme of the texts works 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.510
 As you can see it is very simple, it has the keyboard 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.490
 here below pim pam pim pam can 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.240
 write after we have a button here 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.820
 to change the font size 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.010
 the difference between line the color of the 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.470
 letter everything we go what comes to be the 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.290
 letter after we also have here for 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.230
 change the size here quickly 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.690
 I want you are watching to be able to do 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.570
 line breaks is the button this that 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.390
 You see here in the middle web and follow that there 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.980
 a two little arrows and like a bar 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.170
 blue with that we can go up and down 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.900
 the line as you are seeing what I am 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.210
 doing what else we have out there good 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.840
 the justified paragraph type center 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.840
 right to the left 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.790
 although more to have fonts of 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.310
 fixed letters that is for titles for 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.530
 subtitles etcetera et cetera but already the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.790
 predetermined that come if we give to 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.349
 infinite this is very good because 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.599
 we have here in different things like 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.080
 It can be a web link to add links 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.950
 for arrow be flechitas and formulas 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.780
 good mathematics mathematical symbols 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.329
 pictograms etc and so on a lot 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.769
 of things symbols little things that the truth 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.049
 is that in this way it adds very 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.200
 easily underlined of all life 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.209
 italics in bold and here we have a 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.920
 quick access to different symbols of the 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.050
 keyboard so as not to have to vary 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.900
 10 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.850
 This would basically everything all the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.470
 text process the truth is very 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.110
 simple takes everything here in the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.700
 keyboard does not have absurd spaces to 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.530
 occupy is quite minimalist as os 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.000
 I said but it's perfect to be able 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.370
 write comfortably and quickly 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.140
 because since on the iPad we always have 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.030
 the fingers on the bottom in the 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.830
 keyboard and so we do not have to go up 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.290
 upwards 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.480
 to give to I do not know that I do not know how many 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.120
 truth is that the interface is very good 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.330
 it's very easy to use and for me one of 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.120
 the best text processors that 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.590
 I am there in now and as you 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.720
 I say the trick to not have to 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.030
 buy it is export it where you want 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.670
 you who see here and so not what 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.610
 we will have to save in the application 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.050
 and it's also true that adjustments that I do not know 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.520
 why it's called adjustments would have to 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.190
 have a little arrow to look for or something 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.010
 would have more logic because we can jump 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.710
 directly to google to wikipedia at 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.990
 dictionary and so on you do naron for 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.790
 example if I give google and I jump 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.970
 directly to google if it gives you already 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.770
 dictionary goes directly to me though 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.550
 download the dictionary application 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.230
 for this website on the battery and 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.630
 basically this is not how you are seeing 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.630
 It is very, very, very good 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.980
 well we also have vision to screen 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.690
 complete and such 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.060
 as I said is an application that 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.380
 It is very, very good and that 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.080
 I recommend 100% 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.419
 louis 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.300
 there we are we have to double-click 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.360
 they will leave documents and they are saved 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.990
 automatically 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.539
 and I know that this application is very useful 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.069
 for all those who have to 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.050
 Do some work with the iPad 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.060
 once in a while it will give us something 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.409
 even good as an agenda not so much 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.050
 because not being able to save more 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.819
 documents but not to get us out of 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.090
 a hurry at some point we can go 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.889
 very, very good and said is wrong to give 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.479
 like this video they liked it as 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.099
 always subscribe to the channel for new 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:17.860
 free apps from Monday to 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.860
 Friday and days 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.820
 etc
