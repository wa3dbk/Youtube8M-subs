00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.259 
is it hunters it's a player map well
there<00:02:52.470> will<00:02:52.709> be<00:02:52.769> scouting<00:02:53.250> necessary<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.180> be

there will be scouting necessary to be

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.729 
there will be scouting necessary to be

to even figure out who to attack and
where<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.030> danger<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.329> coming<00:03:00.419> from<00:03:00.719> I<00:03:00.930> think

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
where the danger is coming from I think

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.300 
where the danger is coming from I think
there<00:03:01.349> might<00:03:01.439> be<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> little<00:03:01.829> bit<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.099> advantage

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
there might be a little bit of advantage

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.089 
there might be a little bit of advantage
for<00:03:02.730> tester<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.359> because<00:03:03.840> he<00:03:03.959> has<00:03:04.169> the<00:03:04.200> 12

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
for tester here because he has the 12

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.220 
for tester here because he has the 12
and<00:03:05.310> he<00:03:05.700> could<00:03:06.030> theoretically<00:03:06.389> get<00:03:07.109> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
and he could theoretically get the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.190 
and he could theoretically get the
expansion<00:03:07.799> either<00:03:08.519> at<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.849> element<00:03:09.689> clock<00:03:09.959> or

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
expansion either at the element clock or

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.670 
expansion either at the element clock or
the<00:03:10.379> inside<00:03:10.739> 11<00:03:10.980> o'clock<00:03:11.189> and<00:03:11.459> looks<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.239> um

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
the inside 11 o'clock and looks like um

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.899 
the inside 11 o'clock and looks like um
it<00:03:13.680> looks<00:03:13.739> like<00:03:14.040> com<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.519> going<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:14.879> his

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
it looks like com is going for his

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.059 
it looks like com is going for his
second<00:03:15.329> hatchery<00:03:15.689> and<00:03:15.719> a<00:03:15.959> creep<00:03:16.680> colony

second hatchery and a creep colony
protect<00:03:17.370> himself<00:03:17.519> against<00:03:17.879> an<00:03:17.970> early<00:03:18.239> rush<00:03:18.470> so

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
protect himself against an early rush so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.409 
protect himself against an early rush so
his<00:03:19.709> 12<00:03:20.129> pool<00:03:20.549> is<00:03:20.790> going<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> be<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> little<00:03:21.299> more

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
his 12 pool is going to be a little more

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.449 
his 12 pool is going to be a little more
effective<00:03:21.540> than<00:03:21.989> he<00:03:22.229> was<00:03:22.409> nine<00:03:22.620> pool<00:03:22.889> if<00:03:23.099> he

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
effective than he was nine pool if he

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.729 
effective than he was nine pool if he
manages<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.849> not<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.900> injured<00:03:25.079> in<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.500> early

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
manages to not get injured in the early

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.530 
manages to not get injured in the early
game<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.459> looks<00:03:26.669> like<00:03:26.790> Boston's<00:03:27.239> actually

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
game and looks like Boston's actually

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.300 
game and looks like Boston's actually
shared<00:03:27.780> vision<00:03:28.049> with<00:03:28.169> everyone<00:03:28.500> now<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.829> he

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
shared vision with everyone now and he

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.129 
shared vision with everyone now and he
is<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.579> for<00:03:29.669> two<00:03:29.790> racks<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.329> he<00:03:30.659> is<00:03:30.750> looking

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
is going for two racks so he is looking

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.050 
is going for two racks so he is looking
like<00:03:31.379> he's<00:03:31.530> going<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.709> go<00:03:31.799> for<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> medic<00:03:32.489> marine

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
gas anymore so definitely going uh just

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.930 
gas anymore so definitely going uh just
for<00:04:47.740> surgeons<00:04:48.100> here<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.460> he<00:04:48.550> needs<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.790> get

out his base and do some damage to kiva

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.950 
out his base and do some damage to kiva
or<00:04:50.740> else<00:04:50.890> where<00:04:51.850> else<00:04:52.000> he<00:04:52.450> was<00:04:52.570> gonna<00:04:52.690> be<00:04:52.780> far

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
or else where else he was gonna be far

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.720 
or else where else he was gonna be far
ahead<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.320> he's<00:04:53.410> mid<00:04:53.620> will<00:04:53.770> just<00:04:54.190> destroy<00:04:54.370> him

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
ahead and he's mid will just destroy him

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.610 
ahead and he's mid will just destroy him
with<00:04:55.030> muta<00:04:55.360> list<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.750> guess<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.170> other<00:04:56.320> option

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
with muta list I guess the other option

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.020 
with muta list I guess the other option
is<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.800> get<00:04:57.010> some<00:04:57.160> sport<00:04:57.400> colonies<00:04:57.760> but<00:04:57.880> those

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
is to get some sport colonies but those

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.150 
is to get some sport colonies but those
would<00:04:58.240> set<00:04:58.600> him<00:04:58.690> back<00:04:58.810> even<00:04:59.050> further<00:04:59.440> in<00:04:59.800> his

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
would set him back even further in his

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160 
would set him back even further in his
in<00:05:00.460> his<00:05:00.520> tack<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.060> in<00:05:01.240> this<00:05:01.390> entire<00:05:01.690> game<00:05:01.810> and

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
in his tack and in this entire game and

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.230 
in his tack and in this entire game and
looks<00:05:02.590> like<00:05:02.710> I'm<00:05:02.860> actually<00:05:03.130> looks<00:05:03.820> like<00:05:03.910> Kiba

looks like I'm actually looks like Kiba

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.060 
looks like I'm actually looks like Kiba
is<00:05:04.390> about<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:04.780> uh<00:05:04.810> he<00:05:05.590> was<00:05:05.710> getting<00:05:05.890> pushed

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
is about to uh he was getting pushed

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.710 
is about to uh he was getting pushed
back<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.250> little<00:05:06.460> rather<00:05:06.670> comments<00:05:07.210> about<00:05:07.600> to

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
back a little rather comments about to

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.970 
back a little rather comments about to
move<00:05:07.870> out<00:05:07.990> looks<00:05:08.200> like<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.410> first<00:05:08.590> medics<00:05:08.860> out

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
move out looks like the first medics out

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.160 
move out looks like the first medics out
for<00:05:09.160> Hassan<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:09.700> looks<00:05:10.300> like<00:05:10.420> tester<00:05:10.780> smartly

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
for Hassan and looks like tester smartly

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.840 
for Hassan and looks like tester smartly
is<00:05:11.290> building<00:05:11.530> some<00:05:11.680> photon<00:05:12.010> cannons<00:05:12.340> in<00:05:12.430> front

is building some photon cannons in front

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.640 
is building some photon cannons in front
of<00:05:13.030> he<00:05:13.570> was<00:05:13.750> based<00:05:13.960> providing<00:05:14.500> some

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
of he was based providing some

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.960 
of he was based providing some
protection<00:05:15.040> and<00:05:15.160> photon<00:05:15.460> cannons<00:05:15.730> are<00:05:15.820> quite

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
protection and photon cannons are quite

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.570 
protection and photon cannons are quite
effective<00:05:16.390> against<00:05:16.600> medical<00:05:17.290> marines<00:05:17.740> and

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
effective against medical marines and

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.240 
effective against medical marines and
looks<00:05:19.060> like<00:05:19.180> I'm<00:05:19.360> perhaps<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.320> escrow<00:05:21.070> team

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
looks like I'm perhaps the escrow team

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.610 
looks like I'm perhaps the escrow team
is<00:05:21.370> thinking<00:05:21.940> about<00:05:22.200> retreating<00:05:23.200> towards

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
is thinking about retreating towards

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.380 
is thinking about retreating towards
those<00:05:23.710> photon<00:05:24.100> cannons<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.610> using<00:05:25.240> them<00:05:25.360> in

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
those photon cannons and using them in

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.430 
those photon cannons and using them in
their<00:05:25.630> defense<00:05:25.900> it<00:05:26.050> looks<00:05:26.170> like<00:05:26.260> they<00:05:26.410> have

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
their defense it looks like they have

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.410 
their defense it looks like they have
done<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:26.920> tester<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:27.460> hiva<00:05:27.790> have<00:05:27.940> put<00:05:28.390> all

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
done that tester and hiva have put all

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.820 
done that tester and hiva have put all
their<00:05:28.720> troops<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.140> near<00:05:29.380> those<00:05:29.500> photon

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
their troops on near those photon

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.980 
their troops on near those photon
cannons<00:05:30.100> it<00:05:30.190> looks<00:05:30.340> like<00:05:30.460> now<00:05:30.850> the<00:05:30.910> STX<00:05:31.750> team

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
cannons it looks like now the STX team

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.360 
cannons it looks like now the STX team
has<00:05:32.140> a<00:05:32.170> center<00:05:32.470> than<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.740> but<00:05:32.830> of<00:05:32.920> course<00:05:33.190> on

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
has a center than that but of course on

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.610 
has a center than that but of course on
hunters<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.390> senator<00:05:34.690> nap<00:05:34.840> is<00:05:34.990> critical

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
hunters the senator nap is critical

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.780 
hunters the senator nap is critical
absolutely<00:05:35.770> critical<00:05:36.100> to<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.640> progress

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
absolutely critical to the progress

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.400 
absolutely critical to the progress
again<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.450> looks<00:05:37.660> like<00:05:37.750> now<00:05:37.900> about<00:05:38.170> attack

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
again it looks like now about attack

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.950 
again it looks like now about attack
about<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.800> happen<00:05:38.980> here<00:05:39.660> looks<00:05:40.660> like<00:05:40.780> I'm

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
about to happen here looks like I'm

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.560 
about to happen here looks like I'm
looks<00:05:41.410> like<00:05:41.530> eva<00:05:41.830> is<00:05:42.010> uh<00:05:42.070> I'm<00:05:42.760> sorry<00:05:42.940> I<00:05:43.060> calm<00:05:43.420> is

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.330 
looks like eva is uh I'm sorry I calm is

waiting for his Alan to come up waiting
for<00:05:45.490> Watson<00:05:45.760> a<00:05:45.820> common<00:05:46.030> looks<00:05:46.210> like<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.450> first

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
for Watson a common looks like the first

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.750 
for Watson a common looks like the first
new<00:05:46.810> litter<00:05:47.080> about<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.440> come<00:05:47.560> out<00:05:47.650> for<00:05:47.890> Heba

sport<00:05:53.470> but<00:05:53.590> look<00:05:53.680> at<00:05:53.800> how<00:05:54.130> few<00:05:54.310> drones<00:05:54.550> he<00:05:54.760> has

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
sport but look at how few drones he has

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.730 
sport but look at how few drones he has
despite<00:05:55.180> going<00:05:55.450> for<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.630> 12<00:05:55.900> pool<00:05:56.140> he<00:05:56.620> has<00:05:56.710> a

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
despite going for a 12 pool he has a

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.350 
despite going for a 12 pool he has a
probably<00:05:57.220> just<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.490> same<00:05:57.670> number<00:05:57.850> of<00:05:57.970> drones

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
probably just the same number of drones

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.960 
probably just the same number of drones
mining<00:05:58.810> minerals<00:05:59.110> as<00:05:59.530> um<00:05:59.800> Kiba<00:06:00.520> does<00:06:00.670> so<00:06:00.790> he's

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
mining minerals as um Kiba does so he's

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.610 
mining minerals as um Kiba does so he's
really<00:06:01.180> has<00:06:01.360> lost<00:06:01.630> economic<00:06:01.870> advantage<00:06:02.470> and

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
really has lost economic advantage and

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.660 
really has lost economic advantage and
he<00:06:02.710> hasn't<00:06:02.980> gained<00:06:03.160> much<00:06:03.340> of<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.490> tech

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
he hasn't gained much of a tech

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.950 
he hasn't gained much of a tech
advantage<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.300> now<00:06:04.390> big<00:06:04.570> attack<00:06:04.780> in<00:06:04.900> the

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
advantage and now big attack in the

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.510 
advantage and now big attack in the
middle<00:06:05.170> here<00:06:05.200> I<00:06:05.530> don't<00:06:06.130> think<00:06:06.250> it<00:06:06.310> was<00:06:06.370> a<00:06:06.430> good

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
middle here I don't think it was a good

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.890 
middle here I don't think it was a good
idea<00:06:06.580> for<00:06:06.850> tester<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.270> he<00:06:07.420> wouldn't<00:06:07.630> move<00:06:07.750> out

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
idea for tester and he wouldn't move out

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.720 
idea for tester and he wouldn't move out
just<00:06:08.140> yet<00:06:08.260> because<00:06:08.410> they<00:06:09.250> really<00:06:09.520> need<00:06:09.670> the

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
just yet because they really need the

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.010 
just yet because they really need the
protection<00:06:09.850> of<00:06:10.150> those<00:06:10.330> cannons<00:06:10.690> if<00:06:10.900> their

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
protection of those cannons if their

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.540 
protection of those cannons if their
forces<00:06:11.320> died<00:06:11.620> then<00:06:11.830> those<00:06:11.980> organs<00:06:12.310> will<00:06:12.460> be

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
forces died then those organs will be

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.890 
forces died then those organs will be
able<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:12.760> swarm<00:06:13.030> those<00:06:13.180> cans<00:06:13.390> quite<00:06:13.660> easily

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
able to swarm those cans quite easily

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.990 
able to swarm those cans quite easily
and<00:06:14.230> then<00:06:14.710> perhaps<00:06:15.070> do<00:06:15.310> a<00:06:15.340> lot<00:06:15.580> of<00:06:15.610> damage<00:06:15.880> to

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
and then perhaps do a lot of damage to

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.790 
and then perhaps do a lot of damage to
he<00:06:16.450> was<00:06:16.600> main<00:06:16.720> base<00:06:16.900> now<00:06:17.110> he<00:06:17.170> were<00:06:17.410> picking<00:06:17.680> off

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
he was main base now he were picking off

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.500 
he was main base now he were picking off
an<00:06:17.920> overlord<00:06:18.280> and<00:06:18.400> looks<00:06:18.940> like<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.210> sport
