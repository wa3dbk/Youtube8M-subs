things like that hence why the movie

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.440 
things like that hence why the movie
could<00:00:53.860> be<00:00:53.950> taking<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.310> little<00:00:54.430> bit<00:00:54.579> longer<00:00:54.910> but

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
could be taking a little bit longer but

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.290 
could be taking a little bit longer but
he<00:00:55.690> did<00:00:55.899> say<00:00:56.230> I<00:00:56.680> still<00:00:57.130> have<00:00:57.309> no<00:00:57.550> idea<00:00:57.579> when<00:00:58.210> it

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
he did say I still have no idea when it

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.420 
he did say I still have no idea when it
would<00:00:58.420> come<00:00:58.450> out<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:59.050> long<00:00:59.350> time<00:00:59.380> i'm<00:01:00.160> gonna

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
would come out a long time i'm gonna

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.580 
would come out a long time i'm gonna
guess<00:01:00.700> three<00:01:01.300> years<00:01:01.600> but<00:01:01.930> it<00:01:02.020> could<00:01:02.140> be<00:01:02.260> for

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
guess three years but it could be for

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.829 
guess three years but it could be for
probably<00:01:03.340> not<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:03.880> three<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.629> four<00:01:04.809> years

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
probably not to three to four years

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.530 
probably not to three to four years
seems<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.530> be<00:01:05.619> a<00:01:05.649> reasonable<00:01:06.280> bet<00:01:06.540> stressing

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
seems to be a reasonable bet stressing

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.600 
seems to be a reasonable bet stressing
that<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.840> project<00:01:08.079> remains<00:01:08.590> in<00:01:08.830> early<00:01:09.310> stages

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610
