00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
movement mechanics tutorial I really

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.070 
movement mechanics tutorial I really
want<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.440> say<00:00:07.560> Unreal<00:00:08.010> Tournament<00:00:08.059> but<00:00:09.080> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
want to say Unreal Tournament but the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.900 
want to say Unreal Tournament but the
movement<00:00:10.469> can't<00:00:10.620> mechanics<00:00:11.309> provided<00:00:11.820> in

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910

movement can't mechanics provided in
this<00:00:12.030> story<00:00:12.300> Oh<00:00:12.500> aren't<00:00:13.500> specific<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.340> Unreal

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
this story Oh aren't specific to Unreal

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.019 
this story Oh aren't specific to Unreal
Tournament<00:00:15.770> and<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.369> let's<00:00:17.550> quickly<00:00:17.730> go<00:00:18.000> over

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
Tournament and so let's quickly go over

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.590 
Tournament and so let's quickly go over
what<00:00:18.150> those<00:00:18.359> are<00:00:18.949> we<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.460> variable<00:00:21.210> run

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
what those are we have the variable run

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.769 
what those are we have the variable run
speed<00:00:21.900> which<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.269> I'm<00:00:24.510> moving

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
speed which is as you can see I'm moving

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.109 
speed which is as you can see I'm moving
quite<00:00:25.260> slow<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.800> now<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.160> scroll<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.550> once<00:00:26.880> I

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
quite slow right now I scroll up once I

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880 
quite slow right now I scroll up once I
move<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:27.570> faster<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.439> scroll<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
move a little faster and I scroll to the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.420 
move a little faster and I scroll to the
max<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.580> now<00:00:30.179> I'm<00:00:30.240> running<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.660> full<00:00:30.840> speed

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
max and now I'm running at full speed

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
max and now I'm running at full speed
this<00:00:32.430> might<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.880> more<00:00:33.120> useful<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> stealth

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this might be more useful in the stealth

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.650 
this might be more useful in the stealth
type<00:00:34.440> game<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:36.230> that's<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.399> also<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
type game and that's it we have also a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.100 
type game and that's it we have also a
double<00:00:40.170> jump<00:00:41.030> seen<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.239> previous<00:00:42.420> tutorials

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
double jump seen in previous tutorials

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.860 
double jump seen in previous tutorials
we<00:00:44.030> have<00:00:45.289> -<00:00:46.289> left<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.600> can

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
we have - left and right and you can

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.250 
we have - left and right and you can
also<00:00:51.989> -<00:00:52.590> an<00:00:52.860> air<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:55.469> clues<00:00:55.770> forward<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.370> back

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
also - an air it clues forward in back

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:07.100 
also - an air it clues forward in back
but<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> also<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:59.000> the<00:01:00.000> wall<00:01:00.300> jump<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:06.110> we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
but you also have the wall jump so we

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.130 
but you also have the wall jump so we
also<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.580> wall<00:01:08.760> running<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.020> way

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
also have the wall running so the way

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.410 
also have the wall running so the way
this<00:01:10.290> works<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.250> jump<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.729> then

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this works is you do one jump and then

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
this works is you do one jump and then
the<00:01:12.570> second<00:01:13.049> jump<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.159> typically

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the second jump that you are typically

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.789 
the second jump that you are typically
doing<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> air<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.659> press<00:01:15.960> space<00:01:16.110> again<00:01:16.259> on

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
doing the air you press space again on

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.450 
doing the air you press space again on
the<00:01:17.070> wall<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:17.970> begin<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> wall<00:01:18.900> running

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.609 

but<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.850> also<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.780> another<00:01:24.900> jump

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but then you can also do another jump

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.149 
but then you can also do another jump
off<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.400> wall<00:01:26.580> once<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.000> finish<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.009> can

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
off the wall once you finish so you can

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.640 
off the wall once you finish so you can
create<00:01:29.340> some<00:01:29.520> pretty<00:01:29.880> cool<00:01:30.119> combinations<00:01:30.869> now

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
create some pretty cool combinations now

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.960 
create some pretty cool combinations now
there's<00:01:31.890> also<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.790> regular<00:01:33.450> wall<00:01:33.720> jump<00:01:35.630> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
there's also the regular wall jump and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.830 
there's also the regular wall jump and
lastly<00:01:38.970> there's<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.900> sprint<00:01:41.270> which<00:01:42.270> only<00:01:42.540> lasts

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
lastly there's a sprint which only lasts

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.899 
lastly there's a sprint which only lasts
for<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.409> certain<00:01:43.860> amount<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.130> stamina<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
for a certain amount of stamina that you

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.330 
for a certain amount of stamina that you
have<00:01:45.229> created<00:01:48.110> now<00:01:49.110> there's<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:50.040> wot

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
have created now there's also a wot

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.730 
have created now there's also a wot
dodge<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.659> you're<00:01:51.780> pointing<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.200> say<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
dodge so if you're pointing at say this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
dodge so if you're pointing at say this
angle<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.090> jump<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> jump<00:01:54.750> again

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
angle and you jump and you jump again

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.370 
angle and you jump and you jump again
it'll<00:01:55.649> push<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> little<00:01:56.310> bit<00:01:56.640> forward<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
it'll push you a little bit forward and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.340 
it'll push you a little bit forward and
that<00:01:58.380> bouncing<00:01:59.240> angle<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.200> this

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that bouncing angle and so is this

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
that bouncing angle and so is this
imagine<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.159> running<00:02:02.520> towards<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.820> wall

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
imagine if you're running towards a wall

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.020 
imagine if you're running towards a wall
in<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:04.049> air<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.290> jump<00:02:04.530> off<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> wall<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.969> know

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
in the air to jump off a wall you know

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.139 
in the air to jump off a wall you know
jump<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:07.129> roughly<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> same<00:02:08.550> anger<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.000> would

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
jump in roughly the same anger you would

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:17.820 
jump in roughly the same anger you would
in<00:02:09.270> real<00:02:09.420> life

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.320 

you<00:02:18.830> know<00:02:19.010> there's<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.310> little<00:02:19.790> push<00:02:20.090> right

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
you know there's a little push right

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.680 
you know there's a little push right
there<00:02:21.460> last<00:02:22.460> thing<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.760> want<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.060> show<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
there last thing we want to show is the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.410 
there last thing we want to show is the
double<00:02:24.440> jump<00:02:24.620> with<00:02:24.830> charge<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.240> is<00:02:26.390> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
double jump with charge and so this is a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.360 
double jump with charge and so this is a
normal<00:02:26.630> double<00:02:27.080> jump<00:02:27.410> look<00:02:27.710> at<00:02:27.860> ha<00:02:27.950> ha<00:02:28.100> power

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
normal double jump look at ha ha power

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.920 
normal double jump look at ha ha power
I'd<00:02:28.700> jump<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.060> air<00:02:31.270> just<00:02:32.270> above<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.600> line

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
I'd jump in the air just above that line

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
I'd jump in the air just above that line
now<00:02:33.620> I'm<00:02:33.680> gonna<00:02:33.800> hold<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.310> spacebar<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:35.210> one

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
now I'm gonna hold the spacebar for one

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.420 
now I'm gonna hold the spacebar for one
two<00:02:36.950> seconds<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:39.020> get<00:02:39.170> another<00:02:39.410> jump<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:40.220> can

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
two seconds and get another jump you can

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.510 
two seconds and get another jump you can
see<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.640> almost<00:02:40.910> reached<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.390> second<00:02:41.750> line<00:02:42.520> and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
see I almost reached the second line and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.250 
see I almost reached the second line and
so<00:02:43.730> those<00:02:44.120> are<00:02:44.150> just<00:02:44.420> some<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.900> movement

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
so those are just some of the movement

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.710 
so those are just some of the movement
mechanics<00:02:45.710> that<00:02:46.220> will<00:02:46.370> go<00:02:46.610> over<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.120> this

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
mechanics that will go over it in this

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.590 
mechanics that will go over it in this
series<00:02:48.700> one<00:02:49.700> thing<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.090> want<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.360> go<00:02:50.480> over

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
series one thing I want to go over

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.780 
series one thing I want to go over
before<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:50.960> get<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.350> is<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:52.370> pacing

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
before we get to that is is pacing

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.250 
before we get to that is is pacing
somebody<00:02:55.790> fundamentals<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.660> pacing<00:02:57.050> is

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
somebody fundamentals of pacing is

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260 
somebody fundamentals of pacing is
movement<00:02:58.130> impetus

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
movement impetus

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.040 
movement impetus
it's<00:03:00.170> basically<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.830> will<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.510> player<00:03:02.750> has

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
it's basically the will the player has

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.880 
it's basically the will the player has
to<00:03:03.080> move<00:03:03.730> why<00:03:04.730> would<00:03:05.000> this<00:03:05.150> person<00:03:05.360> move<00:03:05.890> is

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
to move why would this person move is

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.600 
to move why would this person move is
there<00:03:07.810> some<00:03:08.810> drive<00:03:09.290> behind<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.130> player<00:03:10.340> to

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
there some drive behind the player to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.640 
there some drive behind the player to
continue<00:03:11.210> moving<00:03:11.360> throughout<00:03:11.780> your<00:03:11.990> level<00:03:12.290> is

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
continue moving throughout your level is

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.680 
continue moving throughout your level is
it<00:03:12.950> inviting<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.700> there<00:03:13.910> angles

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
it inviting is there angles

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.620 
it inviting is there angles
does<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.830> shape<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.540> way<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.170> contours

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
does it shape in the way that contours

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.280 
does it shape in the way that contours
to<00:03:20.630> movement<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:23.120> for<00:03:23.300> example<00:03:23.810> if<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.080> see

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
to movement so for example if you see

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.410 
to movement so for example if you see
these<00:03:24.470> two<00:03:24.740> slabs<00:03:25.010> right<00:03:25.310> here<00:03:25.490> you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
these two slabs right here you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.030 
these two slabs right here you
immediately<00:03:26.780> want<00:03:26.960> to<00:03:27.140> run<00:03:27.380> up<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:27.800> wall

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
immediately want to run up to this wall

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.170 
immediately want to run up to this wall
and<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.930> ride<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.350> or<00:03:30.620> jump<00:03:31.490> it<00:03:31.700> or<00:03:31.880> do

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
and just ride it or jump it or do

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.970 
and just ride it or jump it or do
something<00:03:32.630> because<00:03:33.170> just<00:03:33.470> look<00:03:33.890> at

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
something because just look at

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.630 
something because just look at
everything<00:03:34.190> else<00:03:34.460> it's<00:03:35.270> shaped<00:03:35.780> like<00:03:35.900> boxes

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
everything else it's shaped like boxes

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.220 
everything else it's shaped like boxes
literally<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:38.660> it's<00:03:38.840> not<00:03:38.960> really

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
literally and so it's not really

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.170 
literally and so it's not really
inviting<00:03:39.680> at<00:03:39.800> all<00:03:39.950> even<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:40.790> area<00:03:41.060> right

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
inviting at all even this area right

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.490 
inviting at all even this area right
here<00:03:41.270> is<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.480> lot<00:03:41.690> more<00:03:41.870> inviting<00:03:42.110> than<00:03:42.320> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
here is a lot more inviting than the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.450 
here is a lot more inviting than the
rest<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.770> this<00:03:42.890> level<00:03:43.100> for<00:03:43.910> movement<00:03:44.260> because

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
rest of this level for movement because

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.370 
rest of this level for movement because
this<00:03:46.460> angles<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.270> same<00:03:47.450> goes<00:03:47.660> in<00:03:47.870> this<00:03:47.990> angles

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
this angles the same goes in this angles

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.890 
this angles the same goes in this angles
you<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.710> want<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.160> continue<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.880> flow<00:03:50.180> that

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
you just want to continue the flow that

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.300 
you just want to continue the flow that
is<00:03:51.140> created<00:03:51.740> by<00:03:51.950> this<00:03:52.010> wall<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.980> creates

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
is created by this wall and that creates

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.920 
is created by this wall and that creates
a<00:03:55.520> will<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.480> move<00:03:56.660> your<00:03:56.960> character<00:03:58.930> another

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
a will to move your character another

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.790 
a will to move your character another
thing<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:00.170> want<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.380> cover<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.910> threat<00:04:02.800> threat

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
thing you want to cover is threat threat

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.320 
thing you want to cover is threat threat
is<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:05.420> actual<00:04:06.080> danger<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:07.010> player<00:04:07.220> has<00:04:07.550> so

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
is the actual danger the player has so

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.690 
is the actual danger the player has so
that<00:04:08.600> would<00:04:08.840> be<00:04:09.020> players<00:04:09.530> that<00:04:09.650> are<00:04:09.920> close<00:04:10.280> to

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
that would be players that are close to

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.030 
that would be players that are close to
the<00:04:10.820> enemy<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.930> for<00:04:12.140> example<00:04:12.590> if<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:12.800> played

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
the enemy so for example if you played

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.730 
the enemy so for example if you played
quake<00:04:13.370> or<00:04:13.580> Unreal<00:04:14.030> Tournament<00:04:14.380> this<00:04:15.380> would<00:04:15.590> be

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
quake or Unreal Tournament this would be

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.910 
quake or Unreal Tournament this would be
something<00:04:16.720> open<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.989> basically<00:04:18.500> speed

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
something open this is basically speed

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.390 
something open this is basically speed
though<00:04:19.040> are<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.250> players<00:04:19.489> as<00:04:19.820> all<00:04:20.150> there<00:04:20.390> is

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
though are the players as all there is

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.220 
though are the players as all there is
so<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.640> actual<00:04:23.390> threat<00:04:23.600> would<00:04:23.930> be<00:04:24.110> the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
so the actual threat would be the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.730 
so the actual threat would be the
players<00:04:24.440> how<00:04:24.650> close<00:04:24.950> it<00:04:25.160> can<00:04:25.280> get

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
players how close it can get

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.029 
players how close it can get
and<00:04:26.340> this<00:04:27.210> is<00:04:27.419> what<00:04:28.080> affects<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.560> pacing<00:04:28.919> as

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
and this is what affects the pacing as

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.150 
and this is what affects the pacing as
well<00:04:29.250> if<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.759> player<00:04:29.940> can<00:04:30.180> get<00:04:30.300> close<00:04:30.509> to<00:04:30.539> you

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
well if the player can get close to you

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.010 
well if the player can get close to you
there's<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.310> sense<00:04:32.669> that<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:33.300> have<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.870> keep

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
there's a sense that you have to keep

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.559 
there's a sense that you have to keep
moving<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:35.669> another<00:04:35.910> one<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.150> want<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.419> talk

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
moving so another one I want to talk

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.320 
moving so another one I want to talk
about<00:04:36.720> is<00:04:37.020> tension<00:04:37.530> tension<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.759> the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
about is tension tension is the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.529 
about is tension tension is the
atmosphere<00:04:40.050> or<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.830> mood<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.490> game<00:04:41.539> or

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
atmosphere or the mood of the game or

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.439 
atmosphere or the mood of the game or
essentially<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.470> perceived<00:04:44.220> fear<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:44.970> the

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
essentially the perceived fear in the

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:45.980 
essentially the perceived fear in the
game

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
game

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.150 
game
this<00:04:46.229> is<00:04:46.440> level<00:04:46.770> feel<00:04:47.130> like<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:48.560> want<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.770> keep

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
this is level feel like I want to keep

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.740 
this is level feel like I want to keep
moving<00:04:50.610> or<00:04:50.639> it<00:04:50.819> doesn't<00:04:50.970> make<00:04:51.210> me<00:04:51.419> want<00:04:51.449> to

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750

moving<00:05:09.090> because<00:05:09.449> that<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.889> world<00:05:11.160> just<00:05:11.729> feels

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
moving because that the world just feels

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.710 
moving because that the world just feels
uneasy<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:15.289> unsafe<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:18.060> last<00:05:18.270> thing<00:05:18.539> we<00:05:18.690> want

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
uneasy and unsafe the last thing we want

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.670 
uneasy and unsafe the last thing we want
to<00:05:18.960> touch<00:05:19.080> on<00:05:19.289> this<00:05:19.699> temple<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:22.020> temple<00:05:22.409> is

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
to touch on this temple the temple is

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.950 
to touch on this temple the temple is
the<00:05:22.860> actions<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.520> player<00:05:23.759> has<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.270> experience

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
the actions the player has to experience

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.589 
the actions the player has to experience
during<00:05:25.889> gameplay

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
during gameplay

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.820 
during gameplay
so<00:05:27.599> in<00:05:27.750> Unreal<00:05:28.740> Tournament<00:05:28.770> or<00:05:29.400> quake<00:05:29.699> again

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
so in Unreal Tournament or quake again

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.850 
so in Unreal Tournament or quake again
this<00:05:31.830> is<00:05:32.039> constant<00:05:32.580> need<00:05:32.759> to<00:05:33.000> move<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:34.620> the

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
this is constant need to move so the

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.240 
this is constant need to move so the
tempo<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.370> game<00:05:35.400> is<00:05:35.759> pretty<00:05:36.570> high<00:05:37.250> you

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
tempo of the game is pretty high you

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.580 
tempo of the game is pretty high you
have<00:05:38.280> to<00:05:38.550> keep<00:05:38.909> moving<00:05:39.330> if<00:05:39.599> you<00:05:40.199> don't<00:05:40.380> keep

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
have to keep moving if you don't keep

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.620 
have to keep moving if you don't keep
moving<00:05:40.979> you'll<00:05:41.639> likely<00:05:41.880> die

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
moving you'll likely die

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.420 
moving you'll likely die
and<00:05:43.229> so<00:05:43.409> that<00:05:43.590> creates<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.919> tempo<00:05:44.219> with<00:05:44.310> the

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
and so that creates the tempo with the

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.839 
and so that creates the tempo with the
game<00:05:44.580> last<00:05:44.849> way<00:05:45.090> people<00:05:45.659> call<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:45.990> fast-paced

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
game last way people call it fast-paced

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.540 
game last way people call it fast-paced
it's<00:05:47.849> this<00:05:48.060> constant<00:05:48.539> need<00:05:48.599> to<00:05:48.900> move<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:50.250> it

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
it's this constant need to move and it

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.670 
it's this constant need to move and it
since<00:05:51.330> it<00:05:51.479> gets<00:05:51.570> your<00:05:51.780> your<00:05:52.169> blood<00:05:52.380> pumping

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
since it gets your your blood pumping

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.430 
since it gets your your blood pumping
you<00:05:53.159> know<00:05:53.280> it's<00:05:53.759> real<00:05:54.000> intense<00:05:54.419> it<00:05:55.020> feels<00:05:55.229> like

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
you know it's real intense it feels like

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.110 
you know it's real intense it feels like
you're<00:05:55.620> just<00:05:55.740> in<00:05:55.949> the<00:05:56.070> action<00:05:56.580> because

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
you're just in the action because

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.730 
you're just in the action because
there's<00:05:57.330> always<00:05:57.570> this<00:05:57.900> need<00:05:58.169> to<00:05:58.320> move<00:05:58.469> even

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
there's always this need to move even

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.189 
there's always this need to move even
though<00:05:59.060> there<00:06:00.060> could<00:06:00.210> be<00:06:00.419> that<00:06:00.630> time<00:06:00.870> where

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
though there could be that time where

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.279 
though there could be that time where
you're<00:06:01.860> by<00:06:02.039> yourself<00:06:02.360> constantly<00:06:03.360> moving<00:06:03.599> not

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
you're by yourself constantly moving not

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.100 
you're by yourself constantly moving not
finding<00:06:04.800> anyone<00:06:05.190> but<00:06:05.909> there's<00:06:06.150> this<00:06:06.690> fast

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
finding anyone but there's this fast

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
finding anyone but there's this fast
fast<00:06:07.830> pace<00:06:08.370> and<00:06:08.729> that's<00:06:09.539> it<00:06:09.810> so<00:06:10.530> pacing<00:06:11.009> is

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
fast pace and that's it so pacing is

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.770 
fast pace and that's it so pacing is
something<00:06:11.520> you<00:06:11.639> really<00:06:11.820> want<00:06:11.969> to<00:06:12.240> consider

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
something you really want to consider

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.370 
something you really want to consider
when<00:06:13.440> implementing<00:06:14.250> these<00:06:14.370> mechanics<00:06:15.380> though

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
when implementing these mechanics though

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.279 
when implementing these mechanics though
it<00:06:16.590> can<00:06:16.800> be<00:06:16.979> fun<00:06:17.280> to<00:06:17.490> have<00:06:18.479> every<00:06:18.870> mechanic

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
it can be fun to have every mechanic

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.150 
it can be fun to have every mechanic
possible<00:06:19.919> you<00:06:20.639> want<00:06:20.789> to<00:06:20.909> get
