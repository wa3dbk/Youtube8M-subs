00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.840
 he is working on creating a computer 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.770
 which makes our daily life 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.380
 for example it will be easier to help commit

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.910
 adapt computers to humans 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.790
 controlled keyboard and mouse and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.970
 a thing of the past 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.300
 we want to make a man 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.170

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.199
 the day will come when the onboard computer 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
 will think and communicate their thoughts 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.259
 I do not remember 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.239
 to the police 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.649
 at the first movie man 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.979
 to Europe we will definitely be 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.279
 Sochi computers in our laboratory they 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.529
 worse actions that will react and 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.739
 on our voices intonation gestures 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.809
 mimic the emotional state of the computer 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.859

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.889
 it's all about the passport 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.049
 neighboring lab scientists are trying 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.489
 provide opportunity 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.190
 driving control 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.219
 using glances and gestures 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.629
 such attempts were in the past 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.279
 sit there contactless 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.459
 control systems still in the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.409
 twenties russian inventor 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.819
 these moments 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.379
 then created a musical 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.849
 the instrument on which they played it perfectly 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.849
 without touching life the principle is the same she 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.269
 m 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.049
 the computer of the future must be 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.480
 a specialist generalist but 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.480
 while consuming minimal energy 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.029
 now on stage energy one 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.799
 single data center 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.159
 password costs a few million 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.159
 euro per year 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.709
 the main problem in cooling and in fact 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.059
 each beans the challenge of large 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.159
 chip makers is 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.709
 including each new generation 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.010
 their chips 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.720
 becoming more economical and they 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.720
 go to the right path seydou dumbia years 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.819
 for several 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.159
 decades experts work 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.180
 over the creation of the computer of the future 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.449
 this computer made in germany 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.879
 produced 60 in the first year of fouls 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.879
 he remembered so pic text lines 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.530
 in Palestine and Easter events 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.790
 expects us to create a quantum 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.909
 computer 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:26.789
 physical laboratory scientists 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.659
 say that atoms and changes them 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.340
 energy state 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.659
 holding them 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.580
 in the percent laser beam basis 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.580
 quantum computer 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.020
 compared to classic 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.770
 operators have a completely different logic 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.199
 if traditional only works by 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.569
 principle binary logic then commands 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.569
 on the principle of superposition 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:54.819
 they themselves are right 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.699
 checking also excavators 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.559
 computer we can simultaneously in 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.749
 the carrier had data for it that 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:02.659
 called fit or tails and tails 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.309
 quantum concurrency important 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:06.669
 advantage of quantum computing 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.770
 compared to traditional 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.840
 digital 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.000
 and due to this he works on a lot 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.600
 many times faster export reports and 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.180
 if you have grown priests 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.830
 to solve complex maths 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.409
 task for bp network searches and it's perfect 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.680
 in the model as a computer running 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.320
 based on dna molecules 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.440
 it does not need a revolution either 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.219
 energy as a living cell 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.589
 today there are first attempts in that 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.619
 among us and create while 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:40.749
 a computer that can retrieve 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.939
 square root true calculate 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:45.939
 nasa media institute 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:47.709
 but endless possibilities 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:50.909
 computer wizard and do not believe was soon 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.389
 full was not a man's car 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:54.959
 replace he thinks
