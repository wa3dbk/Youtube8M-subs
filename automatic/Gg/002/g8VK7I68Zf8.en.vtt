00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.380
 may fiesta river class 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.680
 this is the ford compact in a version 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.900
 more finalized in the finalization of the model 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.820
 you can check the video you can see 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.990
 this force of 2008 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.760
 the link appears below the comments 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.670
 technically the two are the same 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.699
 fought the brake and 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.329
 suspension and 2009 model did not present 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.920
 nothing new about the incredible 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.379
 but I want to show you in that 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.329
 The model is the most 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.870
 the most common 70 found in the 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:51.129
 thus distinguishing the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.620
 rearview mirror handle and frieze 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.140
 side in golden color caps with 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.379
 differential design and the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.039
 in the door it is here that we perceive 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.310
 best finish of this space version 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.750
 very good above the category average 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.710
 this version gives series of features 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.619
 power steering air conditioning 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.170
 glasses and electric locks 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.509
 the panel has this silver finish on the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.810
 in the air diffuser rings and in the 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:29.200
 counters on the sides of the door counted 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.040
 with the same fabric as the mirror seats 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.210
 in the two sunshades individual lights of 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.759
 reading and also has a central console 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.259
 how to best finish door objects 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.540
 this model as you can perceive 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.740
 is in the rear view mirror 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.590
 electric 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.990
 it does not come optional in this version 1.0 only 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.649
 at 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.530
 1.6 Probably one owner has put as 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.810
 an accessory is a great deal 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.549
 because for those who usually share the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.850
 car is very practical 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.569
 the maneuver is never the wheel in the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.700
 guide is also worth an improvement 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.599
 considerable in comparison to the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.120
 entry is the height adjustment of a seat 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.300
 if the height adjustment of the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.000
 available only in model 1.6 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.580
 with air bag at least as regular 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.069
 I have a better view of the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.140
 players something that I can not get the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:37.880
 input models here back good space 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.590
 also for the legs to the same head 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.040
 door finish 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.220
 I highlight the seat belt that 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.360
 in this version are three retractable points and 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.140
 on the sides 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:57.310
 now the middle passenger without news 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.310
 lap belt and no head cost 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.519
 also the portugal and the trunk better 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.299
 end the investment here in the 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.140
 but there is still a lack of 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.109
 part 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.630
 Look, it 's something unforgivable that costs 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.329
 place a plastic material that can 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.760
 protect the luggage that enters the door 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.239
 It is inevitable that with time 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.790
 there is some risk banks are 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.040
 increasing the capacity of 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.620
 Baggage 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.720
 If you watched another video, you saw my 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.720
 unfavorable opinion 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.140
 to this 1 liter engine I indicate the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.600
 1.6 engine far superior in performance and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.150
 moderate fuel consumption 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.430
 but if you do not give up economy 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.350
 do not care about poor performance 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.380
 fiesta 1.0 can meet your 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.380
 need 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.820
 look for this classic version as 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.130
 You saw the items that are worth the 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.150
 investment and the price difference is well 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.600
 little 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:11.620
 this is it was the feather of the day ford 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.620
 fiesta 1.0 flex 2009 great buy
