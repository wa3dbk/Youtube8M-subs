00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.259 
than it was in the past and this comes
at<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.470> very<00:03:26.500> interesting<00:03:26.799> time<00:03:27.160> because<00:03:27.370> this

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
at a very interesting time because this

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.729 
at a very interesting time because this
is<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.540> same<00:03:28.780> time<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.170> we<00:03:29.260> see<00:03:29.440> China

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
is the same time that we see China

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.500 
is the same time that we see China
becoming<00:03:30.489> more<00:03:30.640> assertive<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.209> region

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.960 
becoming more assertive in the region
and<00:03:31.660> we're<00:03:32.200> seeing<00:03:32.440> Russia<00:03:32.830> really<00:03:33.730> try<00:03:33.940> to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
and we're seeing Russia really try to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.940 
and we're seeing Russia really try to
come<00:03:34.269> back<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.630> say<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.590> needs<00:03:35.890> to

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
expect in the coming years to see this

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.620 
expect in the coming years to see this
region<00:03:42.250> become<00:03:42.549> much<00:03:42.730> more<00:03:42.940> dynamic<00:03:43.150> as<00:03:43.570> the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
region become much more dynamic as the

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.380 
region become much more dynamic as the
three<00:03:44.410> large<00:03:44.650> powers<00:03:45.239> position<00:03:46.239> themselves

three large powers position themselves

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.560 
three large powers position themselves
they<00:03:46.989> they<00:03:47.380> compete<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.700> as<00:03:48.970> we<00:03:49.090> see<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
they they compete and as we see the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.199 
they they compete and as we see the
evolution<00:03:49.840> of<00:03:50.230> countries<00:03:50.890> like<00:03:51.100> Japan<00:03:51.519> India

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
evolution of countries like Japan India
