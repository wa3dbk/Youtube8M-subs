 at the atmospheric of the Bund de and has this is just the l World War II 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.480
 the new EVT 06 should 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.539
 However, Northrop had small caps 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 Here the packaging never looks really cool 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.919
 as always from all sides 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.919
 and the device pack now rest first 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.310
 once it's always the course 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.310
 Lauer accessory box 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.710
 October our sonoco approx 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.890
 it went first aside 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.980
 sorrow 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.390
 what is included here 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.940
 were very rare 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.399
 and Finke Old equipment plugs for full doses 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 this is a manual a hand puppet so 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.780
 Prokop 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.880
 and close 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.260
 Windows 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.630

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.630
 64-bit 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.920
 not even out of Amien 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 of course in the statute 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 "There's the last part under it 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 we have here 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.760
 we can not see too big 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.119
 October takes place from 6 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.520
 the world Hassel and fitting 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 Nielsen this log with sledges 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 it goes on to the device 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
 that we are in there that's already in there 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.249
 the black bag here with that by putting pressure on 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.279
 the treasures are not violations or so but light scratches 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.269
 better, very nice person 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:31.649
 this is the black version there is also a silver one 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.049
 us exchanges with crawl versions that can select irish 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.049
 Walter decided with geothermal for the black 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.489
 with that little one again look from all sides 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:46.879
 before I give you the device 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.879
 introduce in more detail 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.659
 we have to open it 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.080
 they like here the nice keyboard and one and only the display Effkemann 6 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.670
 Inch with a resolution of 13 66 by 768 pixels 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.259
 look at the register things to all sides 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:24.759
 that you have the connections 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.759
 those on the right when hum again 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.449
 would we have two connections for headphones Palfinger for example yours 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.709
 Friends with Â»enacted 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.719
 by connecting her microphone 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.809
 and secondly, like Fords 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.119
 on the back then the impetus for the power supply 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.189
 and protect a few poisons 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.670
 and on the left most connections once VGH 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.459
 another usb port 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.839
 continued 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.319
 HDMI 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.089
 a DisplayPort 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.699
 No card reader 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.969
 that's why sim cards have to re-create two rooms next to their reason as well 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.829
 already relatively rare 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.179
 and in front we have this wrongly 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:11.989
 the speaker 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.989
 now that's normal the keyboards 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.849
 Person now a bit rows 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.590
 but he can really write very well 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.020
 52 are 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.580
 now the winner is still standing 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.720
 what the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.169
 special came 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.280
 below underneath then a day later with a very nice surface 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.460
 Michael Snower continues a son 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.059
 if you have ticks 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:42.279
 a kind of Kessler around 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.689
 Stoiber look 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.969
 down to the two separate mouse buttons feel this piece very well so 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:49.999
 no foliage Wickede causes 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.740
 which I personally like very much 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.230
 you heard that Artur we have that too 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.360
 at the counter 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 in the form of a marriage head 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.669
 the Ascherslebener turned on the light to be made out 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.009
 so we can see that the keyboard is illuminated 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.860
 which is emphatically very great 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.439
 yes, even more in the logo this one in the head 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.169
 Of course that's natural 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.169
 without the speakers all these lit up 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.560
 and sloe that threatens not like now can Albert the alienware 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.409
 Open Command Center 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.409
 and pick another color, for example 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.870
 how can you select the different areas for example now the 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.439
 keyboards 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.779
 and just choose a different color, such as blue 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.859
 or if year turns black out of the war completely when doing laundry 

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:45.889
 Example disturbs 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.249
 because now 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.339
 when exactly what project turquoise 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.830
 green 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.339
 however, apply 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:56.639
 so 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.089
 we see this color wheel in the middle 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.089
 These days you can easily choose 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.150
 now i want him out of logo here 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.520
 Now the four drivers are looking for each other 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.729
 So if you want to give it too colorful 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.990
 a fireplace and had clicked Fekter 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.789
 such as the flashing 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.439
 For example, we can also set up a new e-mail 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:21.280
 arrives 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.400
 for example, something brings keyboard or something 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.099
 and now the return to a top squad is on 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:29.439
 set between plau 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:32.839
 and 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:33.800
 so 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.189
 quite a lot of possibilities 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.580
 yes even more the two rules extras because with the between the integrated 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.159
 intel graphics 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:46.669
 and again a g-force the offender can choose 335 votes to gamble on 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.949
 So you want the boats graphics card Enormous battery life with the 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.949
 Simply the integrated and can thus save energy 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:59.469
 why they race all the land action house so the race is six each 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:00.599
 button 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.589
 and should spare in a few seconds 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.580
 changed 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.979
 her word has no new city 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:10.249
 if now here right click here 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:14.279
 that this is the integrated graphic so no note from 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:15.210
 Nvidia 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.580
 Mini is 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.849
 for Denise again 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:22.309
 knows the last European Championship in this 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.619
 that here you can activate the Anhui Game Control here 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.879
 In any case subscribe to my youtube channel accounts for the NSX 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:35.930
 First, install a few games and benchmarks 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.630
 the results are we will be in the next - 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.580
 or on military bases EM
