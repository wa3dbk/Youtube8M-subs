hello<00:00:01.170> there<00:00:01.380> today<00:00:01.680> I'm<00:00:02.520> going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> be

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hello there today I'm going to be

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.309 
hello there today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:03.000> about<00:00:03.030> command<00:00:03.480> line<00:00:03.720> networking

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
talking about command line networking

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.590 
talking about command line networking
and<00:00:04.470> two<00:00:05.250> commands<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.759> particular<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.420> deal

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
and two commands in particular that deal

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.089 
and two commands in particular that deal
with<00:00:06.810> MAC<00:00:07.140> addresses<00:00:08.389> those<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> let<00:00:11.040> me

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
with MAC addresses those a so let me

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.919 
with MAC addresses those a so let me
pull<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.490> command<00:00:11.880> prompt<00:00:12.179> by<00:00:12.330> typing<00:00:12.509> in

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
pull up a command prompt by typing in

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
pull up a command prompt by typing in
CMD<00:00:13.320> if<00:00:13.799> you're<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.070> XP<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.590> click<00:00:16.590> start

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
CMD if you're on XP you can click start

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.550 
CMD if you're on XP you can click start
and<00:00:17.130> run<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.730> type<00:00:17.910> CMD<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.600> you're<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.109> Vista

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and run and type CMD if you're on Vista

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.560 
and run and type CMD if you're on Vista
or<00:00:19.710> later<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.609> need<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.820> right-click<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
or later you need to right-click on the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.390 
or later you need to right-click on the
CMD<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.320> run<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.619> administrator<00:00:25.279> all<00:00:26.279> right

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
CMD and run as administrator all right

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
CMD and run as administrator all right
so<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> got<00:00:27.029> my<00:00:27.060> command<00:00:27.480> prompt<00:00:27.779> open<00:00:29.420> today's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
so I got my command prompt open today's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.659 
so I got my command prompt open today's
two<00:00:31.170> commands<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> deal<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.399> MAC

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
two commands are going to deal with MAC

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.389 
two commands are going to deal with MAC
addresses<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.890> let<00:00:34.890> me<00:00:34.950> show<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> first

every card has a MAC address burned into
it<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> factory<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.420> used

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it from the factory and it can be used

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.190 
it from the factory and it can be used
to<00:01:09.869> identify<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:11.430> machine<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.689> actually

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
to identify your machine it's actually

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
to identify your machine it's actually
used<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> local<00:01:14.100> network<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.909> how

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
used on the local network that's how

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.190 
used on the local network that's how
computers<00:01:15.450> talk<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.689> each<00:01:15.840> other<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
computers talk to each other in the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
computers talk to each other in the
local<00:01:16.409> network<00:01:16.640> by<00:01:17.659> MAC<00:01:18.659> addresses<00:01:19.130> they<00:01:20.420> tend

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
local network by MAC addresses they tend

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.749 
local network by MAC addresses they tend
not<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> use<00:01:21.930> IP<00:01:22.560> addresses<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.549> what<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> like

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
not to use IP addresses so what I like

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
not to use IP addresses so what I like
to<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> wireless<00:01:28.200> network

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to do is when I have a wireless network

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.940 
to do is when I have a wireless network
I<00:01:28.799> put<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> Mac<00:01:29.450> filtration<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> which<00:01:31.740> means

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I put a Mac filtration on it which means

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 
I put a Mac filtration on it which means
that<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.549> make<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> list<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.840> MAC

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
that I make a list of all my MAC

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.319 
that I make a list of all my MAC
addresses<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.770> unless<00:01:35.430> you're<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.240> those

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
addresses and unless you're one of those

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.760 
addresses and unless you're one of those
MAC<00:01:36.570> addresses<00:01:36.600> you're<00:01:37.170> unable<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.500> connect

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
MAC addresses you're unable to connect

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
MAC addresses you're unable to connect
to<00:01:37.829> my<00:01:37.950> wireless<00:01:38.130> network<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.420> MAC<00:01:39.600> addresses

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
to my wireless network so MAC addresses

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.289 
to my wireless network so MAC addresses
are<00:01:40.170> good<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.590> know<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.430> good<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.119> see

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
are good to know about and good to see

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.670 
are good to know about and good to see
on<00:01:42.479> your<00:01:42.630> machines<00:01:42.960> especially<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.560> you're

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
using Wireless because it's the parking

using Wireless because it's the parking
next<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> Porsche<00:01:46.710> theory<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.810> can<00:01:48.810> secure<00:01:49.110> my

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
next to a Porsche theory I can secure my

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.609 
next to a Porsche theory I can secure my
network<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:50.100> than<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.360> person<00:01:51.810> beside<00:01:52.020> me

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
network more than the person beside me

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.740 
network more than the person beside me
and<00:01:52.710> they're<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.790> attractive<00:01:54.299> therefore

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and they're more attractive therefore

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.030 
and they're more attractive therefore
you're<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.140> steal<00:01:55.290> their<00:01:55.500> Porsche<00:01:55.740> or

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
you're going to steal their Porsche or

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.870 
you're going to steal their Porsche or
break<00:01:56.670> into<00:01:56.850> their<00:01:57.060> wireless<00:01:57.390> network<00:01:58.250> so

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.410 

anyway<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> first<00:02:03.030> command<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.290> Mac<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
anyway the first command is get Mac and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.999 
anyway the first command is get Mac and
that's<00:02:06.420> pretty<00:02:06.570> much<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.770> Mac

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that's pretty much it just get Mac

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.150 
that's pretty much it just get Mac
that's<00:02:08.399> why<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.849> making<00:02:09.149> two<00:02:09.619> two<00:02:10.619> videos<00:02:10.950> on

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
that's why I'm making two two videos on

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.870 
that's why I'm making two two videos on
here<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.640> also<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> git

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
here you can also do a git

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:25.620 
here you can also do a git
Mack<00:02:14.280> -<00:02:15.280> s<00:02:16.170> -<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:19.980> s<00:02:21.810> will<00:02:22.810> be<00:02:24.300> will<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.420> the

Mack - s - you and s will be will be the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:36.420 
Mack - s - you and s will be will be the
system<00:02:29.280> 192.168.0.1<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:34.270> user<00:02:35.160> /<00:02:36.160> you

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
system 192.168.0.1 and a user / you

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.690 
system 192.168.0.1 and a user / you
would<00:02:36.670> be<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.940> user<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.540> ad<00:02:38.430> illustrator<00:02:40.560> and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
would be the user so ad illustrator and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.500 
would be the user so ad illustrator and
i<00:02:42.700> don't<00:02:42.820> know<00:02:42.880> if<00:02:42.940> that's<00:02:43.000> actually<00:02:43.240> going<00:02:43.450> to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
i don't know if that's actually going to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:53.580 
i don't know if that's actually going to
work<00:02:48.390> yeah<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:50.200> looks<00:02:50.800> like<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.190> worked<00:02:51.480> i<00:02:52.590> just

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
work yeah it looks like it worked i just

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.110 
work yeah it looks like it worked i just
didn't<00:02:53.740> put<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.890> password<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.460> there<00:02:54.610> i<00:02:54.790> don't

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
didn't put a password in there i don't

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.770 
didn't put a password in there i don't
think<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.540> user<00:02:55.930> has<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.230> password<00:02:57.780> but

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
think that user has a password but

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.120 
think that user has a password but
that's<00:02:59.440> how<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.620> can<00:02:59.740> get<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.950> MAC<00:03:00.100> address

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
that's how you can get the MAC address

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.300 
that's how you can get the MAC address
of<00:03:00.520> remote<00:03:01.180> machines<00:03:01.630> or<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.200> can<00:03:02.770> just<00:03:02.800> do<00:03:05.310> get

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
of remote machines or I can just do get

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:18.030 
of remote machines or I can just do get
Mac<00:03:06.490> -<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:15.420> 192.168.1<00:03:16.420> X<00:03:16.540> command<00:03:16.900> but<00:03:17.620> get<00:03:17.830> Mac

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
Mac - a 192.168.1 X command but get Mac

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.690 
Mac - a 192.168.1 X command but get Mac
will<00:03:18.340> tell<00:03:18.580> me<00:03:18.700> my<00:03:18.850> local<00:03:20.160> MAC<00:03:21.160> address<00:03:23.700> get

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
will tell me my local MAC address get

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.250 
will tell me my local MAC address get
Mac's<00:03:24.880> not<00:03:25.090> available<00:03:25.570> in<00:03:25.690> every<00:03:25.810> operating

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
Mac's not available in every operating

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.710 
Mac's not available in every operating
system<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.860> your<00:03:27.370> mileage<00:03:27.580> may<00:03:27.940> vary<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.600> may

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
system so your mileage may vary you may

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.380 
system so your mileage may vary you may
not<00:03:28.870> actually<00:03:29.050> have<00:03:29.350> this<00:03:29.500> command<00:03:29.800> but<00:03:30.390> try

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
not actually have this command but try

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.490 
not actually have this command but try
it<00:03:31.420> anyway<00:03:31.720> see<00:03:32.080> what<00:03:32.200> happens<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.990> next

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
it anyway see what happens the next

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.830 
it anyway see what happens the next
command<00:03:35.770> is<00:03:35.950> art<00:03:36.270> this<00:03:37.270> may<00:03:37.450> not<00:03:37.600> be<00:03:37.720> available

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
command is art this may not be available

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.140 
command is art this may not be available
in<00:03:38.200> all<00:03:38.290> operating<00:03:38.710> systems<00:03:38.830> either<00:03:39.190> but

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
in all operating systems either but

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.780 
in all operating systems either but
it'll<00:03:40.900> show<00:03:41.110> my<00:03:41.770> address<00:03:42.490> resolution

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
it'll show my address resolution

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.690 
it'll show my address resolution
protocol<00:03:43.720> that's<00:03:44.230> what<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.470> ARP<00:03:45.070> stands<00:03:45.400> for

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
protocol that's what a ARP stands for

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.420 
protocol that's what a ARP stands for
basically<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:47.140> my<00:03:47.500> MAC<00:03:48.070> address<00:03:48.400> is

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
basically it's all my MAC address is

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.470 
basically it's all my MAC address is
translated<00:03:49.090> into<00:03:49.209> IP<00:03:49.570> addresses<00:03:50.050> so<00:03:50.550> -<00:03:51.550> a<00:03:51.790> will

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
translated into IP addresses so - a will

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.390 
translated into IP addresses so - a will
show<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.230> ones<00:03:53.440> that<00:03:53.709> my<00:03:53.830> computer<00:03:54.220> knows

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
show the ones that my computer knows

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.890 
show the ones that my computer knows
about<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:54.880> there's<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:57.209> 192.168.0.1<00:03:58.209> with<00:03:58.870> a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
about and there's a 192.168.0.1 with a

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.660 
about and there's a 192.168.0.1 with a
MAC<00:03:59.500> address<00:03:59.830> and<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:02.890> broadcast

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
MAC address and this is a broadcast

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.380 
MAC address and this is a broadcast
broadcast<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:05.520> multicast<00:04:08.580> multicast<00:04:09.580> and

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
broadcast and multicast multicast and

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.530 
broadcast and multicast multicast and
broadcast<00:04:11.070> so<00:04:12.070> these<00:04:12.250> are<00:04:12.400> all<00:04:12.550> of<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:12.970> this

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
broadcast so these are all of the this

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.880 
broadcast so these are all of the this
is<00:04:13.600> how<00:04:13.720> vistas<00:04:14.440> kind<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.709> redone<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:16.890> stack

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
is how vistas kind of redone the stack

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.500 
is how vistas kind of redone the stack
is<00:04:18.160> they<00:04:18.400> put<00:04:18.580> these<00:04:18.670> extra<00:04:18.850> entries<00:04:19.299> in<00:04:19.420> here

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
is they put these extra entries in here

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.740 
is they put these extra entries in here
because<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.750> used<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.109> never<00:04:20.290> see<00:04:20.500> this<00:04:20.650> on<00:04:20.830> XP

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
because you used to never see this on XP

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.409 
because you used to never see this on XP
so<00:04:22.750> anyway<00:04:22.990> ARP<00:04:23.290> -<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.890> will<00:04:24.520> show<00:04:24.729> all<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.240> my

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.379 
with the MAC address of this so my
computer<00:05:14.680> whenever<00:05:14.949> I<00:05:15.430> type<00:05:15.880> in<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.240> web

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.100 

aren't<00:05:27.009> aren't<00:05:27.669> doing<00:05:27.910> a<00:05:27.970> whole<00:05:28.090> lot<00:05:28.120> so<00:05:28.870> let

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
aren't aren't doing a whole lot so let

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.909 
aren't aren't doing a whole lot so let
me<00:05:29.169> delete<00:05:29.349> that<00:05:29.680> one<00:05:29.740> ARB<00:05:30.099> -<00:05:30.970> d<00:05:34.919> 192.168.0.1

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
me delete that one ARB - d 192.168.0.1

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:43.219 
me delete that one ARB - d 192.168.0.1
t2<00:05:40.229> and<00:05:41.229> then<00:05:41.830> do<00:05:42.070> arp

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
t2 and then do arp

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.610 
t2 and then do arp
a<00:05:44.229> and<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:45.550> can<00:05:45.639> see<00:05:45.699> now<00:05:45.970> it's<00:05:46.930> gone<00:05:47.169> it's<00:05:47.560> not

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
a and you can see now it's gone it's not

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.860 
a and you can see now it's gone it's not
there<00:05:47.889> anymore

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
there anymore

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.740 
there anymore
so<00:05:49.870> these<00:05:49.990> commands<00:05:50.320> don't<00:05:50.530> do<00:05:50.620> a<00:05:50.650> lot<00:05:51.720> like<00:05:52.720> I

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
so these commands don't do a lot like I

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.689 
so these commands don't do a lot like I
say<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.380> can<00:05:53.560> use<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.830> get<00:05:54.010> back<00:05:54.159> or<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.490> ARP

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
say you can use the get back or the ARP

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.560 
say you can use the get back or the ARP
-<00:05:55.060> a<00:05:55.740> command<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:57.099> see<00:05:57.909> what<00:05:58.030> your<00:05:58.150> MAC<00:05:58.240> address
