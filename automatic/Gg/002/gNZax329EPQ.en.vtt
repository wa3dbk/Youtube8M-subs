peaking account I just felt like making
this<00:01:43.380> I've<00:01:43.649> always<00:01:43.920> thought<00:01:44.790> they<00:01:45.000> look<00:01:45.299> like

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
this I've always thought they look like

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.590 
this I've always thought they look like
fun<00:01:48.000> builds<00:01:49.130> interesting<00:01:50.130> builds<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
fun builds interesting builds I like I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.130 
fun builds interesting builds I like I
like<00:01:55.380> having<00:01:55.710> high<00:01:56.329> high<00:01:57.329> offense<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.990> low

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
like having high high offense at low

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.639 
like having high high offense at low
combat<00:01:59.360> which<00:02:00.360> we'll<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.140> I'll<00:02:01.500> get

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
combat which we'll have but I'll get

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.260 
combat which we'll have but I'll get
rekt<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.159> easily<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.729> defense

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
rekt so easily with one defense

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.330 
rekt so easily with one defense
I'll<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.840> respect<00:02:04.110> out<00:02:04.290> pretty<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.189> every

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I'll get respect out pretty much every

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.300 
I'll get respect out pretty much every
spec

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.770 

so<00:02:09.310> yeah<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:13.440> I'd<00:02:14.440> say<00:02:14.800> probably<00:02:15.780> Cinelli

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
so yeah it's I'd say probably Cinelli

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.640 
so yeah it's I'd say probably Cinelli
pure<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:17.560> 75<00:02:17.980> defense<00:02:18.660> 60<00:02:19.660> attack<00:02:19.900> 88<00:02:20.320> strength

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
pure so 75 defense 60 attack 88 strength

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.910 
pure so 75 defense 60 attack 88 strength
99<00:02:21.130> range<00:02:21.660> it's<00:02:22.660> probably<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.110> best<00:02:23.320> build<00:02:23.680> at

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
99 range it's probably the best build at

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.070 
99 range it's probably the best build at
that<00:02:24.270> combat<00:02:27.090> next<00:02:28.090> would<00:02:28.180> probably<00:02:28.480> be<00:02:28.600> 75

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
that combat next would probably be 75

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.130 
that combat next would probably be 75
attackers<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:31.090> 60<00:02:31.570> attack<00:02:31.810> borrow

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
attackers and then 60 attack borrow

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.490 
attackers and then 60 attack borrow
peers<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.780> will<00:02:38.080> probably<00:02:38.290> get

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
peers so this this I will probably get

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.920 
peers so this this I will probably get
rekt<00:02:38.770> but<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.070> like<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.850> don't<00:02:40.570> have<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
rekt but I like that I don't have to

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.900 
rekt but I like that I don't have to
really<00:02:41.080> risk<00:02:41.350> anything<00:02:41.830> like<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.580> can<00:02:42.730> die<00:02:42.880> a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
really risk anything like I can die a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.240 
really risk anything like I can die a

the<00:03:40.660> anchor<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:41.320> I'm<00:03:41.500> not<00:03:41.650> sure<00:03:41.890> yet<00:03:42.160> I

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
the anchor but I'm not sure yet I

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.370 
the anchor but I'm not sure yet I
probably<00:03:43.660> won't<00:03:43.900> ever<00:03:44.050> use<00:03:44.170> anchor<00:03:44.800> but<00:03:46.380> I'd

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
probably won't ever use anchor but I'd

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.440 
probably won't ever use anchor but I'd
be<00:03:47.709> nice<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.070> get<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.220> prayer<00:03:48.550> experience<00:03:49.150> from
