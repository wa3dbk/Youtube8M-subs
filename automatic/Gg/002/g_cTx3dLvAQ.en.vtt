now that the bars are out I still have
the<00:04:01.940> dimples<00:04:02.300> so<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.840> dimples<00:04:03.170> don't<00:04:03.500> come

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
the dimples so the dimples don't come

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.680 
the dimples so the dimples don't come
from<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.610> bars<00:04:04.790> it's<00:04:05.090> not<00:04:05.270> because<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.570> have

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
from the bars it's not because you have

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.000 
from the bars it's not because you have
the<00:04:05.780> bars<00:04:05.960> in<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.260> you<00:04:06.350> get<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.560> dimples<00:04:06.890> the

the bars in that you get the dimples the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.910 
the bars in that you get the dimples the
dimples<00:04:07.400> are<00:04:07.520> caused<00:04:07.790> because<00:04:08.720> when<00:04:09.620> they

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
dimples are caused because when they

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.460 
dimples are caused because when they
pierce<00:04:10.280> your<00:04:10.700> cheek<00:04:10.940> they<00:04:11.630> sort<00:04:11.960> of<00:04:12.020> ruin<00:04:12.350> the

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
muscles so that's why some people

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.300 
muscles so that's why some people
actually<00:04:14.600> never<00:04:15.080> get<00:04:15.350> this<00:04:15.500> properly<00:04:15.980> heals
