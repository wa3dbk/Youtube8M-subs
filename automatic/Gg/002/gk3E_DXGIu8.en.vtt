00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
firstly i think the amazing spider-man

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
firstly i think the amazing spider-man
has<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.950> more<00:00:56.250> realistic<00:00:56.640> tone<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.450> feel<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
has a more realistic tone and feel to it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
has a more realistic tone and feel to it
especially<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.949> characters<00:00:59.520> they<00:01:00.210> were

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
especially the characters they were

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.130 
especially the characters they were
deeper<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> darker<00:01:01.640> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> 2002<00:01:03.539> spider-man

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
deeper and darker in the 2002 spider-man

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.019 
deeper and darker in the 2002 spider-man
film<00:01:04.439> i<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:04.949> found<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.429> characters<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:06.029 
film i actually found the characters to

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:08.629 
film i actually found the characters to
be<00:01:06.179> quite<00:01:06.990> annoying<00:01:07.350> after<00:01:07.649> a<00:01:07.859> while<00:01:07.920> they

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
shooting his web for me I actually

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.180 
shooting his web for me I actually
prefer<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.560> coming<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:13.920> of

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
prefer it coming out of

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.330 
prefer it coming out of
wrists<00:02:14.670> because<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.630> makes<00:02:15.840> sense<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.560> mean

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
wrists because it makes sense I mean

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.950

he's<00:02:17.520> become<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.850> spider<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.330> many<00:02:18.630> other<00:02:18.870> ways

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
he's become a spider in many other ways

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.110 
he's become a spider in many other ways
so<00:02:19.500> why<00:02:19.830> wouldn't<00:02:20.070> he<00:02:20.190> naturally<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.790> able<00:02:21.000> to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
so why wouldn't he naturally be able to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.780 
so why wouldn't he naturally be able to
produce<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.570> web<00:02:21.750> from<00:02:21.960> his<00:02:22.080> body<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.670> know

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
produce a web from his body but you know

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.760 
produce a web from his body but you know
the<00:02:24.000> web<00:02:24.180> using<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.690> amazing<00:02:24.840> spider-man<00:02:25.440> was

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
the web using the amazing spider-man was

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.890 
the web using the amazing spider-man was
still<00:02:25.980> fine<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.090> very<00:02:27.270> minor<00:02:27.570> thing

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
still fine it's just a very minor thing

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.800 
still fine it's just a very minor thing
I<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.080> thought<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.530> was<00:02:28.620> interesting<00:02:29.810> in

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
I just thought it was interesting in

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.720 
I just thought it was interesting in
terms<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.320> action<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.010> movie<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.430> will

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
terms of the action in this movie I will

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.640 
terms of the action in this movie I will
say<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.180> did<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.810> camera<00:02:34.170> angles<00:02:34.530> in

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
say that I did like the camera angles in

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.680 
say that I did like the camera angles in
the<00:02:34.740> way<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.010> was<00:02:35.100> shot<00:02:35.600> especially<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the way it was shot especially the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.510 
the way it was shot especially the
fights<00:02:36.930> between<00:02:37.110> spider-man<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.100> lizard

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
fights between spider-man and the lizard

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.390 
fights between spider-man and the lizard
however<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.360> am<00:02:39.480> NOT<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> big<00:02:40.140> fan<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.440> CGI<00:02:40.980> at<00:02:41.280> all

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
however I am NOT a big fan of CGI at all

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.850 
however I am NOT a big fan of CGI at all
and<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.480> lizard<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.990> me<00:02:43.140> look<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.740> was

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
and the lizard to me look like it was

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.150 
and the lizard to me look like it was
obviously<00:02:44.370> CGI<00:02:45.140> sure<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.260> was<00:02:46.380> flashy<00:02:46.740> and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
obviously CGI sure it was flashy and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.950 
obviously CGI sure it was flashy and
smooth<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.760> everything<00:02:48.270> but<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.720> didn't

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
smooth and everything but it just didn't

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.810 
smooth and everything but it just didn't
look<00:02:49.020> real<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.560> me<00:02:49.740> if<00:02:50.130> you've<00:02:50.310> seen<00:02:50.520> some

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
look real to me if you've seen some

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.090 
look real to me if you've seen some
Lenny<00:02:51.030> speaks<00:02:51.360> episodes<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.020> past<00:02:52.100> you

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
Lenny speaks episodes in the past you

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.070 
Lenny speaks episodes in the past you
know<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.520> I'm<00:02:53.610> not<00:02:53.820> really<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.360> keen<00:02:54.870> on

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
know that I'm not really that keen on

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.350 
know that I'm not really that keen on
CGI<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.860> really<00:02:56.190> think<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:57.120> not

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
CGI I really think that it's just not

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.760 
CGI I really think that it's just not
good<00:02:57.540> enough<00:02:57.570> yet<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.990> be<00:02:58.200> used<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.590> create

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
good enough yet to be used to create

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.420 
good enough yet to be used to create
characters<00:02:59.460> and<00:03:00.800> another<00:03:01.800> thing<00:03:02.040> about<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
characters and another thing about the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.190 
characters and another thing about the
lizard<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.940> me<00:03:03.120> was<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.510> character<00:03:03.780> wasn't

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
lizard to me was that a character wasn't

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.440 
lizard to me was that a character wasn't
really<00:03:04.530> deep<00:03:04.740> enough<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.370> thought<00:03:05.820> dr.<00:03:06.210> Curt

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
really deep enough I thought dr. Curt

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.750 
really deep enough I thought dr. Curt
Connors<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:07.080> good<00:03:07.290> but<00:03:07.500> but<00:03:08.250> not<00:03:08.400> really<00:03:08.640> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
Connors is good but but not really the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.390 
Connors is good but but not really the
lizard<00:03:09.380> overall<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.590> quite<00:03:10.950> enjoyed<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
lizard overall I quite enjoyed the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.010 
lizard overall I quite enjoyed the
amazing<00:03:11.730> spider-man<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.420> recommend<00:03:12.930> you

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
amazing spider-man and I recommend you

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.650 
amazing spider-man and I recommend you
give<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.320> watch<00:03:13.670> Peter<00:03:14.670> Parker<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.330> me<00:03:15.450> was

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
give it a watch Peter Parker to me was

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.870 
give it a watch Peter Parker to me was
actually<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.080> good<00:03:16.230> character<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.040> he's

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
actually a good character in this he's

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.699 
actually a good character in this he's
not<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.239> faithful<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> comics<00:03:19.350> he's<00:03:19.530> not

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
not that faithful to the comics he's not

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.470 
not that faithful to the comics he's not
that<00:03:19.920> nerdy<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.610> he's<00:03:20.730> more<00:03:20.880> adapted<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
that nerdy but he's more adapted to the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.810 
that nerdy but he's more adapted to the
modern<00:03:21.780> teenager<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:23.520> we<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.730> all

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
modern teenager and I think we can all

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.460 
modern teenager and I think we can all
relate<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.330> him<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.510> bit<00:03:24.690> more<00:03:24.870> than<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:25.200> did<00:03:25.410> in

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
relate to him a bit more than we did in

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.090 
relate to him a bit more than we did in
the<00:03:25.620> 2002<00:03:26.489> spider-man<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.590> general<00:03:28.770> it

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
the 2002 spider-man just in general it
