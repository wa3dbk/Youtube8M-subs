all<00:02:54.590> right

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.770 

round<00:02:58.450> two

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.300 

position<00:03:03.940> there<00:03:04.940> are<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.150> few<00:03:05.209> things<00:03:05.510> out

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
position there are a few things out

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.660 
position there are a few things out
this<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.490> not<00:03:07.670> easy<00:03:08.240> it's<00:03:09.020> heavy

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
this is not easy it's heavy

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.760 
this is not easy it's heavy
