gested<00:04:27.449> if<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.630> can<00:04:27.780> afford<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.229> 10.1<00:04:29.070> I'll

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
gested if you can afford the 10.1 I'll

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.250

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
probably lean more towards gaining 10.1

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.750 
probably lean more towards gaining 10.1
because<00:04:31.440> yes<00:04:31.620> it's<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.979> little<00:04:32.220> more<00:04:32.400> bang<00:04:32.610> for
