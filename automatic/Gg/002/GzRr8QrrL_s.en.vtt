changed since this guy right here it's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.539 
changed since this guy right here it's
it's<00:01:23.189> been<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> same<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.869> i<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.110> shoots

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's been the same when i go on shoots
only<00:01:26.549> thick<00:01:26.820> three<00:01:27.119> things<00:01:27.330> I'm<00:01:27.509> worried

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
only thick three things I'm worried

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.679 
only thick three things I'm worried
about<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:28.560> shooting<00:01:29.689> shutter

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
about when I'm actually shooting shutter

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.969 
about when I'm actually shooting shutter
speed<00:01:30.900> aperture<00:01:31.250> films<00:01:32.250> mean<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
speed aperture films mean that's it so I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.140 
speed aperture films mean that's it so I
want<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> break<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.670> down<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:35.909> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so you can kind of get a basic

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.990 
so you can kind of get a basic
understanding<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.369> we're<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.670> further

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
understanding and we're going further

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.350

one of the reasons I love photography
and<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> blending<00:01:46.829> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and that's because it's a blending of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
and that's because it's a blending of
art<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> science<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.509> blend<00:01:48.720> into<00:01:48.840> those<00:01:49.020> two

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
art and science to blend into those two

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.399 
art and science to blend into those two
disciplines<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:50.220> started<00:01:50.850> off<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.600> studying

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
disciplines I started off with studying

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.660 
disciplines I started off with studying
mechanical<00:01:52.560> engineering<00:01:52.829> at<00:01:53.310> Florida<00:01:53.640> State

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
mechanical engineering at Florida State

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.990 
mechanical engineering at Florida State
and<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.720> reason<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.079> chose<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.880> college<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
and the reason I chose that college is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.389 
and the reason I chose that college is
because<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:58.229> basically<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.130> same<00:01:59.219> thing

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
because it's basically the same thing

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.240 
because it's basically the same thing
you're<00:02:00.210> designing<00:02:00.570> things<00:02:00.890> which<00:02:01.890> has<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.159> do

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you're designing things which has to do

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
you're designing things which has to do
with<00:02:02.369> art<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.570> also<00:02:03.719> having<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
with art and you're also having to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.749 
with art and you're also having to
actually<00:02:04.290> create<00:02:04.829> things<00:02:05.070> which<00:02:05.399> has<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.670> do

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
actually create things which has to do

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059 
actually create things which has to do
with<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> science<00:02:06.240> side<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:07.069> Photography

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
with the science side of it Photography

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.760 
with the science side of it Photography
is<00:02:08.099> very<00:02:08.399> very<00:02:08.580> similar<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.289> science<00:02:10.649> side

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is very very similar so the science side

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.380 
is very very similar so the science side
you're<00:02:10.979> manipulating<00:02:11.610> light<00:02:12.200> that's<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
you're manipulating light that's the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.480 
you're manipulating light that's the
most<00:02:13.600> important<00:02:14.380> thing<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.830> understanding

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
most important thing is understanding

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.830 
most important thing is understanding
and<00:02:15.610> manipulating<00:02:16.180> light<00:02:16.330> when<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.660> take<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and manipulating light when you take a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.740 
and manipulating light when you take a
photo<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.640> then<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> artistic<00:02:19.180> side<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.540> will

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
photo and then the artistic side is will

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.330 
photo and then the artistic side is will
you<00:02:19.840> actually<00:02:20.050> do<00:02:20.319> with<00:02:20.470> your<00:02:20.740> image<00:02:20.980> how<00:02:21.280> you

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
you actually do with your image how you

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.190 
you actually do with your image how you
can<00:02:21.520> pose<00:02:21.760> your<00:02:21.970> subjects<00:02:22.390> what<00:02:23.080> you're

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
can pose your subjects what you're

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.010 
can pose your subjects what you're
focusing<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:25.300> break<00:02:25.510> down<00:02:25.750> really

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
focusing on so to break down really

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.100 
focusing on so to break down really
simply<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.640> shutter<00:02:28.000> speed<00:02:28.209> aperture<00:02:28.420> and

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
simply the shutter speed aperture and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.300 
simply the shutter speed aperture and
film<00:02:29.560> speed<00:02:30.150> both<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:32.500> do<00:02:32.620> with<00:02:32.800> art<00:02:33.040> and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
film speed both have to do with art and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.120 
film speed both have to do with art and
science<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.900> science<00:02:34.930> side<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.709> all<00:02:35.830> three<00:02:36.100> of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
science the science side of all three of

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.300 
science the science side of all three of
those<00:02:36.990> how<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.110> looks<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.620> that's<00:02:38.950> it's

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
those how it looks like it that's it's

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.770 
those how it looks like it that's it's
that<00:02:39.370> easy<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:39.850> has<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.150> do<00:02:40.239> with<00:02:40.360> how<00:02:40.600> it

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
that easy just has to do with how it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.559 
that easy just has to do with how it
lets<00:02:40.989> leg<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.440> that's<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:43.030> artistic<00:02:43.540> side

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
lets leg in that's it the artistic side

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.510 
lets leg in that's it the artistic side
of<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.020> though<00:02:44.170> has<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.860> do<00:02:44.980> with<00:02:45.160> blur

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
of it though has to do with blur

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.610 
of it though has to do with blur
basically<00:02:46.360> how<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.570> controls<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
basically how it controls and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.820 
basically how it controls and
manipulates<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.430> blur<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.870> blur<00:02:50.470> doesn't

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
manipulates the blur now blur doesn't

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.740 
manipulates the blur now blur doesn't
sound<00:02:50.980> very<00:02:51.100> artistic<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:51.850> that's<00:02:52.540> what<00:02:52.720> it

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
sound very artistic but that's what it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.680 
sound very artistic but that's what it
is<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.230> helps<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.860> draw<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:55.000> attention<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
is it helps you draw the attention of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.870 
is it helps you draw the attention of
your<00:02:55.750> viewer<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.860> certain<00:02:57.370> aspect<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.760> your

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
your viewer to a certain aspect of your

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.500 
your viewer to a certain aspect of your
photo<00:02:58.769> for<00:02:59.769> instance<00:03:00.180> let's<00:03:01.180> say<00:03:01.239> you're<00:03:01.390> at<00:03:01.480> a

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
photo for instance let's say you're at a

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.240 
photo for instance let's say you're at a
basketball<00:03:01.840> game<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.140> shoot<00:03:02.560> Shaquille

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.690 
field I like to call it distance border
just<00:03:40.660> because<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:42.070> lot<00:03:42.220> easier<00:03:42.250> for<00:03:42.519> my

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
just because it's a lot easier for my

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.449 
just because it's a lot easier for my
brain<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.910> register<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.329> so<00:03:44.280> distant<00:03:45.280> flora

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
brain to register that so distant flora

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.039 
brain to register that so distant flora
has<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.700> do<00:03:45.820> with<00:03:46.030> how<00:03:46.329> much<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.660> in<00:03:46.810> focus

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
has to do with how much is in focus

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.650 
has to do with how much is in focus
before<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.769> after<00:03:48.070> your<00:03:48.190> subject<00:03:48.610> so<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:49.600> this

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
before and after your subject so in this

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.120 
before and after your subject so in this
case<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.079> wall<00:03:50.260> back<00:03:50.470> here<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.769> not<00:03:50.920> really

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
case the wall back here is not really

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.310 
case the wall back here is not really
that<00:03:51.160> exciting<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.540> if<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.690> had<00:03:52.840> an<00:03:52.930> option

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
that exciting and if I had an option

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.140 
that exciting and if I had an option
then<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.739> would<00:03:53.890> have<00:03:53.920> shot<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.370> video<00:03:54.549> at<00:03:55.000> a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
then I would have shot this video at a

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.120 
then I would have shot this video at a
very<00:03:55.390> low<00:03:55.690> depth<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.110> field<00:03:56.320> or<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.709> very<00:03:57.040> small

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
very low depth of field or a very small

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.020 
very low depth of field or a very small
distance<00:03:58.030> border<00:03:58.239> where<00:03:59.200> I'm<00:03:59.739> sharp<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
distance border where I'm sharp but the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.750 
distance border where I'm sharp but the
background<00:04:01.239> is<00:04:01.480> blurred<00:04:01.750> now<00:04:02.019> if<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.370> seven

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
background is blurred now if the seven

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.630 
background is blurred now if the seven
was<00:04:03.940> instead<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.930> know<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.049> wall<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.739> my

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
was instead of a you know a wall that my

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.330 
was instead of a you know a wall that my
wife<00:04:06.820> beautifully<00:04:07.329> painted<00:04:07.620> then<00:04:08.620> let's<00:04:09.220> say

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
wife beautifully painted then let's say

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.680 
wife beautifully painted then let's say
we<00:04:09.459> were<00:04:09.549> in<00:04:09.700> France<00:04:10.060> with<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:10.450> eiffel<00:04:10.660> tower

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
we were in France with the eiffel tower

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.400 
we were in France with the eiffel tower
behind<00:04:11.019> me<00:04:11.260> I<00:04:11.410> definitely<00:04:12.040> want<00:04:12.340> myself<00:04:12.549> and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
behind me I definitely want myself and

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.469 
behind me I definitely want myself and
the<00:04:14.410> eiffel<00:04:14.680> tower<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.950> be<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.100> focus<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:16.000> that

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
the eiffel tower to be in focus so that

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.210 
the eiffel tower to be in focus so that
has<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.750> do<00:04:16.870> with<00:04:16.989> distance<00:04:17.320> border<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:18.100> that's

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
has to do with distance border so that's

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.819 
has to do with distance border so that's
the<00:04:18.280> artistic<00:04:18.789> side<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:19.299> blur<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.590> is

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
the artistic side of blur and that is

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.339 
the artistic side of blur and that is
directly<00:04:21.190> related<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.580> your<00:04:21.729> aperture<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.960> I'm

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
directly related to your aperture so I'm

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:24.760 
directly related to your aperture so I'm
going<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.590> stop<00:04:23.740> there<00:04:23.950> for<00:04:24.070> today

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
going to stop there for today

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.260 
going to stop there for today
and<00:04:24.830> we're<00:04:24.919> going<00:04:25.039> to<00:04:25.099> pick<00:04:25.250> up<00:04:25.280> with<00:04:25.910> a<00:04:25.940> video

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
and we're going to pick up with a video

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.020 
and we're going to pick up with a video
specifically<00:04:26.960> talking<00:04:27.199> about<00:04:27.349> shutter<00:04:27.710> speed

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
specifically talking about shutter speed

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.510 
specifically talking about shutter speed
the<00:04:29.030> next<00:04:29.270> one<00:04:29.389> will<00:04:29.509> be<00:04:29.539> on<00:04:29.900> aperture<00:04:30.520> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
the next one will be on aperture the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.659 
the next one will be on aperture the
next<00:04:31.759> one<00:04:31.940> will<00:04:32.270> be<00:04:32.300> on<00:04:32.660> iso<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.889> then<00:04:34.520> we'll

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
next one will be on iso and then we'll

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.809 
next one will be on iso and then we'll
talk<00:04:34.849> about<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.180> photographer's<00:04:35.900> workflow

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
talk about a photographer's workflow

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.920 
talk about a photographer's workflow
that's<00:04:37.819> basically<00:04:38.150> I've<00:04:38.419> got<00:04:38.539> a<00:04:38.569> foolproof

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
that's basically I've got a foolproof

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.300 
that's basically I've got a foolproof
method<00:04:39.259> where<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.770> don't<00:04:39.919> have<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.129> memorize

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
method where you don't have to memorize

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.760 
method where you don't have to memorize
any<00:04:40.699> numbers<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:42.080> don't<00:04:42.229> have<00:04:42.409> to<00:04:42.500> do<00:04:42.620> any

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
any numbers you don't have to do any

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.309 
any numbers you don't have to do any
math<00:04:43.009> you<00:04:43.430> literally<00:04:44.210> just<00:04:44.840> follow<00:04:45.139> the

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
math you literally just follow the

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.080 
math you literally just follow the
simple<00:04:45.620> workflow<00:04:45.949> and<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:46.819> can<00:04:46.940> take<00:04:47.060> a

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
simple workflow and you can take a

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.300 
simple workflow and you can take a
perfect<00:04:47.569> photo<00:04:47.780> in<00:04:48.050> manual<00:04:48.710> mode<00:04:48.770> one<00:04:49.099> hundred
