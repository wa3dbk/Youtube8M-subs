00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
were being true to who they were and and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.090 
were being true to who they were and and
how<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:30.960> were<00:01:31.020> interpreting<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> music<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
how they were interpreting the music and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.060 
how they were interpreting the music and
it<00:01:32.220> became<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> phenomenon<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.799> it's<00:01:34.799> more

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it became a phenomenon so it's more

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.640

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
comfortable and I think that you'll go
far<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.740> hip-hop<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.369> form<00:01:41.610> will<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.880> far<00:01:42.150> if
