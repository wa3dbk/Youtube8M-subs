is here with American decks and he's got

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.050 
is here with American decks and he's got
a<00:00:12.170> great<00:00:12.470> solution<00:00:12.860> -<00:00:13.220> how<00:00:13.400> do<00:00:13.460> you<00:00:13.640> get<00:00:13.790> lights

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.060 
a great solution - how do you get lights

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.179 
a great solution - how do you get lights
to<00:00:14.270> your<00:00:14.330> deck<00:00:14.630> Dave<00:00:15.290> I'm<00:00:15.530> dying<00:00:15.740> to<00:00:15.950> hear<00:00:16.039> this

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
to your deck Dave I'm dying to hear this

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.070 
to your deck Dave I'm dying to hear this
because<00:00:16.550> so<00:00:16.760> many<00:00:16.880> of<00:00:17.030> my<00:00:17.060> viewers<00:00:17.150> want<00:00:17.960> to

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
because so many of my viewers want to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.870 
because so many of my viewers want to
bring<00:00:18.320> a<00:00:18.350> light<00:00:18.620> -<00:00:18.890> they're<00:00:19.010> outside<00:00:19.130> spaces

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
bring a light - they're outside spaces

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.090 
bring a light - they're outside spaces
so<00:00:20.300> how<00:00:20.420> does<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.630> system<00:00:20.810> work<00:00:20.990> well<00:00:21.800> Vicki

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
so how does the system work well Vicki

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.160 
so how does the system work well Vicki
the<00:00:22.820> guts<00:00:23.090> of<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.300> system<00:00:23.690> is<00:00:23.780> this<00:00:23.900> little

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
the guts of the system is this little

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.010 
the guts of the system is this little
secret<00:00:24.440> this<00:00:24.800> is<00:00:24.860> the<00:00:25.190> power<00:00:25.400> supply<00:00:25.880> this<00:00:26.750> is

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
secret this is the power supply this is

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.480 
secret this is the power supply this is
a<00:00:27.530> DC<00:00:28.280> current<00:00:28.869> LED<00:00:29.869> based<00:00:30.080> system<00:00:30.680> and<00:00:31.340> what

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
a DC current LED based system and what

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.220 
a DC current LED based system and what
does<00:00:31.580> that<00:00:31.610> mean<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:31.970> me<00:00:32.090> what<00:00:32.539> that<00:00:32.689> means<00:00:32.960> is

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
does that mean to me what that means is

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.099 
does that mean to me what that means is
most<00:00:34.039> systems<00:00:34.489> on<00:00:34.609> the<00:00:34.699> market<00:00:34.730> are<00:00:35.359> AC<00:00:35.690> based

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
most systems on the market are AC based

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.799 
most systems on the market are AC based
this<00:00:37.039> converts<00:00:37.670> immediately<00:00:38.600> at<00:00:38.780> the

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
this converts immediately at the

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.860 
this converts immediately at the
receptacle<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.890> DC<00:00:40.370> current<00:00:40.760> okay<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.659> that

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
receptacle to DC current okay and that

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.319 
receptacle to DC current okay and that
allows<00:00:42.199> us<00:00:42.229> to<00:00:42.440> power<00:00:42.890> up<00:00:43.159> more<00:00:43.699> than<00:00:43.879> 50

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
allows us to power up more than 50

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.360 
allows us to power up more than 50
fixtures<00:00:44.809> off<00:00:45.319> of<00:00:45.530> this<00:00:45.620> one<00:00:45.800> model<00:00:46.100> off<00:00:46.219> of

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
fixtures off of this one model off of

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.829 
fixtures off of this one model off of
this<00:00:46.429> one<00:00:46.639> little<00:00:46.850> guy<00:00:46.999> okay

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
this one little guy okay

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.450 
this one little guy okay
and<00:00:47.929> because<00:00:48.319> they're<00:00:48.469> LED<00:00:48.859> that<00:00:49.129> means<00:00:49.339> that

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
and because they're LED that means that

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.649 
and because they're LED that means that
it<00:00:49.550> doesn't<00:00:49.579> take<00:00:49.909> a<00:00:49.969> lot<00:00:50.120> of<00:00:50.239> energy<00:00:50.569> right

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
it doesn't take a lot of energy right

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.020 
it doesn't take a lot of energy right
means<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.589> takes<00:00:51.710> pennies<00:00:52.190> per<00:00:52.370> month<00:00:52.579> versus

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
means it takes pennies per month versus

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.520 
means it takes pennies per month versus
dollars<00:00:53.359> per<00:00:53.539> month<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:53.809> like<00:00:54.049> that<00:00:54.229> right<00:00:54.499> away

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
dollars per month I like that right away

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.639 
dollars per month I like that right away
okay<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:55.370> now<00:00:55.609> this<00:00:55.819> goes<00:00:56.089> where<00:00:56.389> this<00:00:57.199> Reed

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
okay so now this goes where this Reed

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.489 
okay so now this goes where this Reed

so now that we've got that connected how

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.410 
so now that we've got that connected how
about<00:01:19.219> the<00:01:19.340> steps<00:01:19.640> because<00:01:19.850> that's<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.270> most

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
walk out our dark deck how can we do

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.410 
walk out our dark deck how can we do
that<00:01:24.380> well<00:01:25.070> what<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:25.369> do<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.759> key<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:26.060> is<00:01:26.240> we

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
that well what we do the key that is we

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.630 
that well what we do the key that is we
we<00:01:26.869> take<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.140> 30-foot<00:01:27.530> lead<00:01:27.799> right<00:01:28.399> from<00:01:28.579> the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
we take the 30-foot lead right from the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.700 
we take the 30-foot lead right from the
power<00:01:28.820> supply<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.479> we<00:01:29.929> take<00:01:30.140> it<00:01:30.259> to<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.439> first

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
power supply and we take it to the first

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.889 
power supply and we take it to the first
patented<00:01:31.369> plug<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.820> play<00:01:31.969> wiring<00:01:32.000> harness<00:01:32.780> on

patented plug and play wiring harness on
the<00:01:33.020> system<00:01:33.350> okay<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.250> what<00:01:34.429> this<00:01:34.579> becomes

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
the system okay and so what this becomes

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.029 
the system okay and so what this becomes
is<00:01:35.179> a<00:01:35.210> daisy<00:01:35.539> chain<00:01:35.719> of<00:01:36.170> these<00:01:36.560> harnesses

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
is a daisy chain of these harnesses

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.429 
is a daisy chain of these harnesses
underneath<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.460> deck<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.810> they<00:01:39.079> just<00:01:39.259> simply

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
underneath the deck and they just simply

poke this through and all we do is then

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.929 
poke this through and all we do is then
just<00:01:45.770> plug<00:01:46.189> this<00:01:46.340> in<00:01:46.520> together

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939
