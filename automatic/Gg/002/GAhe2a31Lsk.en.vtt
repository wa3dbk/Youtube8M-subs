00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
think about the device are you going to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.039 
think about the device are you going to
upgrade<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> galaxy<00:00:12.269> s5<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.840> do<00:00:12.929> you

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
upgrade to the galaxy s5 what do you

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.570 
upgrade to the galaxy s5 what do you
think<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.530> maybe<00:00:13.710> you've<00:00:13.950> got<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> galaxy

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
think of it maybe you've got the galaxy

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.620 
think of it maybe you've got the galaxy
s4<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:14.969> you're<00:00:15.059> thinking<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.540> upgrading

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
s4 and you're thinking about upgrading

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.410 
s4 and you're thinking about upgrading
let<00:00:16.560> me<00:00:16.710> know<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.010> comments<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.150> we'll

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
let me know in the comments so we'll

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.580 
let me know in the comments so we'll
start<00:00:18.630> off<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.869> design<00:00:19.199> here<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.470> can

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
start off with the design here you can

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.349 
start off with the design here you can
see<00:00:19.740> from<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> right-hand<00:00:20.460> side<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.029> front

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
see from the right-hand side the front

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.759 
see from the right-hand side the front
of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> device<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.080> pretty<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.289> follows

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
of the device and it pretty much follows

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.160 
of the device and it pretty much follows
any<00:00:23.039> other<00:00:23.279> galaxy<00:00:23.760> s<00:00:23.880> device<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.539> not<00:00:24.869> much

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
any other galaxy s device here not much

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.689 
any other galaxy s device here not much
has<00:00:25.380> changed<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:26.070> you've<00:00:26.279> still<00:00:26.519> got<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
has changed really you've still got the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.160 
has changed really you've still got the
physical<00:00:27.150> home<00:00:27.330> button<00:00:27.359> which<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.109> case

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
physical home button which in this case

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.140 
physical home button which in this case
does<00:00:28.619> double<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.279> fingerprint<00:00:29.760> scanner

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
does double as a fingerprint scanner

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.089 
does double as a fingerprint scanner
you've<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> capacitive<00:00:31.619> buttons<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you've got the capacitive buttons on the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
you've got the capacitive buttons on the
left<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:32.520> hand<00:00:32.820> side<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.210> some<00:00:33.329> reason

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
left and right hand side for some reason

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.850 
left and right hand side for some reason
they<00:00:33.660> always<00:00:33.870> put<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.050> back<00:00:34.320> button<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
they always put the back button on the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.370 
they always put the back button on the
right-hand<00:00:35.010> side<00:00:35.250> don't<00:00:35.790> ask<00:00:36.059> me<00:00:36.300> why<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
right-hand side don't ask me why but the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.840 
right-hand side don't ask me why but the
front<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> device<00:00:37.800> other<00:00:38.250> than<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
front of the device other than that is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.080 
front of the device other than that is
pretty<00:00:39.690> much<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.379> same<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> galaxy<00:00:41.489> s4

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
pretty much the same as the galaxy s4

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.240 
pretty much the same as the galaxy s4
it's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> bit<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> bigger<00:00:42.840> screen<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.260> 5.1<00:00:44.070> inch

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it's a bit of a bigger screen a 5.1 inch

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.010 
it's a bit of a bigger screen a 5.1 inch
display<00:00:44.579> will<00:00:44.760> talk<00:00:44.910> about<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.270> specs<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
display will talk about the specs a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.330 
display will talk about the specs a
little<00:00:46.200> bit<00:00:46.289> later<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.829> too<00:00:47.039> much<00:00:47.070> has

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
little bit later but not too much has

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
little bit later but not too much has
changed<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:48.030> terms<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> back<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
changed in terms of the back of the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.750 
changed in terms of the back of the
device<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> picture<00:00:50.670> on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
device you can see from the picture on

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
device you can see from the picture on
the<00:00:50.789> left<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.149> does<00:00:51.329> come<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.899> variety<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the left it does come in a variety of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
the left it does come in a variety of
different<00:00:52.590> colors<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> blue<00:00:53.460> black<00:00:53.910> gold<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
different colors of blue black gold and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.090 
different colors of blue black gold and
I<00:00:54.719> believe<00:00:54.960> white<00:00:55.260> which<00:00:55.469> isn't<00:00:55.770> shown<00:00:55.829> in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I believe white which isn't shown in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.279 
I believe white which isn't shown in
that<00:00:56.219> picture<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.750> some<00:00:57.960> fancy

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that picture they do have some fancy

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.260 
that picture they do have some fancy
names<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> colors<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.760> are<00:01:00.059> what

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
names for the colors but they are what

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.299 
names for the colors but they are what
the<00:01:00.359> colors<00:01:00.629> basically<00:01:01.050> are<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.440> doesn't<00:01:02.010> have

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the colors basically are it doesn't have

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
the colors basically are it doesn't have
the<00:01:02.550> faux<00:01:02.820> material<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.510> saw<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> note<00:01:04.199> 3

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the faux material we saw on the note 3

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
the faux material we saw on the note 3
but<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.860> does<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.580> soft<00:01:05.939> touch<00:01:06.470> plastic

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
but it does have this soft touch plastic

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
but it does have this soft touch plastic
with<00:01:07.710> these<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> weird<00:01:08.670> little<00:01:09.030> bumps

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
with these kind of weird little bumps

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
with these kind of weird little bumps
now<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.869> quite<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.140> how<00:01:10.290> these<00:01:10.590> feel<00:01:10.860> in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
now I don't quite know how these feel in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250 
now I don't quite know how these feel in
the<00:01:11.159> hand<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.659> want<00:01:12.840> my<00:01:12.960> honest

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the hand but if you want my honest

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
the hand but if you want my honest
opinion<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> way<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> looks<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> me<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
opinion the way it looks to me is a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420 
opinion the way it looks to me is a
little<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.439> tacky<00:01:16.740> side<00:01:17.070> especially

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
little bit on the tacky side especially

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
little bit on the tacky side especially
the<00:01:18.000> gold<00:01:18.299> color<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.869> i<00:01:18.930> always<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.350> God

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the gold color but i always think God

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.960 
the gold color but i always think God
looks<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> little<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.220> tacky<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.759> opinion

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
looks a little bit tacky in my opinion

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.149 
looks a little bit tacky in my opinion
but<00:01:21.659> these<00:01:22.020> little<00:01:22.259> bump<00:01:22.650> things<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.100> don't

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
but these little bump things I don't

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.740 
but these little bump things I don't
know<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:23.520> they<00:01:23.670> feel<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> hand<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
know how they feel in the hand but it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.789 
know how they feel in the hand but it
just<00:01:24.900> looks<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.290> bit<00:01:25.439> where<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> me

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
just looks a little bit where to me

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.980 
just looks a little bit where to me
there's<00:01:26.310> no<00:01:26.520> metal<00:01:26.850> design<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
there's no metal design here it's not a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.780 
there's no metal design here it's not a
fully<00:01:28.320> metal<00:01:28.710> build<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.100> still<00:01:29.310> plastic

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
fully metal build it's still plastic

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.550 
fully metal build it's still plastic
with<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> removable<00:01:30.299> back<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.290> change

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
with a removable back so you can change

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.499 
with a removable back so you can change
out<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> battery<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> want<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.329> does

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
out the battery if you want and it does

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
out the battery if you want and it does
have<00:01:33.750> an<00:01:33.869> SD<00:01:34.079> card<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.799> you'll<00:01:35.009> find<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.460> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
have an SD card which you'll find out is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.819 
have an SD card which you'll find out is
really<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.570> needed<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> galaxy<00:01:37.650> s

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
really really needed on a galaxy s

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.950 
really really needed on a galaxy s
device<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> I'll<00:01:38.820> tell<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.090> why<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.540> second

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
device and I'll tell you why in a second

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
device and I'll tell you why in a second
but<00:01:40.530> let<00:01:41.100> me<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
but let me know what you think about the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
but let me know what you think about the
design<00:01:42.270> guys<00:01:42.509> let's<00:01:43.020> move<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> specs<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
design guys let's move on to the specs a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.190 
design guys let's move on to the specs a
case<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> comparison<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.659> between<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
case of a comparison here between the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
case of a comparison here between the
new<00:01:46.350> Galaxy<00:01:46.770> s5<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> left<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
new Galaxy s5 on the left and the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730 
new Galaxy s5 on the left and the
predecessor<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.540> galaxy<00:01:49.049> s4<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> right

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
predecessor the galaxy s4 on the right

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.080 
predecessor the galaxy s4 on the right
so<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.579> where<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so we can actually see where the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
so we can actually see where the
difference<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.600> lie<00:01:51.869> now<00:01:52.500> we'll<00:01:52.680> start<00:01:52.890> off

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
difference is lie now we'll start off

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.469 
difference is lie now we'll start off
with<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.130> dimensions<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.880> essentially<00:01:54.329> what

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
with the dimensions and essentially what

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.969 
with the dimensions and essentially what
you're<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> gates<00:01:55.380> s5<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.829> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you're going to see is the gates s5 is a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
you're going to see is the gates s5 is a
little<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.340> bigger<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> wider<00:01:57.000> than<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
little bit bigger and wider than the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.149 
little bit bigger and wider than the
galaxy<00:01:57.810> s4<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.680> pretty<00:01:59.009> obvious

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
galaxy s4 that's pretty obvious

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.530 
galaxy s4 that's pretty obvious
considering<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.850> have<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> slightly<00:02:00.299> bigger

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
considering we have a slightly bigger

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.510 
considering we have a slightly bigger
screen<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> there's<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> few<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:01.860> sensors<00:02:02.369> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
screen and there's a few more sensors in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249 
screen and there's a few more sensors in
the<00:02:02.610> galaxy<00:02:02.969> s5<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.420> aren't<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> galaxy

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the galaxy s5 that aren't in the galaxy

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.580 
the galaxy s5 that aren't in the galaxy
s4<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:05.009> also<00:02:05.340> weighs<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> bit<00:02:05.939> more<00:02:06.290> 145<00:02:07.290> grams

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
s4 it also weighs a bit more 145 grams

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.160 
s4 it also weighs a bit more 145 grams
compared<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.129> 130<00:02:08.789> grams<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.660> probably<00:02:09.959> won't

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
compared to 130 grams you probably won't

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.750 
compared to 130 grams you probably won't
notice<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> difference<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:11.069> total<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
notice the difference in total the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.820 
notice the difference in total the
footprint<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> galaxy<00:02:12.840> s5<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.260> about

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
footprint of the galaxy s5 is about

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.950 
footprint of the galaxy s5 is about
the<00:02:13.950> same<00:02:14.190> as<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> galaxy<00:02:14.610> s4<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.720> probably

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
the same as the galaxy s4 you probably

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.480 
the same as the galaxy s4 you probably
won't<00:02:16.200> notice<00:02:16.350> if<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.650> held<00:02:16.950> them<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.280> may<00:02:17.430> be

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
won't notice if you held them it may be

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.550 
won't notice if you held them it may be
slightly<00:02:18.090> wider<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:18.750> again<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.260> probably

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
slightly wider but again you probably

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
slightly wider but again you probably
wouldn't<00:02:19.890> notice<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.370> will<00:02:20.940> scroll<00:02:21.180> down

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
wouldn't notice that will scroll down

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.720 
wouldn't notice that will scroll down
here<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.870> we'll<00:02:22.080> check<00:02:22.350> out<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.490> does

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
here and we'll check out this so it does

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.460 
here and we'll check out this so it does

it's also ip67 certified which means

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.000 
it's also ip67 certified which means

something<00:02:36.510> I'm<00:02:36.630> really<00:02:36.660> glad<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.350> see<00:02:37.530> because

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
something I'm really glad to see because

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.590 
something I'm really glad to see because
we<00:02:38.040> saw<00:02:38.220> Samsung<00:02:38.700> release<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.180> Samsung

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
we saw Samsung release the Samsung

we saw Samsung release the Samsung
active<00:02:40.050> which<00:02:40.320> was<00:02:40.470> essentially<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.950> galaxy<00:02:41.550> s4

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970

they've joined that all into one and

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
included it in the galaxy s5 so you

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.270 
included it in the galaxy s5 so you
don't<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> separate<00:02:49.740> device<00:02:50.040> for

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
don't have to have a separate device for

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.650 
don't have to have a separate device for
whether<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.490> go<00:02:50.670> outdoors<00:02:51.150> into<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
whether you go outdoors into the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.690 
whether you go outdoors into the
wilderness<00:02:52.290> or<00:02:52.740> drop<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.220> down<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.520> toilet

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
wilderness or drop it down the toilet

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.520 
wilderness or drop it down the toilet
it's<00:02:54.390> going<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.930> little<00:02:55.080> bit<00:02:55.290> tougher

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
it's going to be that little bit tougher

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.440 
it's going to be that little bit tougher
so<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:56.310> always<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.580> good<00:02:56.820> thing<00:02:56.880> you're

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
so that's always a good thing you're

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.550 
so that's always a good thing you're
probably<00:02:57.630> wondering<00:02:58.080> how<00:02:58.260> they<00:02:58.410> actually

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
probably wondering how they actually

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.110 
probably wondering how they actually
make<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:59.010> water<00:02:59.190> resistant<00:02:59.700> they<00:02:59.820> actually

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
make it water resistant they actually

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.449 
make it water resistant they actually
include<00:03:00.570> little<00:03:00.900> flaps<00:03:01.170> over<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.830> ports<00:03:02.220> I

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
include little flaps over the ports I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.430 
include little flaps over the ports I
don't<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.570> about<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.870> build<00:03:04.050> quality<00:03:04.170> of

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
don't know about the build quality of

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.660 
don't know about the build quality of
those<00:03:04.560> flap<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:04.980> I'm<00:03:05.040> guessing<00:03:05.280> they'll<00:03:05.580> be

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
those flap so I'm guessing they'll be

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.250 
those flap so I'm guessing they'll be
plastic<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.270> you'll<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.570> uncover<00:03:06.840> them

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
plastic but you'll have to uncover them

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.930 
plastic but you'll have to uncover them
every<00:03:07.500> time<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.770> want<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.040> use<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> port<00:03:08.640> in

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
every time you want to use a port in

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.910 
every time you want to use a port in
terms<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> display<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.110> still<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.380> super

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
terms of the display is still a super

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.520 
terms of the display is still a super

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
not to K that loads the leak suggested

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.050 
not to K that loads the leak suggested
it<00:03:15.990> was<00:03:16.080> going<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.320> be<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.920> 5.1<00:03:17.730> inches

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
it was going to be it's 5.1 inches

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.870 
it was going to be it's 5.1 inches
inside<00:03:18.390> with<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.660> pixel<00:03:19.050> density<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.880> 432

inside with the pixel density of 432

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640 
inside with the pixel density of 432
that's<00:03:21.390> actually<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.780> little<00:03:21.870> bit<00:03:22.080> less<00:03:22.380> than

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
that's actually a little bit less than

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.530 
that's actually a little bit less than
the<00:03:23.010> galaxy<00:03:23.459> s4<00:03:23.760> obviously<00:03:24.150> because<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.330> had<00:03:24.510> a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
the galaxy s4 obviously because it had a

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.120 
the galaxy s4 obviously because it had a
marginally<00:03:25.110> smaller<00:03:25.440> screen<00:03:25.860> but<00:03:26.070> you

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
marginally smaller screen but you

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.590 
marginally smaller screen but you
probably<00:03:26.370> won't<00:03:26.519> notice<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.120> difference<00:03:27.450> at

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
probably won't notice that difference at

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.090 
probably won't notice that difference at
all<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.080> it's<00:03:28.530> still<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:29.040> 1080p<00:03:29.600> panel<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:31.290> yeah

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
all and it's still a 1080p panel so yeah

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.199 
all and it's still a 1080p panel so yeah
we'll<00:03:32.250> move<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.580> for<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.850> because<00:03:32.940> it's<00:03:33.090> not

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
we'll move on for that because it's not

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.240 
we'll move on for that because it's not
much<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.630> say<00:03:33.780> here<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.110> still<00:03:34.320> has<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> micro<00:03:34.920> SD

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
much to say here it still has a micro SD

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.790 
much to say here it still has a micro SD
card<00:03:35.519> slot<00:03:35.580> up<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.060> 128<00:03:36.780> gigabytes<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.560> comes

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
card slot up to 128 gigabytes it comes

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800 
card slot up to 128 gigabytes it comes
with<00:03:37.950> 16<00:03:38.340> or<00:03:38.489> 32<00:03:39.030> gigabytes<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.630> internal

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
with 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.380 
with 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal
storage<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.590> two<00:03:41.250> gigabytes<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.880> RAM<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.300> it

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
storage and two gigabytes of RAM so it

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.790 
storage and two gigabytes of RAM so it
still<00:03:42.540> doesn't<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.050> three<00:03:43.410> gigabyte

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
still doesn't have that three gigabyte

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.380 
still doesn't have that three gigabyte
upgrade<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.430> saw<00:03:44.640> some<00:03:44.910> other<00:03:44.970> devices

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
upgrade that we saw some other devices

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.930 
upgrade that we saw some other devices
have<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.050> believe<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.530> Xperia<00:03:46.980> z2<00:03:47.790> I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
have like I believe the Xperia z2 I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.270 
have like I believe the Xperia z2 I
think<00:03:48.300> has<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.660> now<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.650> mentioned<00:03:50.160> before

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
think has that now I mentioned before

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.460 
think has that now I mentioned before
that<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.700> probably<00:03:51.269> need<00:03:51.600> more<00:03:51.930> space<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:52.410> a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
that you probably need more space on a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.860 
that you probably need more space on a
galaxy<00:03:52.769> device<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.459> an<00:03:53.550> SD<00:03:53.880> card<00:03:53.910> because<00:03:54.600> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
galaxy device and an SD card because the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.170 
galaxy device and an SD card because the

rom for TouchWiz on the galaxy s5 is

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.170 
rom for TouchWiz on the galaxy s5 is
eight<00:03:57.900> gig<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.650> takes<00:03:58.920> up<00:03:59.130> 8<00:03:59.310> gigabytes<00:04:00.000> of

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
eight gig it takes up 8 gigabytes of

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.150 
eight gig it takes up 8 gigabytes of
your<00:04:00.330> space<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:00.870> if<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.050> have<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> 16<00:04:01.890> gigabyte

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
your space so if you have a 16 gigabyte

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.250 
your space so if you have a 16 gigabyte
model<00:04:02.459> that's<00:04:03.000> pretty<00:04:03.239> much<00:04:03.450> half<00:04:03.780> your<00:04:04.019> space

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
model that's pretty much half your space

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.440 
model that's pretty much half your space
gone<00:04:04.590> just<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.340> take<00:04:05.550> out<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.970> box<00:04:06.239> you

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
gone just as you take out the box you

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.150 
gone just as you take out the box you
haven't<00:04:06.690> even<00:04:06.780> installed<00:04:07.260> any<00:04:07.410> apps<00:04:07.620> yet<00:04:07.830> so

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
haven't even installed any apps yet so

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.220 
haven't even installed any apps yet so
be<00:04:08.370> aware<00:04:08.610> of<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.790> if<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.540> want<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> galaxy

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
be aware of that if you want the galaxy

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.400 
be aware of that if you want the galaxy
s5<00:04:10.820> moving<00:04:11.820> on<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.330> camera<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.049> this<00:04:13.260> is

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
s5 moving on to the camera and this is

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.860 
s5 moving on to the camera and this is
an<00:04:13.500> area<00:04:13.590> why<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:13.950> think<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.239> nice<00:04:15.600> upgrade

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
an area why I think it is a nice upgrade

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.909 
an area why I think it is a nice upgrade
its<00:04:16.320> 16<00:04:16.830> megapixels<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.940> has<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.229> capability

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
its 16 megapixels it has the capability

impressive stats with the camera can't

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.460 
impressive stats with the camera can't
wait<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.389> actually<00:04:34.479> test<00:04:34.810> out<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.139> camera<00:04:35.410> it

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
wait to actually test out the camera it

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.860 
wait to actually test out the camera it
should<00:04:35.680> produce<00:04:35.830> some<00:04:36.129> really<00:04:36.370> nice<00:04:36.520> shots<00:04:36.870> 4k

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
should produce some really nice shots 4k

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.749

display 4k as being only 1080p so I'm
not<00:04:48.699> sure<00:04:48.909> how<00:04:49.060> much<00:04:49.180> that's<00:04:49.539> a<00:04:49.659> useful

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
not sure how much that's a useful

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.149 
not sure how much that's a useful
feature<00:04:50.139> and<00:04:50.379> it<00:04:50.409> will<00:04:50.590> take<00:04:50.770> up<00:04:50.919> a<00:04:51.009> lot<00:04:51.099> of

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
feature and it will take up a lot of

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
4.4 point2 KitKat the chipset is the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.920 
4.4 point2 KitKat the chipset is the
Snapdragon<00:04:57.370> 801<00:04:57.699> that<00:04:58.060> is<00:04:58.180> confirmed<00:04:58.690> there's

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
Snapdragon 801 that is confirmed there's

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.659 
Snapdragon 801 that is confirmed there's
also<00:04:59.050> another<00:04:59.349> model<00:04:59.919> with<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:00.159> Exynos

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
also another model with the Exynos

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.159 
also another model with the Exynos
chipset<00:05:01.150> but<00:05:01.360> we'll<00:05:01.479> just<00:05:01.659> talk<00:05:01.810> about<00:05:01.930> the

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
chipset but we'll just talk about the

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.370 
chipset but we'll just talk about the
801<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:03.340> it's<00:05:03.669> the<00:05:03.909> quad<00:05:04.180> core<00:05:04.389> 2.5<00:05:05.020> gigahertz

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
801 so it's the quad core 2.5 gigahertz

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.460 
801 so it's the quad core 2.5 gigahertz
Krait<00:05:05.860> 400<00:05:06.130> with<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.789> Adreno<00:05:07.180> 330<00:05:07.569> GPU<00:05:07.720> so<00:05:08.349> it

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
Krait 400 with the Adreno 330 GPU so it

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.680 
Krait 400 with the Adreno 330 GPU so it
has<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.650> higher<00:05:08.979> clock<00:05:09.370> than<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.330> snapdragon

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
has a higher clock than the snapdragon

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.920 
has a higher clock than the snapdragon
800<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.889> GPU<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.789> Adreno<00:05:13.150> 330<00:05:13.539> is<00:05:13.780> the

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
800 and the GPU the Adreno 330 is the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.689 
800 and the GPU the Adreno 330 is the
same<00:05:14.139> one<00:05:14.319> that's<00:05:14.470> in<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.680> Nexus<00:05:15.039> 5<00:05:15.220> but<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.610> is

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
same one that's in the Nexus 5 but it is

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.050 
same one that's in the Nexus 5 but it is
also<00:05:15.909> overclocked<00:05:16.659> to<00:05:17.280> 587<00:05:18.280> megahertz<00:05:18.880> now

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
also overclocked to 587 megahertz now

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.820 
also overclocked to 587 megahertz now
that<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.389> quite<00:05:19.599> a<00:05:19.659> substantial<00:05:19.870> overcook<00:05:20.680> and

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
that is quite a substantial overcook and

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.980 
that is quite a substantial overcook and
it<00:05:20.889> actually<00:05:21.009> puts<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.610> GPU<00:05:22.060> right<00:05:22.719> at<00:05:22.900> the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
it actually puts the GPU right at the

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.390 
it actually puts the GPU right at the
top<00:05:23.169> of<00:05:23.229> the<00:05:23.380> list<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.710> pretty<00:05:23.949> much<00:05:24.009> any

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
top of the list of pretty much any

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.279 
top of the list of pretty much any

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
device out there right now so it has

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.279 
device out there right now so it has
taken<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.889> nice<00:05:27.520> upgrade<00:05:28.120> in<00:05:28.270> terms<00:05:28.870> of<00:05:28.990> clocks

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
taken a nice upgrade in terms of clocks

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.050 
taken a nice upgrade in terms of clocks
at<00:05:29.500> least<00:05:29.710> but<00:05:29.949> a<00:05:29.979> lot<00:05:30.219> of<00:05:30.250> people<00:05:30.520> were<00:05:30.639> hoping

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
at least but a lot of people were hoping

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.749 
at least but a lot of people were hoping
for<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.479> Snapdragon<00:05:32.020> 805<00:05:32.430> that<00:05:33.430> didn't

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
for the Snapdragon 805 that didn't

materialize moving on where else do we
have<00:05:35.919> here<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.250> battery<00:05:36.699> it's<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:36.940> two

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120

battery<00:05:38.289> so<00:05:38.889> slightly<00:05:39.250> bigger<00:05:39.520> than<00:05:39.669> the

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
battery so slightly bigger than the

it<00:05:43.300> would<00:05:43.360> give<00:05:43.539> you<00:05:43.659> 21<00:05:44.229> hours<00:05:44.529> of<00:05:44.650> talk<00:05:44.860> time

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
it would give you 21 hours of talk time

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.800 
it would give you 21 hours of talk time
we'll<00:05:45.310> have<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.550> see<00:05:45.699> how<00:05:45.729> that<00:05:46.000> goes<00:05:46.029> they

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
we'll have to see how that goes they

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.019 
we'll have to see how that goes they
also<00:05:46.990> added<00:05:47.349> a<00:05:47.590> new<00:05:47.860> power<00:05:48.159> saving<00:05:48.669> mode<00:05:48.699> to

also added a new power saving mode to

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.089 
also added a new power saving mode to
touch<00:05:49.240> with<00:05:49.509> which<00:05:49.750> being<00:05:50.199> an<00:05:50.349> AMOLED<00:05:50.740> display

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.249 
touch with which being an AMOLED display
basically<00:05:51.699> if<00:05:51.789> you<00:05:51.880> turn<00:05:52.090> that<00:05:52.240> on<00:05:52.300> it<00:05:52.750> just

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
basically if you turn that on it just

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.230 
basically if you turn that on it just
change<00:05:53.529> changes<00:05:54.069> it<00:05:54.190> to<00:05:54.340> a<00:05:54.370> grayscale<00:05:55.029> of

change changes it to a grayscale of

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.209 
change changes it to a grayscale of
basically<00:05:55.599> black<00:05:55.930> and<00:05:56.139> white<00:05:56.319> we<00:05:56.889> all<00:05:57.039> know

basically black and white we all know

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.249 
basically black and white we all know
that<00:05:57.250> AMOLED<00:05:57.880> displays<00:05:58.270> don't<00:05:58.599> use<00:05:58.779> any<00:05:58.990> power

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
that AMOLED displays don't use any power

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.200 
that AMOLED displays don't use any power
to<00:05:59.560> display<00:05:59.889> black<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:00.460> that<00:06:00.639> should<00:06:00.819> save<00:06:01.090> you

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
to display black so that should save you

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.689 
to display black so that should save you
some<00:06:01.389> battery<00:06:01.750> life<00:06:01.930> if<00:06:02.139> you<00:06:02.289> need<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.680> now<00:06:03.460> it

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
some battery life if you need it now it

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.790 
some battery life if you need it now it
also<00:06:03.849> has<00:06:04.180> a<00:06:04.210> heart<00:06:04.719> rate<00:06:04.870> monitor<00:06:04.930> built<00:06:05.529> into

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
also has a heart rate monitor built into

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.110 
also has a heart rate monitor built into
the<00:06:05.889> software<00:06:06.069> now<00:06:06.520> that's<00:06:06.729> not<00:06:06.969> that

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
the software now that's not that

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.850 
the software now that's not that
interesting<00:06:07.659> because<00:06:07.779> it<00:06:07.960> uses<00:06:08.139> the<00:06:08.259> flash<00:06:08.620> to

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
interesting because it uses the flash to

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.279 
interesting because it uses the flash to
actually<00:06:09.159> check<00:06:10.000> out<00:06:10.180> your<00:06:10.360> heart<00:06:10.539> rate<00:06:10.810> you

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
actually check out your heart rate you

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.570 
actually check out your heart rate you
can<00:06:11.469> download<00:06:11.650> an<00:06:11.919> app<00:06:12.039> from<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.250> Play<00:06:12.520> Store

can download an app from the Play Store

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.279 
can download an app from the Play Store
that<00:06:12.969> will<00:06:13.060> do<00:06:13.210> that<00:06:13.389> it's<00:06:13.539> just<00:06:13.719> built<00:06:13.990> into

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
that will do that it's just built into

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.589 
that will do that it's just built into
the<00:06:14.380> software<00:06:14.590> of<00:06:15.099> the<00:06:15.130> s<00:06:15.610> health<00:06:15.909> fitness

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
application for for the galaxy s5 but

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.050 
application for for the galaxy s5 but
the<00:06:19.960> fingerprint<00:06:20.409> scanner<00:06:20.710> pretty<00:06:21.610> much<00:06:21.849> is<00:06:22.029> a

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
the fingerprint scanner pretty much is a

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.939 
the fingerprint scanner pretty much is a
direct<00:06:22.719> copy<00:06:22.900> of<00:06:23.080> Apple<00:06:23.349> it<00:06:23.469> works<00:06:23.680> a<00:06:23.830> little

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
direct copy of Apple it works a little

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.649 
direct copy of Apple it works a little
bit<00:06:24.099> differently<00:06:24.490> but<00:06:24.789> you<00:06:24.969> could<00:06:25.180> have<00:06:25.210> bet

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659 
bit differently but you could have bet

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:27.480 
bit differently but you could have bet
any<00:06:25.840> money<00:06:25.960> on<00:06:26.259> it<00:06:26.380> that<00:06:26.710> if<00:06:26.860> Apple<00:06:27.219> didn't

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
any money on it that if Apple didn't

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.580 
any money on it that if Apple didn't
have<00:06:27.639> it<00:06:27.729> on<00:06:27.789> the<00:06:27.940> device<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.449> doubt<00:06:28.810> samsung

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
have it on the device I doubt samsung

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.379 
have it on the device I doubt samsung
would<00:06:29.710> have<00:06:29.800> had<00:06:29.919> it<00:06:30.009> on<00:06:30.099> their<00:06:30.340> device<00:06:30.639> so

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
would have had it on their device so

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.659 
would have had it on their device so
yeah<00:06:32.199> that's<00:06:32.620> pretty<00:06:32.800> much<00:06:33.009> it<00:06:33.159> in<00:06:33.340> terms<00:06:33.580> of

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
yeah that's pretty much it in terms of

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.219 
yeah that's pretty much it in terms of
the<00:06:33.759> specs<00:06:34.000> I<00:06:34.120> want<00:06:34.300> to<00:06:34.360> talk<00:06:34.539> about<00:06:34.690> here<00:06:35.050> oh

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
the specs I want to talk about here oh

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.260 
the specs I want to talk about here oh
another<00:06:35.830> thing<00:06:35.949> I<00:06:36.130> just<00:06:36.550> wanted<00:06:36.729> to<00:06:36.759> notice<00:06:37.089> is

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
another thing I just wanted to notice is

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.360 
another thing I just wanted to notice is
it<00:06:37.630> does<00:06:37.839> actually<00:06:37.990> use<00:06:38.259> a<00:06:38.289> nano-sim<00:06:38.919> compared

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
it does actually use a nano-sim compared

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.350 
it does actually use a nano-sim compared
to<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:39.550> galaxy<00:06:39.880> s4<00:06:40.149> micro<00:06:40.599> sim<00:06:40.810> just<00:06:40.990> to<00:06:41.080> be

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
to the galaxy s4 micro sim just to be

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.149 
to the galaxy s4 micro sim just to be
a<00:06:41.389> bit<00:06:41.539> more<00:06:41.689> annoying<00:06:42.050> for<00:06:42.379> us<00:06:42.469> who<00:06:42.919> like

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
a bit more annoying for us who like

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.100 
a bit more annoying for us who like
change<00:06:43.520> their<00:06:43.669> phone<00:06:43.819> quite<00:06:44.060> a<00:06:44.090> lot<00:06:44.300> so<00:06:44.840> moving

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
change their phone quite a lot so moving

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.209 
change their phone quite a lot so moving
on<00:06:45.199> to<00:06:45.349> my<00:06:45.469> thoughts<00:06:45.710> and<00:06:45.919> quite<00:06:46.189> honestly

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:46.219 
on to my thoughts and quite honestly

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:48.520 
on to my thoughts and quite honestly
I've<00:06:46.819> got<00:06:47.060> to<00:06:47.150> say<00:06:47.300> I'm<00:06:47.509> underwhelmed<00:06:48.080> by<00:06:48.379> the

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
I've got to say I'm underwhelmed by the

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.529 
I've got to say I'm underwhelmed by the
galaxy<00:06:49.039> s5<00:06:49.370> I<00:06:49.400> just<00:06:49.699> think<00:06:49.909> companies<00:06:50.300> not

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
galaxy s5 I just think companies not

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.360 
galaxy s5 I just think companies not
just<00:06:50.599> Samsung<00:06:51.259> have<00:06:51.439> just<00:06:51.620> forgotten<00:06:51.770> how<00:06:52.310> to

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
just Samsung have just forgotten how to

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.159 
just Samsung have just forgotten how to
innovate<00:06:52.789> and<00:06:53.180> they<00:06:53.270> don't<00:06:53.479> anymore<00:06:53.840> they're

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
innovate and they don't anymore they're

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.110 
innovate and they don't anymore they're
just<00:06:54.349> copy<00:06:54.949> other<00:06:55.219> companies<00:06:55.729> they<00:06:55.939> add

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
just copy other companies they add

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.779 
just copy other companies they add
little<00:06:56.599> bits<00:06:56.930> and<00:06:57.169> they<00:06:57.349> carry<00:06:58.250> on<00:06:58.430> I<00:06:58.460> just

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
little bits and they carry on I just

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.969 
little bits and they carry on I just
think<00:06:58.939> that's<00:06:59.030> what<00:06:59.270> the<00:06:59.360> galaxy<00:06:59.719> s5<00:07:00.050> is<00:07:00.080> yes

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
think that's what the galaxy s5 is yes

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.409 
think that's what the galaxy s5 is yes
it's<00:07:01.189> an<00:07:01.310> upgrade<00:07:01.699> but<00:07:01.909> there's<00:07:02.090> nothing

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
it's an upgrade but there's nothing

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.540 
it's an upgrade but there's nothing
incredibly<00:07:03.110> special<00:07:03.469> about<00:07:03.949> this<00:07:04.159> device

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
incredibly special about this device

the iphone 6 but I definitely see them

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:19.570 
the iphone 6 but I definitely see them
having<00:07:17.930> an<00:07:18.139> opportunity<00:07:18.379> to<00:07:18.949> come<00:07:19.159> back<00:07:19.400> at

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 
absolute major upgrade it doesn't feel

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.119 
absolute major upgrade it doesn't feel
like<00:07:26.060> a<00:07:26.270> slam<00:07:26.659> dunk<00:07:26.689> from<00:07:27.319> the<00:07:27.409> company<00:07:27.979> and

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:28.129 
like a slam dunk from the company and

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:30.249 
like a slam dunk from the company and
that's<00:07:28.279> why<00:07:28.460> I<00:07:28.490> think<00:07:28.580> Apple<00:07:29.569> really<00:07:29.810> do<00:07:30.050> have

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:30.259 
that's why I think Apple really do have

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:31.689 
that's why I think Apple really do have

an opportunity to come back we'll have
