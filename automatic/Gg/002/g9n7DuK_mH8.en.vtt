00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:11.500
 welcome to korschelt view of pure 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.480
 live tour since the other day I cool the movie 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.789
 I've seen wood on gravel 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.890
 somehow totally upset especially 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.810
 if I actually had to work one 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.750
 perfect solution for this problem is 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.490
 that facebook and ios play culture that 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.860
 you see action here though 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.300
 graphics held in 2d is what, after all 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.940
 Make sure the title is on everyone 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.320
 Even so rickety office computer is running like that 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.390
 there is a very good one 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.820
 physics engine in it so the matches 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.519
 always traceable 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.229
 There are different tables 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.030
 when playing as to the effect in the 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.159
 distinguish the other rules apply 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.379
 and the holes are smaller and thus 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.449
 it is also difficult to poke 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.639
 you can also compete without a goal 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.289
 what the more experience brings so 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:55.659
 you can level up faster and thus the 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.579
 unlocks other tables faster 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.709
 shop you can buy better course 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.690
 the better goal more power 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:04.299
 and the possibility to cut 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.890
 have so much to the theory 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.110
 But now let's take a look at mine 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.210
 honestly , first games 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.340
 I totally my very first and 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.110
 background is following from pool hall 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.540
 junkies we know that there are two types 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.550
 The players are the hustlers 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.830
 and the professional while the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.690
 professinals just play well and 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.910
 By doing so, the hustlers benefit 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.990
 all possibilities for your opponents 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.580
 defeat 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.140
 but we can not do any live 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.770
 Matchbox under the table 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.930
 place 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.850
 no, the only possibility otherwise 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.550
 it stays thanks to this chat window star 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.140
 massive flaming of our opponent 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.540
 and that's exactly why mine was mine 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.370
 advanced character locked what 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.750
 However, I really stupid finds because 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.660
 the things that I pass on to my opponents 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.040
 her mother would have been pure 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.230
 physically not possible 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.390
 Well, whatever that is , we're playing 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.280
 as a professional as a budding 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.190
 I am professionally admitted 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.240
 something from the exercise of an adversary is here 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.760
 always found quickly 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.550
 if our first is alex from israel 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.830
 the packaged offense I sell 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.909
 the result then beat the five red 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.909
 balls in a row 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.230
 then screw it up again and give me that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.850
 the opportunity to show them that I 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.890
 a versager'm such a crap just not 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.420
 long after that, all the red balls are gone 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.080
 he sinks black and thus has 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.930
 won 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.090
 Our next enemy is called moped 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.490
 By the way, the Czech Republic's homeland is this 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.710
 play for an unspectacular game 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.340
 I have the chance to get the black ones 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.230
 sink 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.570
 but unfortunately the white goes a little 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.530
 get in and lose a little faster 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.750
 we make the next czech again 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.580
 me, apparently, only really finished 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.170
 after all, I only have two 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.390
 balls sunk while he already 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.430
 he tries to break in the black one 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.440
 does that too, along with 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.540
 the white what a jerk 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.760
 We deserved to win that and that 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.770
 well proved it would be the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.750
 better player is we reject that from 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.640
 cdu demanded a second leg from what he did 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.990
 certainly with the patience of a true one 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.990
 gentlemans 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.640
 Now we take it with the bold 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.830
 French monier on it is said to be a close one 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.150
 I am reluctant to play 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.510
 recalls rather continue to wesley from 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.880
 england wesley wesley mercy if the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.680
 Wesley feels what he's expected 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.990
 It's really tough than he is 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.480
 then sunk his balls 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.460
 the black fails and then what 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.990
 happened is exactly what the 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.990
 professional 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.810
 After this shine it hails 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:03.659
 and wesley is happy together 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.459
 with us about our fantastic me 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.659
 think it's about time 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.609
 to come to an end 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.470
 Finally, it should be mentioned that the 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.299
 Control also on a touchscreen 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.310
 Apple devices worked very well and 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.180
 that of course against friends 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.979
 can compete 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.720
 There is no experience for here 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.310
 the level increase finally gives 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.199
 then you could just shit in 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.240
 which you win each other extra 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.310
 lets next to these random matches there 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.199
 it also needs the league and all in all 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.419
 you really say it's this little one 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.190
 has pictures to play in and in the 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.930
 Everything is done right 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.400
 one can expect from such a game 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.470
 By the way, you see in the background 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.259
 just a match on a table without 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.240
 Aiming for something different 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.949
 a sense of play is created in the game 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.229
 calm in when you are in between 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.789
 I need a short distraction 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.710
 do not say goodbye at this point 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.240
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.240
 next time rose changed
