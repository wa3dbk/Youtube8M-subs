00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.070
 welcome to rc shops, I 'm here today 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 let you see something really 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 special 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 you gentlemen for my illness 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.680
 modeling has worsened but it has 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.600
 much found this package that we will open 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.320
 I still don't have it together yet 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.390
 I don't even open it, it's a dream 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.989
 it becomes reality you have to know that different 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.060
 years ago I approached this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:58.290
 hobby or wanting to accomplish this 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.410
 model that we will now open together only 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.470
 which cost a lot of money and was 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.590
 really for me it's impossible to buy it 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.380
 but now it has become possible 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.050
 because an Italian distributor has 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.240
 finally educated this model in 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.970
 Italy really at a price 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.150
 really affordable of what i'm talking about 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:28.320
 I'm talking about this this one 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.510
 box contains my dream and now 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.510
 we'll see what it is all about 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:44.930
 here I have positioned the camera 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.770
 now we will open the content together and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.770
 let's see what's there 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.410
 it goes from the conclusion but I'm working 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.860
 to several projects simultaneously and 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:04.090
 unfortunately space is not much so 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:08.030
 it is difficult to be ordered places open 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:17.840
 now I want to say that it is 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:33.260
 something that does not fly that does not go on 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:39.350
 earth but the pin is navigating and producing it 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:43.670
 the ladies and gentlemen this is the file 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:47.170
 mound to pai produced by see if 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.080
 I can show you billy bones 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 billy bones is a year you wait for 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:10.220
 take away what you don't need used here 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:12.709
 qua bini box is an American company that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.230
 until several years ago up to a dozen 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.150
 I think it mattered and distributed some years ago 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.650
 also Italy but in recent years not 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.140
 there was no one else who distributed it 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.610
 so if you wanted to buy a model 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.840
 it was necessary to buy it in the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.750
 united states and hope to receive it without 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.910
 pay a huge amount of money to 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.290
 customs in fact as you know unfortunately the 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.660
 things ordered in the united states are 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.550
 always subject to customs and you never know 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.500
 exactly how to calculate the 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.280
 percentage of customs, however, I can 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.050
 ensure that this model up to 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.630
 the last time I looked around 7 8 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.630
 months ago you could buy in the states 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.959
 united for a price that was around 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:57.380
 over 500 euros in Italy now is 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.480
 available for purchase at the new one 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.580
 boxing team beer distributor the 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.300
 baby 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.360
 that apb model palermo bologna model 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.240
 punto.it if you call, he will answer you 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.470
 piero very kind and available together 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.290
 we agreed to buy this 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:21.700
 model I was sincerely tempted to 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.180
 buy a model with the hull already pre 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.100
 printed in abs because this hull 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.520
 now let's open together and see the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.580
 content this hull is not as you can 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:39.550
 note from the pre-printed box but it is 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:46.110
 instead given to assemble in wood with the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:48.310
 ordinary as you see then there will be 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.970
 a lot of work this project me 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.970
 take away months is not like building a 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:02.020
 announcement let's say as you have seen 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:06.520
 to the last video of the construction of the 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:10.510
 my style ex 450 this model me 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.750
 will take much more time all pre 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.330
 drawn pre cut but in short there is 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:21.610
 of work to do especially because it is 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.800
 my first wooden model to try 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:30.790
 to build so I know it won't be 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:35.680
 easy but there are all the details on 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:37.110
 planking as you see for the whole deck 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.060

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.750
 look, it's really done a lot 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.750
 very well 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:53.380
 they are different sheets with all the details 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:56.920
 to cut and assemble paste there 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:05.080
 the decree of the instructions there 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:08.200
 fantastic floor plan shows how it is 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:14.590
 assembles where it is placed at each 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:17.470
 what are the parts that are needed here 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.260
 to mount the two engines that are not 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.830
 including how much the details in tones 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.990
 plastic friendly friends of 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:31.600

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.340

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.440
 video of the assembly of this model e 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.820
 I hope for the end of the year to have finished it 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.840
 considering that we are at the end of the end 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.240

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.390
 year and being able to connect it at sea together 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:02.080

 customize the color to do it more
