00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome to hardware rat in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 this video the technology news of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 Calendar week 9 2014 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 according to an expert from dying paper 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.389
 printer in four years out he said 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.070
 the printer becomes an object 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.410
 the past and it will not 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.570
 reasons to print something ever 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.609
 The more time spent online the more 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 you get used to it a bit more 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.019
 to read the tray everything can now 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.910
 can be done virtually tablets 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.610
 everyone now afford in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.739
 Great Britain arrived in december 2013 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.950
 tablet in the market the 30 British 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.320
 pounds or 36 euros should cost 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 in germany currently have 26 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 percent of over - 14s a tablet 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.590
 Last year it was just 13 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.420
 percent 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 Sapphire brings a version of the raiden 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.149
 r 990x with 8 gb video memory 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 This is probably an answer to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.320
 the gtx titan black edition the black 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 edition he is just a version 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.739
 the gtx 480 with 6 gb video memory so 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.500
 extra for which the several monitors 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 or a benefit display or maybe 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 even use several volker displays 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 but it also costs 1000 euros for that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.100
 eight gigabyte version of the 290 I would 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.130
 probably I'll think so about that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.380
 650 euros may even cost less 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.659
 the only known version with 8 gb 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.479
 is from sapphire and gets a vapor-x 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.490
 kilo and a backplate this is 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.140
 not only for the optical but should 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 also the ram cool now behind 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.650
 attached street tram becomes one 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.930
 firefox smartphone for 25 US dollars 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.850
 of course this is for bring out 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.549
 emerging countries thought in africa and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.880
 asia or bathing for example it will 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.450
 firefox have it as an operating system 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.939
 128 MB RAM 256 MB flash 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.280
 store a 1 gigahertz processor with 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.130
 a kernel then another 3 5 inches 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.149
 display wlan bluetooth cameras and a 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.860
 ukw radio 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.290
 for us the smartphone could be but 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.060
 but also be attractive for example as 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.560
 so you spare handy continue 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.260
 whatsapp or facebook can use mobile 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.099
 there are now pictures of the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.840
 nr 9 280 without iks it was clear that 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.709
 amd must close this gap 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.530
 in between there he 1970 ickx and 280 e qss 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.380
 a whole 100 euro difference is therefore 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.410
 now he comes to the 99 in 1980 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.390
 percent a refresh of 79 50 will be 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.430
 with three gigabytes of video memory 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.870
 The cards are already very far in the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.000
 maybe start already 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.250
 next week and I guess that 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.650
 the price is about 220 euros 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.030
 will begin 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.380
 Microsoft does not want to see the xx 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.510
 accelerate significantly 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.910
 many cheer year because of the big one 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.040
 success of amd coat and very many 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.140
 have asked yourself if nvidia maybe 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.790
 also use it mentally or something own 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.010
 but rausbringen only the least 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.810
 have thought that microsoft 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.760
 maybe with her directx condor will 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.519
 and that's how it was going to be 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.190
 directx presumably 12 clearly 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.950
 mandl will orient microsoft says 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.420
 like future changes to 3d david 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.400
 next generation of games 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.890
 enable faster than ever 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.549
 to run faster than ever before 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.530
 before 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.980
 Maybe you can even mean it 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.299
 that you will surpass an almond 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.160
 that was better already but with technology 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.600
 If this is the video for this week 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.870
 you fell in a thumb 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.910
 high 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.260
 if you want the nabu then there 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.260
 until the next video
