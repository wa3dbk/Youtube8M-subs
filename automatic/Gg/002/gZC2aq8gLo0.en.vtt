thanks<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.730> guys<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.240> ended<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:22.020> with

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
thanks for that guys I ended up with

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.730 
thanks for that guys I ended up with
this<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:24.090> basically<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.930> 2-channel

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
this and it's basically like a 2-channel

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.070 
this and it's basically like a 2-channel
amp<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.240> channel<00:00:27.599> clean<00:00:27.869> air

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
amp but it's just to channel clean air

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.769 
amp but it's just to channel clean air
so<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.130> you've<00:00:29.310> got<00:00:29.340> volume<00:00:29.670> treble<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
so here you've got volume treble and

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.830 
so here you've got volume treble and
bass<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:32.250> channel<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.239> basically<00:00:33.630> what

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
bass it's one channel so basically what

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.990 
bass it's one channel so basically what
you're<00:00:33.930> getting<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.770> dry<00:00:34.980> signal<00:00:35.280> channel

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
you're getting just a dry signal channel

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.139 
you're getting just a dry signal channel
so<00:00:36.390> nothing<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.469> reverb<00:00:37.890> will<00:00:38.520> trim<00:00:38.940> or

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
so nothing like reverb will trim or

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.330 
so nothing like reverb will trim or
anything<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.110> simple<00:00:40.800> turn

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
anything like that it's just simple turn

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
anything like that it's just simple turn
it<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:42.360> what<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:43.469> over

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it up and that's what you get now over

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.790 
it up and that's what you get now over
here<00:00:44.329> we<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.539> our<00:00:45.840> second<00:00:46.230> channel<00:00:46.469> which

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here we have our second channel which

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.250 
here we have our second channel which
has<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.010> few<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.399> features<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.930> still<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.660 
has a few more features you still got a
volume<00:00:49.640> treble<00:00:50.640> bass<00:00:51.680> reverb<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
volume treble bass reverb now this and
