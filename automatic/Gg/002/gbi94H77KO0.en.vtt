00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.966
 Our first posture today is "slender and streamlined" 

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.899
 If you stand facing the lens 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.133
 The photo will show the full width of your body 

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.366
 What we have to do is to keep the side pose 

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.032
 This will subtly show the beauty to the lens and the audience. 

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:24.199
 Let them think that our body shape is thinner than it actually is. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.433
 It can also highlight beautiful curves 

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.433
 Also keep your arms bent 

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:34.833
 Because it can create a better curve for the photo. 

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.266
 Don't put your arms close to your body 

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.199
 Because this will cause the arm to look very thick 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.733
 What we have to do is to focus on one of the feet. 

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.766
 The other foot is used as an embellishment 

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:49.132
 So you cleverly put your front foot on the lens 

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.466
 And the center of gravity is placed on the back foot 

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.399
 Then stand and turn slightly to the side, leaving the arm away from the body 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.366
 Focus on one foot, smile and relax facial expressions, and enjoy shooting 

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.266
 The second pose is "with frame" 

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:13.066
 We have to do it, use our hands to show our perfect part 

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:17.099
 Many people use their hands to hide themselves 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.933
 When they feel uncomfortable, they may hold their hands 

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.499
 Or masking 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.533
 What we have to do is to frame the perfect part of the body by hand. 

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.799
 When people look at the photos, attention will also be there. 

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:38.266
 The next pose is 'Your nose is a magnet' 

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.799
 Many people are sitting ready to let me shoot 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.400
 I tend to raise my head and want to show a stylish attitude. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.333
 But that will only reveal their nostrils to the lens 

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.399
 Some people will also put their heads sideways 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.633
 This will reveal all the neck lines 

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:54.799
 What I want you to do is imagine that your nose is a magnet. 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.600
 And it will pull itself towards the lens. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.766
 So what we basically do is face the photographer 

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.766
 It will lean toward the lens, and all our facial features are in place 

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.833
 This will be the perfect way to take a good photo. 

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.466
 The fourth pose today is called 'splicing' 

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.999
 Suppose you like my 'frame' pose 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.666
 Or my 'slender and streamlined' pose 

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:23.832
 What we have to do is to make a slight change while maintaining a posture. 

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.833
 It can be a change in the buttocks 

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:26.633
 Transfer of center of gravity 

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:29.633
 You can also play with your hair in a different way. 

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:31.799
 I like to shoot two different emotions. 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.900
 Maybe the first posture is to put your hands on the hips and smile. 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.733
 The next posture is that the hand is placed on the other side of the hip, and the facial expression is more serious, quite cold expression. 

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:42.733
 In this process, you reset your facial expressions. 

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:45.299
 Because if you keep a pose for too long, it will start to look fake. 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.866
 Then you just change between the two poses, slowly 

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:51.299
 And capture many different looks 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.933
 The last pose today is "photo" 

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:03.199
 The first rule is: narrowing the distance 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.733
 A picnic party that looks like a beautiful 

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:11.233
 Will leave a lot of distance in the photo, so you need to be close 

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.733
 If you are quite familiar with each other, you can hold your arms 

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:15.766
 Or put your hand on the shoulder of another person 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.466
 The second rule is: avoid blinking 

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:23.532
 The main reason why some photos were deleted when you took a photo 

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.566
 Because someone blinked 

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:27.899
 Once you capture that lovely and lovely photo 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.233
 Just smile at the other person or your family, or make a joke 

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:33.633
 Press the shutter while they are interacting 

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:35.733
 Because it can also capture some beautiful moments.
