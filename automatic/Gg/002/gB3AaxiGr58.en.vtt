 Snails and slugs are parasites that tend to be very harmful, especially in the garden or on the terrace 

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.002
 where they can quickly devour fruits and young leaves of all kinds of plants 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.580
 On the market there are special baits that kill these animals when they ingest them 

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:48.911
 these are products based on metaldehyde, very poisonous, which must be placed with care 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.359
 to prevent pets from eating them, intrigued by the smell or color 

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:08.353
 These baits are generally placed in small heaps near the garden plots 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:19.370
 we try to place these baits in little visible positions, such as between the grass at the edges of the garden, or between the low leaves of a shrub 

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:31.428
 The baits tend to melt over time, so it is advisable to check when the piles are exhausted and replenish them 

00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:49.110
 As for the slugs it seems that the arrangement in the garden of small containers containing 4-6 cm of beer leads to the rapid extermination of this type of animals
