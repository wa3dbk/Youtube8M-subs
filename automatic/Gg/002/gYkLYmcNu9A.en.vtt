00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 to Müller and how that was founded in 1884 as a leather factory before 50 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.410
 Years began to allow the processing of engineering plastics discretion 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.450
 they are the owner here what are their core areas today 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.869
 we process engineering plastics 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.970
 medical products to products for the construction industry we have customers 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.300
 in the field of metrology 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.439
 we have customers in the area of ​​percent medical technology 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.739
 and there our plastics are used and become special products 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.500
 processed 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.910
 End customer often does not get in the hand 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.200
 but percent 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.060
 they are put into an apparatus built into a unit 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.190
 and bounced there doing their service functioning networked if then 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.130
 a second from the name leaves but series does not leave again 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 on the basis of the machine in front of the now currently describe as the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.790
 Production process St 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.730
 In principle, the production process so that we the granulate what we 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.049
 use plastic granules most of the big companies threes and DSF 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.820
 what exactly the customer or what we have shared with the customer together 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.230
 this material is melted in the machine 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.530
 and when molten, it becomes under high pressure 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.720
 which pressed the mold 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.520
 this material is achieved in this form 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.900
 Typically, "like this guy" lasts 20 to 30 or 40 seconds in the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.450
 50 plus is complete because the part of the cold sense of the form 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 and then the cooled finished part comes out of the machine 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.010
 and then who worked and packed accordingly percent accordingly 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.890
 one of these parts is water for example, you can see here 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.180
 this is now a load drenthe switch 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.220
 the one reason 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.530
 Well, the matrix's moss profit the ZEG that of us that part we're this one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.030
 Form then released connected after a longer startup process day there 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.430
 it different phases Save the release process 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.920
 to Cindy are completed and the customer 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.600
 The customer states that this informed his production in order 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.060
 then the drawings will usually be adjusted again then 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.510
 again certain 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.619
 Mr. Documentation will be done again 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.779
 and then this part runs like that with us and if we are lucky or Pattensen 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.119
 long product cycle such as this runs petite six 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:20.209
 seven years the way and percent since then too 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.049
 accompany this part 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.309
 Quality plays in the case more rain big role because it always can 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:27.729
 Give fluctuations 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.799
 Parts can sometimes hit, parts can be there 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.819
 full speed fluctuations did not accept the findings 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.189
 and the percent 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.289
 want to make sure 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.629
 the spot in the injection molding process more 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.859
 The average person can not imagine anything that they can open 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.939
 So explain that everyone understands what you mean by injection molding 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.319
 has to introduce 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.879
 Jades injection molding is a process plastics for machining 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.389
 to process 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.569
 aap the daily needs we have a the from morning to late from the 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.659
 toothbrush 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.739
 until late at night the lamp we always have injection molded parts in hand 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.809
 I also say from young to old 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.039
 Folk CD pacifier 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.059
 to the pacemaker everything in the injection molded parts 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:13.389
 who accompany our lives without them would actually be percent 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.979
 without that would be without guarantee 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.299
 important to many things 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.809
 Percent 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.579
 in the automotive sector, everything he is looking for in the automotive sector is at 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.219
 Principle injection molded parts tendency to get in the car 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:25.899
 from the door handle sum 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.009
 Laufer calls out to the brake pedal 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.459
 In times of crisis remembers more in difficult times more as important 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.769
 to be able to offer a broad product portfolio 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:36.639
 can 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.769
 that has always been right for us 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.609
 to be broad 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.609
 Duty 1 does not betray an individual so Findeis Levrat SP demands them 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.429
 Although part of the portfolio is to be had 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.250
 Cyclist had been more independent 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.779
 we are up to date now 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:57.559
 a we also feel the crisis, of course, but they see us running 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:58.439
 are percent 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.749
 well busy we have indeed 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.580
 Short-time work made in recent months is short-time working 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.949
 to dismantle now 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.350
 "Because they just have a broad spectrum 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.569
 where one industry is considered to be doing quite well in the other industry 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.479
 and we just want to be there everywhere 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:17.279
 they employ 25 people are in family business 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.430
 it has advantages 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.580
 I think that as a family business we are simply more flexible 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.870
 can react 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.290
 we do not need any board decisions we need 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.450
 no he signatures the land will be three weeks on we are yes 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.460
 as difficult with our customers as it is with our customers » 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.219
 the difficult decisions are to be enforced 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.220
 since percent is with percent 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.410
 at a small noticeably seven and a half 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.990
 December in the crisis certainly better
