00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.059
 we present today 4 simple exercises 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.400
 of facial yoga to revitalize the skin 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.300
 of the face and tone the musculature of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.100
 the face 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.950
 with the first exercise we are going to 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.100
 get and redefine the facial oval and 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.950
 fight double chin and double chin 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.800
 For this we use both hands 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.540
 we support a fist in the area of 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.480
 chin drawing the shape of the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.020
 jaw inhale in two stages 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 we exhale in four times when inhaling 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.750
 we relax the tension and when exhaling 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.300
 we slowly exert pressure from the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.790
 fists against the jaw 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.120
 We try to open our mouths at each 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.900
 exhale the pressure of the fists we 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.560
 prevents 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.890
 of that double tension arises the 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.010
 toning and redefining the oval 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.030
 facial and musculature of the area 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.220
 lower face 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.280
 in a second version of this same 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.979
 exercise 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.250
 let's use again one or two 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.250
 hands 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.240
 we will open our mouths 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.579
 this time with each exhale 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.430
 we will try to close our mouths with 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:28.090
 strength of the fist but the musculature 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.990
 maxilla prevents us from inhaling two 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.869
 time 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.960
 relaxed the tension exhaled in four 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.460
 times I exert the pressure of the fist 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.690
 against the jaw 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.659
 and swam in two times relaxed the tension 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.620
 exhaled in four times slowly 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.270
 I exercise the pressure 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.840
 We will do 10 to 20 repetitions of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.640
 each version of this exercise 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.950
 with this second exercise we are going to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.960
 get to pulp the cheeks and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.979
 bring a good immediate look 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.810
 for this we will use both hands 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.850
 we will support the fists on the cheeks 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.590
 creating first an air chamber 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.209
 independent in the mouth 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.470
 inhale we have and exhale we have by the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.140
 nose 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.170
 when we exhale we exert pressure from the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.140
 fists against the cheeks avoiding that 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.450
 the air comes out through the mouth we inhale 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.090
 we relax the tension and when exhaling 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.230
 we exert the pressure of fists against 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.320
 the cheeks we inhale in two times 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.960
 we exhale in four times we inhale in 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.240
 two times and exhale exercising that 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.210
 pressure on the cheeks in four 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.560
 time 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.930
 We will do 10 to 20 repetitions of 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.230
 This exercise 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.159
 with this third exercise we are going to 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.579
 get fight the edema look 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.620
 weary dark circles and lines 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.829
 expression of the outer contour of 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.790
 eyes we will use the fingertips 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.069
 index and heart we will support the buds in 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.530
 the outer contour of the eye exercising 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.930
 a constant but gentle pressure 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.020
 first we look up at the 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.310
 frowning avoiding wrinkling eyes or 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.800
 front and nothing we will do in two times 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.680
 exhale we have in four times to 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.670
 exhale let's try to close the 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.500
 lower eyelid when inhaling relax the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.130
 tension 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.120
 when exhaling in four times we try 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.879
 close the lower eyelid 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.879
 when inhaling we relax the tension 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.980
 we repeat 10 to 20 times this 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.980
 exercise 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.400
 this fourth exercise brings luminosity 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.880
 general to the face and causes an effect 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.320
 lifting of the brow and forehead 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.810
 we use the fingers as a tool 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.670
 index we rely on the drawing of 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.950
 the eyebrow we raise the look to the eyebrow 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.900
 we breathe in two times as we exhale in 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.150
 four times 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.950
 we try to raise the eyebrow the pressure of 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.890
 finger in the opposite direction we what 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.680
 prevents inhaling in two stages 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.440
 relaxing the tension when exhaling in 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.960
 four times we try to raise the eyebrow 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.040
 we inhaled in two times relaxing the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.760
 we exhale tension in four times 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.760
 trying to raise the eyebrow 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.860
 we will do 10 to 20 repetitions of this 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.860
 exercise
