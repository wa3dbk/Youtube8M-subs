00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.720
 Today my mobile phone clocks arrived 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.450
 I have not tried it yet 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 that's why you do it live the first time 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.219
 packaging looks very nice 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.160
 interesting in the ears in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.880
 different colors and in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.880
 different variants 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 We are all as we have read 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.170
 with two to four gigabytes 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.830
 provided memory or 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.010
 disk capacity why we look 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.170
 What is so absurd in the Koran is absurd 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.620
 If you do not want to wrap it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.050
 a city ​​bus and pretty complete 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.059
 that means two batteries are in it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.300
 Charging cable to et gewäert and an adapter 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.570
 to load the apple adapter very well that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:59.480
 probably looks so similar but well 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.480
 certainly no one is china from here 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.510
 Now we have one of these 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.510
 Note 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.940
 Also the note that is the front 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:16.770
 I think well on the back one 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.120
 flap we just open times a ja see 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.370
 but already very clear 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.780
 So what could it put in the one 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.410
 sim card can be used 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.610
 and an additional memory card 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.460
 he did not think he was like that now 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:42.479
 there is still room in it 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:45.410
 We let's see what the acura of 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.410
 is only that capacity 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.060
 this does not look straight ahead 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.390
 but otherwise the thing does with it 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.979
 already quite stable impression 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.369
 now you would have something usb after that 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.369
 connection 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.330
 Fingernails are of advantage as one 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:19.920
 looks there then you can have it clear 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.920
 try to turn it on somehow 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:31.020
 happens what it is to wait again loudly 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.020
 especially the device immediately there somehow 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.370
 Thus, not calculated now helps 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.269
 well my done 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.760
 It will be a piece of three first 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:00.840
 Founder practically funny funny 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.190
 tralala the company can tell what 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.760
 I can not stand on the displays now 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.830
 recognize but effect only so German man 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:15.660
 even has the german language as if 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:18.060
 the language prefer display that mister 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:25.590
 Kohl will already switch on the display 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:29.370
 Turn off display because despite addresses 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.150
 the camera even connectivity athens 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.510
 would actually have wireless bluetooth 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.510
 has it here 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.350
 or something like that 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.160
 games are on it 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.569
 e book reader is on facebook 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:58.730
 application is on it twitter 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:01.879
 user settings are on that 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:10.550
 we see, that's all 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:14.060
 something small is the real thing 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.040
 Keypad for this phone goes though 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.700
 I would not have a smaller bigger one 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.290
 expected 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.160
 I try to explain how to get to the 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.160
 camera to come 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:31.680
 to push contacts consob 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.680
 pgp keys and kassel are 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.280
 otherwise 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.300
 and you can also release kroll 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.300
 make up 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.140
 Of course that can not be done in the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.140
 body in it 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.120
 the middle 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.219
 I hope that the means to come he 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.629
 leafing through the bet is great 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.729
 as usual , of course , can be right 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.219
 who are not currently loaded that 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.180
 he does not do the setting but 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:13.900
 Nevertheless , I would like to be at one 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.900
 have camera 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.370
 there 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.600
 Outdoor mitigation handset this 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.600
 typical translation error 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.840
 this is clearly not 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.900
 android os but also no apple ios that 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.500
 is this china in the usa but what 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.930
 it can 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.140
 what it has on it is enough 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:46.500
 a war phone call awards 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:48.650
 Contacts three clearly do not make a card 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.650
 from 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.610
 Also there was neither scan the kadetrinne 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.090
 with viewer while no counselor 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.090
 e book reader 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:16.880
 your exercise field clock alarm bluetooth 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.880
 activate 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.590
 that looks good too 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.730
 for as an emergency phone where you go 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:42.580
 Do not bring a big smartphone with you 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:42.580
 I would like to say that 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.580
 click on this link 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.510
 click on the top left 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.000
 finished 

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:11.509
 exelon language 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:20.960
 address neckar so that's more 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:23.129
 as you are used to actually so werd 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.820
 I expected 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:28.980
 because now 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.980
 the one-minute blasted 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.730
 I still have to find out though 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.510
 otherwise they are actually doing a lot 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:39.750
 robust impression 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.750
 that's alright 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.039
 Yes 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.930
 jo 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:50.930
 yes so much for the first impression
