00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
future we've had 19 years of the current

style<00:00:49.159> car<00:00:49.399> what<00:00:49.579> we've<00:00:49.699> been<00:00:49.789> racing<00:00:49.999> it<00:00:50.600> was

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
style car what we've been racing it was

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.509 
style car what we've been racing it was
time<00:00:51.019> to<00:00:51.049> actually<00:00:51.319> move<00:00:51.649> forward<00:00:52.039> we<00:00:52.219> haven't

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
time to actually move forward we haven't

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.209 
time to actually move forward we haven't
made<00:00:52.699> massive<00:00:53.690> changes<00:00:54.109> but<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:54.319> change<00:00:55.039> that

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
made massive changes but the change that

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.649 
made massive changes but the change that
we've<00:00:55.339> made<00:00:55.549> it<00:00:55.760> produced<00:00:56.059> a<00:00:56.179> car<00:00:56.359> that<00:00:56.569> you'll

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
we've made it produced a car that you'll

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.299 
we've made it produced a car that you'll
sleep<00:00:56.839> better<00:00:56.899> racing<00:00:57.379> on<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.530> track<00:00:57.589> you'll

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
sleep better racing on the track you'll

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.039 
sleep better racing on the track you'll
see<00:00:58.489> closer<00:00:58.760> racing<00:00:59.239> not<00:00:59.359> that<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.600> probably

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
see closer racing not that you probably

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.579 
see closer racing not that you probably
think<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:00.559> get<00:01:00.769> much<00:01:00.920> more<00:01:00.979> but<00:01:02.499> it'll<00:01:03.499> be

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
think you get much more but it'll be

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.550 
think you get much more but it'll be
more<00:01:03.829> cost<00:01:04.040> effective<00:01:04.430> for<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.640> teams<00:01:05.420> to

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
more cost effective for the teams to

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.950 
more cost effective for the teams to
build<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.920> repair<00:01:07.399> along<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.210> way<00:01:08.359> as<00:01:08.570> we

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
build and repair along the way as we

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.679 
build and repair along the way as we
move<00:01:09.140> into<00:01:09.320> doing<00:01:09.710> more<00:01:09.799> races<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.450> what

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
move into doing more races and so what

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.810 
move into doing more races and so what
can<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.079> fans<00:01:12.380> expect<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.009> see<00:01:13.219> you<00:01:13.399> said<00:01:13.670> a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
can the fans expect to see you said a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.849 
can the fans expect to see you said a
better<00:01:14.060> racing<00:01:14.600> but<00:01:14.780> in<00:01:14.899> terms<00:01:15.079> of<00:01:15.259> changes<00:01:15.710> to

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
better racing but in terms of changes to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.830 
better racing but in terms of changes to
the<00:01:15.950> car<00:01:16.130> what<00:01:16.399> will<00:01:16.549> they<00:01:16.640> look<00:01:16.820> like<00:01:17.000> well

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
the car what will they look like well

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.270 
the car what will they look like well
look<00:01:18.259> essentially<00:01:18.740> with<00:01:18.859> the<00:01:18.950> forward<00:01:19.219> and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
look essentially with the forward and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.760 
look essentially with the forward and
the<00:01:19.369> Holden<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.789> have<00:01:19.939> now<00:01:20.409> as<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:21.590> can<00:01:21.710> see

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
the Holden we have now as you can see

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.230 
the Holden we have now as you can see
they<00:01:22.009> look<00:01:22.159> very<00:01:22.189> similar<00:01:22.609> obviously<00:01:23.090> they've

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
they look very similar obviously they've

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.940 
they look very similar obviously they've
got<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.420> larger<00:01:24.049> wheel<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.439> 10<00:01:24.590> inch<00:01:24.740> wheel

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
got a larger wheel and a 10 inch wheel

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.889 
got a larger wheel and a 10 inch wheel
instead<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.369> 17<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.179> there's<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.479> styling

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
instead of 17 so there's a styling

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.440 
instead of 17 so there's a styling
change<00:01:27.170> there<00:01:27.530> but<00:01:28.340> what<00:01:28.490> you'll<00:01:28.640> see<00:01:28.880> most<00:01:29.299> of

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
change there but what you'll see most of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.060 
change there but what you'll see most of
the<00:01:29.509> changes<00:01:29.719> are<00:01:30.020> underneath<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.859> fans

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
the changes are underneath that the fans

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.219 
the changes are underneath that the fans
don't<00:01:31.310> always<00:01:31.579> get<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:31.880> see<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.960> there's<00:01:33.170> a

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
don't always get to see and there's a

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.469 
don't always get to see and there's a
huge<00:01:33.560> improvement<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:34.549> driver<00:01:34.820> safety<00:01:35.119> with

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
huge improvement in driver safety with

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.719 
huge improvement in driver safety with
collapsible<00:01:36.170> steering<00:01:36.469> column<00:01:37.070> we've<00:01:37.520> moved

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
collapsible steering column we've moved

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.730 
collapsible steering column we've moved
the<00:01:37.909> fuel<00:01:38.299> tank<00:01:38.539> over<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.049> front<00:01:39.499> of<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.619> rear

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
the fuel tank over the front of the rear

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.529 
the fuel tank over the front of the rear
axle<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.369> won't<00:01:40.549> see<00:01:40.609> those<00:01:40.909> massive

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
axle so you won't see those massive

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.380 
axle so you won't see those massive
fireball<00:01:42.020> impacts<00:01:42.560> on<00:01:43.280> start<00:01:43.640> line<00:01:43.819> incidents

fireball impacts on start line incidents

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.020 
fireball impacts on start line incidents
anymore<00:01:44.780> we've<00:01:45.319> got<00:01:45.590> world's<00:01:46.429> best<00:01:46.579> practice

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
anymore we've got world's best practice

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.380 
anymore we've got world's best practice

intrusion<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.049> from<00:01:51.319> a<00:01:51.380> driver<00:01:51.679> safety<00:01:51.920> point

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
intrusion so from a driver safety point

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.499 
intrusion so from a driver safety point
of<00:01:52.340> view<00:01:52.399> which<00:01:52.609> is<00:01:52.729> really<00:01:52.939> important<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.420> us

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
of view which is really important to us

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.330 
of view which is really important to us
we<00:01:53.990> really<00:01:54.200> achieve<00:01:54.560> what<00:01:54.710> we<00:01:54.740> wanted<00:01:55.039> to<00:01:55.130> be

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
we really achieve what we wanted to be

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.389 
we really achieve what we wanted to be
the<00:01:55.880> cars<00:01:56.149> also<00:01:56.539> lighter<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.439> naturally<00:01:58.189> cars

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
the cars also lighter so naturally cars

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.359 
the cars also lighter so naturally cars
being<00:01:58.670> lighter<00:01:59.139> they<00:02:00.139> produce<00:02:00.319> a<00:02:00.740> better

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
being lighter they produce a better

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.300 
being lighter they produce a better
balanced<00:02:01.819> car<00:02:02.060> on<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.240> circuit<00:02:02.829> within<00:02:03.829> the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
balanced car on the circuit within the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.539 
balanced car on the circuit within the
larger<00:02:04.939> will<00:02:05.149> you<00:02:05.389> also<00:02:05.659> get<00:02:05.869> more<00:02:06.289> grip<00:02:06.560> with

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
larger will you also get more grip with

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.039 
larger will you also get more grip with
the<00:02:07.579> cars<00:02:07.819> on<00:02:07.999> the<00:02:08.060> circuits<00:02:08.420> are<00:02:08.539> overall

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
the cars on the circuits are overall

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.809 
the cars on the circuits are overall
will<00:02:09.500> be<00:02:09.590> better<00:02:09.830> tune<00:02:10.159> package<00:02:10.580> for<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
will be better tune package for the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.089 
will be better tune package for the
teams<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.959> again<00:02:12.620> you'll<00:02:12.769> just<00:02:12.980> see

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
teams to do and again you'll just see

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.809 
teams to do and again you'll just see
better<00:02:13.310> racing

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
better racing

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.759 
better racing

have<00:02:16.099> been<00:02:16.129> testing<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.909> cars<00:02:17.120> what<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
have been testing the cars what is the

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.750 
have been testing the cars what is the
general<00:02:17.900> feedback<00:02:18.170> been<00:02:18.590> generally<00:02:19.519> back<00:02:19.700> to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
general feedback been generally back to

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.459 
general feedback been generally back to
being<00:02:19.879> very<00:02:20.120> positive<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:20.749> mean<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.109> cars<00:02:21.319> are

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
being very positive I mean the cars are

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.379 
being very positive I mean the cars are
quick<00:02:21.620> already<00:02:21.920> out<00:02:22.099> of<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.280> box<00:02:22.489> we<00:02:23.090> haven't

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:23.389 
quick already out of the box we haven't

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.300 
quick already out of the box we haven't
specifically<00:02:23.959> gone<00:02:24.230> around<00:02:24.469> trying<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.040> tune

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
specifically gone around trying to tune

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.879 
specifically gone around trying to tune
them<00:02:25.459> for<00:02:25.870> qualifying<00:02:26.870> lap<00:02:27.170> times<00:02:27.439> but<00:02:27.739> they

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:27.889 
them for qualifying lap times but they

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.339 
them for qualifying lap times but they
are<00:02:27.950> very<00:02:28.310> good<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.819> relation<00:02:29.749> to<00:02:29.900> comparable

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
are very good in relation to comparable

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.089 
are very good in relation to comparable
lap<00:02:30.590> times<00:02:31.159> now<00:02:31.489> so<00:02:31.700> we're<00:02:32.739> extremely<00:02:33.739> excited

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
lap times now so we're extremely excited

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.009 
lap times now so we're extremely excited
about<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.939> fact<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.180> there<00:02:35.900> will<00:02:35.989> be

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
about the fact that there will be

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.809 
about the fact that there will be
quicker<00:02:36.319> car<00:02:36.590> not<00:02:37.099> that<00:02:37.219> that<00:02:37.280> was<00:02:37.519> always<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
quicker car not that that was always the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.369 
quicker car not that that was always the
intention<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:38.540> it'll<00:02:38.689> be<00:02:38.750> quicker<00:02:38.989> Karis

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
intention but it'll be quicker Karis

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.500 
intention but it'll be quicker Karis
