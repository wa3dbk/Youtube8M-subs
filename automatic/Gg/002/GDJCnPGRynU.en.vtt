00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.030
 And then everyone, I'll bring more beauty. 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.190
 a tip for you here on two new 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.369
 settings that appeared here 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.080
 respect of the notification panel of 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.300
 this screen that appears 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.030
 when you drag your thumb down 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.470
 so here it shows some 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.309
 changes you will not have 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.790
 You're right here on top, he's got here. 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.059
 this panel of people calls them all right 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.310
 English would be on and off of 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.140
 some phone functions 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.070
 so here you are seeing here wifi 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.530
 mobile data gps bluetooth is the sound and if 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.570
 use here right to left 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.370
 I see here suspension smart mode 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.510
 power saving lock 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.290
 good what happens is that before in the management 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.700
 previous 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.339
 this panel was fixed to people not 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.340
 could exclude to include new icons 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.550
 here with other functions 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.130
 so now it's in this new version the people 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.140
 you can modify and change the order of 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.119
 buttons and choose which buttons I 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.310
 I want to display or not here in this panel 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.070
 the other modification to the other modification 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.110
 is related to that belly of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.380
 brightness control 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.180
 you can turn on or off so there 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.420
 to access settings come people 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.470
 here in settings ok 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.990
 enter here the display menu and enter here 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.450
 notifications panel 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.820
 So here in the house already has here is 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.240
 connects and disconnects the brightness bar 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.820
 then the brightness slider is on me 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.770
 I can turn it off and it's off then I'll go 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
 leave it on and down here I have 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.259
 set the quick setup buttons 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.590
 they are the famous ones, everyone even has a 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.439
 very famous mold very common in the streets 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.579
 that it creates new 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.940
 everyone is called all 15 and the 23 who 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:17.329
 rolls in the forums of life is so here I 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.720
 I have below the available buttons that 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.850
 buttons are not selected above 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.710
 that I'm selected so I can 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.030
 move these buttons to 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.280
 down according to my 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.150
 I wish, for example, I'm going to take 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.290
 my panel the modification then it is 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.620
 smart suspension 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:42.950
 I'll take it is also the sound control of 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:45.590
 silence and I will also take the economy 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.650
 power 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.710
 so I got five buttons on and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.750
 five buttons off when they appear 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.960
 I pull my notifications bar 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.930
 You will see that now I can not even 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.210
 Talk because I only have five options. 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.260
 so the least I can use 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:09.320
 five I can not use less than five 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.810
 buttons here if I have more than five I 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.340
 Can I roll to call back here? 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.510
 energy saving and I will change the order 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.160
 by tapping here with the lock mode 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.110
 and then when I visualize my father 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.000
 again there are notifications 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.070
 defined in accordance with my 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.450
 preferences 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.160
 So that's it folks I hope they have 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.160
 I liked the hug until the next
