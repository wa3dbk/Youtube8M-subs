00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello dear friends and it is still 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.820
 one lesson in the forehead of warcraft 3 and guitar 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.639
 and in this lesson we will analyze 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.170
 import icon family having problems 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:20.270
 because when you access to the dregs in the pause menu 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:26.070
 or when learning the ability with the icon 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.800
 it's made into a green square that's all 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.840
 due to what's wrong 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 imported there are like three types 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 icons first type is an extension 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:48.270
 I will see bmt she is usually an icon with 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.170
 frame there is also benten 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.960
 This is an icon but without a frame, probably for 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.600
 passive abilities and div bnt this 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.809
 borderless blackout icon 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:09.479
 here on the internet 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:14.460
 must not owe you to download 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.740
 icons to be still derbent that is b 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.380
 and elbow pad band are your business 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.729
 download but descent must 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.100
 be on the scene ready for the heroes 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.750
 diameter only fire pole 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.509
 the ability to replace it with this icon 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.670
 Well, we open another manager 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.100
 import click open this downloaded pack 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.950
 icons from the warcraft blog wounds here and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.729
 about 700 pieces and they are all separated 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:53.220
 on bentley and die hand band you and dagestan 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.900
 I've already got an icon that is more 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.540
 fits 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:07.470
 abilities need different bows 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:12.270
 first import the bandages and then after 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.270
 I import disto bnt 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:25.420
 so that the media and imported horses 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.640
 they won't work because they 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.930
 curves flat 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.180
 you need to specify a non-standard path 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.010
 started giving point mi band and ordinary 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.660
 claws 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.690
 used standard way men 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.940
 on video or noticed with but the icons should 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.150
 be such a way to swim across the bolt textures 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.440
 teams bottom band and then call icons 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:52.920
 c . blp i left the horse title 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.220
 extension so they only gave here 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.650
 another part of wife makei 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.650
 2 horses must be a slightly different way. 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:15.970
 replaceable text command where sibu 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.799
 design sometimes you donâ€™t mess up as i think 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.489
 as noticed like 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:28.590
 deep and david name con kiwi 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:32.079
 it is desirable to do the same as in 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.329
 active and peel up she's better 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.049
 work we all about imported and 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:42.820
 you can work with the icon open 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.680
 object editor and look for our our 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.459
 ability 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.459
 so fiery pillar 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:57.810
 yes , I have a great expectation of this 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.260
 fire pole and pentagram and that is 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.510
 icon 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.590
 used and researched undesirable 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.790
 same to 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.080
 it follows as if studying like 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:18.200
 we use bmt texture that is 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:21.200
 actively importing cops ok what are we talking about 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:30.270
 imported, you can start tf. 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:32.419
 let's here the key is displayed and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.060
 exit menu 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.620
 the icon is beautifully written for everyone thanks 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.430
 for viewing put the process 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.430
 and sign
