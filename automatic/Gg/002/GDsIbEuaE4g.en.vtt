00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.109
 good how about good friends in this 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.570
 I bring you a new tutorial 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.340
 on how to unlock achievements for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.769
 xbox 360 profiles 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.199
 well the objective of this is for example 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.490
 what an achievement that is very difficult for 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:24.270
 seriously example 3.0 from gears of war 3 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.340
 seriously 1.2 of gears of war 2 is a 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.220
 example of achievements that are lived 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.439
 difficult to remove but then several 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.719
 we want no good this is a tutorial 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.239
 so they can see how to unblock the good 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.540
 first of all we need to configure 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.719
 a usb can be from a gig in 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.730
 forward a usb in our xbox once 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.730
 that you have configured we passed the profile to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.290
 our usb we go the profile that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.280
 we want to unblock in the 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.149
 achievements once we've gone through 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.590
 well we will need two programs that will 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.950
 to be him 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.990
 profil editor that would be this without virus 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.360
 as you can see I wanted to profil editor without 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.720
 virus because I uploaded it has no virus and 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.420
 the usb is the same as I got it without 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.030
 good virus they give who to download to 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.450
 the two equal to this one give you in download 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.850
 once you have downloaded it 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.950
 well then 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.630
 we go to where we are 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.340
 saved an example I kept them in the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.710
 desk as you can see here are 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.780
 our files good one more thing 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.420
 before starting this to start the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.720
 procedure I will tell you this does not have 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.049
 risk of banning everything to be sure is 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.340
 this I tell you is not like a tool 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.190
 it's not cheating it's a tool 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.110
 to unblock them but then there's going to be 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.149
 people who really do not want to 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.399
 good for people who do not want 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.500
 I tell them not the risk of banning and therefore not 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.409
 revile the more people if 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.090
 they do and nothing or that I teach them all 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.149
 and it is your decision of you 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.240
 use the tool yes or no or no 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.740
 good and good I'm still with the tutorial a 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.600
 Once we have downloaded what good 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.880
 we are going to do is extract them as 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.880
 you know right click extract here 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.560
 and as you can see here we already have the usb 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.960
 there were the profile editor right click 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.180
 and extract here 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.190
 remember these files are files 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.730
 winrar to be able to extract it they need the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.700
 winrar program in good this we already have 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.400
 here is the usb open the folder of the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.290
 usb remember to show our usb already 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.180
 it has to be configured you have to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.220
 have the profile inside and connected to 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.870
 our good pc once we have 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.870
 that we open the usb 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.020
 we hope to finish the program how can 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.850
 see here is use of these flowers we 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.540
 let's file open device 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.360
 and we wait for you to upload our profile 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.939
 we're going to go happy to the one who has 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.400
 number one we open it we give it click 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.349
 we keep clicking we keep clicking 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.629
 friends until this disappears that already 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.120
 do not keep clicking if you no longer 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.909
 It may be good when we already have this 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.519
 we select and we give extra 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.379
 extract or extract it we paste it in the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.439
 desk to make it easier and what 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.239
 we keep this program do not close it 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.170
 you only go in the tab we lower the 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.970
 good tab now the opportunity is going 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.030
 from the profile vÃ­ctor we open the teacher the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.910
 editor 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.250
 wait for the good program to load 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.030
 once you have loaded we go to 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.250
 open 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.930
 good and as you can see we select the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.030
 desk because for example I like 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.800
 from my TV I recommend you try my 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.810
 profile on the desktop so it's not 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.560
 then work to find it as they can 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.880
 see here is the profile 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.190
 and we open it 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.230
 and as you can see here is the profile on 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.470
 profile what he just created is called achievements 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.500
 of xbox 360 as I only put two games 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.330
 how can you see this to unlock it 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.280
 what we are going to do is how can you see 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.700
 here says game core 0 do not have any 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.100
 no g unlocked 0 achievements of 1600 and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.080
 0 achievements of 2000 kind we selected and 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.850
 that play two selections of the game and you 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.500
 we give good I recommend them 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.720
 unlock all because you can 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.340
 unlocking one by one is very tedious 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.490
 I recommend you unlock all 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.770
 achievements and we give you on offline and you 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.539
 we give a locker and we give him yes 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.250
 well we already have all the logos of 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.990
 software unlocking 2 now 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.669
 we select ten software 3 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.340
 we give him offline and a locker and we give him 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.229
 yes yes, that's all for example 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.909
 I do not keep these two games in this 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.830
 account but if you have much more 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:47.800
 games can do the same with the 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.690
 other games and unlock them good we 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.229
 we run the symbol of the xbox what 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.669
 we select and we give 6 save and one 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.330
 Once we have done this we close 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:01.180
 the program good now what are we going to 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.210
 to do is open the tab of the usb 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.639
 this explorer is good as you can see here 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.889
 Now what we are going to do is drag 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.889
 we drag our profile 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.889
 and we delete the one that says 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.310
 0 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:24.189
 and we give you delight and as you can see 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.189
 here is the profile and we close the 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.979
 good program because that would be everything now 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:33.370
 the only thing that remains is this connect 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.610
 our usb to our xbox and start 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.080
 session with the new profile and then as 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.460
