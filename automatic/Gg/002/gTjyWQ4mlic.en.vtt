00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.760 
together and I lay it across the loom
and<00:00:43.370> at<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.940> end<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.539> want<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> create<00:00:46.350> some

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and at this end I want to create some

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.680 
and at this end I want to create some
tension<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.550> it'll<00:00:47.730> make<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> nice<00:00:48.180> tight<00:00:48.629> knot

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
tension so it'll make a nice tight knot

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.580 
tension so it'll make a nice tight knot
over<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:50.100> left<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.260> I'm

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
over on my left so on the right I'm

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.299 
over on my left so on the right I'm
going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.879> twist<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.260> yarn<00:00:55.590> around<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
going to just twist the yarn around the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
going to just twist the yarn around the
pegs<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.600> only<00:00:57.809> purpose<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.440> create<00:00:58.739> some

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
pegs the only purpose is to create some

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
pegs the only purpose is to create some
tension<00:01:01.100> now<00:01:02.100> I'm<00:01:02.520> directly<00:01:03.059> across<00:01:03.390> from<00:01:03.780> my

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
tension now I'm directly across from my

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.429 
tension now I'm directly across from my
anchor<00:01:04.320> peg<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:05.100> starting<00:01:05.580> point<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.439> I'm

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
anchor peg my starting point and I'm

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.330 
anchor peg my starting point and I'm
doing<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.830> overhand<00:01:08.430> knot<00:01:09.110> now<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
doing an overhand knot now I'm going to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.450 
doing an overhand knot now I'm going to
pull<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.630> my<00:01:12.900> knot<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.650> right<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.400> between

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pull so that my knot is right in between

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.810 
pull so that my knot is right in between
two<00:01:15.330> pegs<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.500> way<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.890> gets<00:01:17.100> hidden<00:01:17.460> real

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
two pegs this way it gets hidden real

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.770 
two pegs this way it gets hidden real
well<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> pull<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.509> tight<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:26.720> generally<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
well so I pull it tight and generally I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.789 
well so I pull it tight and generally I
give<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> another<00:01:31.070> tie<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.000> make<00:01:33.180> sure

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
give it another tie just to make sure

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.950 
give it another tie just to make sure

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.539 
it's tight enough now I'm going to snip
