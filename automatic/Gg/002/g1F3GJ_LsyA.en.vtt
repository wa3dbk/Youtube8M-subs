 how about friends here we have the 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.440
 ingredients to make our cake 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.850
 pumpkin here as you see we have mass 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.160
 broken we have a roll of dough 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.930
 broken that we have bought it that way already 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.790
 prepared 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:24.929
 apart we have 400 grams of pumpkin 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:30.609
 400 grams of evaporated milk 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:33.670
 130 grams of brown sugar 2 eggs one 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.920
 spoonful of cinnamon and a pinch like 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.230
 half a teaspoon of ginger powder 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.809
 with all these ingredients we are going to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.960
 make our delicious cake 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.960
 pumpkin 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.770
 here we have the two eggs in the bowl and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.140
 Now we add the pumpkin to the pumpkin 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.980
 we have said before we have cooked 15 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.350
 minutes 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.579
 it's important that it costs a little because 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.589
 if it can not be very hard 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.070
 there we have a pumpkin we add the 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.070
 sugar 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.390
 we add the cinnamon and the ginger 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.390
 and finally the evaporated milk 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.049
 for all this we are going to beat well 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.049
 beaten 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.620
 we already have the broken dough in the mold 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.280
 we used a mold that these 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.290
 unmold the bottom and we have cut a 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.800
 little that was left over from mass around now 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.570
 we are simply going to add the mixture 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.570
 that we have it well beaten 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.950
 we are going to add it and go to the oven 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:47.190
 the oven at 200 degrees about 50 minutes 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.190
 Let's go there 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.370
 after 50 minutes in the oven here 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.250
 we have taken out our cake and now what 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.360
 let's cool down to cut it to 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.360
 see how it goes inside 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.979
 and here we have our cake that has 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.870
 cooled down we have cut a portion for 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.150
 what do you see 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.150
 and look and look at the texture 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.100
 it's more to the broken dough and the juicy 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.160
 the pumpkin 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.470
 and here we have it right now we are going to 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.150
