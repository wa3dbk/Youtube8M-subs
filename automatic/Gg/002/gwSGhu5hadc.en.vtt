00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.700
 the rays of a star is spreading in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 space according to a trajectory 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.020
 generally straight but not 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.189
 systematically if some of its 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.810
 rays pass near a massive object 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.419
 like another star 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.570
 they will be deflected and captured by his 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.980
 gravitational field indeed the field 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.080
 will focus the light like a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.610
 optical lens astronomers 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.890
 call this phenomenon and lenses 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.540
 gravitational 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.650
 he calls micro lenses when this 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.960
 effect is produced by an object 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.640
 punctual low mass that aligns 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.739
 with a background star and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 focus its light just enough so that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.309
 the star appear a little more 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 bright 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.890
 this makes micro lenses 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.469
 gravitational a very effective tool 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.120
 to detect objects that since 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.260
 confines of the galaxy would be 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.430
 inaccessible to our eyes 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.210
 without these spontaneous effects 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.949
 amplification here is one of our 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.739
 favorite observatory for monitoring 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.800
 events of microlenses 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.350
 the canopus observatory in tasmania with 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.030
 his telescope 1 meter in diameter 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.039
 canopus will have every winter for 15 years 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.660
 chased the planets by this method of 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.099
 detection 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.780
 it's part of our broad network 

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:20.580
 implanted in the southern hemisphere 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.360
 that is to say in new zealand 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 australia tasmania south africa and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.880
 chili while two telescopes 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.950
 about two meters in diameter equipped 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.450
 of a wide field camera are the center 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.700
 of the galaxy looking for 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.979
 manifestations of microlenses one in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.569
 new zealand and the other to chile one 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.399
 real regiment since the twenty 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.200
 smaller telescope 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.069
 come in support for monitoring 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.509
 continuous of these micro lens alerts 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.580
 it's all about telescopes from the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.500
 class t11 be that small telescopes 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.950
 or robotic telescope 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.259
 amateur 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.539
 the galactic center and therefore monitor 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.899
 every year 24 hours a day by our 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.509
 teams from march to october 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.670
 in the case of mrs hoa 2011 blg 262 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.289
 the object responsible for the concentration 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 light rays of the back star 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.580
 plan would be a couple consisting of a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.500
 massive planet equivalent to 4 jupiter 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.030
 and his companion the mass of the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.230
 Earth 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.849
 each of these two objects causes a 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.980
 disturbance on the light curve of 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.900
 the background star it would be 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.440
 so from the first exodus discoveries 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.350
 nowadays 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.460
 moreover no star has been detected 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.260
 in the near environment of this 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.420
 system which would make it the first 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.080
 couple planet one devoid of canvases 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.490
 high but for this same system the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.150
 models also allows a completely different 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.850
 scenario 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.590
 although slightly disadvantaged a 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.980
 red dwarf star 2 0 of masses 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.600
 solar 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.420
 accompanied by a planet of 18 mass 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.800
 terrestrial this second possibility well 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.750
 that less surprising at first glance 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.160
 would require this system to move 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.260
 at a speed about four times 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.130
 higher than expected generally 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.810
 for a star of the bulb so do we 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.090
 deal a couple made up of a planet 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.710
 massive of a wandering moon alone in the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.320
 record of the galaxy at two thousand years 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.850
 light of our solar system or 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.800
 a red dwarf with a companion of 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.720
 Neptune type tracing a high speed 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.540
 in the galactic bulge at 23 thousand 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.560
 light years 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.630
 unfortunately it is not possible to 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.400
 conclude for two main reasons 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.320
 the first is that the central object and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.120
 either not bright or too weakly 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.530
 bright and far away to be able to 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 observe it a posteriori with 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.100
 high resolution telescopes like the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.990
 bedrooms in hawaii where hft 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.060
 indeed such observations 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.010
 Complementary 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.010
 to characterize the lens if this one 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.480
 is a star 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.280
 whatever it is that it is a 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.470
 planetary companion around a dwarf 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.880
 red of 0.12 solar masses or 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.770
 of an exo moon and a planet without 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.880
 star both scenarios presents some 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.890
 characteristics quite 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.750
 exceptional micro method 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.790
 lenses will also have demonstrated 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.230
 ability to detect and moon exo 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.440
 planets isolated for thousands of years 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.440
 light 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.900
 false
