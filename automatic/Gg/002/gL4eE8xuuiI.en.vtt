00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
this was really hard for us but we had

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.840 
this was really hard for us but we had
to<00:00:14.400> select<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:15.360> winners<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.890> hugest

to select some winners so the hugest
problem<00:00:18.330> but<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.720> encountered<00:00:19.380> during

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
problem but that we encountered during

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.730 
problem but that we encountered during
judging<00:00:20.400> these<00:00:20.520> images<00:00:21.480> was<00:00:21.660> actually<00:00:22.199> that

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
judging these images was actually that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.210 
judging these images was actually that
we<00:00:22.859> didn't<00:00:23.100> set<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:24.050> topic<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.830> lot<00:00:26.189> of

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
we didn't set a topic so a lot of

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
we didn't set a topic so a lot of
pictures<00:00:26.580> were<00:00:26.910> actually<00:00:27.240> great<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.750> their

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
pictures were actually great in their

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.550 
pictures were actually great in their
field<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.800> topic<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.449> really<00:00:31.080> compare

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
field or topic but we can really compare

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.549 
field or topic but we can really compare
them<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.250> decided<00:00:32.610> we'll<00:00:32.940> sort<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.960> divide

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
them so we decided we'll sort of divide

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.680 
them so we decided we'll sort of divide
the<00:00:34.950> entries<00:00:35.340> into<00:00:35.550> three<00:00:35.910> categories<00:00:36.090> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the entries into three categories and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.530 
the entries into three categories and
the<00:00:37.559> winner<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> each<00:00:38.309> category<00:00:38.670> gets<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> prize

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the winner of each category gets a prize

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.100 
the winner of each category gets a prize
so<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.850> case<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.480> would<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so in this case this would be the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.100 
so in this case this would be the
category<00:00:43.590> abstract<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.420> an<00:00:45.570> honorable

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680

I'm going to assume that there's a son
and<00:03:06.859> that<00:03:07.859> is<00:03:08.209> sunset<00:03:09.209> or<00:03:09.449> sunrise<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.349> the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
