00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:15.080
 there are wonders in this video I make you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.540
 s. liquid eyeliner review 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.600
 as the name implies it is obviously a rai 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:26.550
 in the black liquid is part of the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 permanent collection of essence I 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.039
 say that despite the fact the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 packaging is rather unique the 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.260
 that in short for some strange reason 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.060
 had not convinced me so far to approve it 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.860
 as soon as the thing actually opened 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.630
 Interesting 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.720
 the applicator as you can see 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.950
 the applicator is really thin and is 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.040
 constituted even if it does not seem not from 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:00.690
 usual brush but from an applicator 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.600
 in felt that is rather rigid but 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.280
 however soft 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.799
 let's move on to the application with one 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 small warning being an eyeliner 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.140
 liquid tends maybe a little bit to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.970
 drool if you obviously pick them up 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.830
 too then before the application is 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.049
 just go and clean it lightly 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.860
 on the edges so as to remove the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.860
 excess product 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.650
 from shines 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.120
 and this then turned out once 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.960
 obviously applied to both 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.640
 eyes 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 obviously it is also possible to do one 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.160
 much thinner line I've decided to 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.530
 instead point it out and make you this in short 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.670
 line and eyeliner a bit more pin style 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.400
 up to let you see also what is the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.490
 yield with regard to intensity e 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.630
 then of course those who offer black 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.660
 I don't know if you notice but actually 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.990
 initially it tends to be very very 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.200
 polished like black but then in reality 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.300
 drying it becomes a little more opaque 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.820
 I must say that especially initially 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.390
 it was n't much 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.840
 we say convinced of this applicator 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.520
 very different than the classic 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.890
 little brush that we may be used to 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.530
 but I must say that this solution offers 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.080
 let's say a possibility of softness but 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.180
 also control in my opinion is greater 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.080
 in the sense that I find very much indeed 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.900
 difficult to make mistakes in the application 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.030
 using this this eyeliner is also 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.310
 a considerable advantage is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.610
 definitely the price because essence 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.010
 in short, he is used to offering us good 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.700
 products at very low prices 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.880
 proposes this eyeliner to the figure of 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.900
 2 euros and 79 so it's really a lot 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.150
 little 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.110
 I must say that with regards to win 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:28.110
 and you know there always speak in 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.570
 this case linci is not a proper inci 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.719
 splendid sincerely consumes is not a 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.120
 good ici let's face it 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.799
 so if you are attentive to the uncivil 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.200
 thun in c green you want an eco product 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.920
 bio eco absolutely this and liner not 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.439
 it's for you 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.780
 but if you don't mind us, here it is not unique 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:53.269
 here it is also particularly bad 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.150
 I must say that in short for the amount that 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.579
 perhaps perhaps as much as it needs to be closed 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.900
 an eye, for example, an eye cycle 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.519
 I gladly close 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.010
 so as far as I'm concerned my own 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.220
 judgment is that this eyeliner was 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.790
 absolutely love at first sight 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.980
 I would very much like to buy again 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.609
 both for the price and for the yield both 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.590
 for ease of application and therefore 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.440
 here is a product that I feel of 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.539
 so advise you nothing too 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.780
 video is over and I thank you 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.449
 as usual for having looked at it there 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.190
 I thank everyone 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.669
 so see you at the next video a 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.669
 kiss everyone and everyone 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.669
 Hello
