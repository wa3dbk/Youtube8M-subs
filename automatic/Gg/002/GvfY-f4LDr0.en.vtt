00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.110
 hello all boys and girls I am the 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.440
 Phases of my channel game I bring you another 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.879
 'top ten' video over there I think that I 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.919
 I had asked him to make the top-ten 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.619
 the shields so good I had it already 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.150
 more or less preselected and here 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.929
 waiting a bit to make the event 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.109
 from the scarlett puppet I decided 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.769
 Well, look, we finished ordering and James 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.990
 'top ten' 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.400
 the thing this 'top ten' has been more 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.420
 difficult to swords because there are 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.170
 many ties 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.570
 a lot and this maybe better than this this 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.700
 is that this depends and I've also had 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.580
 in account thing that maybe if you are 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.160
 warriors not other professions that do not 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.920
 be a guard I have taken into account that 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.240
 see well the aegis is worth the aegis that is 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.510
 this 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.250
 Semitransparent scudi 1 worth of shields 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.260
 which are very beautiful but the aegis 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.820
 It makes ugly shields that are very ugly 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.560
 but it makes them beautiful life worth 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.560
 So that had those little things 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.940
 I tried to take them into account for me 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.500
 include since their guards 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:10.310
 we started with the historical shield of 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.800
 priory I like it because of the size of my 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.260
 character at least you will be 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.540
 they are left quite well the size does not 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.220
 it's disproportionate I like it to be 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.260
 see the little letters I like the brightness 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.109
 3 semi transparent but good 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:29.229
 it looks ghostly but it seems 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:31.179
 crystalline vale I like it quite like 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.359
 You see here very beautiful besides an effect 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.759
 as weird as if it were a gem and there 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.670
 something there in the middle a key or some 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.180
 scrolls do not you have left him cool 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.409
 do not 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.450
 ninth is the esla 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.610
 the shield of the vanguard of ebony 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.160
 OK 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.940
 the thing is that I like it because of the way it is 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.550
 a very peculiar very strange way that 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.980
 it is not seen in other shields 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.020
 Well, I think that my character 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.540
 it looks good but I think that humans no longer 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.520
 it has to look very pretty 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.410
 It is also the ebony edge 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.760
 has a certain story blah blah blah blah 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.630
 then here comes one of the one that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.480
 is 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.830
 diamond aegis I do not know the translation 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.090
 I will exactly put the description 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.220
 It's good if it's like it 's a shield 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.490
 chosen diamond that comes there 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.780
 translated there is no version no pvp because 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.670
 this is a skin that is achieved in the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.760
 'hall' of the monuments that is from 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.040
 the guild wars 1 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.510
 I remember the guild wars this is a 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.200
 last because there was a version that was 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.970
 the black border and the orange center is 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.510
 But what else has done to me? 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.519
 put him on this in this 'top ten' because 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.069
 I had a lot calls 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.239
 very much very much this shield in the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.990
 grill words the next add your the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.850
 preview 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.370
 good is one of the shields that has 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.860
 cash 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.569
 as you can see, it's just not 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.220
 particularly very nice but I think 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.370
 that the effect gives it enough touch 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.790
 as to deserve a seventh place 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.920
 is worth the sixth comes in two is a tie 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.230
 between two promoted two collaborations 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 I really like the way that 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.190
 has this shield 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.099
 It has to be said and the good size maybe 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.660
 a little too big but good 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.989
 but I like this coloring with the 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.440
 black edges and yellow center and 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.209
 then I like this black and red edges 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.550
 orange although the one that is also in 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.110
 white and gold I also like 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.340
 pretty but these two are my 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.200
 favorites 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.030
 There is no other color is not me 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.330
 they just like nothing like red and 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.460
 yellow I do not like it 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.140
 and others that I like the average but you're 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.140
 two I think are the ones I like the most 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.000
 a deserved place 6 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.400
 and being an ascended therefore good with what 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.110
 what it costs to get the one that stays in 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.390
 the 61st place 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.940
 this is the fractal shield that 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.420
 get in the fractals I like 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.040
 because it changes between being in the back 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.900
 or being in handful, it's like being 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.500
 they deploy the only thing that is a little 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.590
 big and me the shoulder pads I ate them 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.560
 that's the only thing I do not like but the 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.600
 effect of the movement in general all 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.139
 the fractal weapons are pretty cool but 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.960
 the shield mola mola 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.509
 in fourth place we have here the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.840
 legendary that I could not miss that 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:41.639
 like we go saved I think it's pretty 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.539
 ugly but wielded 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.819
 or so seen already removed in motion the 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.700
 Leaves the light around 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:55.000
 I think the aegis will look great 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.850
 come on I think he has deserved fifth 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.680
 put itself yes just fourth place but 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.590
 it's better now the first three 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.880
 they are very tied for me, I do not know 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.320
 if you are ready to agree but good 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.620
 we have the third 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.980
 what is the brand shield design that 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.100
 is the obraje I do not know how to pronounce it 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.340
 it's very nice in general the 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.180
 forms the effects that you have wielded 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.340
 he looks very good 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.979
 but saved that's why it's not in the 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.039
 number one for me it looks like a shield 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.740
 huge and that your head sticks out 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.930
 heap maybe in a norm that of good not 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.910
 I know, it's not proven, you know, but I've 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.060
 left here in this position and I think it's 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.900
 it was worth it that this is just from 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.729
 payment that is not 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.850
 you can not get in the game if you do not 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.849
 is spending money that same defect what 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.939
 has this 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:06:00.100
 that had to be achieved by opening a 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:03.790
 these black bow chest and it's good 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:06.250
 I really like a beautiful thing 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.350
 the perfect size for my taste the 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.230
 colors are precious the dragon is 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.480
 done with a lot of detail is wielded 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.510
 very well I have not said his name yet 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.370
 but it's the dragon jade wall is 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.280
 I think it's the 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.990
 if they are not the last weapons compound 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.699
 more or less in between or the 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.550
 first nor the last and me 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.470
 personally those designs do not all 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.540
 they like it but the shield is that this one 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.430
 come back we wanted it yes I think so 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.710
 they bought a weapon of these the safest 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.639
 that outside the shield is worth now we go with 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.120
 the number one 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:45.169
 the lesson may seem amazing 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.939
 but I like it very much is the defense 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.419
 of zenith that these are achieved by 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:52.400
 getting achievement points I think 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.400
 which is the nicest street design of 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.349
 shields and most beautiful that there is of the zenith 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.629
 of this type of weapon set as the 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:02.139
 crystals rotate like the lights of the 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:05.509
 inside how the crystals move 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.460
 saved is the only flaw saved me 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.289
 it seems that it stays a little small and 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.460
 for my character a bit above but in 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.550
 Overall, I think it stays a little 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.460
 small and it's a bit ridiculous but 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.410
 what are we going to do 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.970
 the only weapon is that the amount of 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.160
 lights that have the movement that has 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.310
 it's perfect and it's in the top 1 for a 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.539
 thing so you see it like that and good such but 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:32.169
 you take it out you leave it here and with the aegis it is 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:33.840
 a perfect fusion I think that as 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:36.870
 It seems that 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.880
 what is done bet that it is a shield 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.240
 we are not given a thing superimposed with 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.860
 another one I love and it's in the top 1 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.130
 how well it stays with the aegis is not 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.320
 for another thing is worth this 'top ten' 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.900
 It has cost me much more 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:55.169
 that the one with the swords and I think it's 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.300
 of the almost more difficult because there 

00:07:55.169 --> 00:08:00.210
 there is an intermediate level of shields 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:03.000
 nice the bored ones already bored and then 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.639
 very nice and very cool then that's why 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.050
 It has made me pretty hard hope 

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:08.880
 that you liked the video put me the 

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.510
 comments that shields like most 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.960
 or you whom ye lay less 

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:20.270
 in this 'top ten' is worth and see you in 

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.270
 more videos from guild wars 2 see you later
