show you now is an advanced version of

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.259 
show you now is an advanced version of
that<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> one<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.610> half<00:02:21.640> goblet

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
that this is a one and a half goblet

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.310 
that this is a one and a half goblet
squat<00:02:22.510> what<00:02:22.660> he's<00:02:22.780> gonna<00:02:22.870> do<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.290> same

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
squat what he's gonna do is the same

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.410 
squat what he's gonna do is the same
motion<00:02:23.980> except<00:02:24.519> now<00:02:24.670> he's<00:02:24.850> going<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.060> go<00:02:25.209> down

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
motion except now he's going to go down

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.699 
motion except now he's going to go down
when<00:02:25.630> he<00:02:25.690> gets<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.989> bottom<00:02:26.140> position<00:02:26.590> is

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
when he gets to the bottom position is

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.040 
when he gets to the bottom position is
going<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.890> come<00:02:27.040> halfway<00:02:27.310> up<00:02:27.540> drop<00:02:28.540> back<00:02:28.810> into

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
going to come halfway up drop back into

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.630 
going to come halfway up drop back into
the<00:02:29.140> bottom<00:02:29.410> position<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:30.400> come<00:02:30.610> back

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the bottom position and then come back

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.790 
the bottom position and then come back
all<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.209> way<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.510> top<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.410> it's<00:02:32.680> a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
all the way to the top so it's a

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.710 
all the way to the top so it's a
one-and-a-half<00:02:33.160> rep<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.269> does<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.600> it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
one-and-a-half rep what it does is it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.630 
one-and-a-half rep what it does is it
really<00:02:35.019> just<00:02:35.050> increases<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.920> amount<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.310> time

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
really just increases the amount of time

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.880 
really just increases the amount of time
under<00:02:36.940> tension<00:02:37.170> which<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.290> going<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.530> increase

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
under tension which is going to increase

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.320 
under tension which is going to increase
the<00:02:39.040> amount<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.340> work<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.819> muscle<00:02:40.150> does

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
the amount of work that the muscle does

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.300 
the amount of work that the muscle does
you'll<00:02:40.810> really<00:02:41.050> feel<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.380> difference<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:42.040> how

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
you'll really feel a difference in how

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.130 
you'll really feel a difference in how
hard<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.790> works<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.569> you're<00:02:43.690> training<00:02:44.050> at

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
hard this works so if you're training at

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.720 
hard this works so if you're training at
home<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.829> you<00:02:44.890> don't<00:02:45.100> have<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.250> lot<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.459> heavy

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
home and you don't have a lot of heavy

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.250 
home and you don't have a lot of heavy
weight<00:02:46.030> you're<00:02:46.540> training<00:02:46.780> with<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:46.989> dumbbell

weight you're training with a dumbbell

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.020 
weight you're training with a dumbbell
you<00:02:47.709> can<00:02:47.860> increase<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.310> intensity<00:02:48.700> without

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
you can increase the intensity without

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.060 
you can increase the intensity without
having<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.480> add<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.930> bunch<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.380> weight<00:02:50.560> or<00:02:50.739> go<00:02:50.890> by

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
having to add a bunch of weight or go by

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.560 
having to add a bunch of weight or go by
a<00:02:51.100> huge<00:02:51.459> dumbbell<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.329> increase

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
a huge dumbbell you can just increase

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.650 
a huge dumbbell you can just increase
that<00:02:52.810> intensity<00:02:53.320> by<00:02:53.470> adding<00:02:54.299> one<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> half

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
that intensity by adding one and a half

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.720 
that intensity by adding one and a half
