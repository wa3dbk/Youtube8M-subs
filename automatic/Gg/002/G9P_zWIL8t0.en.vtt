at Evo after I beat him I would have had
to<00:01:59.259> play<00:01:59.409> gamer<00:01:59.679> beat<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.250> we<00:02:00.789> all<00:02:00.970> know<00:02:01.270> how

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
rounds to a match that I normally never

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.839 
rounds to a match that I normally never
lose<00:02:11.440> but<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.709> was<00:02:11.830> just<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.099> confident<00:02:12.640> that

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849
