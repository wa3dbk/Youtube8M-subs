you<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:33.090> when<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> look<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.409> type<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you know when you look at this type of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
you know when you look at this type of
game<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.119> challenge<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
game I think it's really a challenge to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.569 
game I think it's really a challenge to
handicap<00:01:37.320> late<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> season<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.460> know

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
handicap late in the season you know

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.249 
handicap late in the season you know
especially<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:39.780> there's<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> couple

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
especially when there's a couple

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.450 
especially when there's a couple
elements<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.070> play<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> inferior<00:01:43.079> team
