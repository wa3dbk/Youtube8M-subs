pink dye just goes into the engine like

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.919 
pink dye just goes into the engine like
like<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.849> rest<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.209> fuel<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.569> doesn't

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
like the rest of the fuel it doesn't

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.830 
like the rest of the fuel it doesn't
really<00:02:09.050> have<00:02:09.289> any<00:02:09.470> effect<00:02:09.709> on<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:11.540> diesel

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
really have any effect on it the diesel

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.120 
really have any effect on it the diesel
that<00:02:11.870> goes<00:02:12.050> into<00:02:12.200> your<00:02:12.260> tractors<00:02:12.709> is<00:02:12.890> supposed

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
that goes into your tractors is supposed

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.360 
that goes into your tractors is supposed
to<00:02:13.160> be<00:02:13.280> like<00:02:13.459> an<00:02:13.580> ultra-low<00:02:14.060> sulfur<00:02:14.349> so

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
to be like an ultra-low sulfur so

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.710 
to be like an ultra-low sulfur so
there<00:02:17.370> used<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.549> be<00:02:17.610> an<00:02:17.730> old<00:02:17.909> myth<00:02:18.090> saying<00:02:18.420> that

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
there used to be an old myth saying that

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.809 
there used to be an old myth saying that
if<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.409> put<00:02:19.650> off-road<00:02:20.220> diesel<00:02:20.579> into<00:02:20.730> your

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
if you put off-road diesel into your

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.679 
if you put off-road diesel into your
truck<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.019> would<00:02:22.170> damage<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:25.670> that's

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
truck then it would damage it but that's

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:32.240 
truck then it would damage it but that's
pretty<00:02:27.689> well<00:02:27.870> false<00:02:30.379> it<00:02:31.379> doesn't<00:02:31.709> really<00:02:32.010> have

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
pretty well false it doesn't really have

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.470 
pretty well false it doesn't really have
any<00:02:32.400> effect<00:02:32.549> on<00:02:32.819> your<00:02:32.970> engine<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.299> that's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
any effect on your engine but that's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.809 
any effect on your engine but that's
just<00:02:33.569> what<00:02:33.750> they<00:02:33.870> call<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.819> ultra-low

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
just what they call it is ultra-low

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.170 
just what they call it is ultra-low
sulfur<00:02:35.849> so<00:02:36.920> anyway<00:02:37.920> I'm<00:02:38.610> pretty<00:02:38.819> sure<00:02:39.030> most

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
sulfur so anyway I'm pretty sure most

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.349 
sulfur so anyway I'm pretty sure most
farmers<00:02:39.599> use<00:02:40.260> dyed<00:02:40.829> diesel<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.519> of<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
farmers use dyed diesel because of the

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.449 
farmers use dyed diesel because of the
less<00:02:42.510> taxes<00:02:42.900> less<00:02:43.440> taxes<00:02:43.859> on<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.310> can

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
less taxes less taxes on it and they can

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.059 
less taxes less taxes on it and they can
