00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:25.960 

yeah<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.420> guess

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:34.400 

and<00:03:26.970> then<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.300> next<00:03:27.660> part<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.850> start<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:29.970> G<00:03:33.410> so

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
and then the next part is start on G so

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.570 
and then the next part is start on G so
G<00:03:34.440> C<00:03:35.160> D<00:03:35.430> b-flat<00:03:36.830> wat<00:03:37.830> while<00:03:38.040> you're<00:03:38.190> holding<00:03:38.340> a

G C D b-flat wat while you're holding a

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.150 
G C D b-flat wat while you're holding a
C<00:03:38.850> over<00:03:39.090> here<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:40.020> we're<00:03:40.500> gonna<00:03:40.620> hold<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.860> seat

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
C over here so we're gonna hold the seat

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:50.330 
C over here so we're gonna hold the seat
the<00:03:41.940> whole<00:03:42.090> time<00:03:42.150> you're<00:03:42.480> playing<00:03:42.720> this

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:07.530 

so<00:03:51.340> G<00:03:52.000> C<00:03:52.810> D<00:03:53.670> e-flat<00:03:54.670> F<00:03:55.299> G<00:03:56.280> FG<00:03:57.599> FG<00:03:58.920> f<00:03:59.920> e<00:04:06.540> then

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
so G C D e-flat F G FG FG f e then

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.599 
so G C D e-flat F G FG FG f e then
that's<00:04:07.750> played<00:04:08.019> twice<00:04:08.439> and<00:04:08.889> then<00:04:09.639> you're<00:04:09.760> just
