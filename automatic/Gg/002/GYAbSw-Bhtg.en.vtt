like to share this daisy-chain put with
you<00:00:05.580> I've<00:00:06.420> made<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.960> just<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.379> two<00:00:07.529> colors

you I've made it in just the two colors
and<00:00:08.220> I've<00:00:08.550> used<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.210> half<00:00:09.300> yards<00:00:09.510> of

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
and I've used one and a half yards of

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.169 
and I've used one and a half yards of
each<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.219> daisy<00:00:11.519> chain<00:00:11.639> quilt<00:00:12.059> that

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
each this is a daisy chain quilt that

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.480 
each this is a daisy chain quilt that
I've<00:00:12.300> made<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.750> measures<00:00:13.139> 54<00:00:13.769> inches<00:00:14.099> square

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
I've made it measures 54 inches square

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
I've made it measures 54 inches square
and<00:00:14.700> I've<00:00:15.570> used<00:00:15.960> just<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> two<00:00:16.529> colors<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
and I've used just the two colors the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.210 
and I've used just the two colors the
the<00:00:17.970> red<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> white<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.800> rather<00:00:20.010> like

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the red and the white and I rather like

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.390 
the red and the white and I rather like
the<00:00:20.400> way<00:00:20.520> these<00:00:21.710> daisies<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.279> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the way these daisies what I like to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.660 
the way these daisies what I like to
think<00:00:23.550> them<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:23.760> daisies<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:25.250> shown<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
think them as daisies have shown up and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.519 
think them as daisies have shown up and
they<00:00:26.789> sort<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.150> make<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> little<00:00:27.510> Daisy<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
they sort of make a little Daisy the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
they sort of make a little Daisy the
circle<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.390> quite<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> red<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.019> come

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
circle I quite like the red so all come

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.740 
circle I quite like the red so all come
together<00:00:31.349> now<00:00:32.099> I've<00:00:32.279> used<00:00:32.450> three<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> half

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
together now I've used three and a half

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.930 
together now I've used three and a half
inch<00:00:33.960> squares<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.829> plain<00:00:35.250> squares<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
inch squares for the plain squares and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
inch squares for the plain squares and
three<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.020> seven<00:00:37.140> eighths<00:00:37.410> inch<00:00:37.649> squares<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
three and seven eighths inch squares to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.670 
three and seven eighths inch squares to
make<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.489> half<00:00:38.940> square<00:00:39.180> triangles<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.930> for

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
make the half square triangles and for

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.910 
make the half square triangles and for
the<00:00:40.770> border<00:00:41.190> I've<00:00:41.399> used<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.469> stepped<00:00:43.469> pattern

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the border I've used a stepped pattern

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
the border I've used a stepped pattern
of<00:00:44.070> two<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> half<00:00:44.640> inch<00:00:44.910> red<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
of two and a half inch red with one and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.100 
of two and a half inch red with one and
a<00:00:46.050> half<00:00:46.200> inch<00:00:46.440> white<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.690> flipped

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
a half inch white and then just flipped

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.799 
a half inch white and then just flipped
them<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:49.940> make<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> stepped<00:00:51.360> pattern

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
them so that they make a stepped pattern

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.869 
them so that they make a stepped pattern
all<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.140> around<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> corners

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
all the way around and in the corners

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.819 
all the way around and in the corners
for<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> corner<00:00:55.020> stones<00:00:55.289> I've<00:00:55.440> used<00:00:55.680> three

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
for the corner stones I've used three

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
for the corner stones I've used three
and<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> half<00:00:56.129> inch<00:00:56.340> white<00:00:56.579> squares<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.500> hope<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and a half inch white squares I hope you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.160 
and a half inch white squares I hope you
like<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.850> I've<00:00:59.850> used<00:01:00.149> three<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.539> 7/8<00:01:00.930> inch

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like it I've used three and 7/8 inch

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.660 
like it I've used three and 7/8 inch
squares<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.800> make<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.190> half<00:01:02.399> square

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
squares to make the half square

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.810 
squares to make the half square
triangles<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.480> place<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.680> red<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> white<00:01:05.339> with

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
triangles a place a red and a white with

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
triangles a place a red and a white with
right<00:01:06.090> sides<00:01:06.450> together<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.920> mark<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
right sides together and then mark a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
right sides together and then mark a
line<00:01:08.820> along<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> diagonal<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> seam

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
line along the diagonal so a seam

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800 
line along the diagonal so a seam
quarter<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> an<00:01:11.640> inch<00:01:11.760> either<00:01:12.090> side<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.689> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
quarter of an inch either side of that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
quarter of an inch either side of that
line<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> come<00:01:14.159> you'll<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.580> able<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
line and then you come you'll be able to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.270 
line and then you come you'll be able to
cut<00:01:15.000> along<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.570> line<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.680> give<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> two

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
cut along the line to give you two

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.890 
cut along the line to give you two
triangle<00:01:17.970> shapes<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.450> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
triangle shapes like this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.990 
triangle shapes like this
and<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> unfold<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.670> gives<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and when you unfold them that gives you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
and when you unfold them that gives you
a<00:01:21.030> half<00:01:21.210> square<00:01:21.420> triangle<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.470> you'll<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.890> two

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
a half square triangle so you'll get two

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.710 
a half square triangle so you'll get two
of<00:01:23.130> these<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:24.000> three<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> half<00:01:24.540> inch

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
of these which are three and a half inch

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.460 
of these which are three and a half inch
squares<00:01:25.080> from<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.880> pair<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:28.080> squares

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
squares from this one pair of of squares

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.340 
squares from this one pair of of squares
there<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.869> basics

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
there so that was one of the the basics

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.510 
there so that was one of the the basics
now<00:01:31.920> for<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> other<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:33.090> save<00:01:33.720> time<00:01:34.079> I've

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
now for the other one to save time I've

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
now for the other one to save time I've
sewed<00:01:35.520> strips<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.240> fabric<00:01:36.420> together<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.320> then

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
sewed strips of fabric together and then

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.600 
sewed strips of fabric together and then
there<00:01:38.250> involves<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.299> much<00:01:39.479> simpler<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
there involves it's much simpler the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
there involves it's much simpler the
sewing<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> cutting<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.750> I've<00:01:43.140> sewn

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
sewing of the cutting so I've sewn

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.240 
sewing of the cutting so I've sewn
together<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.399> red<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.600> white<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.439> red<00:01:46.470> three

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
together a red a white and a red three

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.649 
together a red a white and a red three
and<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.460> half<00:01:47.670> inch<00:01:47.909> strip<00:01:48.270> they're<00:01:48.450> three<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and a half inch strip they're three and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.780 
and a half inch strip they're three and
a<00:01:48.750> half<00:01:48.930> inches<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.470> way<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.640> I'm

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
a half inches that way and now I'm

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.490 
a half inches that way and now I'm
cutting<00:01:51.060> them<00:01:51.329> across<00:01:51.570> at<00:01:51.930> three<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> half

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
cutting them across at three and a half

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.499 
cutting them across at three and a half
inch<00:01:52.740> intervals<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.329> mean<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
inch intervals so that will mean that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.420 
inch intervals so that will mean that
I've<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.140> effect<00:01:55.470> three<00:01:55.740> squares<00:01:56.100> already

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
I've got in effect three squares already

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490 
I've got in effect three squares already
sewn<00:01:56.700> together<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.990> speeds<00:01:58.259> things

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
sewn together which just speeds things

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.340 
sewn together which just speeds things
up<00:01:58.799> when<00:01:59.070> you're<00:01:59.189> doing<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.140> putting<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
up when you're doing the putting the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469 
up when you're doing the putting the
block<00:02:01.530> together<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.520> I'll<00:02:02.670> carry<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.299> cut

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
block together so I'll carry on and cut

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.760 
block together so I'll carry on and cut
up<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.780> three<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> half<00:02:04.229> inch<00:02:04.409> lengths

as<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.139> second<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.739> first<00:03:33.980> rows<00:03:34.310> you're

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
as the second and first rows you're

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.670 
as the second and first rows you're
using<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.329> white<00:03:35.540> red<00:03:35.750> white<00:03:35.780> at<00:03:36.199> each<00:03:36.349> end

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
using a white red white at each end

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.949 
using a white red white at each end
there<00:03:37.430> with<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.940> hospitai<00:03:38.510> angles<00:03:38.750> in<00:03:38.870> the

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
there with to hospitai angles in the

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.319 
there with to hospitai angles in the

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.599 
middle and a red white red at each end
there<00:03:41.599> again<00:03:42.349> with<00:03:42.560> two<00:03:42.739> houseware<00:03:43.160> triangles

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
there again with two houseware triangles

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.400 
there again with two houseware triangles
in<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.849> middle<00:03:44.090> so<00:03:44.690> now<00:03:44.900> I'm<00:03:45.349> very

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
in the middle so now I'm very

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.650 
in the middle so now I'm very
straightforward<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:46.310> sew<00:03:46.489> together<00:03:46.669> just<00:03:47.480> so

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
straightforward to sew together just so

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.150 
straightforward to sew together just so
all<00:03:47.840> these<00:03:48.019> squares<00:03:48.379> together<00:03:48.530> across<00:03:48.889> each

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
all these squares together across each

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.159 
all these squares together across each
row<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.669> then<00:03:49.790> sew<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.239> rows<00:03:50.389> together<00:03:50.840> and

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
row and then sew the rows together and

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.390 
row and then sew the rows together and
you'll<00:03:51.859> need<00:03:52.099> four<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.459> these<00:03:52.790> blocks<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:54.400> made

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
you'll need four of these blocks I made

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.110 
you'll need four of these blocks I made
one<00:03:55.730> panel<00:03:56.299> each<00:03:56.449> of<00:03:56.769> these<00:03:57.769> three<00:03:58.459> square<00:03:58.819> or

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
one panel each of these three square or

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.990 
one panel each of these three square or
three<00:03:59.419> fabric<00:03:59.870> strips<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:01.669> was<00:04:01.819> not

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
three fabric strips and that was not

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.390 
three fabric strips and that was not
quite<00:04:02.150> enough<00:04:02.480> for<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.989> four<00:04:03.230> blocks<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.220> what

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
quite enough for the four blocks so what

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.099 
quite enough for the four blocks so what
I've<00:04:04.549> done<00:04:04.669> in<00:04:04.909> addition<00:04:05.359> just<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.629> make<00:04:05.959> up

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
I've done in addition just to make up

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.170 
I've done in addition just to make up
the<00:04:06.199> numbers<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.739> sewn<00:04:07.280> together<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.699> red<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.120> a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
the numbers is sewn together a red and a

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.949 
the numbers is sewn together a red and a
white<00:04:08.650> strip<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.889> cut<00:04:10.489> them<00:04:10.669> again<00:04:10.819> at<00:04:11.180> three

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
white strip and cut them again at three

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.170 
white strip and cut them again at three
and<00:04:12.019> a<00:04:12.079> half<00:04:12.199> intervals<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.919> way<00:04:13.129> now<00:04:13.790> what

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
and a half intervals that way now what

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.879 
and a half intervals that way now what
that<00:04:14.209> means<00:04:14.389> is<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.959> can<00:04:14.989> add<00:04:15.349> either<00:04:15.680> a

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
that means is that I can add either a

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.449 
that means is that I can add either a
red<00:04:16.130> square<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.329> or<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.659> white<00:04:17.930> square<00:04:18.459> and

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
red square to it or a white square and

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.279 
red square to it or a white square and
then<00:04:19.970> that<00:04:20.180> will<00:04:20.329> help<00:04:20.750> me<00:04:20.900> just<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.109> finish

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
then that will help me just to finish

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.879 
then that will help me just to finish
off<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.680> numbers<00:04:21.950> that<00:04:22.099> I<00:04:22.219> need<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:22.789> three

one and a half inch strip of white
there's<00:04:46.360> been<00:04:46.539> quilting<00:04:46.749> I've<00:04:47.259> then<00:04:47.529> cut<00:04:47.830> them

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
there's been quilting I've then cut them

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.809 
there's been quilting I've then cut them
apart<00:04:48.159> again<00:04:48.729> in<00:04:49.659> three<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.169> a<00:04:50.199> half<00:04:50.409> inch

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
apart again in three and a half inch

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.129 
apart again in three and a half inch
widths<00:04:51.819> so<00:04:52.029> that<00:04:52.210> they<00:04:52.389> are<00:04:52.599> now<00:04:52.749> a<00:04:52.779> three<00:04:53.080> and

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
widths so that they are now a three and

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.290 
widths so that they are now a three and
a<00:04:53.199> half<00:04:53.379> inch<00:04:53.590> squares<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.340> then<00:04:55.029> of<00:04:55.120> course

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
a half inch squares and then of course

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.399 
a half inch squares and then of course
I've<00:04:55.449> thrown<00:04:55.569> them<00:04:55.749> all<00:04:55.840> back<00:04:55.960> together<00:04:56.139> again

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
I've thrown them all back together again

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.459 
I've thrown them all back together again
but<00:04:56.979> what<00:04:57.819> I've<00:04:58.000> done<00:04:58.150> is<00:04:58.419> I've<00:04:58.659> flipped<00:04:59.139> them

00:04:59.459 --> 00:04:59.469 
but what I've done is I've flipped them

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:01.800 
but what I've done is I've flipped them
so<00:04:59.830> I've<00:05:00.129> put<00:05:00.669> them<00:05:00.849> the<00:05:01.150> one<00:05:01.300> upside<00:05:01.629> down

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
so I've put them the one upside down

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.869 
so I've put them the one upside down
against<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.379> other<00:05:02.529> so<00:05:03.490> that<00:05:03.610> you've<00:05:03.849> got

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:03.879 
against the other so that you've got

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.809 
against the other so that you've got
that<00:05:04.240> stepped<00:05:04.659> effect<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:06.069> then<00:05:06.279> sewing<00:05:06.610> them

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
that stepped effect and then sewing them

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.570 
that stepped effect and then sewing them
together<00:05:07.029> like<00:05:07.599> that<00:05:07.659> now<00:05:08.500> you'll<00:05:09.400> need

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
together like that now you'll need

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.999 
together like that now you'll need
sixteen<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.360> these<00:05:10.479> to<00:05:10.779> go<00:05:10.930> sewed<00:05:11.830> together

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
sixteen of these to go sewed together

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.689 
sixteen of these to go sewed together
for<00:05:12.819> the<00:05:13.029> top<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.569> the<00:05:13.750> bottom<00:05:14.189> I've<00:05:15.189> sewn<00:05:15.520> the

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
for the top and the bottom I've sewn the

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.390 
for the top and the bottom I've sewn the
border<00:05:16.599> across<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.319> top<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.860> now<00:05:18.039> for<00:05:18.310> the

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
border across the top and now for the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.709 
border across the top and now for the
sides<00:05:18.669> I'm<00:05:19.060> using<00:05:19.949> sixteen<00:05:21.210> squares<00:05:22.210> of<00:05:22.539> these

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
sides I'm using sixteen squares of these

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
choice now on this one across the top

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.820 
choice now on this one across the top
I've<00:05:45.520> got<00:05:45.819> the<00:05:46.080> where<00:05:47.080> there's<00:05:47.259> a<00:05:47.349> red<00:05:47.529> square

I've got the where there's a red square
on<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.129> quilt<00:05:48.399> I've<00:05:48.909> got<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.330> white<00:05:49.449> against

on the quilt I've got the white against

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.200 
on the quilt I've got the white against
it<00:05:50.139> and<00:05:50.319> then<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.770> red<00:05:50.979> and<00:05:51.250> that<00:05:51.789> means<00:05:52.029> then

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
it and then the red and that means then

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.939 
it and then the red and that means then
when<00:05:52.389> there's<00:05:52.569> a<00:05:52.599> wide<00:05:52.750> spoke<00:05:53.110> wide<00:05:53.589> square

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
when there's a wide spoke wide square

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.679 
when there's a wide spoke wide square
I'm<00:05:54.129> going<00:05:54.279> to<00:05:54.339> have<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.550> red<00:05:54.699> against<00:05:55.089> it<00:05:55.240> so

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:55.689 
I'm going to have the red against it so

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.629 
I'm going to have the red against it so
that<00:05:55.960> actually<00:05:56.770> I<00:05:56.800> think<00:05:56.919> now<00:05:57.189> is<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:57.399> way<00:05:57.610> I

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
that actually I think now is the way I

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.999 
that actually I think now is the way I
prefer<00:05:57.969> it<00:05:58.330> but<00:05:58.839> you<00:05:59.080> could<00:05:59.319> also<00:05:59.500> do<00:05:59.800> it<00:05:59.830> the

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
prefer it but you could also do it the

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.429 
prefer it but you could also do it the
other<00:06:00.039> way<00:06:00.219> where<00:06:00.969> you've<00:06:01.149> got<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:02.199> red

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
other way where you've got the red

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.499 
other way where you've got the red
against<00:06:02.979> a<00:06:03.099> red<00:06:03.279> square<00:06:03.669> and<00:06:03.909> the<00:06:04.360> white

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
against a red square and the white

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.329 
against a red square and the white
against<00:06:04.990> a<00:06:05.080> white<00:06:05.229> square<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:05.860> that<00:06:06.069> gives

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:06.339 
against a white square and that gives

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:09.899 
against a white square and that gives
you<00:06:06.550> a<00:06:06.789> different<00:06:07.149> effect<00:06:07.949> but<00:06:08.949> as<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:09.580> say<00:06:09.879> you

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
you a different effect but as I say you

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.730 
you a different effect but as I say you
can<00:06:10.270> choose<00:06:10.539> because<00:06:10.930> you<00:06:11.229> can<00:06:11.379> see<00:06:11.500> both

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
can choose because you can see both

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.850 
can choose because you can see both
