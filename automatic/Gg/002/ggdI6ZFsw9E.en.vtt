secure<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> team's<00:01:33.180> victory<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.960> besides

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
secure the team's victory so besides

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.490 
secure the team's victory so besides
that<00:01:34.799> site<00:01:35.340> 244<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
that site 244 is actually one of the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.530 
that site 244 is actually one of the
best<00:01:37.740> maps<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.700> pack<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.240> mean<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.479> think

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
best maps in this pack I mean I think

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.740 
best maps in this pack I mean I think
they're<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.920> closely<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.180> right

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
they're all so closely you know right

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
they're all so closely you know right
there<00:01:43.079> together<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.799> hard<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> really

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
there together it's hard to really

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
there together it's hard to really
pinpoint<00:01:44.549> which<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> best<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.689> can

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
pinpoint which is the best but I can

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.270 
pinpoint which is the best but I can
tell<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> worst<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.560> sure<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.770> climate

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
tell you the worst for sure is climate

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.109 
tell you the worst for sure is climate
but<00:01:47.790> ChopShop<00:01:48.710> perplex<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.009> site<00:01:50.220> 244<00:01:50.939> are

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
but ChopShop perplex and site 244 are

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
but ChopShop perplex and site 244 are
all<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.590> together<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.009> could<00:01:53.310> not

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
all right there together I could not

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
all right there together I could not
pick<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.090> one's<00:01:54.299> better<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.869> all

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
pick out which one's better they are all

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
pick out which one's better they are all
so<00:01:55.680> good<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.729> goes<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.030> show<00:01:57.240> what

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so good and it just goes to show what

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.060 
so good and it just goes to show what
kind<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.780> job<00:01:57.990> sledgehammer<00:01:58.530> has<00:01:58.710> done<00:01:58.920> with

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
kind of a job sledgehammer has done with

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.730 
kind of a job sledgehammer has done with
the<00:01:59.159> DLC<00:01:59.579> -<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.270> way<00:02:00.600> better<00:02:00.840> than<00:02:01.079> DLC<00:02:01.530> one

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the DLC - it's way better than DLC one

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.440 
the DLC - it's way better than DLC one
so<00:02:01.979> I'm<00:02:02.399> actually<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.909> excited<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.390> play
