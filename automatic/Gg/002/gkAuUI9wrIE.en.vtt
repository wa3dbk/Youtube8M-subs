00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
but we do get a mess to cover that up

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.389 
but we do get a mess to cover that up
along<00:00:56.629> with<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.839> tank<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.890> we<00:00:58.039> gotta<00:00:58.190> acts

too so you can go lumberjack on that

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.420 
too so you can go lumberjack on that
tree<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:00.440> get<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:03.079> here's<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.220> tree

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
tree that you get and here's the tree

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.280 
tree that you get and here's the tree
that<00:01:04.640> comes<00:01:04.850> with<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.089> set<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:05.630> twice<00:01:05.930> as<00:01:06.110> tall

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
that comes with the set is twice as tall

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.020 
that comes with the set is twice as tall
as<00:01:06.410> a<00:01:06.500> minifigure<00:01:06.980> and<00:01:07.130> while<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:07.880> looks

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
as a minifigure and while it looks

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.760 
as a minifigure and while it looks
pretty<00:01:08.240> simple<00:01:08.510> in<00:01:08.660> design<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.650> way

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
pretty simple in design and in a way

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.620 
pretty simple in design and in a way
insignificant<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.790> does<00:01:10.970> add<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.210> pretty<00:01:11.480> good

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
insignificant it does add a pretty good

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.260 
insignificant it does add a pretty good
play<00:01:11.810> feature<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.440> set<00:01:12.830> overall<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.610> plus<00:01:14.150> if

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
play feature to set overall and plus if

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.610 
play feature to set overall and plus if
you<00:01:14.360> look<00:01:14.480> carefully<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.350> like<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
you look carefully this is like the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.740 
you look carefully this is like the
beginning<00:01:15.980> of<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.190> new<00:01:16.220> trend<00:01:16.640> if<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.480> look<00:01:17.630> at

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
beginning of a new trend if you look at

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.960 
beginning of a new trend if you look at
some<00:01:17.900> of<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.050> older<00:01:18.350> fire<00:01:18.710> sets<00:01:19.040> they're

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
some of the older fire sets they're

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.120 
some of the older fire sets they're
actually<00:01:20.240> pretty<00:01:20.360> basic<00:01:20.750> because<00:01:21.380> they

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
actually pretty basic because they

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.170 
actually pretty basic because they
didn't<00:01:22.280> really<00:01:22.400> come<00:01:22.580> with<00:01:22.700> anything<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.030> do

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
didn't really come with anything to do

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.120 
didn't really come with anything to do
well<00:01:23.870> except<00:01:24.080> for<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:24.260> fire<00:01:24.530> station<00:01:24.800> that

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
well except for that fire station that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.500 
well except for that fire station that
one<00:01:25.250> came<00:01:25.400> with<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.580> kitten<00:01:25.850> for<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:26.180> rescue

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
one came with a kitten for you to rescue

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.690 
one came with a kitten for you to rescue
and<00:01:26.960> if<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.470> look<00:01:27.590> at<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.800> upcoming<00:01:27.950> 2013

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
and if you look at the upcoming 2013

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.820 
and if you look at the upcoming 2013
fire<00:01:29.120> sets<00:01:29.450> they<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.320> pretty<00:01:30.500> much<00:01:30.590> have

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
fire sets they all pretty much have

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.170 
fire sets they all pretty much have
something<00:01:31.130> for<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.580> do<00:01:31.670> like<00:01:31.880> putting<00:01:32.120> out

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
something for you to do like putting out

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.360

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.059 
that tray of accessories now you notice
that<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:03.090> tank<00:03:03.599> is<00:03:03.840> loosely<00:03:04.260> attached<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.040> a

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
that this tank is loosely attached so a

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.770 
that this tank is loosely attached so a
lot<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.340> times<00:03:05.519> when<00:03:05.760> you're<00:03:05.940> shaking<00:03:06.359> it<00:03:06.629> or

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
lot of times when you're shaking it or

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.630 
lot of times when you're shaking it or
just<00:03:06.989> driving<00:03:07.290> over<00:03:07.349> rough<00:03:07.680> terrain<00:03:07.829> this

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
just driving over rough terrain this

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.520 
just driving over rough terrain this
thing<00:03:08.790> will<00:03:08.909> just<00:03:08.940> move<00:03:09.299> off<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.200> lot<00:03:10.470> of

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
thing will just move off and a lot of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.990 
thing will just move off and a lot of
times<00:03:10.709> it'll<00:03:10.890> cost<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> tree<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.640> get<00:03:11.790> stuck

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
times it'll cost the tree to get stuck

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.970 
times it'll cost the tree to get stuck
inside<00:03:12.150> it's<00:03:12.989> probably<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.379> only<00:03:13.470> bad<00:03:13.769> thing

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
inside it's probably the only bad thing

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.339 
inside it's probably the only bad thing
about<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:15.209> then<00:03:15.480> again<00:03:15.599> it<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:15.989> easy<00:03:16.140> to

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
about this but then again it is easy to

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.740 
about this but then again it is easy to
fix<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:17.370> gonna<00:03:17.549> slide<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.060> there<00:03:18.269> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
fix I'm gonna slide that in there and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.390 
fix I'm gonna slide that in there and
we're<00:03:18.900> good<00:03:19.079> here's<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.010> view<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.280> other

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
we're good here's the view of the other

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.670 
we're good here's the view of the other
side<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.940> in<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.690> way<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:21.989> thing<00:03:22.169> reminds<00:03:22.500> me

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
side and in a way this thing reminds me

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.349 
side and in a way this thing reminds me
of<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.859> tank<00:03:23.160> especially<00:03:23.880> when<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.030> look<00:03:24.150> at<00:03:24.269> it

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
of a tank especially when you look at it

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.089 
of a tank especially when you look at it
from<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.630> front<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:25.620> looks<00:03:25.650> like<00:03:25.889> this<00:03:26.040> thing

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
from the front it looks like this thing

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.069 
from the front it looks like this thing
will<00:03:26.430> have<00:03:26.669> no<00:03:26.849> problem<00:03:27.269> plowing<00:03:27.870> through<00:03:28.019> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
will have no problem plowing through the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.319 
will have no problem plowing through the
rough<00:03:28.349> terrain<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.519> here's<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.819> view<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
here's the view of the back where it

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.110 
here's the view of the back where it
looks<00:03:34.620> pretty<00:03:34.829> plain<00:03:35.099> well<00:03:35.489> we<00:03:35.579> do<00:03:35.700> get<00:03:35.970> some

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
stickers this was a little bad this one

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.520 
stickers this was a little bad this one

top<00:03:48.540> over<00:03:48.720> here<00:03:48.750> too<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:50.190> anyway<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.879> said

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
top over here too but anyway as I said

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.640 
top over here too but anyway as I said
this<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.540> definitely<00:03:52.049> one<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.199> the<00:03:52.290> best<00:03:52.440> fire

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
this is definitely one of the best fire

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.129 
this is definitely one of the best fire
trucks<00:03:52.859> around<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.579> having<00:03:54.480> said<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.720> let's

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
trucks around and having said that let's

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.809 
trucks around and having said that let's
move<00:03:55.290> on<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.739> recommendations<00:03:58.819> overall

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
move on to the recommendations overall

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.460 
move on to the recommendations overall
this<00:03:59.970> is<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.150> really<00:04:00.510> good<00:04:00.629> set<00:04:00.870> when<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.260> comes

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
this is a really good set when it comes

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.869 
this is a really good set when it comes
to<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.680> value<00:04:01.829> we<00:04:02.160> have<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> price<00:04:02.549> per<00:04:02.699> piece

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
to the value we have a price per piece

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.599 
to the value we have a price per piece
ratio<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.510> 8.2<00:04:04.019> cents<00:04:04.290> per<00:04:04.470> piece<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.370> we're

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
ratio of 8.2 cents per piece and we're

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.819 
ratio of 8.2 cents per piece and we're
getting<00:04:05.819> about<00:04:05.970> 25<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.840> 33<00:04:07.260> dollars<00:04:07.590> with<00:04:07.739> the

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
getting about 25 to 33 dollars with the

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.319 
getting about 25 to 33 dollars with the
parts<00:04:08.069> here<00:04:08.220> not<00:04:08.549> including<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.879> minifigure

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
parts here not including the minifigure

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.150 
parts here not including the minifigure
so<00:04:09.870> apparently<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.620> pretty<00:04:10.799> good<00:04:10.980> deal

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
so apparently this is a pretty good deal

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.670 
so apparently this is a pretty good deal
since<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.609> retails<00:04:11.970> for<00:04:12.060> $20<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.290> when<00:04:13.560> it

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
since this retails for $20 and when it

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.199 
since this retails for $20 and when it
comes<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:13.980> play<00:04:14.160> value<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.609> really<00:04:14.849> good<00:04:15.000> too

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
comes to play value is really good too

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.729 
comes to play value is really good too
as<00:04:15.389> I<00:04:15.840> mentioned<00:04:16.139> earlier<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.440> think<00:04:16.500> it's

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
as I mentioned earlier I think it's

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.779 
as I mentioned earlier I think it's
really<00:04:16.919> nice<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.099> we<00:04:17.280> get<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.549> tree

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
really nice that we get this tree

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.670 
really nice that we get this tree
because<00:04:17.970> we<00:04:18.720> now<00:04:18.840> have<00:04:19.049> some<00:04:19.260> fires<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.650> put

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
because we now have some fires to put

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.860 
because we now have some fires to put
out<00:04:19.829> which<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> very<00:04:20.729> welcome<00:04:21.090> change<00:04:21.120> from

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
out which is a very welcome change from

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.110 
out which is a very welcome change from
previous<00:04:22.169> fire<00:04:22.530> series<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.640> on<00:04:23.789> top<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:24.060> that

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
previous fire series and on top of that

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.149 
previous fire series and on top of that
we<00:04:24.240> have<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.360> truck<00:04:24.630> full<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:24.870> features<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.469> the

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
we have a truck full of features and the

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.170 
we have a truck full of features and the
only<00:04:26.310> bad<00:04:26.490> thing<00:04:26.610> about<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.909> that<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.090> could

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
only bad thing about is that it could

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.640 
only bad thing about is that it could
definitely<00:04:27.300> you

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
definitely you

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.680 
definitely you
another<00:04:27.860> minifig<00:04:28.340> but<00:04:28.970> then<00:04:29.090> again<00:04:29.150> for<00:04:29.419> 20

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
another minifig but then again for 20
