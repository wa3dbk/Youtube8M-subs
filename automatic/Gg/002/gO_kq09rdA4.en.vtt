00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.640 
a quick heel but I love them I think
they're<00:03:28.810> super<00:03:29.110> sexy<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:29.800> they<00:03:30.400> kill<00:03:30.700> my<00:03:30.880> feet

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
they're super sexy but they kill my feet

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.810 
they're super sexy but they kill my feet
and<00:03:32.650> this<00:03:33.489> is<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.670> pair<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.560> boots<00:03:35.560> they<00:03:36.489> are

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
and this is a pair of boots they are

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.729 
and this is a pair of boots they are
supposed<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.540> be<00:03:37.600> distressed<00:03:38.110> looking<00:03:38.560> like

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
supposed to be distressed looking like

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.290 
supposed to be distressed looking like
that<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.100> kind<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.670> distressed<00:03:40.180> look

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
that I kind of like that distressed look

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.870 
that I kind of like that distressed look
they<00:03:41.200> kill<00:03:41.560> my<00:03:41.800> feet<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.519> think<00:03:42.760> it's

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
they kill my feet and I think it's

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.740 
they kill my feet and I think it's
because<00:03:43.300> of<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:46.060> pointy<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.600> would

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
because of the the pointy you would

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.850 
because of the the pointy you would
think<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.050> they'd<00:03:47.200> be<00:03:47.350> more<00:03:47.500> comfortable

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
think that they'd be more comfortable

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.470 
think that they'd be more comfortable
because<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.340> chunky<00:03:48.760> heel<00:03:49.030> but

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
because of the chunky heel but

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.160 
because of the chunky heel but
unfortunately<00:03:51.330> that's<00:03:52.330> not<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.630> case<00:03:52.870> they

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
unfortunately that's not the case they

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.960 
unfortunately that's not the case they
are<00:03:53.320> an<00:03:53.470> eight<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:53.769> half<00:03:53.800> and<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.610> think<00:03:54.820> that

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
are an eight and a half and I think that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.240 
are an eight and a half and I think that
has<00:03:55.090> another<00:03:55.360> issue<00:03:55.540> I'm<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.350> nine<00:03:56.590> if

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250
