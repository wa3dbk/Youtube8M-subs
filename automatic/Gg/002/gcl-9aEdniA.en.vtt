00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.640
 in the next video 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.710
 we will do an operation with radicals the 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.630
 operation with radicals in which it goes to 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.320
 appear some letter 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:19.360
 operations 2 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:23.880
 massa that multiplies after 3 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.880
 this - root of 27 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.439
 more root of 243 to square 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:39.300
 good to perform an operation sums 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:42.129
 and subtraction of radicals what is sought is 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.489
 try that the maximum of the radicals 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.530
 so they have the radicand that is what 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.960
 within the root as they are 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.080
 similar and so be able to leave the same 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.570
 filing and carrying out the operation with 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.320
 the coefficients of the radical in this 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.269
 we work with 327 243 squared 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.840
 we already see that the square is going to come out 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.220
 outside 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:15.140
 Now 33 is a cousin and we can not do 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:19.330
 nothing on 27 is 39 33 31 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.260
 27 is 3 cubed 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.990
 it is distributed from your first product as 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.000
 product with even exponents can be 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.420
 be two so that they come out and see 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 clearly he goes out was 243 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.090
 we know that square is already 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:47.350
 decomposed this fits 2 + 4 639 every 3 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:52.820
 243 if we divide by 3 we have 8 left 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:02:01.450
 with 324 0381 0 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:06.600
 this is 81 33 this is 27 39 33 31 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.940
 243 is 3 to the fifth 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.060
 we write this as 3 squared by 3 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.480
 squares by 3 are the exponents two 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.140
 plus two are the ones that gives 5 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.260
 once we have this two more rooted 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.239
 of three now minus 27 that as we have 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.239
 said is 3 squared by 3 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:34.120
 and now more than 3 243 3 squared 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.850
 squared by 3 x squared everything 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.160
 that has a square as the index is 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.290
 two in square cadiz 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.140
 everything is square it has as 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.290
 a passport that allows you to leave 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.410
 inside the root and clear is like a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.970
 entry to exit the root when leaving 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.670
 of the root because the entrance is delivered and 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.870
 stays in the exponent then 2 more 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.760
 33 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:07.970
 - 3 squared that goes out as 320 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.170
 3 and now this 3 equator comes out 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.640
 3 this three boxes outside 3 this 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.870
 it does not come out because our raised to the box 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.200
 a picture 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.300
 he has been 3-3 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:29.180
 we do not have two more to three 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:31.050
 minus 33 plus 3 x 39 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.410
 2. 3 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.960
 and then how do we have the same 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.060
 being rooted is left root of three that is 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.740
 how to draw common factor already add two 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:47.190
 plus minus three all plus or minus three 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.540
 and more 9 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.319
 and now we do that operation that 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:59.099
 we have ahead that gives 2 - 3 - 1 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.099
 and now more to 9 to 10 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.790
 let's go for this and we'll get to that 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.300
 see a little better because it's a bit 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.530
 together everything would be after that less 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.260
 one 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.700
 + 10 to 13 3 and this would be the result of 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.959
 the operation 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.949
 addition and subtraction of radicals that 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.949
 we had initially
