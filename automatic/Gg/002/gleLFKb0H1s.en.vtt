00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.740
 You need to be neat to 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.540
 compose production 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.309

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.530

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.199
 afternoon luiza there isabella good afternoon to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.890
 everybody today we are going to teach 5 hairstyles 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.510
 many different 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.449
 Let's talk first with the boys. 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.429
 What is an easier hairstyle in MarÃ­lia? 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.230
 good good rate is easier 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.360
 especially for young children 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.770
 and more restless if we go here 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.710
 do it quickly 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.500
 using the powdered ointment his hair 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.480
 already cut before going to 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.050
 this Moico stylization that the boys 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.090
 They like it and it's very cool. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.079
 You are the best 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 curl of good yellow hair 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.890
 for boys for the male audience 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.289
 in general it is a hair that is a little bit 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.500
 then the suggestion is to use a 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.049
 good book on a moisturizer and to help 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.129
 in the delineation of the box per box is 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.960
 firm 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.830
 We can use music that I like. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.530
 much because she also already treats ointment 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.659
 and this will help in setting the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.880
 bunch should stay on roll dinho day 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.250
 whole so he can run ball play 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.220
 and if he wants to go out at night in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 beach to go to date is very good and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.689
 Let's move on to the girls now. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.610
 are more elaborate hairstyles good afternoon 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.710
 Bruno, we're going to do this hairstyle. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.270
 in the case of that hairstyle that was a hair 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.850
 very simple very easy too do 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.490
 at home then separate part of the high 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.710
 part is all shredded from the middle to the bottom 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.110
 to create a little volume and has a 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.540
 structure that can hold a clamp 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.820
 so here we wanted more volume 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.649
 This game was diverted, I'm going 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.649
 override the rest 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.010
 creating one and kanu this mohawk line 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.130
 I'm going to take the part now from the front I'm going 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.430
 twist on the mohawk 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.200
 after attaching the clip with a 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.640
 the utility here is with the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.400
 criterion of the mother in the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.560
 in her case with clamp and to stay with 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.170
 a more beautiful effect, we'll go 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.590
 put a crown on it and only on that part 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.870
 from above that the most shredded girl 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.090
 I love it, it's a cutie she can use 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 yes or she can use with accessory 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.019
 then move on now to the next has 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.209
 closed it in that hairstyle we 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.670
 we separated the lateral all the lateral was 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.519
 braided and after braided we 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.220
 we took this part here and we twisted with the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.600
 loose part is a bigger braid even has 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.160
 that being a bigger braid has to be 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.130
 looser because it can not 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.930
 structure and not enough volume. 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.320
 take a staple and also 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.940
 part has everything to the very effect side 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.010
 beautiful france 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.829
 and this more structured loose part is 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.840
 a mixture of braid with sometimes 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.489
 until the tail is right and this can be a tail 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.079
 Also this hair to never stops 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.970
 make straight hair curly hair one 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.769
 curly hair gets more volume 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.350
 so it looks more beautiful even in the curl 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.299
 Let's move on to the last one then 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.980
 If it is we did a tail 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.930
 horse that is too common to be more 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.579
 fine to play and not to stay 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.890
 that scrawled the classic we lose 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.180
 the rest of the hair we made and all 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.880
 these transfers 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.640
 we hold above the tail in that 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.500
 it has to be thin thin gives 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.459
 little more volume 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.959
 in this structure that all braid 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.010
 twist on 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.200
 you can also leave the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.170
 loose braids nad and can hold too 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.790
 accessory or loose or secured with a 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.620
 accessory and if an accessory of 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.720
 shine that made the child very beautiful 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.459
 You can play or play hair 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.070
 the child can also place the crown 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.720
 You can put color or this is that it can 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.790
 do only the part of the ponytail 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.769
 leave the loose plaits she can 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.930
 fucking braids doing a little more 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.580
