you've got to get the head light speed
limiter<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:45.440> in<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:45.860> right<00:00:46.040> time<00:00:46.370> we<00:00:46.610> hit<00:00:46.729> the

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
limiter on in the right time we hit the

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.390 
limiter on in the right time we hit the
button<00:00:47.269> and<00:00:47.449> then<00:00:48.050> it's<00:00:48.229> just<00:00:48.470> because<00:00:49.220> we're

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
button and then it's just because we're

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.680 
button and then it's just because we're
at<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.580> end<00:00:49.699> of<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.909> pit<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:50.360> there's<00:00:50.570> this

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
at the end of the pit so there's this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.719 
at the end of the pit so there's this
long<00:00:51.110> particularly<00:00:51.680> here<00:00:51.979> a<00:00:52.010> tocar<00:00:52.460> like

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
long particularly here a tocar like

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:54.630 
long particularly here a tocar like
there's<00:00:52.970> just<00:00:53.150> this<00:00:53.300> long<00:00:53.629> long<00:00:53.960> long<00:00:54.199> long

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
there's just this long long long long

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.579 
there's just this long long long long
period<00:00:55.640> of<00:00:55.729> time<00:00:55.839> but<00:00:56.839> you're<00:00:57.019> already<00:00:57.170> going

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
period of time but you're already going

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.229 
period of time but you're already going
through<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.949> motion<00:00:58.339> how<00:00:58.519> you<00:00:58.580> got<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:58.940> stop

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
through the motion how you got to stop

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.549 
through the motion how you got to stop
you're<00:00:59.479> looking<00:00:59.780> ahead<00:00:59.900> you're<00:01:00.290> trying<00:01:00.500> to

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
you're looking ahead you're trying to

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.439 
you're looking ahead you're trying to
see<00:01:00.739> whether<00:01:00.949> or<00:01:01.070> not<00:01:01.220> there's<00:01:01.370> any<00:01:01.670> cars<00:01:02.059> just

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
see whether or not there's any cars just

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.689 
see whether or not there's any cars just
just<00:01:03.170> right<00:01:03.530> where<00:01:03.710> your<00:01:03.860> pity<00:01:04.129> is<00:01:04.220> because<00:01:04.580> it

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
just right where your pity is because it

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.480 
just right where your pity is because it
makes<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:04.940> much<00:01:05.030> more<00:01:05.210> difficult<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.720> come<00:01:05.960> in

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
makes it much more difficult to come in

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.399 
makes it much more difficult to come in
sometimes<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:07.610> have<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.360> know<00:01:08.479> sort<00:01:09.260> of

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
sometimes you have to you know sort of

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.649 
sometimes you have to you know sort of
really<00:01:09.770> really<00:01:10.100> adjust<00:01:10.460> yourself<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.450> not

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
really really adjust yourself and not

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.300 
really really adjust yourself and not
get<00:01:11.930> climbing<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.440> right<00:01:12.650> position<00:01:13.159> but

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
get climbing the right position but

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.960 
get climbing the right position but
enough

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
enough

to<00:02:10.440> start<00:02:10.920> turning<00:02:11.340> over<00:02:11.460> so<00:02:11.850> as<00:02:12.030> soon<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.450> we

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
to start turning over so as soon as we

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.870 
to start turning over so as soon as we
touch<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.990> ground<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.740> car<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.250> already

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
touch the ground the car is already

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.250 
touch the ground the car is already
started<00:02:15.540> cool<00:02:16.470> drop<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> spot<00:02:17.930> will<00:02:18.930> spin

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
started cool drop the spot will spin

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.040 
started cool drop the spot will spin
coming<00:02:19.680> out<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:21.090> know<00:02:21.210> obviously<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
coming out and you know obviously it's a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.960 
coming out and you know obviously it's a
crucial<00:02:22.470> time<00:02:22.920> beginning<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.700> our<00:02:23.790> low

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
crucial time beginning in and our low

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.900 
crucial time beginning in and our low
spin<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.510> quickly<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:26.310> know<00:02:26.430> luckily

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
spin so quickly but you know luckily

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
spin so quickly but you know luckily
we're<00:02:27.180> right<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.690> exit<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.620> just

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
we're right on the exit so we can just

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.740 
we're right on the exit so we can just
release<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.790> pit<00:02:29.970> lane<00:02:30.120> limit<00:02:30.450> really

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
release the the pit lane limit really

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.900 
release the the pit lane limit really
really<00:02:31.170> quickly<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.709> fire<00:02:32.310> around<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.670> pits

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
really quickly and fire around the pits

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.600 
really quickly and fire around the pits
so<00:02:33.390> that's<00:02:33.600> that's<00:02:34.470> that's<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.160> action<00:02:35.490> all

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so that's that's that's just action all

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.880 
so that's that's that's just action all
the<00:02:35.700> time
