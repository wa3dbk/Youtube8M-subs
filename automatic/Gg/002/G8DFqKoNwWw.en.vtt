00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 of a kitten in a very easy way tÃ¡ 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.920
 most people have difficulty 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 to finish kitty I brought a 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.160
 very easy technique to solve the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.750

 I really hope you like it. 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.820
 Come on, I've lost my hair to be able to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.550
 Record right for you and now I'm going 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.980
 speak the basic and essential trick when 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.270
 the perfect outline that is people use 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.149
 a durex tape 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 It is very easy to teach you how to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.559
 right position with eyeliner stay 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.079
 perfect, then you can take this 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.940
 You must be as cool as you can. 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.829
 take a little piece of the size you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.829
 I want to go and change a lady 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.510
 you can paste and peel paste and 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.160
 take off only to lose that cup to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.930
 not hurt your skin, I was 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.750
 that his tail not to be so 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.200
 strong are you going in your eye 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.360
 You won the eye at the height of the line. 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.630
 that people are seeing here has 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.580
 our eye the continuity of it that has 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.220
 that being a trigger is then here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.090
 Are you here sir? 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.720
 its continuity has to be where the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.930
 Edinho will stay in the table then you 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.750
 chicao eye so a little hair type 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.750
 raise your eyebrow to paste 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.360
 and lap to not get any small screen 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.190
 accumulated table in a hair 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.910
 accumulated in a cumulative table 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.740
 you strip the eye glue again can 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:54.020
 get the eyeliner you want to have 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.040
 those in pen in gel pen and have 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.560
 the liquid 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.440
 I think in this technique or easier 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.300
 because when you delete 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.300
 Let's remove the ribbon that will come out. 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.010
 is blurred but goes according to each one 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.330
 The designer's day is the one that is a 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.580
 There is a little cream on the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.090
 people often have a lot of affinity with 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.860
 He is usually the preferred is to be 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.860
 more easily applied 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.170
 is a gel that made a more precise brush 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.900
 but it's a little easier 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.730
 more technical hurry wants you to do 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.860
 a click than the liquid gets super 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:37.670
 cool if the liquid dna will follow 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:40.670
 make a dash following the tape is okay 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:49.790
 then you can close the eye with outline 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:52.210
 normal not even after you did 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.890
 it's just you close here 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.890
 from here until now 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.630
 you date 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.640
 your next stuffed dvd 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:32.260
 After you've done this, only you take 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:38.100
 during and is 1-1 before our 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.100
 chains on the video channel
