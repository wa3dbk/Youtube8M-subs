00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.240
 this hashtag expose what I can and my 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.570
 challenge today is to put together a puzzle 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.570
 this one comes 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.050
 able to be a puzzle champion 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.630
 this part of me would be 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.210
 the leg 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.279
 and you screw up 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.059
 I got the most boring task 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.750
 tell them there are car people buttons 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:37.520
 people who washed cars 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.520
 they told me about heads 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.789
 of grandparents and children 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.579
 yes 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.900
 this is an edge 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.090
 first to the edges first chords 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.280
 separated 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.710
 and there the edge is armed all the frame and 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.710
 there you are arming for inside is much more 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.509
 with a lot 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.230
 i 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.820
 on horse they go much better we 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.510
 understanding that there is the top edge 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.530
 the head of the mother father laughed 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.530
 we keep putting together nothing 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590
 part points 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.710
 a few hours ago we are here a little 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.170
 not between our 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.170
 with functions 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.730
 is done all the edge the middle 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.180
 pretty good so much almost faces loose 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.780
 but this sector more than seeing what 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.780
 complicated 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.230
 but he's already wanting to know what 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.790
 it's the last sleep they passed 24 then 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.220
 a while and I keep arming see what's going 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.850
 pretty good but it's still missing so 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 before 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.010
 the 70 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.830
 so so so 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.360
 and if I do not put some action here 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.320
 a little pony with his mother and here 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.900

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.140
 his mother and the layoffs with this picture 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.580
