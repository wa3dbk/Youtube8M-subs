field test face in last six months this

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.520 
field test face in last six months this
is<00:00:33.640> a<00:00:33.670> great<00:00:34.090> experience<00:00:34.600> for<00:00:35.079> me

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
is a great experience for me

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.570 
is a great experience for me
I<00:00:36.480> suppose<00:00:37.480> this<00:00:37.900> numeracy<00:00:38.680> helped<00:00:39.040> us<00:00:39.250> to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
I suppose this numeracy helped us to

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.900 
I suppose this numeracy helped us to
make<00:00:39.750> great<00:00:40.750> coffee<00:00:41.580> consistently<00:00:42.580> in<00:00:42.880> the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
make great coffee consistently in the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.540 
make great coffee consistently in the
cafe<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.860> I<00:00:45.010> work<00:00:45.340> I<00:00:45.700> have<00:00:46.270> some<00:00:46.570> concrete

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
cafe when I work I have some concrete

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.030 
cafe when I work I have some concrete
for<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.580> surety<00:00:49.330> of<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.540> cup<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:50.170> wanna<00:00:50.590> scare

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
for the surety of the cup I wanna scare

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.319 
for the surety of the cup I wanna scare
everything<00:00:51.760> but<00:00:52.600> also<00:00:53.050> I<00:00:53.620> wanna<00:00:53.950> make<00:00:54.329> coffee

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
everything but also I wanna make coffee

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.430 
everything but also I wanna make coffee
more<00:00:55.720> quickly<00:00:56.110> and<00:00:56.620> Savoie<00:00:57.550> fact<00:00:58.440> actually

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
more quickly and Savoie fact actually

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.390 
more quickly and Savoie fact actually
business<00:00:59.710> in<00:01:00.160> solvent<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:01.060> concrete<00:01:02.220> but<00:01:03.220> I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
business in solvent is concrete but I

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.300 
business in solvent is concrete but I
realized<00:01:04.239> is<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.570> this<00:01:05.439> machine<00:01:05.799> can

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
realized is that this machine can

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.880 
realized is that this machine can
control<00:01:06.960> extraction<00:01:07.960> easily<00:01:08.560> by<00:01:08.859> using

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
control extraction easily by using

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.499 
control extraction easily by using
graphene<00:01:09.789> matrix<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:11.560> system<00:01:12.219> help<00:01:12.640> us<00:01:13.179> to

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
graphene matrix this system help us to

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.580 
graphene matrix this system help us to
understand<00:01:14.259> extraction<00:01:15.159> with<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> copy<00:01:15.640> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
understand extraction with a copy I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.830 
understand extraction with a copy I
suppose<00:01:17.590> most<00:01:17.950> important<00:01:18.789> things<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.509> his
