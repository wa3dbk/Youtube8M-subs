of the car

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480 
of the car
I<00:01:44.930> just<00:01:45.930> left<00:01:46.200> mine<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.829> car<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.369> going

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
I just left mine on the car so I'm going

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.980 
I just left mine on the car so I'm going
to<00:01:47.579> take<00:01:47.729> these<00:01:47.939> off<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.630> use<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to take these off and just use the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.710 
to take these off and just use the
existing<00:01:49.229> ones<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.950> place<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.720> then

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
existing ones that are in place and then

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.270 
existing ones that are in place and then
the<00:01:51.750> reason<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.229> has<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> bag<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the reason this has got a bag on it is

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
the reason this has got a bag on it is
because<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.700> already<00:01:54.090> got<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.509> anti-seize

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
because it's already got the anti-seize

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.130 
because it's already got the anti-seize
lubricant<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:57.299> you're<00:01:57.509> supposed<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> put

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
lubricant that you're supposed to put

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
grommet back in place the rubber grommet

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.309 
grommet back in place the rubber grommet
through<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> hole

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
through the hole

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.039 
through the hole
floorboard<00:02:12.739> yeah<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:14.359> plugs<00:02:14.599> right<00:02:14.749> back

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
floorboard yeah it just plugs right back

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.089 
floorboard yeah it just plugs right back
in<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:15.439> and<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.620> see<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:15.859> little<00:02:16.010> green

in there and you see the little green

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.539 
in there and you see the little green
piece<00:02:16.579> there<00:02:17.170> how<00:02:18.170> does<00:02:18.439> the<00:02:18.590> piece<00:02:18.829> that<00:02:19.189> just

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
piece there how does the piece that just

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.789 
piece there how does the piece that just
needs<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.510> shove<00:02:20.749> back<00:02:20.959> into<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.379> hole<00:02:23.799> we

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
needs to shove back into the hole we

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.199 
needs to shove back into the hole we
should<00:02:25.010> be<00:02:25.129> we<00:02:25.340> put<00:02:25.549> that<00:02:25.670> right<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:26.120> there

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
should be we put that right in there

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.899 
should be we put that right in there
and<00:02:29.209> you're<00:02:29.329> done

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909

and you're done
I'm<00:02:31.909> going<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:32.239> ahead<00:02:32.389> and<00:02:32.659> roll<00:02:33.319> the

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
I'm going to go ahead and roll the

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.949 
I'm going to go ahead and roll the
carpet<00:02:33.709> back<00:02:34.040> right<00:02:34.370> here<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.629> it's<00:02:35.750> pretty

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
carpet back right here so it's pretty

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.809 
carpet back right here so it's pretty
simple<00:02:36.439> I'm<00:02:36.769> just<00:02:36.829> going<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.159> rotate<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.670> right

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
simple I'm just going to rotate it right

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.319 
simple I'm just going to rotate it right
back<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.400> can<00:02:43.609> see<00:02:43.819> how<00:02:43.939> that<00:02:44.120> matches

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
back in so you can see how that matches

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.990 
back in so you can see how that matches
up<00:02:44.569> now<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.769> then<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.219> little<00:02:46.430> piece<00:02:46.579> right

here that's the bracket that I took off
last<00:02:49.519> time<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.189> just<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:53.510> step<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:53.930> a

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
last time and that is just for step in a

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.789 
last time and that is just for step in a
little<00:02:54.290> bit<00:02:54.409> so<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.680> work<00:02:54.949> with<00:02:55.189> it<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:56.799> just

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
little bit so I can work with it I just

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
pulled the fuse for the radio that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.530 
pulled the fuse for the radio that
because<00:03:10.129> I<00:03:10.250> thought<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.609> would<00:03:10.730> be<00:03:10.760> assigned

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
because I thought that would be assigned

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.390 
because I thought that would be assigned
to<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.319> clock<00:03:12.560> which<00:03:12.829> is<00:03:12.859> what<00:03:13.159> some<00:03:13.340> of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
to the the clock which is what some of

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.819 
to the the clock which is what some of
the<00:03:13.519> notes<00:03:13.699> I<00:03:13.849> saw<00:03:14.060> said<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.569> do<00:03:14.719> that<00:03:15.469> didn't

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
the notes I saw said to do that didn't

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.879 
the notes I saw said to do that didn't
work<00:03:16.069> so<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.459> just<00:03:16.669> unplugged<00:03:17.419> the<00:03:17.750> battery<00:03:18.139> for

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
work so I just unplugged the battery for

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.610 
work so I just unplugged the battery for
about<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.069> minute<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.780> lights<00:03:23.989> gone

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
about a minute and the lights gone

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.539 
about a minute and the lights gone
it's<00:03:25.609> reset<00:03:26.030> itself<00:03:26.359> so<00:03:27.159> it<00:03:28.159> looks<00:03:28.459> like

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
it's reset itself so it looks like

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.460 
it's reset itself so it looks like
that's<00:03:28.790> all<00:03:29.000> there<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.479> it<00:03:29.659> this<00:03:30.199> should

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
that's all there is to it this should

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.800 
that's all there is to it this should
take<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.979> uh<00:03:31.009> between<00:03:31.939> 30<00:03:32.239> minutes<00:03:32.329> an<00:03:32.659> hour

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
take you uh between 30 minutes an hour

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.929 
take you uh between 30 minutes an hour
depending<00:03:33.139> on<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.919> how<00:03:34.099> quickly<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.549> can<00:03:34.790> go

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
depending on on how quickly you can go

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.999 
depending on on how quickly you can go
with<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.229> but<00:03:36.229> you<00:03:36.349> know<00:03:36.439> where<00:03:36.590> all<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.769> parts

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:37.009 
with it but you know where all the parts

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.870 
with it but you know where all the parts
and<00:03:37.159> pieces<00:03:37.280> are<00:03:37.579> now<00:03:37.729> from<00:03:37.909> this<00:03:38.120> good<00:03:38.720> luck
