00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
to find the spot where we can cut a hole

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.260 
to find the spot where we can cut a hole
to<00:01:25.079> get<00:01:25.259> access<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.280> decide<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
to get access to it so I decide to do it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.929 
to get access to it so I decide to do it
on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> back<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:29.250> make<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> easier<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
on the back that make it easier with a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.770 
on the back that make it easier with a
dremel<00:01:30.420> tool<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.890> cutting<00:01:32.189> bit<00:01:32.600> that'd<00:01:33.600> be

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
dremel tool and a cutting bit that'd be

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.859 
dremel tool and a cutting bit that'd be
easy<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.350> way<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.680> cut<00:01:35.180> they<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.390> piss<00:01:36.630> off

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
easy is way to cut they have to piss off

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.609 
easy is way to cut they have to piss off
now<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.770> work<00:01:37.979> inside<00:01:39.290> there<00:01:40.290> mark

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
now you can work inside there mark

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
now you can work inside there mark
everything<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.520> designing<00:01:42.390> what

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
everything pretty much designing what

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.870 
everything pretty much designing what
you<00:01:42.689> want<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> once<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.040> got<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.189> your<00:01:47.430> marks

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
you want so once you got all your marks

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.819 
you want so once you got all your marks
you<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> start<00:01:48.840> drilling<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.380> careful

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
you have to start drilling be careful

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.310 
you have to start drilling be careful
because<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.430> Racine<00:01:51.270> made<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.750> called<00:01:51.960> break

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
because the Racine made is called break

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.730 
because the Racine made is called break
easily<00:01:52.649> so

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.490 

then<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> present<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.420> part<00:02:00.720> just

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
then you have to present the part just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
then you have to present the part just
to<00:02:01.680> make<00:02:01.860> sure<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.310> fit<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.000> poll<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to make sure they fit the poll have to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
to make sure they fit the poll have to
be<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> slightly<00:02:03.990> bigger<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.460> any

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
be a slightly bigger so you have any

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.199 
be a slightly bigger so you have any
problems<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:07.399> we<00:02:08.399> decide<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.910> put<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
problems then we decide to put the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.639 
problems then we decide to put the
switch<00:02:09.539> right<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> forehead<00:02:10.350> on<00:02:10.619> the

switch right on the forehead on the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.360 
switch right on the forehead on the
skull<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.630> then<00:02:16.020> with<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> dremel<00:02:16.890> tool<00:02:17.130> and

the cutout bead you have to make the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.559 
the cutout bead you have to make the
hole<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> little<00:02:19.980> bigger<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.450> be

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
hole a little bigger you just got to be

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.590 
hole a little bigger you just got to be
really<00:02:21.930> precise<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.739> fit<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.610> switch

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
really precise so you fit the switch

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.800 
really precise so you fit the switch
perfectly<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.239> fuse<00:02:27.450> holder

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
perfectly and then for the fuse holder

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.330 
perfectly and then for the fuse holder
you<00:02:27.930> do<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> same<00:02:28.410> thing<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.280> make

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
you do the same thing you have to make

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.880 
you do the same thing you have to make
sure<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.510> rotate<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.319> has<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> little

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
sure that a one rotate it has a little

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.580 
sure that a one rotate it has a little
flat<00:02:32.400> side<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.989> pull<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.410> on

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
flat side of it so when you pull it on

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.860 
flat side of it so when you pull it on
and<00:02:34.620> off<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.190> fuse<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.730> better<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.690> for

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
and off the fuse it be better and for

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.320 
and off the fuse it be better and for
the<00:02:36.989> record<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:38.069> can<00:02:38.280> use<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> no<00:02:38.730> computer

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
the record you can use a no computer

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.360 
the record you can use a no computer

cord or any kind of an electric device
you<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.900> key<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.459> I'm<00:02:44.459> going

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
you know and you key is that I'm going

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.790 
you know and you key is that I'm going
to<00:02:44.970> move<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.360> shape<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.200> ground<00:02:46.440> man<00:02:46.590> has

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
to move the shape and the ground man has

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.030 
to move the shape and the ground man has
to<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.330> perfectly<00:02:48.330> sized<00:02:48.720> hole<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.950> it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
to be there perfectly sized hole so it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.820 
to be there perfectly sized hole so it
will<00:02:50.220> be<00:02:50.430> tied<00:02:51.110> when<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.230> put<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.530> cord

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
will be tied when you put the cord

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.620 
will be tied when you put the cord
because<00:02:53.310> they<00:02:53.459> otherwise<00:02:53.880> when<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.209> pull<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
because they otherwise when you pull the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.750 
because they otherwise when you pull the
cord<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.019> going<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.350> kind<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.650> difficult<00:02:55.890> it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
cord is going to be kind of difficult it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.930 
cord is going to be kind of difficult it
will<00:02:56.940> come<00:02:57.269> off<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.720> walk<00:02:57.870> shorter<00:02:58.940> so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
will come off and you walk shorter so

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.060 
will come off and you walk shorter so
you<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.150> all<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.390> holes<00:03:00.660> pretty<00:03:00.959> much<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> pre

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
you got all the holes pretty much a pre

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
you got all the holes pretty much a pre
drilled<00:03:02.489> before<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:05.310> make<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.640> easier<00:03:06.030> on

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
drilled before that make it easier on

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.210 
drilled before that make it easier on
you<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.510> install<00:03:06.900> everything<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you to install everything and then the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.900 
you to install everything and then the
real<00:03:08.370> cell<00:03:08.670> will<00:03:08.850> be<00:03:09.030> on<00:03:09.150> top<00:03:10.640> they<00:03:11.640> always

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
real cell will be on top they always

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.199 
real cell will be on top they always
start<00:03:12.150> from<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.450> farther<00:03:12.870> part<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:14.209> hole

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
start from the farther part of the hole

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.970 
start from the farther part of the hole
because<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.900> will<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.500> don't<00:03:16.650> have<00:03:16.769> much

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
because that will you don't have much

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.069 
because that will you don't have much
taxes<00:03:17.579> with<00:03:17.730> your<00:03:17.880> hands<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.390> every<00:03:18.630> wire<00:03:18.840> you

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
taxes with your hands and every wire you

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.740 
taxes with your hands and every wire you
have<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.410> peel<00:03:19.880> for<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> transformer<00:03:21.630> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
have to peel for the transformer and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.780 
have to peel for the transformer and
everything<00:03:22.290> maybe<00:03:22.530> bending<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.160> bottom<00:03:23.519> of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
everything maybe bending the bottom of

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.000 
everything maybe bending the bottom of
the<00:03:23.910> transformer<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.780> fit<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.140> round<00:03:25.410> surface

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
the transformer to fit the round surface

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.970 
the transformer to fit the round surface
of<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> skull<00:03:26.670> inside<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.350> pretty<00:03:28.709> deal

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
of the skull inside so you pretty deal

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.620 
of the skull inside so you pretty deal
the<00:03:29.160> poles

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.319 

let<00:03:33.630> me<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:33.959> proceed<00:03:34.410> on<00:03:34.970> using<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.120> vault

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
let me just proceed on using the vault

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.180 
let me just proceed on using the vault
enough<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.049> put<00:03:37.560> them<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.799> place<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.950> for

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
enough to put them in place and then for

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.099 
enough to put them in place and then for
the<00:03:41.280> messy<00:03:41.489> stuff<00:03:41.880> when<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.780> wouldn't

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
the messy stuff when you you wouldn't

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.110 
the messy stuff when you you wouldn't
need<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.230> small<00:03:43.590> vacuum<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> get

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
need a small vacuum and this is a get

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.650 
need a small vacuum and this is a get
really<00:03:45.510> messy<00:03:46.190> machine<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.400> white<00:03:48.060> dust<00:03:48.420> it

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
really messy machine is white dust it

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.569 
really messy machine is white dust it
was<00:03:48.810> everywhere<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:49.769> good<00:03:49.920> idea<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.430> keep

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
was everywhere so it's good idea to keep

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.330 
was everywhere so it's good idea to keep
cleaning<00:03:50.940> after<00:03:51.180> drilling<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.920> then<00:03:53.040> for<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
cleaning after drilling and then for the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.979 
cleaning after drilling and then for the
poor<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.790> can<00:03:53.970> always<00:03:54.120> feel<00:03:54.420> part<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.959> just

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
poor you can always feel part of it just

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.259 
poor you can always feel part of it just
not<00:03:55.769> laying<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:57.049> solder<00:03:58.049> those<00:03:58.350> tapes<00:03:58.650> inside

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
not laying to solder those tapes inside

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.880 
not laying to solder those tapes inside
you<00:04:00.269> always<00:04:00.540> remember<00:04:00.810> put<00:04:01.170> soldering<00:04:01.560> on<00:04:01.769> the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
you always remember put soldering on the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.490 
you always remember put soldering on the
tapes<00:04:02.190> before<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.880> put

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
tapes before you put

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.500 
tapes before you put
and<00:04:03.590> then<00:04:04.310> sometimes<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.030> find<00:04:05.360> little

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
and then sometimes you find little

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.760 
and then sometimes you find little
thicknesses<00:04:06.320> inside<00:04:06.830> when<00:04:07.100> they<00:04:07.250> put<00:04:07.550> the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
thicknesses inside when they put the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.410 
thicknesses inside when they put the
machine<00:04:09.770> on<00:04:09.800> doses<00:04:10.370> cause<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:11.240> need<00:04:11.390> a

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
machine on doses cause you need a

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.590 
machine on doses cause you need a
grinding<00:04:11.960> stone<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.590> clean<00:04:13.310> out<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.670> walls<00:04:13.940> so

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
grinding stone to clean out the walls so

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.750 
grinding stone to clean out the walls so
you<00:04:14.630> can<00:04:14.780> see<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.290> knots<00:04:15.560> on<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.890> floods<00:04:16.430> and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
you can see the knots on the floods and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.199
