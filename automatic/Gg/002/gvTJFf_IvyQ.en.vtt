play<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:12.720> than<00:01:13.439> anything<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.990> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
play with more than anything is the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
play with more than anything is the
sliding<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:16.890> forth<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:20.330> this<00:01:21.330> part

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
sliding back and forth and the this part

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.109 
sliding back and forth and the this part
here<00:01:21.900> sliding<00:01:22.350> side<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> side<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.090> see

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
here sliding side to side you can see

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999 
here sliding side to side you can see
how<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> bottom<00:01:24.900> plate<00:01:25.080> slide<00:01:25.409> side<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> side

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
how that bottom plate slide side to side

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.310 
how that bottom plate slide side to side
and<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:26.400> your<00:01:27.119> other<00:01:27.240> plate<00:01:27.600> slides<00:01:28.049> back

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and then your other plate slides back

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.640 
and then your other plate slides back
and<00:01:28.350> forth<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.689> that's<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.960> usually<00:01:31.439> try<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and forth so that's I usually try to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.249 
and forth so that's I usually try to
play<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.400> most<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.079> thing

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
play with that the most the one thing

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.740 
play with that the most the one thing
that<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.439> did<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.780> really<00:01:36.780> helps<00:01:37.140> out<00:01:37.320> is

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
that I did do that really helps out is

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.670 
that I did do that really helps out is
my<00:01:39.750> quick<00:01:39.990> release<00:01:40.290> plate<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:42.140> found<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.560> i

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
my quick release plate I found that if i

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920 
my quick release plate I found that if i
have<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.159> quick<00:01:44.460> release<00:01:44.729> plate<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:45.509> my

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
have a quick release plate on my

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.510 
have a quick release plate on my
glidecam<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> won't<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:49.460> try<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
glidecam I won't have to try to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.800 
glidecam I won't have to try to
rebalance<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.119> every<00:01:51.299> time<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.479> take<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
rebalance it every time I take the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.569 
rebalance it every time I take the
camera<00:01:52.079> off<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> shoot<00:01:53.250> or

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
camera off so if I want to shoot or

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730 
camera off so if I want to shoot or
something<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.990> snap<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.530> in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
something you know I can just snap it in

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.030 
something you know I can just snap it in
place<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.689> stuck<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> quick<00:01:58.740> release<00:01:58.890> plate

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
place so I stuck the quick release plate

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.120 
place so I stuck the quick release plate
on<00:01:59.399> and<00:02:00.409> balanced<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.890> just

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
on and balanced it from there I just

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.770 
on and balanced it from there I just
stuck<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.549> far<00:02:02.759> back<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.210> could<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.659> my

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
stuck it as far back as I could so my

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.530 
stuck it as far back as I could so my
lens<00:02:04.020> wouldn't<00:02:04.380> hang<00:02:04.530> off<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.680> edge

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.150 

so<00:02:08.540> that's<00:02:08.960> kind<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.200> how<00:02:09.290> my<00:02:09.440> lens<00:02:09.680> fits<00:02:09.979> on

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
so that's kind of how my lens fits on

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.390 
so that's kind of how my lens fits on
that's<00:02:10.430> my<00:02:10.670> 18<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.510> 1<00:02:11.630> 35<00:02:12.020> millimeter<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.310> I'm

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's my 18 to 1 35 millimeter so I'm

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.560 
that's my 18 to 1 35 millimeter so I'm
going<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.790> work<00:02:14.060> with<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.450> little

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
going to have to work with it a little

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.650 
going to have to work with it a little
bit<00:02:14.720> more<00:02:14.900> with<00:02:15.200> like<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> 50<00:02:15.920> millimeter<00:02:16.070> crime

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
bit more with like a 50 millimeter crime

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.010 
bit more with like a 50 millimeter crime
but<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.850> kind<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.090> works<00:02:20.270> for<00:02:20.480> me<00:02:20.570> like<00:02:20.780> I'm

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
but that kind of works for me like I'm

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.840 
but that kind of works for me like I'm
going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.200> shoot<00:02:21.410> like<00:02:21.710> an<00:02:21.860> event<00:02:22.190> her<00:02:22.370> concert

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
going to shoot like an event her concert

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.730 
going to shoot like an event her concert
or<00:02:22.970> something<00:02:23.090> that's<00:02:23.450> that's<00:02:24.290> usually<00:02:24.620> how

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
or something that's that's usually how

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.000 
or something that's that's usually how
I'll<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.040> leave<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.220> like<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.870> now<00:02:27.010> you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
I'll just leave it like that now you

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.380 
I'll just leave it like that now you
have<00:02:28.160> some<00:02:28.370> people<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.760> say<00:02:29.000> there's<00:02:29.210> like<00:02:29.270> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
have some people that say there's like a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.820 
have some people that say there's like a
one<00:02:29.660> second<00:02:30.140> or<00:02:30.260> two<00:02:30.410> second<00:02:30.910> drop<00:02:31.910> rule<00:02:32.830> on

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
one second or two second drop rule on

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.450 
one second or two second drop rule on
your<00:02:34.130> glad<00:02:34.340> cam<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.060> needs<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:36.530> drop<00:02:37.220> a

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
your glad cam so it needs to to drop a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.030 
your glad cam so it needs to to drop a
certain<00:02:37.970> amount<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.480> time<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.990> just<00:02:39.290> rebalance

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
certain amount of time I just rebalance

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.030 
certain amount of time I just rebalance
mine<00:02:40.250> in<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.760> does<00:02:41.090> have<00:02:41.330> kind<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:42.040> drop

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
mine in it it does have kind of a drop

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.220 
mine in it it does have kind of a drop
rule<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.240> takes<00:02:44.420> about<00:02:44.570> two<00:02:44.870> seconds

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
rule to it so it takes about two seconds

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.350 
rule to it so it takes about two seconds
for<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.560> drop<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.790> get<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.090> right<00:02:47.330> I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
for it to drop and to get that right I

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.540 
for it to drop and to get that right I
just<00:02:47.510> adjusted<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> height<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:50.000> and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
just adjusted the height of this and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.070 
just adjusted the height of this and
move<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.850> camera<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.840> little<00:02:53.960> bit

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
move the camera for just a little bit

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.020 
move the camera for just a little bit
and<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:56.390> increased<00:02:56.840> my<00:02:56.960> drop<00:02:57.260> time<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.030> it's

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
and that increased my drop time so it's

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.850 
and that increased my drop time so it's
pretty<00:02:59.240> balanced<00:02:59.780> hold<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.560> with<00:03:00.680> one<00:03:00.710> hand

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
pretty balanced hold it with one hand

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.780 
pretty balanced hold it with one hand
now<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.900> can<00:03:03.020> see<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.470> kind<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:04.450> turns<00:03:06.790> you

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
now and you can see it kind of turns you

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.510 
now and you can see it kind of turns you
know<00:03:07.940> that's<00:03:09.340> me<00:03:10.340> form<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.190> mean

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
know that's me form in it so I mean

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.340 
know that's me form in it so I mean
everybody's<00:03:13.940> setups<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.110> be<00:03:15.170> different

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
everybody's setups going to be different

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.620 
everybody's setups going to be different
like<00:03:15.709> i<00:03:15.800> said<00:03:15.860> i<00:03:16.010> have<00:03:16.190> my<00:03:16.459> microphone<00:03:17.270> on<00:03:17.480> it

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
like i said i have my microphone on it

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.430 
like i said i have my microphone on it
and<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:20.300> know<00:03:20.420> really<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:21.110> play<00:03:21.320> around

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
and you know really just play around

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.270 
and you know really just play around
with<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.890> plate<00:03:22.130> get<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:24.130> quick<00:03:25.130> release

with the plate get you a quick release

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.210 
with the plate get you a quick release
plate<00:03:25.459> that's<00:03:26.000> going<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.270> help<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.600> lot<00:03:26.840> so

plate that's going to help you a lot so
you<00:03:28.220> know<00:03:28.340> your<00:03:28.489> camera<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.790> going<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.000> be<00:03:29.060> in

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
you know your camera is going to be in

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.479 
you know your camera is going to be in
the<00:03:29.209> same<00:03:29.360> spot<00:03:29.540> every<00:03:29.690> time<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.320> then<00:03:30.980> play

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
the same spot every time and then play

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.830 
the same spot every time and then play
around<00:03:31.700> with<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.000> slide<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.360> forward<00:03:32.780> and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
around with this slide and forward and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.960 
around with this slide and forward and
back<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.370> find<00:03:34.370> your<00:03:34.550> center<00:03:34.850> of<00:03:34.880> gravity

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
back and find your center of gravity

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.330 
back and find your center of gravity
with<00:03:35.450> your<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.560> plate<00:03:36.800> down<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.250> on

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
with your with the plate down here on

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.390 
with your with the plate down here on
the<00:03:37.370> bottom<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.290> can<00:03:39.500> slide<00:03:39.769> side<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.100> side

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
the bottom so you can slide side to side

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.640 
the bottom so you can slide side to side
and<00:03:40.760> get<00:03:40.970> your<00:03:41.120> camera<00:03:41.420> centered<00:03:41.780> you'll

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
and get your camera centered you'll

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.810 
and get your camera centered you'll
notice<00:03:42.860> that<00:03:42.980> mind<00:03:43.340> sent<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.910> certain<00:03:45.820> it's

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
notice that mind sent it a certain it's

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.720 
notice that mind sent it a certain it's
about<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.150> center<00:03:47.390> not<00:03:47.780> exactly<00:03:48.230> sanara<00:03:48.769> it's

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
about the center not exactly sanara it's

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.680 
about the center not exactly sanara it's
about<00:03:49.790> good<00:03:50.690> enough

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
about good enough

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.890 
about good enough
and<00:03:51.810> then<00:03:52.850> play<00:03:53.850> around<00:03:54.090> with<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.390> height<00:03:54.570> you

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
and then play around with the height you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.410 
and then play around with the height you
know<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.920> higher<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.250> goes<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.700> think<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:57.150> less

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
know the higher it goes I think the less

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.000 
know the higher it goes I think the less
weight<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.990> can<00:03:58.140> have<00:03:58.320> on<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.560> bottom<00:03:58.860> and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
weight you can have on the bottom and

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.700 
weight you can have on the bottom and
then<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.910> can<00:04:00.060> move<00:04:00.180> these<00:04:00.360> forward<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:01.350> to

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
then you can move these forward to to

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.290 
then you can move these forward to to
increase<00:04:02.160> your<00:04:02.190> drop<00:04:02.520> your<00:04:03.000> drop<00:04:03.240> tom<00:04:03.450> and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
increase your drop your drop tom and

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.490 
increase your drop your drop tom and
like<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.390> said<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.630> also<00:04:06.840> depends<00:04:07.140> on<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.350> lens

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
like I said it also depends on the lens

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.400 
like I said it also depends on the lens
you<00:04:07.740> have<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:09.270> hope<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.810> helps<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.290> little

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
you have so I hope that helps a little
