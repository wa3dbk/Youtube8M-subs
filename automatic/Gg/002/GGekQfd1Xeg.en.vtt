00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.610
 Y 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.090
 it is estimated that the restaurants 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.770
 Spaniards throw on average three thousand euros 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.900
 in the trash for waste 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.100
 food more than 200 million 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.020
 losses for the sector of the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.430
 restoration to the year this has 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.560
 very great impacts on the environment 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 environment also on the accounts of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.630
 restaurant being an important source 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.849
 of costs however the reduction of a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.499
 50% of food waste is 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.270
 an achievable goal for most 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.910
 of the restaurants 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.040
 the first step to follow is to make a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.020
 good waste audit 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.670
 this step is essential to know 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.310
 how much food are we 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.230
 discarding the year and why once 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.060
 we have diagnosed in our source of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.640
 losses and for a reduction of 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.520
 efficient waste is essential and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.290
 include our three Rs reduce 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.290
 reuse and recycle 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.699
 for this first of all reduce 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.949
 complexity is fundamental a letter does not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.320
 too wide and well balanced 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.170
 has a great impact on the amount of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.970
 waste that we generate uses 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.190
 whenever possible the same 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.170
 key ingredients throughout the letter and 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.330
 Discard those dishes with lower 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 rotation and with ingredients and processes 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.520
 costly 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.890
 the second key is planning the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 60% of waste can be avoided 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.710
 with good planning equally 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.359
 it is important that you plan your 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.609
 purchases to acquire the minimum 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.409
 necessary quantities always use a 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.899
 main comparator and a list of 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 simple and effective shopping also you 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.890
 will help in planning the use 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.259
 seasonal ingredients and do not discard 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.359
 dry frozen products or 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.600
 bottled or canned by its high 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.600
 durability 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.220
 finally it is equally important 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.560
 minimize the waste of your 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.570
 preparation processes using 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.430
 culinary aids carrying out a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.040
 good production planning and 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.350
 through an optimal reuse of your 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.560
 you will be able to save up to one 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.530
 30% of the total food that is 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.100
 discarded for example we can reuse 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.230
 shrimp making croquettes with 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.410
 remaining sliced ​​fruits and you can 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.090
 use them to perform a few speak or 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.030
 fruit salad 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.980
 reducing the complexity of your letter if 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.540
 Improve your planning and reducing 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.480
 part of the waste during the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.550
 preparation will undoubtedly give 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.920
 boost your business by reducing one 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.269
 important part of its costs and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.269
 improving your environmental footprint
