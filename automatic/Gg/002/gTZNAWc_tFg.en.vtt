basically pretty much any food will be
picky<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.989> beginning<00:03:04.260> but<00:03:04.640> as<00:03:05.640> long<00:03:05.790> as

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
picky in the beginning but as long as

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.690 
picky in the beginning but as long as
you<00:03:05.970> train<00:03:06.209> them<00:03:06.330> though<00:03:06.540> they'll<00:03:06.840> take<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.170> so

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700
