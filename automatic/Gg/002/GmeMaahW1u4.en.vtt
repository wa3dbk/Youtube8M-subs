00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.000
 españa good the truth is that it is a 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.859
 very big opportunity that has given me the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.899
 chain and I'm doing what I most 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.489
 like in the world that motorcycles are already 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.449
 you know it because there has always been 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.729
 silver with the bikes and learning a lot 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.299
 We have 18 great prizes throughout 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:53.149
 all season and it shows that I'm going 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.190
 learning and taking confidence in each 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.319
 one of them so very happy good 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.730
 how is it to travel all over the 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:03.140
 world 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.650
 it's amazing and I love it is a pass 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.850
 I do not love I have very little time for 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.490
 be at home so it's true that 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.750
 then we have weeks that free for 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.210
 spent with family and friends 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.460
 which we all focus on because 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.320
 if we do not find it days but it's very 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.450
 pretty very intense and I'm lucky that 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.310
 I have a part of a story that is 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.720
 circuit flame a circuit that gives me 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.700
 the opportunity to get to know the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.619
 city ​​where I travel so for me it's 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.180
 Wonderful, I love it 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.910
 melissa you can see that you're fascinated by 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.830
 where it comes bikes that you love me 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.080
 comes from very small I was born in 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.850
 belgium in a super super biker village 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.280
 although there are a lot of fans are few 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.979
 pilots living in belgium and that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.450
 very few Belgian pilots running but 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.550
 my father was one of them before 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.440
 chanting the spa circuit and there was a lot 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.920
 passion biker and he wanted to transmit 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.509
 all this passion for my cousins ​​and 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.789
 me to my sister happens that my sister does not 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.740
 he was not hooked and I was 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.200
 small I live it as a passionate 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.390
 more like him since when you travel you travel 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.250
 with Dad 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.710
 if the truth is found by all 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.630
 great prizes we see little but yes 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.310
 that with my companion nico abad we say 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.450
 when we arrived at the paddock to the circuit 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.400
 let's say hello 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.380
 antonio jiménez because if we do not reach the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.080
 Sunday race day and I have not seen it 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.420
 still but if I can I'll see him 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.090
 if you had a blank check 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.670
 what bike would you buy 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.489
 Well, I think I'm not very supportive 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.830
 of motorcycles because especially on the road 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.680
 It gives me a little fear and respect but 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.849
 for me a beautiful motorcycle for a woman is 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.950
 the one that the ducati monster 696 in black me 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.890
 love imagine melissa up that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.739
 more bike for I prefer a Vespino for 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.180
 go formentera ibiza I liked it better 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.510
 if you had to take someone from 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.099
 package to a paradisiacal island that 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.290
 who would you take or what would you take 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.180
 Well look, my friend would undoubtedly take me 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.400
 rose the one that a long time ago 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 I see and I would have to spend the day 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.180
 on the beach talking talking 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.250
 with her and telling her a lot of things 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.540
 because the trips are wonderful but 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 you also have very little time for 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.269
 talk to your people so I would kidnap 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.849
 and I would be 24 hours talking to her is 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.890
 a great friend yes yes yes I love 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.750
 also that you have to take advantage of the time 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.360
 to be with the family because with 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.860
 this work because as I said there is 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.079
 little bit more than I am from Barcelona and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.700
 I live here in madrid now but 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.990
 good thing is that I can tell you I love 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.530
 my work 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:33.040
 how is the world going so well is not 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.890
 because this is the world that we 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.600
 that this equipment retransmits but the 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.400
 truth is a pass marc marquez has 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.110
 upgraded this year and see a 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.600
 20 year old boy who is beating 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.640
 all records 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.770
 incredible because if he is doing now 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.380
 what is this that is your first year that is 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.960
 his year of rookie we have many years left 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.750
 of good motorcycling and then they are already 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.520
 we have a pool of Spanish pilots 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.680
 that they are doing great and 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.650
 are the three categories very very 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.960
 exciting do not miss it there are many 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.520
 champions in Spanish motorcycles also in 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.350
 football also in basketball you think 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.120
 that maybe that has influenced that not 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.110
 that is, the Olympics 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.930
 that we have some envy 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.930
 good of envy personally in a 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.370
 motorcycling world I think 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.410
 Italians some envy have us 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.910
 because they are used to having 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.580
 Valentino Rossi and now we 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.440
 we are winning all everything and like you 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.270
 well you say then in soccer equal in tennis 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.240
 I do not think it's a matter of envy 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.289
 I think the image you have right now 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.790
 Spain 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:42.290
 outside d 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.290
 outside views of the world is very like you 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.000
 I would say very contaminated then I think 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:52.580
 that I know how things do 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.230
 Japanese how is the world open to 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.410
 what they can do and how they see us 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.760
 to us we are at this moment 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.160
 that's because I think it would be more 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.810
 harmful I am not or is it a pity 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.640
 that Spain can not have or that in 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.680
 madryn can not have the olympics 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.569
 but I also understand why it has 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.490
 chosen tokyo 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.830
 melissa account is not a dream 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.169
 professional that you have a dream already 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.969
 you are fulfilling clear is what you 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.550
 I am fulfilling now but yes it is 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.899
 truth that I am a person wanting to 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.289
 learn and do many things 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:25.819
 I obviously do not want to be 50 years old and 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.389
 keep presenting the bikes from pit 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.249
