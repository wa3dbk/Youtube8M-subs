00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350
BIG BIRD: Aw, Captain
Vegetable, it's

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.930
really not that bad.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.750
Listen, [SINGING]

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.820
I've a special secret children
ought to know.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.440
It's about the little mistakes
you make as you begin to grow.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.170
If you make a mistake, you
shouldn't start to cry.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.020
Mistakes are not so bad,
and here is why.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.810
Oh, everyone makes mistakes.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.740
Oh yes, they do.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.850
Your sister and your brother
and dad and mother, too.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.610
Big people, small people, matter
of fact, all people.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.095
Everyone makes mistakes,
so why can't you?

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:37.880
CAPTAIN VEGETABLE:
You're right.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.216
Tell me more about
this, Big Bird.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:40.570
BIG BIRD: [SINGING]

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.850
If you make a mistake while
counting up to 10, well, don't

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.880
get mad, and don't be sad, just
start to count again.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.470
And if you should only get to
eight or nine, I'm still your

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.456
friend, and I still
like you fine.

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:54.902
CAPTAIN VEGETABLE: Great.

00:00:54.902 --> 00:00:55.350
BIG BIRD: [SINGING]

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.070
'Cause everyone makes mistakes,
oh yes, they do.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.230
Your sister and your brother and
your dad and mother, too.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.890
Big people, small people, matter
of fact, all people,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.920
everyone makes mistakes,
so why can't you?

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.700
CAPTAIN VEGETABLE:
You hear that?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.910
Everybody does.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.130
Why not me?

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.560
BIG BIRD: [SINGING]

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.770
If you spill a glass of milk all
over the floor, well, your

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.700
mom and dad still
like you just as

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.000
much as they did before.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.260
'Cause when mother and dad were
just as small as you--

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.945
CAPTAIN VEGETABLE: As me?

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:28.555
BIG BIRD: I'll bet that they
knocked their milk over, too.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.465
CAPTAIN VEGETABLE: [LAUGHS]

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:29.750
BIG BIRD: [SINGING]

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.550
'Cause everyone makes mistakes,
oh yes, they do.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.310
Your sister and your brother and
your dad and mother, too.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.260
Big people, small people, matter
of fact, all people,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.320
everyone makes mistakes,
so why can't you?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.220
If everyone in the whole wide
world makes mistakes,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.800
then why can't you?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.940
CAPTAIN VEGETABLE: Well, you
know, my little friend?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.430
BIG BIRD: What?

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.160
CAPTAIN VEGETABLE: You know,
that was a very nice song.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.735
And it makes me feel
a lot better now.

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:06.800
And could you bend down
here for a minute?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.050
BIG BIRD: Well, sure.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.690
CAPTAIN VEGETABLE: Muah!

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.940
BIG BIRD: Oh, wow.
