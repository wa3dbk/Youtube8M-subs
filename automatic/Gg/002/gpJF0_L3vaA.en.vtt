players<00:01:34.990> views<00:01:35.990> in<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:37.789> process<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.749> making

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:39.139 
players views in the process of making

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:40.510 
players views in the process of making
it<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:39.380> if<00:01:39.649> they<00:01:39.799> don't<00:01:39.950> like<00:01:40.189> something

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
it and if they don't like something

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.819 
it and if they don't like something
they'll<00:01:41.090> they'll<00:01:41.899> go<00:01:42.079> away<00:01:42.139> and<00:01:42.409> change<00:01:42.649> it

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829
