one<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.979> basically<00:01:26.490> say<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
one you know basically say or to do a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
cup of the mix you would do a cup of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
cup of the mix you would do a cup of
water<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.630> ratio<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
water so it's one to one ratio but it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.530 
water so it's one to one ratio but it
tastes<00:01:32.250> awesome<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.850> honey<00:01:33.150> inside
