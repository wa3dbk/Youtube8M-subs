00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Nine people today I'll show you the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.670
 eskimo motto 'the act in the place too 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.670
 called 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:23.740
 First of all, this mod inserts so 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.240
 horny new bio and indeed this 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.580
 Tactics with him so somehow such a 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.980
 snow bio with lots of ice like you 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.140
 you can usually see a big one already 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.050
 berg and I think that looks right 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.480
 awesome and if you think so about it 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.010
 then you know why I fly that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.550
 I then find as you have already noticed 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.579
 this mod adds small huts in 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.670
 the eskimos live and these huts 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.640
 are from the inside so on the bed the stove one 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.370
 empty box unfortunately still and mostly 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.219
 another falls somewhere next to them 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.510
 redstone torch just as bug with me 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.370
 not because I've been around the world for so long 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.140
 have that that disappeared but 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.890
 if red john torch finds you should 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.240
 Do not be surprised 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.250
 and I think these are small huts 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.140
 but quite cool so small mini 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.900
 huts quite comfortable of them right 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.240
 small and live in this then the 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.310
 eskimos also here throughout this 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.650
 Plant Blumberg in this ice cream bio 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.510
 running around that are such will with it 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.510
 to the fur coat and I find that looks 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.730
 really cool from so small eskimos the 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.490
 then live in their huts and yes that 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.320
 first to the bio again to the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.350
 These are really great 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.670
 strong because they have 16 hearts and that 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.200
 is already living a bit so what is allowed 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.780
 Of course, an ice does not work 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.170
 the polar bears are missing exactly this 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.910
 out right somehow and will 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.440
 jordi have new hearts and life 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.730
 make a heart hurt for these 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.040
 aggressive if you are not in the 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.190
 creative not found you can 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.840
 easily kill not always quickly from the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.370
 then you can see creative motor 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.440
 that the batteries are and kill me 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.130
 want to make a heart and hurt 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.780
 then lose rob polar bear meet so 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.390
 raw polar bear meat so this meat 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.489
 brings a single hunger collins raw 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.769
 and cooked three to four clubs and 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.080
 we can do that now and 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.300
 what is that firewood where the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.670
 Perfect transition here the firewood 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.040
 forces you with a mix of sticks 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.200
 and with this fire wood you can get ten 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.750
 burn items and here it is 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.420
 still the coppola the rent and this 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.640
 You can also make fire wood into one 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.950
 fire place so celebration place so 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.440
 Campfire does not even work together 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.200
 with compost or in bars and 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.850
 then you get two pieces and 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.860
 These are actually and decorations 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.960
 block and you make light one now 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.760
 im so nee i have to see myself 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.470
 already stopped somewhere where no 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.770
 light is then we can again 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.020
 make fast and as you can see 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.970
 makes the light with this place you can 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.040
 even correct yourself as eskimo 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.250
 Feel because there is a furry armor 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.440
 These forces you from fur you 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.450
 unfortunately can not get because the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.880
 you would get fixed by snow after all 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.410
 these are just due to a bug 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.520
 not in the game but if you 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.920
 inside you can snow you 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.630
 kill foxes and then a fur armor 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.090
 to build 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.580
 then there's the ice and that too 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.950
 you break down but at the moment there is still 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.030
 a little bug everytime you do that 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.750
 degrades you get even more iron ore 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.550
 and usually you do not have to 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.920
 get more iron ore but mandl 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.260
 would have to get ice floes show 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.260
 I quickly go upstairs so normally 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.769
 dropman namely from the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.689
 as if these ice charts so ice 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.370
 shards and with them you can 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.000
 as tools forces as well as in 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.579
 normal tools makes a shovel 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.299
 pick everything but dingy out of one 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:05.079
 high and I'll show you that was fast 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:09.549
 so and these items have just that 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:12.040
 same are exactly the same as iron but 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.950
 So they actually hold 1000 blocks 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.180
 much stronger and if you can do that then 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.989
 if you really ice these 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.500
 dying then dropped out of the ice ore 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.780
 you can finally force these 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.750
 Then there is a decoration blog 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.680
 among the newsletter as well as stones labs 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.699
 So only half out of snow this 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.479
 unfortunately you can not over each other 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.180
 clap 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.130
 but I do not know how to do that 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.620
 it does not stand up for that and how you can do it 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.270
 normal semi-stages forces so strong 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.680
 So you do not have these with me 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.050
 That's why I still remember 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.000
 not how to get it and still 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.360
 All in all, this mod is right 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.970
 hot 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.120
 with these little eskimos with one 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.740
 Himself as eskimo and this polar bear 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.460
 these are really cool and so on 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.810
 and so on 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.050
 this time invariably invite you 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.880
 if then the ice of this 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.160
 iceberg that you get to him 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.990
 is gefixed then this mod is correct 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.050
 cool it is still a yeti hardly and what 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.510
 So I know this mod will be fine 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.039
 better is good and so on and so on 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.039
 have fun sports and show 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.280
 if
