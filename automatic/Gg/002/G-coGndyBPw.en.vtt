am<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:23.110> like<00:04:23.350> three<00:04:23.710> light<00:04:24.190> three<00:04:25.000> shades

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
am to like three light three shades

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.100 
am to like three light three shades
darker<00:04:25.949> because<00:04:26.949> of<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.370> Ox<00:04:27.550> is<00:04:27.760> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
darker because of the Ox is the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.020 
darker because of the Ox is the
oxidization<00:04:29.110> that's<00:04:30.100> perhaps<00:04:30.250> how<00:04:30.699> you<00:04:30.729> say

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
oxidization that's perhaps how you say

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.050 
oxidization that's perhaps how you say
yeah<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.410> exercises<00:04:32.860> like<00:04:33.130> crazy<00:04:33.520> on<00:04:33.639> me<00:04:33.850> and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
yeah it exercises like crazy on me and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.020 
yeah it exercises like crazy on me and
this<00:04:34.240> doesn't<00:04:34.540> I<00:04:34.900> don't<00:04:35.139> know<00:04:35.229> why<00:04:35.410> but<00:04:36.030> yeah

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
this doesn't I don't know why but yeah

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.879 
this doesn't I don't know why but yeah
this<00:04:37.600> is<00:04:37.780> like<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.930> little<00:04:38.169> bit<00:04:38.350> more<00:04:38.530> expensive

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
this is like a little bit more expensive

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.820 
this is like a little bit more expensive
than<00:04:39.490> thus<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.449> other<00:04:40.780> places<00:04:41.560> like<00:04:41.680> the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
than thus the other places like the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.469 
than thus the other places like the
cheapo<00:04:42.310> version<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.060> it's<00:04:43.750> natural<00:04:44.290> one<00:04:44.560> also

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
cheapo version and it's natural one also

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.090 
cheapo version and it's natural one also
this<00:04:46.479> is<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.720> only<00:04:46.840> shade<00:04:47.199> that<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.470> see<00:04:47.830> that

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
this is the only shade that I see that

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.510 
this is the only shade that I see that
it<00:04:48.699> comes<00:04:49.120> with<00:04:49.479> a<00:04:50.010> with<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.040> yellow<00:04:51.280> undertone

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
it comes with a with a yellow undertone

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.960 
it comes with a with a yellow undertone
to<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:53.410> it's<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.710> same<00:04:53.919> thing<00:04:53.950> except<00:04:54.760> for

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
to it so it's the same thing except for

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.150 
to it so it's the same thing except for
this<00:04:55.060> has<00:04:55.360> two<00:04:55.750> more<00:04:55.900> ramps<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.770> has<00:04:56.950> no

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
this has two more ramps and it has no

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.230 
this has two more ramps and it has no
mirror<00:04:58.110> look<00:04:59.250> it<00:05:00.250> has<00:05:00.280> no<00:05:00.580> merit<00:05:00.790> it<00:05:01.000> comes

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
mirror look it has no merit it comes

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.310 
mirror look it has no merit it comes
with<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.419> little<00:05:01.660> crappy<00:05:02.370> almost<00:05:03.370> a<00:05:04.320> fabric

with a little crappy almost a fabric

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.510 
with a little crappy almost a fabric
thingy<00:05:05.970> not<00:05:06.970> even<00:05:07.090> one<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.020> these<00:05:08.260> I<00:05:08.560> put<00:05:09.010> one

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
thingy not even one of these I put one

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.779 
thingy not even one of these I put one
of<00:05:09.639> these<00:05:09.760> available<00:05:10.120> puffs<00:05:11.039> but<00:05:12.039> the

of these available puffs but the

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:20.570 
of these available puffs but the
coverage<00:05:13.180> is<00:05:13.300> also<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:15.310> is<00:05:15.669> yellow<00:05:16.270> based<00:05:17.100> and

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.710 

it's<00:05:21.580> kind<00:05:21.789> of<00:05:21.880> different<00:05:22.150> than<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.570> other
