00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.730
 here it is how to say 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:39.380
 1 15 minutes go baking now 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:39.380
 neatly it doesn't smell good goes 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:54.320
 sorry you can't do the cameras for aired 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.320
 head can be pierced 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:06.229
 if you light alexander 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.229
 you will get obese 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:22.120
 the fish is ready but it is almost otvetku yet 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:31.720
 No pity for the camera, they did not come up 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:34.920
 which conveys the flavor so now what 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:41.190
 we need to do we need to do 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.190
 again a little lemon 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:58.150
 top and oil him up to the ocean filmed 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:15.730
 I buy a brush we know hands a little oil 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.439
 butter to make it crispy 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.439
 crust 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.370
 if someone wants to transfer it from below 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.040
 a crisp score needs to be returned but i don't 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:52.940
 I advise you to do this because the fish on 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:03:00.310
 nectar and make foil as a cup 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:04.670
 so that the sauce does not run away all but stayed 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.049
 here and then we have this broth am all 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.049
 let's go top 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:28.670
 we all have all happened already 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.709
 still such advice when 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:50.069
 parsley mix key 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:52.890
 not clothes branches tear off the leaves in 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:59.750
 that branches sell bitterness so small 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.750
 and send to the beginning 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.769
 yes no i 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:34.690
 we do not climb sideways lower 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:48.220
 top and all 20 30 minutes and everything is so 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.660
 should not ready but we have an oven 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:57.560
 so-so we can not figure out that and so 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:01.010
 so maybe there will be a second take in 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.130
 retired to the oven so she is 20 30 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:08.560
 minutes should cook after that meat 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:15.260
 Of course I am quickly preparing 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:19.930
 so we wait pokamis can be shred 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.010
 greens and then I already did a little romance and 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:27.440
 all sauces 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:29.690
 someone wants any sauce we use 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.950
 we will use what we have it 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.240
 ketchup mayonnaise 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.790
 a little bit of that sweet sauce demand and 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:44.020
 chinese soybean 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.020
 and this sauce which will give the fish
