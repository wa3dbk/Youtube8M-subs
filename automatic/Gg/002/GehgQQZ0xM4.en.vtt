00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.710
 hi Guys 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.710
 repeated and show something special 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.169
 when shopping back 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.169
 what is this head too 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.269
 that hurts me if one 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.269
 That means you have progress from having 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.289
 By the way, the same thing the rocker Kriftel expert she rewarded GÃ¼nther up to 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.289
 a year 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.839
 here's a gust of wind 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 for Nordwalde 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.869
 build on heavy trains Markus Braun 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700
 un-Member 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.580
 or is actually built 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.580
 with their problems are and g 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.310
 a tunnel to the retreat 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.430
 there it is like me forced 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.620
 In terms of Nick, it is at least 40 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 to look at others 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.340
 Petri not with me probably I also suffer the tie 1 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.420
 it means that William Bell seemed to be 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.130
 that the government is coming 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.130
 And sell 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.110
 WoW to follow the bullish 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 then we have 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.830
 a train station together 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.100
 to negotiate with the Greens for years 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.180
 Merry the investigators 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.180
 all that pretty small Nottuln 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.310
 Romsthal 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.400
 but also such land Luminale 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.480
 it sang songs a house of their own must 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.420
 nothing can be broken 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.020
 there's protectionism 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 earlier that says I do not 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 so far no one knows and it can be demolished 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.049
 APA 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.709
 it just makes you cold 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.709
 between that sees everything from boom 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.369
 at the reformed 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.039
 so 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.719
 I hope they look over 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 I have the empathy 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.819
 modestly packed 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.819
 and players 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.309
 developed Mio 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.499
