00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
week I was true 52 so I'm going to go

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.370 
week I was true 52 so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.250> weigh<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.210> we'll<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.840> how

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
