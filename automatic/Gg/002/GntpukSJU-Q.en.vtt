gore-tex<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.640> problem<00:03:18.970> with<00:03:19.090> gore-tex

gore-tex the problem with gore-tex

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.630 
gore-tex the problem with gore-tex
normally<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.140> if<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.560> gets<00:03:20.769> wet<00:03:21.190> I'm

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
normally is that if it gets wet I'm

normally is that if it gets wet I'm
inside<00:03:22.269> of<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.510> boot<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:23.019> takes<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.410> really

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
inside of the boot it takes a really

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.400 
inside of the boot it takes a really
long<00:03:23.709> time<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.310> dry<00:03:24.519> out<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.989> that's<00:03:26.109> one<00:03:26.380> of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
long time to dry out but that's one of

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.500 
long time to dry out but that's one of
