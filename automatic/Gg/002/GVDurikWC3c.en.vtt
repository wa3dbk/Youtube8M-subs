00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
a round pattern the next family of tools

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.640 
a round pattern the next family of tools
that<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.439> our<00:01:19.590> weight<00:01:19.740> jig<00:01:19.979> Delfy<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
that we have is our weight jig Delfy and

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.520 
that we have is our weight jig Delfy and
the<00:01:22.650> Delfy<00:01:23.040> has<00:01:23.360> 1/16<00:01:24.360> inch<00:01:24.600> metal<00:01:24.990> pegs<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the Delfy has 1/16 inch metal pegs and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280 
the Delfy has 1/16 inch metal pegs and
the<00:01:26.250> holes<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:27.000> spaced<00:01:27.240> five<00:01:27.600> holes<00:01:27.869> per<00:01:28.200> an

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the holes are spaced five holes per an

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.130 
the holes are spaced five holes per an
inch<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> Delfy<00:01:30.360> allows<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
inch so that the Delfy allows you to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
inch so that the Delfy allows you to
make<00:01:31.320> smaller<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.189> delicate<00:01:32.250> jewelry

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
make smaller and more delicate jewelry

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.240 
make smaller and more delicate jewelry
components<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.530> good<00:01:34.799> jig<00:01:35.070> if

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
centaur the Centaur has same square peg

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.539 
centaur the Centaur has same square peg
pattern<00:02:35.569> as<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.989> Delfy<00:02:36.379> with<00:02:36.620> 5<00:02:36.950> holes<00:02:37.220> per

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.479 
inch the same 1/16 inch pegs and it also
has<00:02:41.360> half<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.079> round<00:02:42.410> peg<00:02:42.739> pattern<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
has half of the round peg pattern of the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.940 
has half of the round peg pattern of the
Cyclops<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.019> allows<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.739> make

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
Cyclops so that it allows you to make

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.900 
Cyclops so that it allows you to make
either<00:02:46.549> square<00:02:46.940> or<00:02:47.329> round<00:02:47.720> patterns<00:02:48.730> with<00:02:49.730> our

smaller and more delicate pegs and with

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.309 
smaller and more delicate pegs and with
the<00:02:52.190> Delfy<00:02:52.579> here<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:52.940> also<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.329> an<00:02:53.840> accessory

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
the Delfy here we also have an accessory

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.740 
the Delfy here we also have an accessory
we<00:02:54.530> call<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.860> spiral<00:02:55.310> maker<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:56.329> spiral

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
we call the spiral maker the spiral

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.110 
we call the spiral maker the spiral
maker<00:02:56.989> allows<00:02:57.319> us<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.920> make<00:02:58.099> spirals<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.910> the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
maker allows us to make spirals and the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.309 
maker allows us to make spirals and the
way<00:02:59.269> we<00:02:59.450> use<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.810> spiral<00:03:00.260> maker<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:02.079> we<00:03:03.079> put

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
way we use the spiral maker is we put

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.110 
way we use the spiral maker is we put
the<00:03:03.470> wire<00:03:03.680> through<00:03:04.010> one<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.610> holes<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:05.000> the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
the wire through one of the holes in the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.750 
the wire through one of the holes in the
spiral<00:03:05.390> maker<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:05.900> bend<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.290> flat<00:03:06.560> put<00:03:07.549> the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
spiral maker we bend it flat put the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.789 
spiral maker we bend it flat put the
spiral<00:03:08.150> maker<00:03:08.329> into<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.959> jig<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.410> then<00:03:09.620> while

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
spiral maker into the jig and then while

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.530 
spiral maker into the jig and then while
we're<00:03:10.010> looking<00:03:10.129> through<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.850> jig<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.269> pull

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
we're looking through the jig we pull

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.309 
we're looking through the jig we pull
the<00:03:11.720> wire<00:03:11.930> around<00:03:12.230> into<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.950> spiral<00:03:14.319> allowing

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
the wire around into a spiral allowing

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.020 
the wire around into a spiral allowing
us<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.470> make<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.769> nice<00:03:16.040> tight<00:03:16.310> spiral<00:03:16.459> without

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
us to make a nice tight spiral without

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.910 
us to make a nice tight spiral without
marking<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> wire<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.260> that's<00:03:18.470> our<00:03:18.620> spiral

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
marking the wire so that's our spiral

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.370 
marking the wire so that's our spiral
maker<00:03:19.250> accessory<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.209> again<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.170> have<00:03:21.350> a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
maker accessory and again we have a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.259 
maker accessory and again we have a
spiral<00:03:21.709> maker<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.549> will<00:03:22.730> work<00:03:22.910> with<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
spiral maker that will work with the

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.090 
spiral maker that will work with the
Olympus<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:24.230> different<00:03:24.590> spiral<00:03:24.920> maker

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
Olympus and a different spiral maker

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.370 
Olympus and a different spiral maker
that<00:03:25.340> will<00:03:25.519> work<00:03:25.700> with<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.090> Delfy<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.720> those

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
that will work with the Delfy and those

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.000 
that will work with the Delfy and those
are<00:03:27.530> our<00:03:27.769> wig<00:03:28.010> jig<00:03:28.190> tools<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.730> accessories
