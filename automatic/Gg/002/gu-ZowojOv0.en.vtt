00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.730
 so do some bodybuilding 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.340
 that there is a lot in a game that 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.080
 hid all that and that are complexed 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.630
 Well, I'll show them a little bit 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.449
 do a bodybuilding like that instead 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 to become criticizing they will do 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.380
 a bit of bodybuilding is so 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.440
 today I did so 1 developed 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 lying in jeans is good with them between 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.840
 deploys between 70 and 73 kg because I 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.500
 do not know how much the bar is 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.200

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.809
 can not put more because that's it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.789
 I have that we see but it will be 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.629
 enough to show the grumpy who 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.500

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.500
 was going to take some seed 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.929

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.179
 posed to do more is that there is no 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.020
 person behind me in case I have a 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:02:00.460
 worries redo pay attention but you 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.460
 have seen the prints that criticize you 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 will be able to do the same thing 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.149
 after you can come and criticize me 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.030
 but meanwhile close your mouths and 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.310
 So that's what they like well 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.090
 exploits they can return to my page
