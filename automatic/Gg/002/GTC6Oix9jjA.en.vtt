i have a feeling Dzeko will be leaving

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.990 
i have a feeling Dzeko will be leaving
so<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.920> would<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.070> leave<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> grower<00:03:23.790> which

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
so it would just leave a grower which

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.310 
so it would just leave a grower which
will<00:03:24.209> mean<00:03:24.330> they<00:03:24.510> will<00:03:24.630> have<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.810> sign<00:03:25.110> someone

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
will mean they will have to sign someone

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.220 
will mean they will have to sign someone
else<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.860> course<00:03:26.130> Aguero<00:03:26.780> will<00:03:27.780> be<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
else of course Aguero will be in the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.900 
else of course Aguero will be in the
squad<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.680> doubt<00:03:28.950> he<00:03:29.160> was<00:03:29.280> incredible<00:03:29.820> he

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
squad of a doubt he was incredible he

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.699 
squad of a doubt he was incredible he
always<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.300> he's<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> fantastic<00:03:30.750> striker<00:03:31.350> so<00:03:31.560> he

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
always is he's a fantastic striker so he

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.410 
always is he's a fantastic striker so he
will<00:03:31.890> be<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.160> squad<00:03:32.520> one<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.090> heavier

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420

think<00:03:36.810> he<00:03:36.930> has<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.080> big<00:03:37.380> chance<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.800> getting

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
think he has a big chance of getting

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.130 
think he has a big chance of getting
into<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.340> squad<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.640> striker<00:03:39.180> their<00:03:39.480> 71

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.400 
pace again I don't know as go read as in
game<00:03:42.420> stats<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.840> he's<00:03:42.959> had<00:03:43.050> a<00:03:43.080> good<00:03:43.350> season

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
game stats but he's had a good season

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.010 
game stats but he's had a good season
for<00:03:43.800> severe<00:03:44.220> not<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.640> best<00:03:44.850> but<00:03:45.000> he<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.660> quite

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
for severe not the best but he is quite

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.110 
for severe not the best but he is quite
a<00:03:46.170> good<00:03:46.470> ghost<00:03:46.709> go<00:03:46.980> out<00:03:47.040> when<00:03:47.280> needed<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.940> now

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
a good ghost go out when needed to now

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.820 
a good ghost go out when needed to now
he<00:03:48.180> can't<00:03:48.600> even<00:03:48.780> really<00:03:49.080> get<00:03:49.260> into<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.500> spain

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
he can't even really get into the spain

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.890 
he can't even really get into the spain
squad<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.850> may<00:03:51.060> not<00:03:51.180> necessarily<00:03:51.330> be<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
squad so it may not necessarily be the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.360 
squad so it may not necessarily be the
best<00:03:52.110> buy<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:52.350> them<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:52.770> it<00:03:52.860> called<00:03:53.100> could

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
best buy for them but it called could

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.310 
best buy for them but it called could
also<00:03:53.610> really<00:03:54.090> work<00:03:54.239> out<00:03:54.480> height<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.080> very

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
also really work out height is very

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.660 
also really work out height is very
important<00:03:55.770> in<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:55.980> Premier<00:03:56.280> League<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:56.580> it

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
important in the Premier League so it

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.400 
important in the Premier League so it
could<00:03:56.880> be<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> very<00:03:57.270> very<00:03:57.510> good<00:03:57.780> thing<00:03:57.959> for<00:03:58.170> him

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
could be a very very good thing for him

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.710 
could be a very very good thing for him
now<00:03:58.770> like<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.400> said<00:03:59.459> Jake<00:03:59.850> oh<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.150> assume<00:04:00.510> will<00:04:00.690> be

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
now like I said Jake oh I assume will be

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.120 
now like I said Jake oh I assume will be
on<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.930> way<00:04:01.110> out<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.830> who<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.010> think

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
on the way out so that is who I think

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.220 
on the way out so that is who I think
will<00:04:02.400> be<00:04:02.550> taken<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.209> role<00:04:03.420> obviously

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
will be taken up that role obviously

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.660 
will be taken up that role obviously
