that I've been working on recently
something's<00:00:14.099> taking<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.490> lot<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.639> time<00:00:17.210> so<00:00:18.210> here

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
something's taking a lot of time so here

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.759 
something's taking a lot of time so here
I've<00:00:18.960> got<00:00:19.020> my<00:00:20.630> fancy-schmancy<00:00:21.740> turnigy<00:00:22.740> 9x

our<00:00:23.279> radio<00:00:23.670> great<00:00:24.300> radio<00:00:24.630> lots<00:00:24.930> of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
our radio great radio lots of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.509 
our radio great radio lots of
programming<00:00:25.350> features<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.920> really<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.279> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
programming features I really like it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.799 
programming features I really like it
here's<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:31.250> arduino<00:00:32.250> nano<00:00:32.809> compatible

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
here's a a arduino nano compatible

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.790 
here's a a arduino nano compatible
device<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:35.719> actually<00:00:36.719> sell<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.350> my<00:00:37.469> store

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

as<00:00:38.010> well<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:40.140> I've<00:00:40.350> got<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> few<00:00:40.590> left<00:00:40.800> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
as well I think I've got a few left in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.150 
as well I think I've got a few left in
stock<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:44.840> have<00:00:45.840> interfaced<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.680> with

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
stock and I have interfaced it with

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.860 
stock and I have interfaced it with
MATLAB<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.420> ahead<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
MATLAB so I want to go ahead and do a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.470 
MATLAB so I want to go ahead and do a
demonstration<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:50.120> I'll<00:00:51.120> show<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
demonstration here I'll show you a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.439 
demonstration here I'll show you a
couple<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.469> screenshot<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.309> two<00:00:53.460> later<00:00:53.730> so

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
couple of our screenshot or two later so

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.430 
couple of our screenshot or two later so
here's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.719> MATLAB<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:57.449> MATLAB<00:00:57.750> program<00:00:58.170> I've

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
here's a MATLAB the MATLAB program I've

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.549 
here's a MATLAB the MATLAB program I've
got<00:00:58.680> an<00:00:58.920> application<00:00:59.809> that<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.870> wrote<00:01:01.260> which

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
got an application that I wrote which

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.189 
got an application that I wrote which
has<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> graphical<00:01:02.489> user<00:01:02.520> interface<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.449> click

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
has a graphical user interface I click

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
has a graphical user interface I click
run<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.920> opens<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.430> panel<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
run it opens up this panel I'm going to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.020 
run it opens up this panel I'm going to
maximize<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:07.220> go<00:01:08.220> ahead<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.549> set<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.820> comm

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
maximize that I go ahead and set my comm

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.000 
maximize that I go ahead and set my comm
port<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> comm<00:01:09.630> 13<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> comm

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
port to comm 13 because that's the comm

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.100

port associated with my Arduino Nano I
hit<00:01:14.780> start<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:17.210> connecting<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> Arduino

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
hit start here connecting to the Arduino

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.120 
hit start here connecting to the Arduino
and<00:01:19.880> now<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.860> says<00:01:23.100> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and now you can see that it says that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
and now you can see that it says that
I'm<00:01:23.400> connected<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> frames

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I'm connected you can see the frames

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
I'm connected you can see the frames
updating<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.280> nothing<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> plot

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
updating but you see nothing on the plot

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.210 
updating but you see nothing on the plot
well<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.659> radio<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.020> off<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:28.979> gonna<00:01:29.070> go

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
well the radio is off so I'm gonna go

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.810 
well the radio is off so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.890> put<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> radio<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.670> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
ahead and put the radio right here so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.120 
ahead and put the radio right here so
you<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.180> both<00:01:33.360> simultaneously<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you can see both simultaneously as I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.149 
you can see both simultaneously as I
turn<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.549> radio<00:01:35.579> on

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
turn the radio on

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.679 
turn the radio on
once<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.520> starts<00:01:38.850> transmitting<00:01:39.240> you'll<00:01:39.540> see

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
once it starts transmitting you'll see

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.179 
once it starts transmitting you'll see
stuff<00:01:39.900> pop<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.409> screen<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
stuff pop up on the screen there it is

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.080 
stuff pop up on the screen there it is
so<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.979> live<00:01:46.979> data<00:01:47.399> coming<00:01:47.729> onto

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
so now you can see live data coming onto

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.850 
so now you can see live data coming onto
the<00:01:48.180> screen<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.200> data<00:01:50.270> corresponds<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
the screen and this data corresponds to

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.660 
the screen and this data corresponds to
what<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> transmitter<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> doing

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.830 

so<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.700> can<00:02:00.850> go<00:02:00.970> ahead<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.210> move<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.570> sticks

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
so I can go ahead and move the sticks

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.120 
so I can go ahead and move the sticks
around<00:02:01.960> I'm<00:02:02.170> just<00:02:02.350> moving<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.680> left<00:02:02.860> stick

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
around I'm just moving the left stick

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.230 
around I'm just moving the left stick
here<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.720> move<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.080> stick<00:02:05.730> it<00:02:06.730> updates<00:02:07.060> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
here as I move the stick it updates the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.889 
here as I move the stick it updates the
screen<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.670> see<00:02:09.910> there's<00:02:10.119> actually<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.509> teal

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
screen you see there's actually a teal

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.880 
screen you see there's actually a teal
plot<00:02:11.740> there<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:13.240> blue<00:02:13.990> asterisks<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:14.770> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
plot there to the blue asterisks so the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.880 
plot there to the blue asterisks so the
throttle<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.670> teal<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.180> rudder<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.770> then

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
throttle the teal is the rudder and then

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.880 
throttle the teal is the rudder and then
on<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.070> right<00:02:18.250> stick<00:02:19.200> you've<00:02:20.200> got<00:02:20.410> either<00:02:20.620> on

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
on the right stick you've got either on

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.280 
on the right stick you've got either on
an<00:02:20.980> elevator<00:02:21.370> down<00:02:21.580> here<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.020> as<00:02:23.140> well

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
an elevator down here going on as well

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.630 
an elevator down here going on as well
let<00:02:23.500> me<00:02:23.530> move<00:02:23.710> them<00:02:23.800> real<00:02:24.010> slow<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.580> can

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
let me move them real slow so you can

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.140 
let me move them real slow so you can
see<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.380> happened<00:02:26.380> better<00:02:26.730> now<00:02:27.730> let<00:02:27.880> me<00:02:27.970> show

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
see it happened better now let me show

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.350 
see it happened better now let me show
you<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.160> plotting<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.910> could<00:02:31.209> see

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
you what it's plotting so you could see

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.680 
you what it's plotting so you could see
the<00:02:31.480> PPM<00:02:32.490> microsecond<00:02:33.490> value<00:02:33.790> values<00:02:34.450> here

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the PPM microsecond value values here

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.510

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
wrote this code to actually function

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.010

signal really doesn't matter I can
always<00:02:43.150> tweak<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.720> adapt<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.650> the

transmitter or whatever the case is it

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.410 
transmitter or whatever the case is it
also<00:02:48.280> tells<00:02:48.550> me<00:02:48.610> if<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.820> transmitters<00:02:49.270> on

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
also tells me if the transmitters on

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.480 
also tells me if the transmitters on
down<00:02:49.630> there<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.900> says<00:02:50.080> TX<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.620> equals<00:02:50.950> 1<00:02:51.220> I

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
down there it says TX on equals 1 I

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.400 
down there it says TX on equals 1 I
could<00:02:52.060> turn<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> transmitter<00:02:52.660> off<00:02:52.959> there<00:02:53.320> it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
could turn the transmitter off there it

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.140 
could turn the transmitter off there it
is<00:02:53.500> zero<00:02:54.959> turn<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.050> back<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.700> will<00:02:57.910> start

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
is zero turn it back on it will start

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.140 
is zero turn it back on it will start
refreshing<00:02:59.020> values<00:02:59.610> tells<00:03:00.610> me<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.000> on

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
refreshing values tells me that it's on

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.470 
refreshing values tells me that it's on
again

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
again

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.550 
again
so<00:03:02.970> anyway<00:03:04.180> nifty<00:03:04.570> little<00:03:04.780> tool<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.380> got

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
so anyway nifty little tool that I got

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.370 
so anyway nifty little tool that I got
here<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.480> has<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> lot<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:11.050> potential

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
here I think this has a lot of potential

you<00:03:15.760> debug<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.180> transmitter<00:03:16.630> like<00:03:16.810> I've<00:03:16.959> got

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
you debug the transmitter like I've got

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.710 
you debug the transmitter like I've got
going<00:03:17.380> on<00:03:17.470> here<00:03:17.739> but<00:03:18.640> also<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.180> can<00:03:19.330> record

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
going on here but also it can record

going on here but also it can record
your<00:03:19.930> flights<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.590> mean<00:03:20.739> think<00:03:20.920> about<00:03:20.980> the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
your flights I mean think about the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.810 
your flights I mean think about the
possibility<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:23.220> going<00:03:24.220> out<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.550> flying

possibility of going out to the flying

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.180 
possibility of going out to the flying

recording<00:03:28.090> your<00:03:28.209> stick<00:03:28.480> inputs<00:03:29.310> maybe

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
recording your stick inputs maybe

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.830 
recording your stick inputs maybe
something<00:03:30.640> even<00:03:30.700> more<00:03:30.940> sophisticated<00:03:31.570> where

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
something even more sophisticated where

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.130 
something even more sophisticated where
you<00:03:31.930> record<00:03:32.730> gyroscopic<00:03:33.730> data<00:03:33.940> as<00:03:34.420> well<00:03:34.630> as<00:03:34.750> as

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
you record gyroscopic data as well as as

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.870 
you record gyroscopic data as well as as
well<00:03:35.200> as<00:03:35.470> accelerometers<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.220> also<00:03:36.670> all

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
well as accelerometers and also all

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.250 
well as accelerometers and also all
sorts<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:37.209> things<00:03:37.330> like<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.570> pretty<00:03:38.050> soon

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
sorts of things like that pretty soon

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.630 
sorts of things like that pretty soon
you<00:03:38.380> could<00:03:38.530> have<00:03:38.680> an<00:03:38.800> input<00:03:38.980> versus<00:03:39.519> output

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
you could have an input versus output

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.960 
you could have an input versus output
correlation<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.750> develop<00:03:41.970> flight

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
correlation you can develop flight

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.830 
correlation you can develop flight
controllers<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:45.570> vehicle<00:03:48.030> dinette<00:03:49.030> dynamic

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
controllers and vehicle dinette dynamic

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.900 
controllers and vehicle dinette dynamic
models<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.530> model<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.340> dynamics<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.820> the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
models to model the dynamics of the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.600 
models to model the dynamics of the
vehicle<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.810> can<00:03:53.620> do<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.950> whole<00:03:54.310> lot<00:03:54.459> of

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
vehicle so you can do a whole lot of

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.949 
vehicle so you can do a whole lot of
stuff<00:03:54.820> for<00:03:55.000> something<00:03:55.269> like<00:03:55.420> this<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.840> also

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
stuff for something like this it also

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.479 
stuff for something like this it also
demonstrates<00:03:56.530> how<00:03:56.739> an<00:03:56.830> Arduino<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.280> can<00:03:57.400> be

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
demonstrates how an Arduino it can be

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.560 
demonstrates how an Arduino it can be
used<00:03:57.670> as<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:57.850> laboratory<00:03:58.390> instrument<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.110> I

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
used as a laboratory instrument so I

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.220 
used as a laboratory instrument so I
really<00:04:01.570> think<00:04:01.750> this<00:04:01.870> has<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:02.019> lot<00:04:02.170> of

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
really think this has a lot of

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.199 
really think this has a lot of
application<00:04:02.920> at<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.940> moment<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.590> am<00:04:06.209> making

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
application at the moment I am making

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.520 
application at the moment I am making
this<00:04:07.359> function<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:07.989> can<00:04:08.079> see<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.350> frame

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
this function you can see the frame

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.349 
this function you can see the frame
remembers<00:04:09.100> updating<00:04:09.519> pretty<00:04:09.700> slowly<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.239> it's

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
remembers updating pretty slowly so it's

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.510 
remembers updating pretty slowly so it's
running<00:04:10.600> out<00:04:10.660> of<00:04:10.780> priests<00:04:10.989> low<00:04:11.200> frequency

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
running out of priests low frequency

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.030 
running out of priests low frequency
that's<00:04:13.120> because<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.480> still<00:04:13.780> have<00:04:14.560> my<00:04:14.770> code

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
that's because I still have my code

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.069 
that's because I still have my code
pretty<00:04:15.400> inefficient<00:04:15.819> it's<00:04:16.570> pulling<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
pretty inefficient it's pulling the

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.009 
pretty inefficient it's pulling the

have not run the profiler yet in MATLAB

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.120 
have not run the profiler yet in MATLAB
to<00:04:28.419> refine<00:04:28.780> this<00:04:28.990> code<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.560> need<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.860> run<00:04:30.010> the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130

profiler clean up bottlenecks I've

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.560 
profiler clean up bottlenecks I've
actually<00:04:32.650> started<00:04:33.130> doing<00:04:33.340> that<00:04:33.460> but<00:04:34.240> I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
actually started doing that but I

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.420 
actually started doing that but I
haven't<00:04:35.050> implemented<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.770> this<00:04:35.919> said<00:04:36.100> in

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
haven't implemented it and this said in

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.740 
haven't implemented it and this said in
this<00:04:36.520> iteration<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:37.030> code<00:04:37.240> yes<00:04:37.510> that's

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
this iteration of code yes that's

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.930 
this iteration of code yes that's
something<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.200> come<00:04:39.160> in<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.340> future<00:04:39.700> but<00:04:39.880> I

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
something to come in the future but I

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.320 
something to come in the future but I
expect<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.050> be<00:04:41.080> able<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:41.590> get<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:42.070> maximum<00:04:42.970> data

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
expect to be able to get a maximum data

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.060 
expect to be able to get a maximum data
logging<00:04:43.600> frequency<00:04:44.320> if<00:04:44.440> somewhere<00:04:44.830> around

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
logging frequency if somewhere around

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.379 
logging frequency if somewhere around
300<00:04:45.610> Hertz

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
300 Hertz

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.090 
300 Hertz
by<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.930> time<00:04:47.080> I'm<00:04:47.229> all<00:04:47.380> done<00:04:47.560> however<00:04:47.800> it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
by the time I'm all done however it

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.350 
by the time I'm all done however it
won't<00:04:48.190> be<00:04:48.340> able<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.580> update<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.970> plot<00:04:49.180> that

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
won't be able to update the plot that

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.090 
won't be able to update the plot that
fast<00:04:49.690> so<00:04:49.900> it'll<00:04:50.080> probably<00:04:50.110> have<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.590> be<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.770> plot

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
fast so it'll probably have to be a plot

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.840 
fast so it'll probably have to be a plot
that<00:04:51.430> updates<00:04:52.419> every<00:04:52.720> now<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.139> then<00:04:53.229> or<00:04:53.290> just

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
that updates every now and then or just

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.090 
that updates every now and then or just
refreshes<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> new<00:04:55.150> data<00:04:55.330> under<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.690> screen

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
refreshes the new data under the screen

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.260 
refreshes the new data under the screen
also<00:04:57.100> if<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:57.460> look<00:04:57.610> into<00:04:57.729> my<00:04:57.910> source<00:04:58.150> code

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
also if you look into my source code

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.420 
also if you look into my source code
you'll<00:04:58.600> see<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.840> I'm<00:04:58.960> sending<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.010> data<00:05:00.220> in

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
you'll see that I'm sending the data in

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.350 
you'll see that I'm sending the data in
a<00:05:00.550> pretty<00:05:01.419> sophisticated<00:05:01.660> manner<00:05:02.490> I'm<00:05:03.490> using

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
a pretty sophisticated manner I'm using

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.469 
a pretty sophisticated manner I'm using
binary<00:05:05.340> sending<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.550> receiving<00:05:06.580> and

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
binary sending and receiving and

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.080 
binary sending and receiving and
creating<00:05:08.020> binary<00:05:08.979> packets<00:05:09.550> as<00:05:09.669> opposed<00:05:09.970> to

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
creating binary packets as opposed to

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.120 
creating binary packets as opposed to
using<00:05:10.240> ASCII<00:05:10.570> characters<00:05:11.200> which<00:05:11.710> would<00:05:11.919> be

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
using ASCII characters which would be

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.469 
using ASCII characters which would be
the<00:05:12.280> standard<00:05:12.520> way<00:05:12.820> to<00:05:12.850> do<00:05:13.090> stuff<00:05:13.300> through

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
the standard way to do stuff through

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.040 
the standard way to do stuff through
serial<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:15.160> this<00:05:15.370> requires<00:05:15.700> using<00:05:16.000> unions<00:05:16.539> in

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
serial and this requires using unions in

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.670 
serial and this requires using unions in
C<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:19.450> pack<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.840> data<00:05:20.020> create<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.500> data

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
C and to pack the data create the data

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.850 
C and to pack the data create the data
packets<00:05:21.160> and<00:05:21.340> then<00:05:22.060> using<00:05:22.450> a<00:05:22.960> special<00:05:23.650> type

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
packets and then using a special type

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.790 
packets and then using a special type
casting<00:05:24.340> in<00:05:24.430> MATLAB<00:05:24.789> to<00:05:25.120> unpack<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.780> data<00:05:26.430> so

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
casting in MATLAB to unpack the data so

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.710 
casting in MATLAB to unpack the data so
anyway<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:30.039> hope<00:05:30.160> you<00:05:30.310> enjoyed<00:05:30.610> this<00:05:30.880> I'm<00:05:31.510> gonna
