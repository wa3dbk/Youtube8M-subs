00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
know stability of it and you can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.860 
know stability of it and you can
definitely<00:00:53.100> tell<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.550> been<00:00:53.789> worked<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.390> it's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
very well polished it's a lot smoother

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.400 
very well polished it's a lot smoother
now<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.660> some<00:00:57.899> delay<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> I've

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
now there is some delay that I've

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.260 
now there is some delay that I've
noticed<00:00:58.590> opening<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.399> app<00:00:59.550> switcher<00:00:59.879> like

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
noticed opening up the app switcher like

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
noticed opening up the app switcher like
there's<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> stutter<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.739> don't<00:01:01.920> like

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
there's a stutter which I don't like

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.200 
there's a stutter which I don't like
sometimes<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> open<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:02.969> an<00:01:03.090> application

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
sometimes if you open up an application

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.910 
sometimes if you open up an application
there's<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:04.080> bit<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.320> delay<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
there's a little bit of a delay that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.590 
there's a little bit of a delay that
shouldn't<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.030> otherwise<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
shouldn't be there but otherwise you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.719 
shouldn't be there but otherwise you
know<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.869> works<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.590> well<00:01:07.770> now<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.580> for

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
know it works very well now it's for

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.399 
know it works very well now it's for
battery<00:01:09.060> life<00:01:09.090> I've<00:01:09.540> noticed<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
battery life I've noticed that it is a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.990 
battery life I've noticed that it is a
little<00:01:10.590> bit<00:01:10.770> better<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.369> draining<00:01:11.729> as

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
little bit better it's not draining as

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
little bit better it's not draining as
fast<00:01:12.510> even<00:01:12.840> though<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.049> literally<00:01:13.320> been

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
fast even though it's literally been

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
fast even though it's literally been
only<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> few<00:01:13.890> hours<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.430> having<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.150> sit

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
only a few hours just having it sit

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
only a few hours just having it sit
there<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:15.750> using<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> notice<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.950> battery

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
there or using you notice the battery

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
there or using you notice the battery
life<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.299> better<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
life is a little bit better but I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
life is a little bit better but I
haven't<00:01:19.259> had<00:01:19.350> an<00:01:19.470> issue<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> may<00:01:20.250> be

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
haven't had an issue with that it may be

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
haven't had an issue with that it may be
different<00:01:20.549> from<00:01:20.759> people<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.750> had<00:01:21.990> an

different from people that have had an

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.719 
different from people that have had an
issue<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.890> anyways<00:01:23.159> let's<00:01:23.549> go<00:01:23.700> ahead

they're very minimal now they've got

this very minimal look to them if I show

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.300 
this very minimal look to them if I show
you<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.959> previous<00:04:06.290> one<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:06.769> as<00:04:06.919> you<00:04:07.010> can<00:04:07.130> see

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
you the previous one so as you can see

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.920 
you the previous one so as you can see
the<00:04:07.459> icons<00:04:07.880> look<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.180> little<00:04:08.389> bit<00:04:08.569> different

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
the icons look a little bit different

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.750 
the icons look a little bit different
behave<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.230> little<00:04:09.349> bit<00:04:09.530> different<00:04:09.919> when<00:04:10.669> you

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
behave a little bit different when you

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.300 
behave a little bit different when you
activate<00:04:11.209> them<00:04:11.419> so<00:04:11.750> looks<00:04:12.169> just<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.620> little<00:04:13.010> bit

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
activate them so looks just a little bit

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.580 
activate them so looks just a little bit
different<00:04:13.849> now<00:04:13.910> actually<00:04:14.569> in<00:04:14.780> general<00:04:15.319> and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
different now actually in general and

this<00:04:34.000> isn't<00:04:34.270> anything<00:04:34.420> new<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:35.080> was<00:04:35.260> available

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440

relocated<00:04:37.720> now<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.020> reason<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:38.710> think<00:04:38.920> this

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
relocated now the reason I think this

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.040 
relocated now the reason I think this
has<00:04:39.370> been<00:04:39.400> relocated<00:04:40.120> is<00:04:40.240> because<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.870> new

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
has been relocated is because of the new

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.710 
has been relocated is because of the new
a<00:04:41.290> label<00:04:41.740> Act<00:04:41.980> signed<00:04:42.370> into<00:04:42.640> law<00:04:43.450> by<00:04:43.480> President

Obama<00:04:44.650> what<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.130> basically<00:04:45.220> means<00:04:45.520> is

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
Obama what it basically means is

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.030 
Obama what it basically means is
basically<00:04:46.420> if<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.810> make<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.170> FCC<00:04:47.320> labels

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.370 
basically if you make the FCC labels
page<00:04:48.430> right<00:04:48.670> here<00:04:48.700> more<00:04:49.420> easily<00:04:49.990> accessible
