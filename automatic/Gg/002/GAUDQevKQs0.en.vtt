00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello here is the first part of the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.950
 guppy reproduction 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.170
 we can see the female guppy and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.530
 males if you know how to recognize them so much 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.839
 better 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.369
 the males are more colorful than the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.990
 females females are a little bit more 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.720
 fat as males males measure 3 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 at 4 cm in adulthood females 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 can measure 3 to 5 cm and they are only 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.300
 not very often colored they are 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.730
 rather black like this one on which 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.739
 I zoom you can roughly 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 levy 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:41.040
 so here is my little aquarium it's a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.370
 64 so you put three males for the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.370
 female 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.230
 so that should be enough I have other 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.230
 fish that cohabit very well with 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.760
 my qpi I do not know the name sorry 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.989
 finally here I have a little fish 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.970
 tile washer there but that he 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.330
 not very obvious reflected here 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.010
 several kinds of malbon lines go bad 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.980
 the bad corner there 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:23.430
 our you see quietly by train 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.430
 to have fun 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.380
 finally here is gold today I noticed 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.370
 that they were in attempts to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.290
 reproduction 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.990
 so they are approaching females 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:43.050
 see all that they have fun approach 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.240
 many of the females 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:51.750
 they try somehow as 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.750
 you can see to reproduce 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.410
 what could you say about 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.660
 groups and when you have babies have to 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.490
 let's have to separate the babies from 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.030
 the family in corner our aquarium at 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.140
 douar bridge put in the aquarium 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.430
 it's easier and not needed 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.550
 to have thirty six thousand aquarium but 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.250
 do not let them grow up there 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.880
 in 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.950
 that's all after not leaving 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:32.910
 fish or the vegetable or their 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:36.590
 feeding once a day here 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.590
 what she and let live 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.590
 quietly 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.670
 not try to take a buck and a 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.069
 female and put them in a skin 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.269
 black 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.110
 if you want to do that you put him 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.890
 in a small aquarium you put a 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.549
 males and three females what if you 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:06.440
 put a female with a bad evil 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:10.430
 will exhaust the female the female will 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.560
 die what males are very active 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.590
 sexually 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.590
 so here we have to let 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.900
