00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.080
Skipper, how you goin’, mate? Jase.
Andrew.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.580
You are the one that is going to get us there
safely?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.420
 I’m going for the boat mate, cut them straps.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.899
So here we are on the Sealink barge Darwin,
call it Darwin cos it hangs out in Darwin

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.479
I guess. Come and have a look, come and have
a bit of a guided tour.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.880
This is our cabin, that’s where I am sleeping.
That’s where the cameraman is sleeping.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:55.200
That’s where Simon is sleeping. This is
luxurious. There are showers and toilets.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.490
We don’t have that on our boat.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.680
Come through here.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.400
That’s Simon; he’s already at home.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.060
Round here, let’s go.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.460
This is the food area, the kitchen, apparently
no throwing the food scraps out the port hole.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.260
That is the number one rule. There is the
food. Plenty of food in the fridge. Here is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.790
the pantry fully stocked.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.860
Don’t know what is in here. Oh that’s
the storage room.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.160
There’s the tv.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.020
Go upstairs.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.820
That’s the captain’s room. We don’t
go in there. That’s his spot- oh we don’t

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.020
go in there either, because that is captain
number 2.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.500
Let’s go upstairs and have a look at the
wheel house.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.220
Might go past the poop deck first.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.480
Always wondered why they called it the poop
deck, cos there is no actual poop on it. It’s

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.960
pretty clean actually.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.009
Come this way, come this way, come on, come
on.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.740
Over here have a look. This is what we go
for when the ships going down, we go for that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.160
one. But I was actually going to go for my
boat. I reckon just cut the red straps and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.730
when the prop hits the water, go.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.530
Come round this way. That’s if the sh**
really hits the fan, that is the life raft.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.940
Don’t go for the boat. When it’s blowing
about 50-60 knots, you get in that thing.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.970
That’s the safe thing.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.310
Come round here, this is the wheel house.
This is the man that drives the boat.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.460
Apparently he’s pretty good at it, I hope.
Come through here.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.900
That is where we are going. Somewhere on that
thing.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.140
So what time do they serve the drinks and
cheese platters?

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.790
Alright, I will go tell Simon then.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.480
Well there you have it the Sealink barge called
Darwin, why do they call it Darwin? 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:15.059
Cos it lives in Darwin, there you go. Couldn’t
call it Noosa or anything I guess, see ya.
