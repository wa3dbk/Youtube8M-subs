kind<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.820> an<00:02:23.940> interesting<00:02:24.300> idea<00:02:24.690> about<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
kind like an interesting idea about the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.800 
kind like an interesting idea about the
ecology<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> world<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.030> about<00:02:27.180> how<00:02:27.450> we

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
ecology of the world and about how we

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.450 
ecology of the world and about how we
could<00:02:28.080> actually<00:02:28.200> try<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.680> save<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.040> planet<00:02:29.400> I

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
could actually try and save the planet I

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.160 
could actually try and save the planet I
think<00:02:29.640> there<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.880> hidden<00:02:30.150> message<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:31.020> there

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
think there is a hidden message in there

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.220 
think there is a hidden message in there
but<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.620> know<00:02:31.740> don't<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:33.840> need<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.080> look

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
but you know don't do we need to look

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.780 
but you know don't do we need to look
after<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.590> planet<00:02:34.920> more<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.310> all<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.610> you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
after the planet more and all that you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.490 
after the planet more and all that you
know<00:02:35.910> should<00:02:36.300> we<00:02:36.330> actually<00:02:36.630> be<00:02:36.840> more

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
know should we actually be more

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.110 
know should we actually be more
trustworthy<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.430> all<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.760> sort<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.060> stuff

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
trustworthy and all that sort of stuff

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.720 
trustworthy and all that sort of stuff
and<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:40.370> sort<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.430> something<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.640> think

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
and that sort of something I think

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
and that sort of something I think
there's<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.090> kind<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.480> hidden<00:02:42.600> message<00:02:42.810> but

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
there's that kind of hidden message but

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.260 
there's that kind of hidden message but
however<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.070> felt<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.490> as<00:02:44.760> an<00:02:44.880> episode

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
however that I felt like as an episode

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.410 
however that I felt like as an episode
it<00:02:45.540> was<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.690> bit<00:02:46.160> hmm<00:02:47.220> okay<00:02:47.640> don't<00:02:47.970> really<00:02:48.209> but

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
it was a bit hmm okay don't really but

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.780 
it was a bit hmm okay don't really but
however<00:02:48.900> though<00:02:49.140> after<00:02:50.040> three<00:02:50.490> brilliant

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
however though after three brilliant

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.250 
however though after three brilliant
episodes<00:02:51.270> you're<00:02:51.390> bound<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.810> have<00:02:51.930> an<00:02:52.050> episode

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
episodes you're bound to have an episode

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.590 
episodes you're bound to have an episode
there<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:53.459> not<00:02:53.640> gonna<00:02:53.820> be<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.000> great<00:02:54.270> but

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
there it's not gonna be that great but

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.210 
there it's not gonna be that great but
how<00:02:54.750> are<00:02:54.900> though<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.260> think<00:02:55.530> Frank<00:02:55.860> control

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
how are though I think Frank control

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.490 
how are though I think Frank control
boys<00:02:56.430> does<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.270> great<00:02:57.510> job<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.930> building<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
boys does a great job of building the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.949 
boys does a great job of building the
snow<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.459> may<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.180> may<00:03:00.300> be<00:03:00.330> scary<00:03:00.750> but

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
snow that you may think may be scary but

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.480 
snow that you may think may be scary but
it<00:03:01.050> turns<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.650> bit<00:03:01.830> simple<00:03:02.310> though

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
it turns out to be a bit simple though

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.820 
it turns out to be a bit simple though
really<00:03:03.080> I've<00:03:04.080> got<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.320> say<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> performance

I liked the CGI had the forest tower but
I<00:03:27.060> felt<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.390> was<00:03:27.510> kind<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.900> bit

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
I felt that was kind of like a bit

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.620 
I felt that was kind of like a bit
interesting<00:03:28.830> no<00:03:29.010> really<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.400> was<00:03:29.550> very<00:03:30.360> sort

there's<00:04:05.250> loads<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.640> those<00:04:05.790> are<00:04:05.940> different

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
really I think it does raise questions

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.860 
really I think it does raise questions
about<00:04:10.280> society<00:04:11.280> as<00:04:11.519> well<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.180> way<00:04:12.390> that

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
about society as well and the way that

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
we are like maybe with medication about

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.599 
we are like maybe with medication about
how<00:04:15.390> we<00:04:15.450> treat<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.019> planet<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.979> know

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
how we treat the planet in that I know

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.030

it's<00:04:17.820> stupid<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:18.510> that's<00:04:19.470> what<00:04:19.739> I've<00:04:19.859> got

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
it's stupid but that's what I've got

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.920 
it's stupid but that's what I've got
though<00:04:20.220> from<00:04:20.370> watching<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:20.790> episode<00:04:21.330> it's

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
I think this could actually be the most

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.020 
I think this could actually be the most
exciting<00:06:42.240> finale<00:06:42.950> probably<00:06:43.950> sent<00:06:44.250> series<00:06:44.760> for

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
exciting finale probably sent series for

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.770 
exciting finale probably sent series for
though<00:06:45.300> really<00:06:45.570> it<00:06:45.690> was<00:06:45.810> just<00:06:47.300> man<00:06:48.300> I<00:06:48.540> mean<00:06:48.660> I

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
though really it was just man I mean I

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.290 
though really it was just man I mean I
know<00:06:48.840> my<00:06:49.170> um<00:06:49.710> Matt<00:06:50.250> Smith's<00:06:50.640> finales<00:06:51.150> were

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.630 
know my um Matt Smith's finales were
pretty<00:06:51.510> good<00:06:51.660> but<00:06:51.870> this<00:06:52.560> really<00:06:52.980> pulls<00:06:53.340> you<00:06:53.520> in
