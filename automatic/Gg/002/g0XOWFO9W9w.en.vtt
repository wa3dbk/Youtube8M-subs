00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.720 

basically<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:14.040> I'm<00:00:14.130> saying<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.519> it's

basically what I'm saying is it's
actually<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.780> easy<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.109> get<00:00:16.320> fired<00:00:16.590> from<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
actually really easy to get fired from a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.439 
actually really easy to get fired from a
cruise<00:00:17.160> line<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.550> don't<00:00:17.699> want<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.970> scare<00:00:18.180> anyone

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.420 
cruise line I don't want to scare anyone
off<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.439> basically<00:00:19.560> walking<00:00:20.070> on

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
off but you are basically walking on

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.000 
off but you are basically walking on
eggshells<00:00:20.850> quite<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> lot<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> time<00:00:22.050> here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
eggshells quite a lot of the time here

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.679 
eggshells quite a lot of the time here
are<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> reasons<00:00:23.490> why<00:00:24.230> numero<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:26.630> getting<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
are the reasons why numero one getting a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.720 
are the reasons why numero one getting a
bit<00:00:27.840> too<00:00:28.170> close<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> guests

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
bit too close with the guests

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.560 
bit too close with the guests
it's<00:00:30.590> probably<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> obvious<00:00:32.090> least<00:00:33.090> likely

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it's probably the obvious least likely

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
it's probably the obvious least likely
to<00:00:33.600> happen<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.079> people<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:34.950> done<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to happen but people have done it and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.010 
to happen but people have done it and
I've<00:00:35.670> known<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.149> too<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> they<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.660> got

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
I've known them too and they have got

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.889 
I've known them too and they have got
fired<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.760> it<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.300> getting<00:00:39.750> to

everywhere

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.550 
everywhere
it's<00:03:17.850> like<00:03:17.970> Big<00:03:18.150> Brother<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:19.080> on<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.320> ship

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it's like Big Brother but on this ship

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.990 
it's like Big Brother but on this ship
so<00:03:20.420> it's<00:03:21.420> worse<00:03:21.630> than<00:03:21.810> Big<00:03:21.960> Brother<00:03:22.790> there<00:03:23.790> are

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
so it's worse than Big Brother there are

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.330 
so it's worse than Big Brother there are
actually<00:03:24.480> loads<00:03:25.050> more<00:03:25.290> ways<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:26.130> could
