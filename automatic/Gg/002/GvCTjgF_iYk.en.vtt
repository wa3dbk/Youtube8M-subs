and<00:00:18.780> we're<00:00:18.960> today<00:00:19.200> to<00:00:19.410> show<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:20.130> features

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
and we're today to show you the features

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.560 
and we're today to show you the features
of<00:00:20.610> the<00:00:20.970> BM<00:00:21.390> 320<00:00:22.290> cement<00:00:22.920> mixer<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.390> our

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
of the BM 320 cement mixer this is our

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.140 
of the BM 320 cement mixer this is our
largest<00:00:25.110> unit<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.710> currently<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
largest unit that we currently have it

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.440 
largest unit that we currently have it
holds<00:00:27.510> 12<00:00:27.720> cubic<00:00:28.410> feet<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.920> cement

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
holds 12 cubic feet of cement

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.930 
holds 12 cubic feet of cement
it's<00:00:30.779> chain<00:00:31.290> driven<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.190> back<00:00:32.400> here<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it's chain driven on the back here it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.210 
it's chain driven on the back here it
has<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> large<00:00:33.480> sprocket<00:00:34.080> here<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.379> small<00:00:34.920> drive

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
has a large sprocket here a small drive

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.000 
has a large sprocket here a small drive
sprocket<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> end<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.449> drive<00:00:36.690> shaft

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
sprocket on the end of the drive shaft

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
sprocket on the end of the drive shaft
it<00:00:38.010> comes<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> lot<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.030> different<00:00:39.510> holes

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it comes with a lot of different holes

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.880 
it comes with a lot of different holes
here<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.830> here<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:43.080> adjust<00:00:43.590> this

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
here and here so you can adjust this

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.369 
here and here so you can adjust this
properly<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.150> size<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.809> tractor

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
properly for your size of tractor

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.479 
properly for your size of tractor
because<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.340> way<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.699> works<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.329> only

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
because the way this works with only

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.030 
because the way this works with only
with<00:00:50.489> only<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.059> hose<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> do

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
with only one hose this is going to do

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.400 
with only one hose this is going to do
all<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.460> picking<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.540> cement<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.290> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
all the picking up of the cement and the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.799 
all the picking up of the cement and the
weight<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> lowering<00:00:57.450> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
weight is going to do the lowering so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.350 
weight is going to do the lowering so
you<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:58.110> a<00:00:58.140> one-way<00:00:58.620> valve<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:59.460> regular

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
you need a one-way valve or regular

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.569 
you need a one-way valve or regular
remote<00:01:00.780> either<00:01:01.110> way<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.680> only<00:01:01.950> using<00:01:02.340> one

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
remote either way it's only using one

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.510 
remote either way it's only using one
line<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.300> will<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.860> pick<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> back<00:01:05.309> up

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
line which will be to pick it back up

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.170 
line which will be to pick it back up
under<00:01:06.210> pressure<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> weight<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.610> gravity

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
under pressure the weight or gravity

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.080 
under pressure the weight or gravity
will<00:01:09.479> let<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.050> its<00:01:10.080> following<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
will let it do its following so if you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
will let it do its following so if you
don't<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.660> a<00:01:12.690> remote<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.440> your<00:01:13.619> tractor<00:01:13.950> one

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
don't have a remote on your tractor one

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.760 
don't have a remote on your tractor one
other<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.789> you<00:01:14.820> could<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.259> could<00:01:16.289> get

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
other way you could do it you could get

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.040 
other way you could do it you could get
like<00:01:17.039> at<00:01:17.220> northern<00:01:17.580> hydraulics<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.539> somewhere

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
like at northern hydraulics or somewhere

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.199 
like at northern hydraulics or somewhere
you<00:01:19.259> could<00:01:19.440> get<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.979> switches<00:01:20.550> Northern<00:01:20.940> Tool

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.209 
you could get a switches Northern Tool

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.859 
you could get a switches Northern Tool
now<00:01:21.539> you<00:01:22.259> could<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.709> a<00:01:22.979> hand-pump<00:01:23.910> hydraulic

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
now you could get a hand-pump hydraulic

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.380 
now you could get a hand-pump hydraulic
pump<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.440> that<00:01:25.470> would<00:01:26.190> allow<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.819> pick<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
pump and that would allow you to pick it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.660 
pump and that would allow you to pick it
back<00:01:27.569> up<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.709> you<00:01:28.740> would<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.130> open<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
back up and then you would just open the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.550 
back up and then you would just open the
valve<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:30.119> dump<00:01:30.539> it<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.899> case<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.319> don't<00:01:31.440> have

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
valve to dump it in case you don't have

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.760 
valve to dump it in case you don't have
a<00:01:31.709> remote<00:01:32.099> valve<00:01:32.399> on<00:01:32.580> your<00:01:32.759> tractor<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
a remote valve on your tractor so this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.260 
a remote valve on your tractor so this
is<00:01:34.979> 12<00:01:35.250> cubic<00:01:35.729> feet<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.390> cubic<00:01:37.319> yard<00:01:37.349> is<00:01:38.000> 27<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
is 12 cubic feet a cubic yard is 27 so

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.809 
is 12 cubic feet a cubic yard is 27 so
this<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.599> just<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.959> little<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.440> less<00:01:40.770> than<00:01:41.399> 1/2

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
this is just a little bit less than 1/2

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.990 
this is just a little bit less than 1/2
of<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.330> cubic<00:01:42.720> yard<00:01:42.800> so<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:44.039> full<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.580> average

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
of a cubic yard so this full of average

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.139 
of a cubic yard so this full of average
cement<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> wait<00:01:46.380> 15<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.149> 1,800

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
cement is going to wait 15 to 1,800

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.260 
cement is going to wait 15 to 1,800
pounds<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:49.380> completely<00:01:50.069> full<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.060> just

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
pounds when completely full so just

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.180 
pounds when completely full so just
remember<00:01:51.539> that<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:52.080> your<00:01:52.319> tractor<00:01:52.619> how<00:01:53.009> much

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
remember that on your tractor how much

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.040 
remember that on your tractor how much
weight<00:01:53.459> you<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.819> you<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.300> do<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.509> back

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
weight you that you really do have back

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.760 
weight you that you really do have back
here<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.709> because<00:01:56.459> of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.849> way<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.270> works

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
here and because of the way this works

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.620 
here and because of the way this works
this<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.190> be<00:01:59.310> fairly<00:01:59.700> close<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.450> your

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this is going to be fairly close to your

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.350 
this is going to be fairly close to your
tractor<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.830> remember<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> always<00:02:02.700> check<00:02:03.330> your

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
tractor so remember to always check your

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.320 
tractor so remember to always check your
pto<00:02:04.080> length<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:05.190> see<00:02:05.429> if<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.729> need<00:02:05.910> to<00:02:06.030> cut<00:02:06.300> it

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
pto length to see if you need to cut it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.040 
pto length to see if you need to cut it
or<00:02:06.599> not

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
or not

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.290 
or not
before<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.830> put<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.369> when<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.819> real<00:02:09.060> high

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
before you put it on when it's real high

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780 
before you put it on when it's real high
and<00:02:09.630> then<00:02:09.869> lower<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.560> kink<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.160> shaft<00:02:11.459> up

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and then lower it and kink this shaft up
