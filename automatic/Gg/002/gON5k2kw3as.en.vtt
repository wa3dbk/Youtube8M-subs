00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.400
Skipping this guard saves one second.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.480
Walking diagonal is faster.

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:53.018
Redguard is chosen because Adrenaline Rush makes you go fast. Going fast is good.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.400
I'm manipulating where the cursor will appear by looking at a specific spot. The cursor moves around even when it's not visible.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.380
Barbarian is chosen because they go fast.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.080
The Steed is chosen because it makes you go fast.

00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:42.173
This platter is stolen because it's worth a lot. If you drop it before getting caught, you can pick it back up.

00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:47.714
This ring is given Fargoth for a discount at Arrille's Tradehouse.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.520
Using spells is now unlocked, so Adrenaline Rush is used. You can go through the wall here to skip the final part of character generation.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:03.614
2x Scroll of Almsivi Intervention, 1x Scroll of Ondusi's Unhinging, 1x Lockpick

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.660
Fast

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.380
I start walking to regenerate Fatigue.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:32.426
3x Scroll of Icarian Flight, Scroll of Almsivi Intervention is used to to get to Balmora.

00:02:35.243 --> 00:02:38.983
1x Potion of Marking, 1x Potion of Recall, 1x Standard Rising Force Potion

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.740
I use Scroll of Almsivi Intervention to warp to a specific spot.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.720
I use Scroll of Icarian Flight to gain +1000 acrobatics, then aim at a specific pixel and jump.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.080
High (low) Fatigue is required to make this jump.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.440
Another Scroll of Icarian Flight is used just before landing to survive the fall.

00:03:01.468 --> 00:03:06.448
Can't see shit. I use Scroll of Ondusi's Unlocking to unlock this door, then pick up a weapon so I can do something coming up.

00:03:07.382 --> 00:03:13.842
Rapidly switching constant effect weapons makes the effect stack permanently. Keening has Speed, so we go fast.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.660
I use the Standard Rising Force Potion to levitate.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.940
Potion of Marking is used directly above Dagoth Ur in order to teleport back there later.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.940
Going fast means you can go through walls. It's easier to do when transitioning between areas.

00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:35.948
If you switch to a Lockpick before landing a hit, any NPC will die in one hit.

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:42.854
I pick up Sunder and Amulet of Heartheal. The amulet lets me levitate some more.  Potion of Recall is used to get back to Dagoth Ur.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.580
I have thousands of points of Speed at this point.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.820
Sunder and Keening are required to beat the game. I tried to skip them, but it's not possible.

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:15.773
Decent run overall with a really good end. I'll try to get a better time soon.
