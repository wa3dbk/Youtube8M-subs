00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi knew they video test sites 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.000
 to the point like today I you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.040
 presents the organic natural booster test 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 from news which muscle so it's a 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.559
 booster with green tea from guara 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.139
 would therefore give the most energy 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.300
 strength to endurance trainings that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.890
 would help fat loss and that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 would give fishing for the whole day 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.300
 and so I wanted to test 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 so this booster it is different so 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.920
 that one dairy muscles of the different 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.989
 other boosts in particular by the fact that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.790
 it's organic and natural ingredients 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.890
 inside that would increase energy 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.800
 in a gradual way that way a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.530
 long-lasting action and it would avoid 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 controls then at the level of what says 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.860
 the science about it to boost itself 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.080
 bank was constituted obviously I 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.750
 did not say green tea and guarana so 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.989
 both that represents for if I had 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.880
 the 80 mg of caffeine is about 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.559
 so caffeine 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.520
 it's well known for actually 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.380
 increase performance force sa 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.899
 Fight against fatigue is an action 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.649
 long term also so that's 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.410
 interesting 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.960
 on the other hand if we take a coffee only one 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.240
 the optimal dosage would be at 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.300
 around 3 to 6 mg per kilo weight of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.810
 good body green tea 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.149
 we know it is also for the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.619
 fat loss but hey right here it's not 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.580
 too much purpose enough we'll say it'll be a 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.850
 little more and finally guarana on it 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.090
 know it's effective for performance 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.560
 but it's not so much due to the dose of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 caffeine contained inside is this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.880
 that it's mostly actually due to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.340
 other substances 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.600
 after yes and so the hills studies before 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.540
 that a little bit there but we 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.950
 know that guarana does it 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.799
 works very well for 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.630
 performance so tribes this board 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.240
 for use for the effort four to six 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.060
 capsules before the session so pretty much 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.030
 15 minutes while if you want 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.959
 take to be good enough to be good 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.670
 form during the day 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.500
 in this case and advise you to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.350
 also take jules divide the meals 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.120
 so for my part what I was doing 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.750
 is that I took so djl 2 I had 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.310
 the morning of noon and then to have very 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.329
 cute here is at the level where 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.519
 precisely these capsules 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.610
 we know one as usual with these are 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.519
 young people who are very very good quality 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.709
 Panard enough it's not young people who 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.030
 come from badoux after having 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.550
 tested i will give you all so 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.610
 so that my personal opinion it will be we will 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.230
 rather do the opposite for once 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.040
 so I tested good of course I did not 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.569
 not had the effect wow 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.680
 as we say it is to say that by 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.300
 report to other posterers where we 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.500
 could have tingling of the 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.660
 betanine or situations 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.870
 of housing and will obviously have there we have 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.180
 something more natural tone and 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.940
 at least concentrated so I necessarily 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.750
 have not been done at the level of the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.690
 meeting 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.310
 so my test to me is that we 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.230
 works already I will vote very 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.209
 early kind so very little and I can 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.010
 work ten eleven twelve hours a 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.690
 day and then in the evening I have to 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.850
 training so the best way 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.230
 to actually test fit for me 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.900
 the effectiveness of a product he will take it 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.970
 his flight so I have to say that everything 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.470
 first of all it will actually help for 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.300
 fight against fatigue during the 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.730
 day 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.280
 so that was interesting because it 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.900
 great feel about one day 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.300
 normal 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.340
 on the other hand before the meeting it helps me a 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.370
 little energy level for the session 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.630
 but it was not either 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.170
 extraordinary for me that is to say 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.370
 I did not have a session of madness you 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.489
 can chain series that it was 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.440
 too much really relativize to my 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.750
 meaning I consider it rather as a 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.209
 food supplement but we will say 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.070
 santÃ©cois let's say to have a little a 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.220
 to be in shape during the day 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.050
 that we obviously appreciate the side 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.310
 there's no backlash in the end it's 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.090
 nice and we did not either 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.220
 extreme excitement 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.459
 that was so it's nice 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.500
 so I did not have any trouble 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.880
 when I took this natural booster 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.560
 bio so that's the same 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.850
 pleasant 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.340
 so then the highlights of this 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.920
 product first of all so these are the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.980
 ingredients that are natural bio so 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.360
 that's interesting and the practical side 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.340
 do you actually take capsules 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.280
 when you had to take him to work 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.830
 it's more pleasant than powder and 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.120
 finally in the tri muscle crd respect 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.630
 European standards there are 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.460
 controls 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.370
 you also have at the level of qualities 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.140
 data provided by this site we know 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.280
 where does it come from we know what it is 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.660
 that's very nice 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.890
 the weak point of this product so that 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.490
 you will spiked barr perspective 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.710
 so that is to say that if you 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.470
 focus exclusively on 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.040
 caffeine dosages you will find the 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.380
 weak construction knowing that the 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.260
 mouth of the wolf says in his book we have 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.270
 already had positive effects on caffeine 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.510
 with minimal dosages for 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.540
 sportsmen at the level so in this case 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.950
 more at a high level in the sport and 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.070
 the more we are receptive to this kind of 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.260
 stimulants that's it and it's having used 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.840
 also with the effectiveness of guarana 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.400
 since we know it's not just 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.770
 because of caffeine there are substances 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.270
 also angoran who make it work 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.220
 on performance we do not know the 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.240
 findings we do not know for what purpose 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.490
 I did not find to give 1 by 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.080
 compared to the minimum quantities and that's 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.300
 so do not hesitate to give me if 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.770
 you have it's so interesting so 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.169
 so here I would say it's a 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.330
 product is not bad for those who 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.310
 precisely and the sportsmen who write to me 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.720
 and who ask me to have little ones 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.370
 booster that could allow them to 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.160
 to resist a little more to fatigue 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.690
 during a session and while being sure 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.640
 that there are no doping products to 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.880
 inside so here listen it's a 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.440
 product that can be perfect for them 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.450
 it is also an ideal product for 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.410
 those who are precisely about 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.850
 troubles when they take 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.070
 dietary supplements therefore 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.820
 booster a little more enriched in others 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.530
 ingredients so so here is to 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.790
 listen to that's all for me and I say to 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.390
 very soon on video test to the point 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.390
 like hi
