00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.730 
about the fact that he didn't propose
and<00:02:01.520> he<00:02:01.820> didn't<00:02:02.119> say<00:02:02.420> he<00:02:02.869> loved<00:02:03.170> him<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.590> is

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
and he didn't say he loved him this is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.480 
and he didn't say he loved him this is
the<00:02:03.859> Juan<00:02:04.039> Pablo<00:02:04.520> bachelor<00:02:05.030> with<00:02:05.299> Nikki<00:02:05.719> and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the Juan Pablo bachelor with Nikki and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.389 
the Juan Pablo bachelor with Nikki and
actually<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:08.180> reality<00:02:08.770> that's<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:10.070> correct

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
actually in reality that's the correct

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.280 
actually in reality that's the correct
thing<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.880> think<00:02:11.090> because<00:02:11.420> everybody<00:02:11.810> watches

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
thing I think because everybody watches

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.720 
thing I think because everybody watches
so<00:02:12.410> many<00:02:12.590> episodes<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.130> The<00:02:13.220> Bachelor<00:02:13.580> where

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
so many episodes of The Bachelor where

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.160 
so many episodes of The Bachelor where
they<00:02:13.820> do<00:02:13.880> say<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.180> love<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.599> but<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:14.989> they

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
they do say I love you but then they

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.589 
they do say I love you but then they
break<00:02:15.500> up<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.980> few<00:02:16.190> months<00:02:16.459> later<00:02:16.610> which<00:02:17.360> goes

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
break up a few months later which goes

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.600 
break up a few months later which goes
to<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.900> point<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.260> was<00:02:18.410> making<00:02:18.800> earlier

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
to the point that I was making earlier

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.710 
to the point that I was making earlier
then<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:20.150> don't<00:02:20.360> know<00:02:20.720> what<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.260> feel<00:02:21.650> truly

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
then you don't know what you feel truly

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.810 
then you don't know what you feel truly
until<00:02:23.720> you've<00:02:23.960> gotten<00:02:24.620> enough<00:02:25.100> time<00:02:25.460> and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
until you've gotten enough time and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.780 
until you've gotten enough time and
you're<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:27.470> know<00:02:27.590> you've<00:02:27.860> relaxed<00:02:28.460> into<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
you're you know you've relaxed into the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.730 
you're you know you've relaxed into the
relationship<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:30.140> feel<00:02:30.410> your<00:02:30.590> real

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
relationship and you feel your real

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.510 
relationship and you feel your real
feelings<00:02:31.270> so<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.600> think<00:02:32.960> if<00:02:33.470> someone's<00:02:34.130> telling

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
feelings so I think if someone's telling

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.820 
feelings so I think if someone's telling
you<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.910> they<00:02:35.060> love<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.420> within<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.590> first
