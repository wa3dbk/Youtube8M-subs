00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the last part of the mod you can see

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.110 
the last part of the mod you can see
there's<00:03:04.680> snow<00:03:05.010> Pegasus<00:03:05.580> which<00:03:05.790> was<00:03:05.940> there

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
there's snow Pegasus which was there

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.330 
there's snow Pegasus which was there
before<00:03:06.270> but<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.780> was<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.230> snow<00:03:07.650> horse<00:03:08.010> it

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
before but it was not a snow horse it

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.850 
before but it was not a snow horse it
was<00:03:08.490> only<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.730> dirt<00:03:08.970> horse<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:09.960> there's<00:03:10.110> no<00:03:10.230> dirt

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
was only a dirt horse so there's no dirt

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.460 
was only a dirt horse so there's no dirt
and<00:03:11.160> snow<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.610> birth<00:03:11.820> which<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.020> made<00:03:13.260> by

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
and snow of birth which is just made by

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.560 
and snow of birth which is just made by
doing<00:03:13.740> this<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.160> left<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:14.940> with<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
doing this on the left but with the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.080 
doing this on the left but with the
correspondent<00:03:16.350> things<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:17.640> makes<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
correspondent things so this makes the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.090 
correspondent things so this makes the
Pegasus<00:03:18.540> move<00:03:18.870> with<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.110> feather<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.830> makes

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
Pegasus move with a feather and it makes

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.820 
Pegasus move with a feather and it makes
a<00:03:20.280> normal<00:03:20.670> horse<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.690> with<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.959> dirt<00:03:22.170> makes<00:03:22.620> a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
a normal horse so with the dirt makes a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.570 
a normal horse so with the dirt makes a
dirt<00:03:23.190> horse<00:03:23.490> if<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:24.720> use<00:03:24.930> grass<00:03:25.709> which<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.400> the

dirt horse if we use grass which is the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.050 
dirt horse if we use grass which is the
long<00:03:26.730> grass<00:03:27.000> which<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.570> grabbed<00:03:27.810> this

long grass which I just grabbed this

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.320 
long grass which I just grabbed this
