00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.540
 voodoo 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.950
 Yes Fish Arrow no 1 condition is a series that this Vestol is a series 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.880
 Was viewed 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:21.770
 It will be a hard plug This is to commemorate the 12th anniversary of live-action 12th anniversary 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.480
 And what Well but I plug to make Well 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:30.210
 Although the list price is 1,200 yen without everything, it is 0 in the form of tax-included 1260 yen 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.510
 8 is amazing affordable 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.540
 But I want to explain a little because it is a hard plug with a solid concept 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.080
 I will 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:45.100
 Well lure that will be zero first is vibration 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:51.160
 It is this vibration called the best vibe, but the concept is 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.750
 Mari Tteyuu more constant layer can also attract easy to Town Hall of Atri lift &amp; Fall 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.830
 Also added action element 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.530
 It is width as can be seen When asked to look at vibration is a normal vibration 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.040
 Seki compared 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:09.140
 There Zudon and is thick because this boil Thus pull resistance is easy to understand firmly 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.860
 Slow even beginners is has become such a way that say pull easy to a certain layer 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.520
 Also head I'll say to more action in retrieving 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:22.380
 It is shaped to receive water, and if you debate it, take a good balance 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.170
 So during the lift and fall the civil hall and such an example vibrate like this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 It's a vibration like this 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:35.729
 The Tteyuu catch in that lift and fall is here so I guess in this case 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:39.570
 I Pudesu ended up best this took quite a large side flat surface of the body 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.340
 It was a shut, so it was a time of unity 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.159
 Likely is a more fairly large flushing say I dart the moment of flushing 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.969
 That's fine 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:55.090
 One concept is to stop the aspen sound 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:59.319
 Fairly thin Nde even compared to Atorippu gold car Nari is a thin anywhere in the sugar 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:04.780
 As we say that more crisp action is transmitted firmly 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.180
 I understand that even the beginners are moving more and it works 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.909
 Cheap 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.190
 And here too 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:17.400
 Best Chateau come this year in the shut-in is recommended for beginners Intermediate 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:20.460
 The best please try mastering the best Ruashizu 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.460
 voodoo
