is<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.360> block<00:02:41.600> one<00:02:42.080> eye<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.890> don't<00:02:43.220> see<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
is to block one eye so you don't see the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.880 
is to block one eye so you don't see the
frame<00:02:43.850> meant<00:02:44.330> for<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.630> correct<00:02:44.960> I<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.680> does

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
frame meant for the correct I it does

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.860 
frame meant for the correct I it does
this<00:02:46.070> like<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.370> really<00:02:46.670> insane<00:02:47.300> rates<00:02:47.630> like

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
this like it really insane rates like

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.630 
this like it really insane rates like
this<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.620> brain<00:02:48.830> is<00:02:49.040> thinking<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.520> it's

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
this so the brain is thinking that it's

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.940
