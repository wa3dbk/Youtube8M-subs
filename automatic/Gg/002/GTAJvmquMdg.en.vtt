00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
take this mounting hardware here and we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
take this mounting hardware here and we
actually<00:01:13.229> slide<00:01:13.710> these<00:01:14.600> nuts<00:01:15.600> through<00:01:16.880> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
actually slide these nuts through and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.170 
actually slide these nuts through and
we'll<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.650> four<00:01:19.650> times<00:01:20.030> now<00:01:21.030> I've

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
we'll do that four times now I've

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
we'll do that four times now I've
already<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.750> tools<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.100> makes

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
already got my tools out so this makes

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.690 
already got my tools out so this makes
it<00:01:23.520> pretty<00:01:23.880> simple<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> will<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> twice

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
it pretty simple so I will do that twice

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.200 
it pretty simple so I will do that twice
on<00:01:26.939> each<00:01:27.090> side<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.930> two<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> those<00:01:29.210> now

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
on each side and I have two of those now

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.819 
on each side and I have two of those now
you<00:01:30.810> don't<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.170> tighten<00:01:31.409> these<00:01:31.619> too

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
point for our windshield I say I'm just

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:16.539

kind of loosely fitting everything and
I'm<00:03:16.880> going<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.360> exactly<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.989> same

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
I'm going to do it exactly the same

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.670 
I'm going to do it exactly the same
place<00:03:18.500> on<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.100> other<00:03:19.220> side<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:21.350> I<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.650> our

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
place on the other side so I have our

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.170 
place on the other side so I have our
clamps<00:03:21.980> installed<00:03:22.430> on<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.670> bars<00:03:22.850> just

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
clamps installed on the bars just

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.789 
clamps installed on the bars just
loosely<00:03:23.510> they<00:03:23.690> can<00:03:23.840> still<00:03:24.049> pivot<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.560> still

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
loosely they can still pivot and still

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.440 
loosely they can still pivot and still
move<00:03:25.010> they're<00:03:25.340> not<00:03:25.370> clamping<00:03:25.850> down<00:03:25.940> too<00:03:26.150> tight

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
move they're not clamping down too tight

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.400 
move they're not clamping down too tight
and<00:03:27.290> I'm<00:03:27.380> going<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.530> try<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.739> slide<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.160> arms

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
and I'm going to try to slide the arms

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.759 
and I'm going to try to slide the arms

here into our mounting bar mounting

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.509 
here into our mounting bar mounting
locations<00:03:34.959> that's<00:03:35.959> pretty<00:03:36.380> easy<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:37.280> one

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
locations that's pretty easy this one

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.130 
locations that's pretty easy this one
here<00:03:37.730> is<00:03:37.910> going<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.239> go<00:03:38.329> underneath<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.930> brake

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
here is going to go underneath the brake

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.270 
here is going to go underneath the brake
line<00:03:39.410> on<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.709> drz<00:03:41.829> now<00:03:42.829> I<00:03:42.859> have<00:03:43.010> everything

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
line on the drz now I have everything

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.140 
line on the drz now I have everything
very<00:03:43.910> loosely<00:03:44.390> held<00:03:45.049> in<00:03:45.260> place<00:03:45.560> here<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:46.150> can

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
very loosely held in place here I can

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.479 
very loosely held in place here I can
adjust<00:03:47.329> a<00:03:47.630> height<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.230> can<00:03:48.380> adjust<00:03:48.739> tilt<00:03:49.190> on<00:03:49.400> the

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
adjust a height I can adjust tilt on the

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.460 
adjust a height I can adjust tilt on the
screen<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:50.120> can<00:03:50.329> allow<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> little<00:03:50.870> bit<00:03:50.959> air<00:03:51.200> flow

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
screen I can allow a little bit air flow

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.860 
screen I can allow a little bit air flow
underneath<00:03:51.799> I<00:03:52.250> can<00:03:52.940> even<00:03:53.239> drop<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.630> down<00:03:53.810> a

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
underneath I can even drop it down a

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.640 
underneath I can even drop it down a
little<00:03:54.200> bit<00:03:54.410> so<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.280> got<00:03:55.489> lots<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.910> different

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
little bit so I got lots of different

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.349 
little bit so I got lots of different
positions<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:58.040> can<00:03:58.220> set<00:03:58.459> this<00:03:58.579> windscreen<00:03:59.150> in

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
positions I can set this windscreen in

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.539 
positions I can set this windscreen in
so<00:04:00.200> I'm<00:04:00.440> going<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.620> try<00:04:00.829> somewhere<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.459> the

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
so I'm going to try somewhere in the

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.800 
so I'm going to try somewhere in the
middle<00:04:01.819> because<00:04:02.090> I'm<00:04:02.180> not<00:04:02.329> sure<00:04:02.540> exactly

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
middle because I'm not sure exactly

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.610 
middle because I'm not sure exactly
where<00:04:03.109> I<00:04:03.140> want<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.590> I'm<00:04:04.340> going<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.489> tighten<00:04:04.880> our

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
where I want it I'm going to tighten our

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.349 
where I want it I'm going to tighten our
mounting<00:04:06.620> points<00:04:06.920> down<00:04:07.130> go<00:04:07.850> for<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> bit<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.209> a

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
mounting points down go for a bit of a

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.970 
mounting points down go for a bit of a
ride<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.019> likely<00:04:09.530> make<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.709> few

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
ride and and likely make a few

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.949

adjustments<00:04:10.069> on<00:04:10.700> this<00:04:10.910> like<00:04:11.630> I<00:04:11.660> said<00:04:11.690> there's

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
adjustments on this like I said there's

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.000 
adjustments on this like I said there's
