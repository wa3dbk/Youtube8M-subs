Donegal silks and how fast are we going

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.580 
Donegal silks and how fast are we going
a<00:02:17.730> poll<00:02:18.510> hope<00:02:18.690> were<00:02:18.840> hopefully<00:02:19.320> we're<00:02:19.500> in

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
a poll hope were hopefully we're in

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
a poll hope were hopefully we're in
front<00:02:20.750> if<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.840> can<00:02:22.160> history<00:02:23.160> repeats<00:02:23.490> itself

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
front if you can history repeats itself

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.400 
front if you can history repeats itself
if<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.030> seldom<00:02:24.540> get<00:02:24.690> caught<00:02:24.900> passing<00:02:25.110> the

if the seldom get caught passing the
quarter<00:02:25.680> Pole<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.960> think<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.110> important<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
quarter Pole I think it's important to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.580 
quarter Pole I think it's important to
have<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.280> my<00:02:29.730> head<00:02:30.000> knowing<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.900> you

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
have that in my head knowing that you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.350

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
almost got act as if the corner pole is

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.700 
almost got act as if the corner pole is
the<00:02:33.390> wire<00:02:33.720> because<00:02:34.080> there's<00:02:34.320> not<00:02:34.470> usually

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
the wire because there's not usually

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.200
