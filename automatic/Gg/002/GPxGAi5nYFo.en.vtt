the<00:01:05.640> Leslie<00:01:05.939> pedal<00:01:06.270> we've<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> stereo

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the Leslie pedal we've got a stereo

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.899 
the Leslie pedal we've got a stereo
input<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.070> case<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.430> running<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> mono

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
input in this case I'm running a mono

input in this case I'm running a mono
cable<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.810> works<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.170> fine

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
cable into that and it works just fine

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
cable into that and it works just fine
you'd<00:01:10.920> use<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.310> stereo<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you'd use it in stereo if you have a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
you'd use it in stereo if you have a
stereo<00:01:12.330> guitar<00:01:12.630> signal<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.439> you're

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
stereo guitar signal or if you're

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.870 
stereo guitar signal or if you're
dealing<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:13.979> electronic<00:01:14.430> keyboard<00:01:14.580> that

you're routing through the pedal we have

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.770 
you're routing through the pedal we have
a<00:01:16.979> 6<00:01:17.220> DB<00:01:17.369> gain<00:01:17.700> boost<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.390> useful<00:01:18.689> when

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
a 6 DB gain boost which is useful when

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.969 
a 6 DB gain boost which is useful when
you're<00:01:18.900> playing<00:01:19.110> guitar<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> bring<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you're playing guitar to bring it up to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.080 
you're playing guitar to bring it up to
a<00:01:20.009> level<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.369> more<00:01:20.640> similar<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
a level that's more similar to a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
a level that's more similar to a
keyboard<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> cu1<00:01:23.130> input<00:01:23.520> jack

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

now I go to the 18 V this is the

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.280 
now I go to the 18 V this is the

other<00:04:06.080> ones<00:04:06.290> have<00:04:06.530> it's<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:06.980> little<00:04:07.130> bit

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
other ones have it's a little bit

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.840 
other ones have it's a little bit
cleaner<00:04:07.550> sound<00:04:07.819> a<00:04:08.030> little<00:04:08.120> bit<00:04:08.330> smoother<00:04:12.850> when

cleaner sound a little bit smoother when
we<00:04:13.970> go<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.300> pr<00:04:14.540> 40<00:04:15.019> that's<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.590> original

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
we go to the pr 40 that's the original

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.240 
we go to the pr 40 that's the original
organ<00:04:16.280> tone<00:04:16.489> box

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.920 

you<00:04:22.880> can<00:04:23.000> hear<00:04:23.180> it's<00:04:23.270> shaping<00:04:23.480> our<00:04:23.720> sound

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
you can hear it's shaping our sound

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.150 
you can hear it's shaping our sound
we're<00:04:24.170> getting<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.440> effect<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.830> that<00:04:24.920> tube

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
we're getting the effect of that tube

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.470 
we're getting the effect of that tube
amplifier<00:04:30.310> let's<00:04:31.310> go<00:04:31.430> back<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:31.730> 147<00:04:32.390> and

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
amplifier let's go back to the 147 and

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.990 
amplifier let's go back to the 147 and
look<00:04:32.570> at<00:04:32.660> what<00:04:32.750> some<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.020> controls<00:04:33.350> do<00:04:34.000> so

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
look at what some of the controls do so

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.470 
look at what some of the controls do so
here's<00:04:35.210> our<00:04:35.330> fast<00:04:35.600> speed<00:04:36.880> if<00:04:37.880> we<00:04:38.030> hit<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.270> slow

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
here's our fast speed if we hit the slow

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.240 
here's our fast speed if we hit the slow
fast<00:04:38.720> button<00:04:39.140> it<00:04:39.560> will<00:04:39.650> slow<00:04:39.890> down<00:04:40.040> to<00:04:40.160> the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
fast button it will slow down to the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.050 
fast button it will slow down to the
slow<00:04:40.460> speed<00:04:40.730> of<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.910> Leslie<00:04:45.790> now<00:04:46.790> this<00:04:46.940> is

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
slow speed of the Leslie now this is

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.670 
slow speed of the Leslie now this is
what<00:04:47.210> was<00:04:47.330> called<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.630> chorale<00:04:47.960> sound<00:04:48.380> on<00:04:48.590> an

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
what was called the chorale sound on an

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.850 

it's<00:05:02.480> a<00:05:02.510> nice<00:05:02.660> combination<00:05:02.930> of<00:05:03.350> chorus<00:05:03.680> and

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
it's a nice combination of chorus and

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.290 
it's a nice combination of chorus and
flange<00:05:04.130> as<00:05:04.400> we<00:05:04.490> get<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.700> effect<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.030> those<00:05:05.120> two

rotors<00:05:05.660> turning<00:05:05.870> very<00:05:06.200> slowly<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:07.040> we<00:05:07.130> have

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
rotors turning very slowly and we have

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.470 
rotors turning very slowly and we have
the<00:05:07.400> distortion<00:05:07.790> that's<00:05:07.910> coming<00:05:08.180> in<00:05:08.270> from<00:05:08.300> the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
the distortion that's coming in from the

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.940 
the distortion that's coming in from the
overdrive<00:05:08.870> control<00:05:09.290> we<00:05:09.590> can<00:05:09.740> turn<00:05:09.890> that<00:05:10.040> up<00:05:14.950> or

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
overdrive control we can turn that up or

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:24.970 
overdrive control we can turn that up or
bring<00:05:16.130> it<00:05:16.220> back<00:05:16.370> for<00:05:16.580> a<00:05:16.610> cleaner<00:05:16.880> sound<00:05:23.920> now<00:05:24.920> we

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
bring it back for a cleaner sound now we

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.650 
bring it back for a cleaner sound now we
have<00:05:25.130> control<00:05:25.460> over<00:05:25.640> how<00:05:25.760> fast<00:05:25.790> we<00:05:26.180> transition

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
have control over how fast we transition

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.210 
have control over how fast we transition
from<00:05:26.690> slow<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.080> fast<00:05:27.200> here<00:05:27.710> I've<00:05:27.800> got<00:05:27.950> it<00:05:27.980> set

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
from slow to fast here I've got it set

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.440 
from slow to fast here I've got it set
the<00:05:28.340> way<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:28.610> would<00:05:28.760> be<00:05:28.880> with<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.120> original

the way that would be with the original
cabinet<00:05:29.870> we<00:05:30.260> can<00:05:30.410> speed<00:05:30.620> that<00:05:30.740> up<00:05:30.800> just<00:05:31.070> a

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
cabinet we can speed that up just a

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.740 
cabinet we can speed that up just a
little<00:05:31.160> bit<00:05:31.430> if<00:05:31.520> we<00:05:31.550> like<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.120> go<00:05:32.300> from<00:05:32.480> slow

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
little bit if we like and go from slow

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:43.300 
little bit if we like and go from slow
to<00:05:35.950> fast<00:05:41.200> now<00:05:42.200> the<00:05:42.260> distance<00:05:42.590> control<00:05:42.920> has<00:05:43.190> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
to fast now the distance control has the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.680 
to fast now the distance control has the
effect<00:05:43.520> of<00:05:43.580> determining<00:05:44.030> how<00:05:44.150> far<00:05:44.390> away<00:05:44.570> the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
effect of determining how far away the

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.360 
effect of determining how far away the
microphone<00:05:45.110> is<00:05:45.230> from<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.470> cabinet<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.040> the

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
microphone is from the cabinet and the

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.160 
microphone is from the cabinet and the
result<00:05:46.700> of<00:05:46.850> this<00:05:46.940> in<00:05:47.090> an<00:05:47.150> audio<00:05:47.420> standpoint<00:05:47.960> is

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
result of this in an audio standpoint is

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.750 
result of this in an audio standpoint is
it<00:05:48.440> smooths<00:05:48.740> out<00:05:48.890> a<00:05:48.950> bit<00:05:49.190> of<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.400> choppiness

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
it smooths out a bit of the choppiness

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.610 
it smooths out a bit of the choppiness
of<00:05:50.000> those<00:05:50.120> rotors<00:05:50.360> spinning<00:05:50.720> so<00:05:51.290> if<00:05:51.380> we<00:05:51.470> put

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
of those rotors spinning so if we put

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.090 
of those rotors spinning so if we put
that<00:05:51.650> very<00:05:51.980> close<00:05:56.590> you<00:05:57.590> can<00:05:57.710> really<00:05:58.010> hear

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
that very close you can really hear

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.040 
that very close you can really hear
those<00:05:58.280> rotors<00:05:58.520> turning<00:05:58.850> if<00:05:59.360> we<00:05:59.510> turn<00:05:59.720> that<00:05:59.870> too

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
those rotors turning if we turn that too

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.450 
those rotors turning if we turn that too
far<00:06:00.260> away<00:06:00.500> which<00:06:00.680> would<00:06:00.740> be<00:06:00.890> about<00:06:01.070> three<00:06:01.310> feet

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
far away which would be about three feet

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.180 
far away which would be about three feet
away<00:06:01.580> from<00:06:01.670> the<00:06:01.880> cabinet<00:06:05.710> it's<00:06:06.710> a<00:06:06.800> smoother

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
away from the cabinet it's a smoother

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.440 
away from the cabinet it's a smoother
sound<00:06:07.370> with<00:06:07.520> a<00:06:07.580> little<00:06:07.760> bit<00:06:07.850> more<00:06:08.000> of<00:06:08.060> a<00:06:08.120> chorus

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
sound with a little bit more of a chorus

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.300 
sound with a little bit more of a chorus
effect<00:06:08.570> to<00:06:08.960> it<00:06:09.080> we<00:06:09.590> also<00:06:09.740> have<00:06:09.920> control<00:06:10.280> over

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
effect to it we also have control over

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.890 
effect to it we also have control over
the<00:06:10.550> mix<00:06:10.730> of<00:06:10.850> our<00:06:10.910> virtual<00:06:11.240> cabinet<00:06:11.690> we<00:06:11.780> can

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
the mix of our virtual cabinet we can

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.630 
the mix of our virtual cabinet we can
turn<00:06:12.080> that<00:06:12.200> down<00:06:15.160> or<00:06:16.160> bring<00:06:16.310> it<00:06:16.430> all<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.550> way

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
turn that down or bring it all the way

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.309 
turn that down or bring it all the way
up

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
up

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:24.549

I<00:06:22.300> like<00:06:23.300> it<00:06:23.389> about<00:06:23.569> in<00:06:23.689> the<00:06:23.749> middle<00:06:24.050> most<00:06:24.409> of

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:24.559 
I like it about in the middle most of

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:25.779 
I like it about in the middle most of
these<00:06:24.619> controls<00:06:25.009> sound<00:06:25.219> most<00:06:25.490> like<00:06:25.699> the

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
these controls sound most like the

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.010 
these controls sound most like the
original<00:06:26.149> cabinet<00:06:26.479> when<00:06:26.599> you're<00:06:26.719> set<00:06:26.869> about

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
original cabinet when you're set about

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:41.019 
original cabinet when you're set about
250<00:06:27.439> percent<00:06:27.589> or<00:06:27.889> about<00:06:28.039> 12<00:06:28.339> o'clock<00:06:39.879> our<00:06:40.879> last

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029 
250 percent or about 12 o'clock our last

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:42.850 
250 percent or about 12 o'clock our last
control<00:06:41.419> is<00:06:41.539> a<00:06:41.569> break<00:06:41.869> switch<00:06:42.169> in<00:06:42.529> the<00:06:42.649> breaks

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
control is a break switch in the breaks

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.769 
control is a break switch in the breaks
which<00:06:43.099> stops<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:43.699> rotation<00:06:44.210> of<00:06:44.330> the<00:06:44.479> rotors

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779 
which stops the rotation of the rotors

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.989 
which stops the rotation of the rotors
within<00:06:45.080> the<00:06:45.199> cabinet<00:06:45.649> now<00:06:46.129> on<00:06:46.279> a<00:06:46.309> real<00:06:46.520> leslie

those<00:06:47.360> would<00:06:47.569> stop<00:06:47.779> at<00:06:47.899> some<00:06:48.080> random<00:06:48.259> point

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:48.499 
those would stop at some random point

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:50.019 
those would stop at some random point
but<00:06:49.009> here<00:06:49.159> they've<00:06:49.279> set<00:06:49.430> it<00:06:49.460> up<00:06:49.610> so<00:06:49.729> they<00:06:49.819> stop

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:50.029 
but here they've set it up so they stop

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:51.189 
but here they've set it up so they stop
at<00:06:50.180> the<00:06:50.240> center<00:06:50.539> point<00:06:50.689> which<00:06:50.869> is<00:06:50.959> a<00:06:50.990> much<00:06:51.169> more

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
at the center point which is a much more

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:59.930 
at the center point which is a much more
usable<00:06:51.800> tone

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.620 

and<00:07:00.940> you<00:07:01.030> can<00:07:01.150> hear<00:07:01.270> the<00:07:01.360> rotors

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
and you can hear the rotors

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.000 
and you can hear the rotors
realistically<00:07:02.260> speed<00:07:02.500> up<00:07:02.620> when<00:07:02.740> you<00:07:02.800> turn
