00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
that go along with it and the question

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.109 
that go along with it and the question
the<00:02:06.350> body<00:02:06.529> count<00:02:06.770> stuff<00:02:07.100> also<00:02:07.340> was<00:02:08.090> a

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the body count stuff also was a

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.559 
the body count stuff also was a
something<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.289> consider<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.550> they<00:02:11.300> may

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
something to consider that they may

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.660 
something to consider that they may
release<00:02:12.520> costume<00:02:13.520> DLC<00:02:14.180> or<00:02:14.209> gear<00:02:14.750> DLC<00:02:15.670> with

release costume DLC or gear DLC with

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
with the DLC packs now my first

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.160 
with the DLC packs now my first
inclination

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
inclination

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.140 
inclination
is<00:02:21.230> too<00:02:21.530> very<00:02:21.740> much<00:02:21.800> quickly<00:02:22.280> hope<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.970> they

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
is too very much quickly hope that they

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.300 
is too very much quickly hope that they
don't<00:02:23.330> do<00:02:23.630> micro<00:02:24.020> transactions<00:02:24.830> as<00:02:25.010> they've

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
don't do micro transactions as they've

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.570 
don't do micro transactions as they've
done<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> past<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:27.800> know<00:02:27.830> we've<00:02:28.160> seen

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
done in the past you know we've seen

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.309 
done in the past you know we've seen
that<00:02:28.760> with<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.970> camels<00:02:29.420> from<00:02:29.599> black<00:02:29.810> ops<00:02:30.050> 2

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
that with the camels from black ops 2

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.710 
that with the camels from black ops 2
and<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.310> was<00:02:31.819> really<00:02:32.120> disappointed<00:02:32.209> with

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
and and I was really disappointed with

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.390 
and and I was really disappointed with
that<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.840> actually<00:02:33.080> made<00:02:33.349> a<00:02:33.380> video<00:02:33.590> saying<00:02:34.040> that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
that I actually made a video saying that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.790 
that I actually made a video saying that
I<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:35.209> didn't<00:02:35.569> like<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.750> concept<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.590> thought

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
I I didn't like that concept I thought

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.530 
I I didn't like that concept I thought
it<00:02:36.890> was<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.040> money<00:02:37.250> grab<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.819> think<00:02:38.239> they<00:02:38.360> could

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
it was a money grab I think they could

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.720 
it was a money grab I think they could
have<00:02:38.569> just<00:02:38.660> thrown<00:02:39.050> those<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.530> as<00:02:39.770> new

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
have just thrown those in as new

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.850 
have just thrown those in as new
achievements<00:02:41.420> new<00:02:41.569> things<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.080> unlock<00:02:42.590> and

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
achievements new things to unlock and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.770 
achievements new things to unlock and
just<00:02:43.190> kind<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.400> creates<00:02:43.760> extra<00:02:44.030> life<00:02:44.330> cycle<00:02:44.720> to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
just kind of creates extra life cycle to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.320 
just kind of creates extra life cycle to
the<00:02:44.810> game<00:02:45.020> but<00:02:45.200> instead<00:02:45.560> they<00:02:46.150> made<00:02:47.150> them

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
the game but instead they made them

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.880 
the game but instead they made them
something<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.959> buy<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:48.709> if

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
something that you just buy and so if

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.229 
something that you just buy and so if
you<00:02:48.920> throw<00:02:49.190> money<00:02:49.340> down<00:02:49.580> then<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.850> have<00:02:50.030> them

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
you throw money down then you have them

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.000 
you throw money down then you have them
and<00:02:50.420> it's<00:02:50.540> not<00:02:50.720> really<00:02:50.989> adding<00:02:51.140> longevity<00:02:51.709> to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
and it's not really adding longevity to

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.460 
and it's not really adding longevity to
the<00:02:52.099> game<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.459> more<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:54.050> paying<00:02:54.380> for

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
the game it's more just you paying for

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.050 
the game it's more just you paying for
personalization<00:02:55.220> which<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.730> little<00:02:55.910> bit

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
personalization which is a little bit

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.270 
personalization which is a little bit
lame<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.900> really<00:02:57.380> hope<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.739> they<00:02:57.890> don't<00:02:58.010> go

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
lame so I really hope that they don't go

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.449 
lame so I really hope that they don't go
that<00:02:58.550> route<00:02:58.880> with<00:02:59.590> this<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:00.890> concept<00:03:01.160> but

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
that route with this kind of concept but

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.740 
that route with this kind of concept but
I<00:03:01.519> really<00:03:01.819> hope<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.090> they<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.299> this<00:03:02.569> because

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
I really hope that they do this because

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.100 
I really hope that they do this because
there<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.080> seems<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.620> be<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.769> lot<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.040> space<00:03:04.430> for

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
there is seems to be a lot of space for

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.150 
there is seems to be a lot of space for
especially<00:03:06.110> with<00:03:06.230> next-gen<00:03:06.650> there's<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.010> much

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
especially with next-gen there's so much

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.559 
especially with next-gen there's so much
room<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.519> those<00:03:07.670> consoles<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.420> those

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
room on those consoles and on those

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.750 
room on those consoles and on those
disks<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:09.500> much<00:03:09.650> computing<00:03:10.040> power<00:03:10.100> I

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
disks and so much computing power I

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.630 
disks and so much computing power I
don't<00:03:11.450> see<00:03:11.600> why<00:03:11.630> we<00:03:11.900> couldn't<00:03:12.019> have<00:03:12.290> more<00:03:12.640> DLC

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
don't see why we couldn't have more DLC

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.300 
don't see why we couldn't have more DLC
guns<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.209> then<00:03:14.390> why<00:03:14.569> you<00:03:14.630> couldn't<00:03:15.019> have<00:03:15.310> you

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
guns and then why you couldn't have you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.449 
guns and then why you couldn't have you
know<00:03:16.340> regular<00:03:16.819> new<00:03:17.950> costume<00:03:18.950> content

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
know regular new costume content

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.190 
know regular new costume content
especially<00:03:20.060> considering<00:03:20.780> they're<00:03:20.900> adding

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
especially considering they're adding

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.500 
especially considering they're adding
that<00:03:21.290> much<00:03:21.350> customization<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:22.580> game<00:03:22.819> you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
that much customization to this game you

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.840 
that much customization to this game you
know<00:03:23.650> what<00:03:24.650> do<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.769> guys<00:03:24.920> think<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.459> think<00:03:25.670> it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
know what do you guys think you think it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.940 
know what do you guys think you think it
would<00:03:25.970> be<00:03:26.090> cool<00:03:26.299> if<00:03:26.359> we<00:03:26.540> got<00:03:26.900> more<00:03:27.350> different

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
would be cool if we got more different

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.849 
would be cool if we got more different
suits<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.850> different<00:03:29.630> gear<00:03:30.200> maybe<00:03:30.530> even

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
suits and different gear maybe even

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.560 
suits and different gear maybe even
