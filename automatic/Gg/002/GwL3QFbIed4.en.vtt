00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.310 
steps it takes about 20 a good 20 25
minutes<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:12.700> kind<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.970> just<00:01:13.150> guess<00:01:13.930> I'd<00:01:14.110> have<00:01:14.140> a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
minutes so kind of just guess I'd have a

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.560 
minutes so kind of just guess I'd have a
drink<00:01:14.620> keep<00:01:14.770> your<00:01:14.890> eye<00:01:14.950> on<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:15.370> and<00:01:15.570> we're

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
drink keep your eye on it and we're

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.240 
drink keep your eye on it and we're
going<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:16.750> keep<00:01:16.870> flipping<00:01:17.290> them<00:01:17.440> so<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.100> goal

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
going to keep flipping them so the goal

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.670 
going to keep flipping them so the goal
is<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.430> get<00:01:18.640> them<00:01:18.820> black<00:01:19.150> black<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.440> mean<00:01:20.620> you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
is to get them black black so I mean you

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.110 
is to get them black black so I mean you
can't<00:01:20.890> really<00:01:21.070> mess<00:01:21.340> it<00:01:21.370> up<00:01:21.550> right<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:21.909> want

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
can't really mess it up right you want

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.550 
can't really mess it up right you want
to<00:01:22.240> actually<00:01:22.390> burn<00:01:22.659> them<00:01:22.870> so<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.320> don't<00:01:23.380> have

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
to actually burn them so you don't have

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.550 
to actually burn them so you don't have
to<00:01:23.740> really<00:01:24.310> worry<00:01:24.370> about<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.880> okay<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:26.320> our
