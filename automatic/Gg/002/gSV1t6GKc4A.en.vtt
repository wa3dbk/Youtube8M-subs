there are little particles in there that
can<00:00:52.440> actually<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.190> dangerous<00:00:53.399> for

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
can actually be really dangerous for

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.729 
can actually be really dangerous for
this<00:00:54.149> place<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> particle<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> vapor

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
this place of particle it's not a vapor

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.979 
this place of particle it's not a vapor
when<00:00:56.370> people<00:00:56.670> smoke<00:00:56.940> cigarettes<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.809> is

when people smoke cigarettes which is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
when people smoke cigarettes which is

bad enough they're inhaling of vapor

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
bad enough they're inhaling of vapor
which<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.420> again<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.350> solid<00:01:01.920> okay

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
which is again this is a solid okay

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.560 
which is again this is a solid okay
because<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.059> hard<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> tell<00:01:03.390> from
