00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 since 97 farc salt is a series 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.110
 politically incorrect that offends 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.509
 for free generates much controversy 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.969
 and how should you know where you've just 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 to throw only part of this tuf to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.500
 xbox 360 ps3 and pc 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.180
 so the ubisoft buddy that this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.949
 with the painful motorcycles than in 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.170
 tell nothing but we have the kenny we separated 6 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.899
 curiosity about the strong sun for you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.219
 fail at recess 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.230
 There's one thing I do not know. 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.260
 I can understand where it came from. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.059
 This is the real look of the real drawing. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 my dear lucas is that you jump for what 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.870
 was born when metz tony gilroy pocker 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.950
 made a Christmas card full of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.680
 copacabana 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.890
 good if you fought it quickly 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.960
 shared on the internet and this in 92 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.190
 does not return to the park comrades of 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.410
 facebook generation 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.410
 the first will come from the history of the internet 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 the success was so much that the two crazy 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.450
 decided to turn everything into a drawing 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 really or the one thing we do not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.110
 you can win the park's 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.450
 Brazil is very girl 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.630
 Do you mind if you touch your balls end? 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.240
 incarnated was agreed to accept 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 plus the original has a special touch already 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.040
 which is made almost entirely by the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.780
 two creators of the series wheels but the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.180
 Guys kick and rich and shit because 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.950
 drawings are rather in mation shit 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.689
 coldly calculated 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.340
 match workout work in all 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.439
 episodes of saving the park in the scheme 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.439
 intense marathon making an episode 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.049
 By week I work but fifth 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.360
 of the good blog the training park makes voice 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.290
 from the outside and from his father the hang ae 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.899
 also from the position 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.970
 since the medium is the voice of the fall and Borges 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.970
 kenny the CNE voice of kimi 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.080
 You did not know, but Tony's doctor uses a 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.000
 very special technique of muffling the mouth 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.250
 to dub the beloved and dying whom the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.940
 world is not going he always dies more 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.160
 return 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.930
 well, he does not die anymore, he died in 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.670
 almost every episode of the series until the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.620
 fifth season when in a pack of 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:24.330
 time in the episode that drives 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.440
 uncle scares the people what falls can 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.209
 grow until it was a form of 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.040
 protest against a broadcaster that threatened 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.450
 cancel the drawing contract thing 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.980
 so right that's it 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.720
 but then what he came back at the end of the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.209
 sixth season as if nothing had 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.060
 happened and from then on it was not 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.530
 dying as before 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.060
 one of the frequent choices of 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.060
 dirty mouth are video games 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.170
 The Kashima game has to play wii 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.150
 before the release and even god god 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.010
 sent a psp to earth to choose 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.080
 who would be the new keanu reeves and remember 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.550
 kan and had a newer one in two 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.330

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:12.299
 4 playstation xbox a nobody knows 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:14.670
 Patagonia that was what he did in 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.140
 But know that the light that spoil 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.410
 without my car factory are the secrets 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.640
 usually hidden jokes and 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.709
 references and you know you have a 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.890
 very popular easter egg in salford on 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.480
 sof park any aliens lag 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.850
 they appear hidden in many 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.459
 incidentally you noticed that our 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.060
 video they appear also lac repeats the 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.920
 video again and then turn on the ball I already 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.320
 I played all the games in the park until 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.760
 now but tell me there that you stretch another 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.680
 It's different about this. 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.360
 man this is the first game in which 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.760
 producers are totally involved 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.530
 but as so totally involved 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.600
 besides creating the story they 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.209
 created all the mechanics of the game of 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.120
 even evolution could want 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.709
 then that PrP gene and corpitcho 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.570
 protagonist who is you 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.110

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.110

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.540
