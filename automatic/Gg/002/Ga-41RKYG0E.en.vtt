it's an Allsteel okay because though
I've<00:05:28.949> run<00:05:29.219> into<00:05:29.399> a<00:05:29.550> number<00:05:29.999> of<00:05:31.459> shops<00:05:32.459> that<00:05:32.959> we

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:33.959 
I've run into a number of shops that we

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:37.699 
I've run into a number of shops that we
sell<00:05:34.199> to<00:05:34.229> that<00:05:35.330> leave<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.539> damper<00:05:36.929> on<00:05:36.959> even

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:37.709 
sell to that leave the damper on even

sell to that leave the damper on even
during<00:05:37.889> a<00:05:38.249> an<00:05:38.759> overhaul<00:05:39.239> because<00:05:39.839> they<00:05:40.709> feel

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
during a an overhaul because they feel

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.309 
during a an overhaul because they feel
as<00:05:41.249> though<00:05:41.279> that<00:05:41.789> it's<00:05:42.019> still<00:05:43.019> good

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.439 

unfortunately<00:05:46.319> that's<00:05:47.119> something<00:05:48.119> over<00:05:48.360> the

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
unfortunately that's something over the

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.559 
unfortunately that's something over the
years<00:05:48.689> and<00:05:49.050> of<00:05:49.349> mechanics<00:05:49.919> haven't<00:05:50.249> been

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
years and of mechanics haven't been

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.969 
years and of mechanics haven't been
educated<00:05:51.569> on<00:05:51.719> because<00:05:52.439> they<00:05:52.559> look<00:05:52.709> at<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:52.919> on

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
educated on because they look at it on

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.799 
educated on because they look at it on
the<00:05:53.069> front<00:05:53.309> of<00:05:53.339> the<00:05:53.459> engine<00:05:53.879> and<00:05:54.419> typically

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:54.809 
the front of the engine and typically

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.559 
the front of the engine and typically
they<00:05:54.989> it<00:05:55.709> looks<00:05:55.739> like<00:05:55.949> a<00:05:56.119> steel<00:05:57.119> weed<00:05:57.389> out

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
they it looks like a steel weed out

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.170 
they it looks like a steel weed out
there<00:05:57.839> yeah<00:05:58.259> and

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
there yeah and

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.060 
there yeah and
they<00:06:00.660> don't<00:06:00.870> know<00:06:01.290> there's<00:06:01.770> something

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
they don't know there's something

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.070 
they don't know there's something

yet another complaint I've had from

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.640 
yet another complaint I've had from
drivers<00:06:40.780> and<00:06:42.660> driver<00:06:43.660> fatigue<00:06:43.930> so<00:06:44.320> pick<00:06:44.470> one

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
drivers and driver fatigue so pick one

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.950 
drivers and driver fatigue so pick one
because<00:06:44.980> the<00:06:45.460> harmonics<00:06:45.970> which<00:06:46.240> hamana

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
because the harmonics which hamana

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.870 
because the harmonics which hamana
quavering<00:06:47.380> raishin<00:06:48.010> is<00:06:48.160> very<00:06:48.520> much<00:06:48.640> like<00:06:48.820> a
