 year then the crisis struck and blocked 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.670
 financial flows are now the most 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.320
 massive over the past decade 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 stage eight floors of the hull built 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.210
 finishing work is underway 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.849
 our university has connecting 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.490
 this building has ten buildings but of them to 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.040
 Unfortunately, this is only the second 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.280
 everything is built as an educational publication 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.540
 former hostel 3 building on 10 thousand 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 square meters students will move 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 most numerous economic 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.110
 faculty and historians who cram into 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.910
 dilapidated sixth case after 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.579
 completing this building their old building 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 bear here will be the central dining room 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.000

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.160

 graduate students will defend dissertations 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 Part of the faculties now works for us 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.409
 so to speak in one and a half shifts we do not 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.720
 Enough space than their Alexander 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.790
 said i hope that with the input of this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.430
 buildings we will all learn in one shift 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.710
 during the inspection of the body of the governor 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.460
 the region visited the third floor of the building he 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.970
 almost ready 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 installed doors and even plumbing 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.640
 hull color design solutions 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 modern thought out to the smallest detail 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.259
 for example their elevators here two will be 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.960
 work only from the third floor in front 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.610
 new task is building yet 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.600
 single hull which is essentially 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 will connect the old and the new building 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.759
 here you need certain logical 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 actions in terms of supporting our 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.759
