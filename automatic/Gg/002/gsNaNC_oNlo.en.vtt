I've<00:00:02.350> loved<00:00:02.710> drag<00:00:02.980> racing<00:00:03.400> ever<00:00:03.550> since<00:00:03.610> I<00:00:03.940> was

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.060 
I've loved drag racing ever since I was

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.870 
I've loved drag racing ever since I was
a<00:00:04.090> kid<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:05.830> know<00:00:05.860> I<00:00:05.950> always<00:00:06.160> wondered<00:00:06.460> what<00:00:06.790> it

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
a kid you know I always wondered what it

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.970 
a kid you know I always wondered what it
would<00:00:07.000> be<00:00:07.030> like<00:00:07.180> to<00:00:07.750> to<00:00:08.260> drive<00:00:08.590> a<00:00:08.620> race<00:00:08.950> car

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
would be like to to drive a race car

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.509 
would be like to to drive a race car
like<00:00:09.550> that<00:00:10.200> having<00:00:11.200> cystic<00:00:11.620> fibrosis<00:00:11.650> I

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
like that having cystic fibrosis I

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.640 
like that having cystic fibrosis I
thought<00:00:12.789> the<00:00:13.480> only<00:00:13.599> thing<00:00:13.780> I<00:00:14.079> could<00:00:14.139> ever<00:00:14.349> do

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
thought the only thing I could ever do

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.580 
thought the only thing I could ever do
is<00:00:14.829> spectate<00:00:16.679> until<00:00:17.679> now<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:20.199> all<00:00:20.349> of<00:00:20.500> our

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
is spectate until now for all of our

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.990 
is spectate until now for all of our
patients<00:00:20.800> there's<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.340> balance<00:00:21.789> between

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
patients there's a balance between

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.269 
patients there's a balance between
health<00:00:22.539> maintenance<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.679> getting<00:00:23.949> on<00:00:24.070> with

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
health maintenance and getting on with

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.380 
health maintenance and getting on with
life<00:00:24.310> I<00:00:25.740> wasn't<00:00:26.740> surprised<00:00:27.099> his<00:00:27.880> life<00:00:28.089> for

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
life I wasn't surprised his life for

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.140 
life I wasn't surprised his life for
motor<00:00:28.539> racing<00:00:29.050> his<00:00:29.470> love<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:30.279> us<00:00:30.580> it<00:00:30.999> all

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
motor racing his love the us it all

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.910 
motor racing his love the us it all
seemed<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.570> fit<00:00:31.779> together<00:00:31.990> as<00:00:32.590> long<00:00:32.710> as<00:00:32.800> the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
seemed to fit together as long as the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.380 
seemed to fit together as long as the
other<00:00:33.100> starts<00:00:33.460> somewhere<00:00:33.640> and<00:00:34.120> that's<00:00:34.210> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
other starts somewhere and that's the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.850 
other starts somewhere and that's the
beauty<00:00:34.660> of<00:00:34.690> drag<00:00:34.930> race<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.320> I<00:00:35.379> suppose<00:00:35.710> you

this illness is taken so much from me
over<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> years<00:00:59.780> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.200> chance<00:01:01.560> to<00:01:01.710> take

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
over the years this is my chance to take

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.850 
over the years this is my chance to take
something<00:01:02.490> back<00:01:02.870> we're<00:01:03.870> measuring<00:01:04.230> in<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
something back we're measuring in a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.360 
something back we're measuring in a
census<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.790> inside<00:01:06.210> stuff<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.370> then

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
census the inside stuff in you then

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.360 
census the inside stuff in you then
nobody<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.830> that's<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.160> see

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
nobody can see and that's what we see

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.760 
nobody can see and that's what we see
out<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> racetrack<00:01:12.080> people<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.530> have

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
out on the racetrack people that have

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.070 
out on the racetrack people that have
never<00:01:14.040> been<00:01:14.640> challenged<00:01:17.210> have<00:01:18.210> never<00:01:18.479> had<00:01:18.870> any

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
never been challenged have never had any

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.670 
never been challenged have never had any
adversity<00:01:20.360> have<00:01:21.360> never<00:01:21.630> pushed<00:01:21.960> themselves

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
adversity have never pushed themselves

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.770

which can you know you can get oil under
the<00:02:09.740> tires<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.340> wreck<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:11.030> way<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:11.510> there's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
the tires and wreck that way so there's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.110 
the tires and wreck that way so there's
a<00:02:12.230> lot<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.470> stuff<00:02:12.680> going<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.490> big<00:02:13.670> decision

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
a lot of stuff going on the big decision

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.450
