00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hey what's happening people what is it like and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.279
 today we are going to continue talking about 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.540
 Photography 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.340
 I will try to explain it the best 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.780
 possible way so that you understand it what 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.460
 what is the color temperature and the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.320
 white balance the temperature of 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.940
 colors so to speak the tonality that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.170
 receive the image we are going to photograph 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.000
 depending on the lighting that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.740
 we have the color temperature is measured 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.810
 in degrees kelvin the less degrees 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.609
 we have more quality orange is going to be 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.920
 our image while the more 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.750
 degrees we have cooler blue is going to be 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 our image the light of a match are 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.399
 1700 degrees Kelvin house bulbs 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.800
 are 2800 degrees Kelvin the fluorescent 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.380
 of our kitchen are going to be 5,000 degrees 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 Kelvin Daylight are 5600 degrees 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.820
 Kelvin being white light and a couple of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 seron are about 6,200 degrees that lived 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.719
 well et cetera etcetera now that you know what 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.390
 what is the color temperature so 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.760
 very very basic and very simple we are going to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.379
 see what the white balance as 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.940
 we have seen with the color temperature 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.620
 Each lighting source has a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 totally different tonality if 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.039
 we make a photograph inside 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.809
 from our house with a light bulb the tone 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.730
 color of the photograph has shades 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.510
 orange and in this way we do not 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.300
 allows you to see the actual colors 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.320
 we have to help our camera 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.360
 effectively with the white balance 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.010
 all digital cameras have a 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.260
 series of automatic white balance sheets 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.460
 for each inner situation is another 10 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.740
 we will use it whenever we do 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.300
 indoor pictures sunny what 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.610
 we would use outdoors in full light of 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.920
 day or cloudy days but with lots of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.800
 cloudy we would use it for photographs in 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.840
 shadow or for very very very cloudy days 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.430
 that there is almost no fluorescent light what 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.410
 we would use for illuminated photographs 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.630
 by fluorescent as from the kitchen of 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.920
 our automatic house is the same 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.450
 in the camera interprets in a way 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.400
 automatic the tonality of the scene and 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.380
 corrects it in automatic mode is not 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.640
 always the best option the eye if by 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.740
 case diaz you have a camera that makes 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.170
 manual white balance I recommend that 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.670
 always use the symbol is this and it is 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.050
 as easy as placing a white sheet 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.030
 in the scene that we are going to photograph 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.680
 press the manual balance button and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.690
 understand that our camera ready to 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.490
 that you understand it better to pay attention 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.870
 your camera turn on the light of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.160
 our room places to do 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.260
 white balance in position 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.180
 fluorescent and take a photo to a 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.280
 object any placed now the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.170
 white balance to interior mode or 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.209
 the tungsten bulb 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.709
 photograph in this way to know a 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.480
 completely different tonality in each 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.489
 photograph upload your tests to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.319
 twitter media not me the best is better and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.150
 yes more like that with cool colors effects 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.920
 will be those that will appear in my next 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.690
 photography video and talking about upload 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.489
 to twitter selected only two 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.709
 Photographs of all you sent me 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.940
 is of composition and re within this 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.940
 first photograph has a tonality 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.280
 of colors that I love is beautiful in 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.260
 colors is brutal and also that is 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.349
 also very very well composed because what 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.300
 which is the little plant just covers the line 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.610
 left vertical of the rule of 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.560
 thirds and also also covers two 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.010
 strong points the upper left and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.290
 the lower left we go that the 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.880
 truth that this one is great and we are going my 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.470
 congratulations but in this second and 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.140
 last is also a wonder because 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.260
 has managed to freeze the gull in the 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.360
 exact point is that it is amazing in addition 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.670
 that the seagull is at the strong point 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.989
 upper right of the image and it captures 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.010
 our attention to be in movement 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 also that the look is perfectly 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.530
 placed leaving air to the left and 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.000
 it's good that I think 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.280
 Incredible also that it seems lie but 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.440
 that the road line does not take us 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.480
 also to what is the gull to 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.490
 little bird so I also want to give 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.100
 Congratulations to Raquel because that is 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.900
 brutal the photo I love were so many 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.330
 that was encouraged led her to put all in 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.540
 this video we would already be in the minute 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.370
 50 I'm out there about 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.080
 Well, you can not keep giving me cane 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.790
 your cameras and the balance of 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.200
 Please send in your blanks and 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.730
 tests and you know that you can do what 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.500
 that you want with this video on networks 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.630
 social to be one for will be another 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.860
 something that they want to give a like and if not 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.790
 you liked to also give me a liking 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.370
 what is wonderful behind it appeared a 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.930
 gremlin good and tells you that they give you 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.760
 wishes and you ask for the notification that 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.670
 want is to print from the other grants 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.660
 I already like all loyalists if I subscribe 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.269
 you are not subscribed that totally 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.780
 free and good well you know father 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.670
 another world remains the same as that big one 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.470
 and see you next Tuesday if god 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.650
 want in this piece of chunk piece
