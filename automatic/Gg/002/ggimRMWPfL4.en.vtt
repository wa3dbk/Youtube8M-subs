my favorite things to do especially in
larger<00:00:21.400> tanks<00:00:21.700> you<00:00:21.820> get<00:00:21.970> a<00:00:22.000> piece<00:00:22.210> of<00:00:22.240> cork<00:00:22.689> and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
larger tanks you get a piece of cork and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.770 
larger tanks you get a piece of cork and
you<00:00:24.250> wedge<00:00:24.640> it<00:00:24.789> up<00:00:24.880> against<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.180> corner<00:00:25.570> here

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
you wedge it up against the corner here

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.320 
you wedge it up against the corner here
add<00:00:26.680> a<00:00:26.740> piece<00:00:27.070> of<00:00:27.279> wood<00:00:27.430> to<00:00:27.490> keep<00:00:27.820> it<00:00:27.970> in<00:00:28.060> place

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
add a piece of wood to keep it in place

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.740 
add a piece of wood to keep it in place
and<00:00:28.600> then<00:00:28.990> you<00:00:29.110> fill<00:00:29.350> it<00:00:29.470> up<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.270> back<00:00:31.480> with

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
and then you fill it up in the back with

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.490 
and then you fill it up in the back with
bedding<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:33.879> does<00:00:34.270> is<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:34.989> acts<00:00:35.230> as

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
bedding and what that does is it acts as

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500 
bedding and what that does is it acts as
a<00:00:35.949> burrowing<00:00:36.309> kind<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.820> hiding<00:00:37.030> spot<00:00:37.480> for

because once it's all done it should

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.570 
because once it's all done it should
look<00:01:53.140> kind<00:01:53.709> of<00:01:53.770> like<00:01:53.920> where<00:01:54.099> you<00:01:54.130> find<00:01:54.369> corn

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
look kind of like where you find corn

corn<00:01:58.750> snakes<00:01:59.020> naturalistically<00:01:59.860> but<00:02:00.489> I<00:02:00.700> think

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
corn snakes naturalistically but I think

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.089 
corn snakes naturalistically but I think
they<00:02:01.179> deserve<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.720> they<00:02:02.140> can<00:02:02.319> be<00:02:02.349> really

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
they deserve it they can be really

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.680 
they deserve it they can be really
really<00:02:03.340> neat<00:02:03.489> pets<00:02:03.729> if<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:03.940> set<00:02:04.209> them<00:02:04.330> up<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.630> a

make these graphs punches which by

I'm<00:06:16.169> kind<00:06:16.620> of<00:06:16.710> really<00:06:16.860> excited<00:06:16.949> about<00:06:17.879> the

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
I'm kind of really excited about the

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.570 
I'm kind of really excited about the
whole<00:06:18.180> through<00:06:18.539> the<00:06:18.629> alligator<00:06:18.990> I<00:06:19.050> think<00:06:19.580> but

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
whole through the alligator I think but

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.450 
whole through the alligator I think but
it's<00:06:21.330> not<00:06:21.569> necessarily<00:06:22.250> mandatory<00:06:23.250> I<00:06:23.310> mean

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
it's not necessarily mandatory I mean

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.469 
it's not necessarily mandatory I mean
you<00:06:23.520> could<00:06:23.669> take<00:06:23.759> it<00:06:23.909> out<00:06:24.000> and<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.210> cage<00:06:24.360> would

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
you could take it out and the cage would

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.820 
you could take it out and the cage would
still<00:06:24.719> look<00:06:24.870> really<00:06:24.930> cool<00:06:25.349> with<00:06:25.500> just<00:06:25.710> the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
still look really cool with just the

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.129

moss<00:06:26.009> added<00:06:26.460> to<00:06:26.610> it<00:06:26.759> but<00:06:27.719> there's<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.930> ton<00:06:28.110> of

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
your snakes to climb on so if you've got

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.430 
your snakes to climb on so if you've got
a<00:06:38.669> more<00:06:39.180> or<00:06:39.300> boreal<00:06:39.629> or<00:06:39.719> more<00:06:39.870> active<00:06:40.169> snake

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
a more or boreal or more active snake

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.680 
a more or boreal or more active snake
this<00:06:40.620> helps<00:06:40.919> keep<00:06:41.069> them<00:06:41.219> kinda<00:06:41.819> in<00:06:42.060> snake

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
this helps keep them kinda in snake

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.990 
this helps keep them kinda in snake
snake<00:06:43.139> shape<00:06:43.379> it<00:06:43.770> helps<00:06:44.219> them<00:06:44.580> give<00:06:44.789> them

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
snake shape it helps them give them

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.939 
snake shape it helps them give them
something<00:06:45.449> basically<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:45.930> climb<00:06:46.169> on<00:06:46.379> stay

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
something basically to climb on stay

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.730 
something basically to climb on stay
active<00:06:47.370> not<00:06:48.360> turn<00:06:48.599> into<00:06:48.780> fat<00:06:49.080> tubs<00:06:49.530> of<00:06:49.710> lard

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
active not turn into fat tubs of lard

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.570 
active not turn into fat tubs of lard
like<00:06:50.280> some<00:06:50.550> captive<00:06:50.969> snakes<00:06:51.240> can<00:06:52.580> the

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
basically giving them stuff to climb on

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.499 
basically giving them stuff to climb on
is<00:06:55.590> good<00:06:55.770> for<00:06:55.919> them<00:06:56.009> it's<00:06:56.069> good<00:06:56.159> for<00:06:56.430> you<00:06:56.520> and

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
again if you put a basking spot like a

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.089 
again if you put a basking spot like a
low<00:06:59.940> wattage<00:07:00.150> like<00:07:00.449> a<00:07:00.569> 40<00:07:01.199> watt<00:07:01.349> or<00:07:01.560> 60<00:07:01.949> watt

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099 
low wattage like a 40 watt or 60 watt

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.879 
low wattage like a 40 watt or 60 watt
bulb<00:07:02.279> over<00:07:03.150> here<00:07:03.629> on<00:07:03.779> the<00:07:03.990> warm<00:07:04.229> side<00:07:04.289> your

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
bulb over here on the warm side your

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.499 
bulb over here on the warm side your
snake<00:07:05.129> will<00:07:05.340> actually<00:07:05.669> climb<00:07:05.909> out<00:07:06.090> and<00:07:06.270> bask

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509 
snake will actually climb out and bask
