00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
concentrated in the pit you should get a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.529 
concentrated in the pit you should get a
better<00:02:04.100> light<00:02:04.429> you<00:02:04.789> should<00:02:05.000> light<00:02:05.210> up<00:02:05.240> better

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
around the perimeter as you can see how

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.340 
around the perimeter as you can see how
it<00:02:07.550> has<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> cone<00:02:08.000> shape<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.570> so<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.320> can

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
it has a cone shape to it so you can

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.699 
it has a cone shape to it so you can
start<00:02:10.340> very<00:02:11.180> low<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:12.110> have<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.260> small<00:02:12.590> no
