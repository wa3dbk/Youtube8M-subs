00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
hey welcome to lab 59 videos now we just

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.700 
hey welcome to lab 59 videos now we just
we're<00:00:09.450> doing<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.719> compression<00:00:10.080> test<00:00:10.260> on<00:00:10.590> this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
we're doing a compression test on this

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.290 
we're doing a compression test on this
i'm<00:00:10.920> actually<00:00:11.040> using<00:00:11.340> part<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.759> another<00:00:11.940> video

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
i'm actually using part of another video

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.759 
i'm actually using part of another video
where<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.630> just<00:00:12.960> did<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> compression<00:00:13.590> test

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
where we just did a compression test

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.770 
where we just did a compression test
shown<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> Honda<00:00:15.389> Civics

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
shown how to do it on the Honda Civics

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.439 
shown how to do it on the Honda Civics
well<00:00:16.500> we're<00:00:16.980> using<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.400> also<00:00:17.850> as<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> test

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
well we're using this also as a test

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.320 
well we're using this also as a test
vehicle<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.710> had<00:00:19.859> about<00:00:20.100> 120<00:00:20.880> pounds<00:00:21.029> in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
vehicle so we had about 120 pounds in

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.259 
vehicle so we had about 120 pounds in
this<00:00:21.449> cylinder<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:22.500> 119<00:00:23.340> pounds<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:24.090> this

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
this cylinder about 119 pounds in this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.150 
this cylinder about 119 pounds in this
cylinder<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:25.260> owner<00:00:25.590> dropped<00:00:25.920> down

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
cylinder this owner dropped down

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.970 
cylinder this owner dropped down
drastically<00:00:26.519> into<00:00:27.269> around<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.990> 70<00:00:28.470> pound<00:00:28.710> range

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
drastically into around a 70 pound range

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.189 
drastically into around a 70 pound range
so<00:00:29.340> that's<00:00:29.490> something's<00:00:30.269> going<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.900> there

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
so that's something's going on in there

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.930 
so that's something's going on in there
and<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.099> right<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.460> came<00:00:32.700> down

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
and then this one right here came down

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090 
and then this one right here came down
to<00:00:33.120> about<00:00:33.329> 90<00:00:33.899> pounds<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.500> definitely<00:00:34.920> had

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to about 90 pounds so we definitely had

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.569 
to about 90 pounds so we definitely had
two<00:00:35.399> cylinders<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.180> definitely<00:00:36.690> off

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
two cylinders that was definitely off

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.270 
two cylinders that was definitely off
first<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.790> 220<00:00:39.420> pounds<00:00:39.719> wasn't<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.140> bad<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.010> of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
first to 220 pounds wasn't so bad so of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.920 
first to 220 pounds wasn't so bad so of
course<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.000> had<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> restore

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
course you know I had to kind of restore

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.180 
course you know I had to kind of restore
and<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.610> saw<00:00:44.820> restore<00:00:45.420> says<00:00:45.860> right<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:46.890> on

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and so I saw restore says right here on

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.529 
and so I saw restore says right here on
the<00:00:47.309> back<00:00:47.629> big<00:00:48.629> old<00:00:48.870> red<00:00:49.289> lettering<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.539> says

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the back big old red lettering it says

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.310 
the back big old red lettering it says
right<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:53.300> independent<00:00:54.300> tests<00:00:54.510> prove<00:00:54.930> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
right here independent tests prove that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.549 
right here independent tests prove that
restore<00:00:55.860> works<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:57.329> increase<00:00:57.559> compression

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
restore works to increase compression

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.029 
restore works to increase compression
and<00:00:58.710> high<00:00:59.370> mileage<00:00:59.640> engines<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:01.500> car<00:01:01.739> has

there is going to be revamped like you
wouldn't<00:01:39.450> believe

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
wouldn't believe

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
wouldn't believe
when<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.700> rolls<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.600> should<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.020> around

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
when it rolls out it should be around

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.530 
when it rolls out it should be around
400<00:01:43.710> horsepower<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.610> right<00:01:44.850> now<00:01:45.030> we're

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
400 horsepower but right now we're

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
400 horsepower but right now we're
putting<00:01:45.689> around<00:01:45.840> town<00:01:46.170> picking<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.619> parts<00:01:46.890> for

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
putting around town picking up parts for

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
putting around town picking up parts for
it<00:01:47.159> we're<00:01:47.310> trying<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.700> out<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.119> test<00:01:48.899> out

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it we're trying it out so test out

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.679 
it we're trying it out so test out
restore<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.649> see<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> really<00:01:51.090> works<00:01:51.329> so

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
restore and see if it really works so

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.210 
restore and see if it really works so
now<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> says<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> shake<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.770> pretty<00:01:53.009> good

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
now it says to shake it up pretty good

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550 
now it says to shake it up pretty good
so<00:01:53.430> we're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> shake<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
so we're going to shake it up so and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
so we're going to shake it up so and
then<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.070> add<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.640> well<00:01:56.790> let's
