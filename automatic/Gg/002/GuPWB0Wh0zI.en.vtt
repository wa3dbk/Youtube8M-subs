00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.420
 or 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.719
 hello guys welcome to a new video 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.789
 of pet darling dotcom today we are going to 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.860
 make a super easy tutorial that is 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.710
 a recipe for dogs are going to be 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.599
 goodies but special to prove 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.140
 our love to our dogs are going to 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.250
 have a heart shape and color red 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.920
 look we will use four ingredients 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.940
 basic that are olive oil flour 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.879
 baby fruit and beetroot porridge or 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.400
 becerrada which is this colored tuber 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.200
 red and we will use it just for its 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.000
 color because without adding colorants 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.399
 artificial we are going to get that 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.829
 we dough is pink or rojito 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.219
 we will also need some molds 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.199
 meters like to measure cups and 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.780
 then molds that can be put into 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.160
 oven the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.489
 with the blender 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.190
 beat the beet and we want to make a 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.860
 finite puree to add it to the mix 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.750
 of our dog treats the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.509
 beet has a sweet taste and they 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.789
 really like dogs still is 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.770
 natural but it does have sugar and 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.520
 they have about 7 grams of sugar 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.009
 per 100 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.049
 of beet with which as we will add 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.810
 little to the cookies is not so much 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.719
 ok now let's mix everything in one 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.399
 bol one - half cup of flour can be 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.069
 flour integrated into the white flour or 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.140
 the flour that you like most this is 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.270
 optional one or two can be added 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.700
 small teaspoons of yeast for 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.969
 to raise the cupcakes more 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.740
 let's put baby porridge is the 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.990
 bought in a supermarket and it's made 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.860
 fruit- based city ​​that does not have 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.649
 grapes worth is a 200 gram pot that 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.149
 Equivalent measurements to a cup in addition 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.610
 of not having place does not have sugar either 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.670
 added in the dow life later with the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.530
 puree of the beet that is very well 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.070
 It is weak but is good will 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.700
 add a third cup 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.130
 and finally a quarter olive oil 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.929
 of cup is worth if you do not have olive 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.780
 you can put sunflower oil for 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.150
 example and now we have to remove everything 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.610
 until we get a paste you'll see 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.140
 pink color very beautiful the truth that 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.240
 in the video the color has not come out so 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.880
 well but it comes out pretty much a pink like 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.160
 the one of the pink panther 'if by what it is 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.770
 someone does not have beets what 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.110
 you can do is simply add the 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.880
 same amount but of baby porridge 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.280
 you would do everything with the porridge of 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.290
 fruits worth we would be rosita but 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.170
 good would be equally rich the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.270
 goodies you have to get a 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.830
 texture similar to this if it is 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.110
 too liquid because it has added a 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.120
 little bit of flour by eye and vice versa 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.739
 It's very solid to add a little bit of 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.110
 water that will integrate very well in the 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.170
 mixture is worth now let's fill in the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.180
 baking mold with this mixture to me 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.700
 has given me to fill two molds 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.470
 whole with which are 28 cupcakes 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.320
 OK 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.900
 and we're going to take them to the oven for 15 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.430
 minutes preheated to 180 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.430
 degrees Celsius 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.050
 does not compete external to a thing I tell you the 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.599
 Beet has many properties 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.430
 antioxidants and fiber and good many 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.069
 things but it has a slight effect 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.290
 laxative which do not happen to give 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.450
 these cupcakes or any beets in 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.370
 general to dogs because if you pass 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.709
 will give them diarrhea is not the end of the world 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.470
 because it's not toxic but you know that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.569
 then you will have to clean it up, this is 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.209
 Coverage for sugar - based desserts 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.250
 red and white and I'm going to 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.830
 melt a little and I'm going to use it 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.140
 to decorate some cupcakes just 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.329
 so you can see the effect that will remain 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.730
 more beautiful look has already taken out of the oven 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.579
 the cakes and to know if they are 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.230
 ready you have to click with a toothpick 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.970
 to melt the coverage is usually 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.069
 do in the water bath or as I have 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.950
 done in quick plan in the microwave 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.690
 I'm going to unmold the cupcakes 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.410
 the color in the camera has not been good 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.080
 but they are red roses 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.750
 and let's decorate the now with the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.610
 coverage 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.130
 and if you want to put another coverage 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.079
 different to you you like it 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.000
 you put it I recommend it to be colored 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.760
 red or pink to make it more effective 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.590
 heart and who does not want to put any 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.230
 decoration nothing happens because the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.140
 Dogs are going to like it just as well 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.570
 I'm going to tap a little like that 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.640
 how shabby and fast but good so that 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.040
 it is more beautiful the good of these 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.160
 coverages is that they then harden 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.200
 then they make like they were chocolates 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.419
 One thing to use the decoration that you like 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.550
 but do not use chocolate, much less 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.610
 cocoa that is very toxic for dogs 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.040
 ok or not look at all the little hearts 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.780
 cupcakes for dogs 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.270
 this can be stored in the refrigerator in a 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.950
 little jar and they last more than a week and 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.020
 what am I going to do, it's freezing 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.240
 and when I feel like it, he took two 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.060
 one or two for that day for mariachi 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.600
 It's worth seeing if he likes them 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.600
 Likes 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.900
