00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.189
 it's very mature tap it's easier 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.439
 wake up gets better inside 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.840
 recipe 'that here in the case of our 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.179
 famous life she is cut into cubes 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.520
 which I've put in the water to boil 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.649
 in all four to five minutes of the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:16.900
 Proof gives a hoe 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.900

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.160
 Those are stop beating step let's go 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.010
 give a stir here in this recipe is 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.410
 because she has already danced rather hoarse than 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.810
 but it is the right to give a 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.680
 here's a new one I'm the case of 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.250
 injury 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.200
 It will take another stirred touched 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.680
 It's time to hit her and she'll be very thick. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.690
 this line is on the side is also the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.110
 to take advantage of a brand already has 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.010
 because of the injury to the 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.010
 present a little more milk 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.360
 Ok, well, people, it's okay here. 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.180
 cool 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:30.680
 So we're going to add from here. 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:31.819
 now in the same way that is in this 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.090
 mass here staff 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:39.140
 we will add here then 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:47.690
 making me stay with me 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:04:00.349
 the tomato onion and Ã¡vila and I'm going to mess with it 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:04:03.440
 It's all ok, she's doing well here already. 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.390
 It is not mixed also with a tube 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.500
 So, from here, we 're going to count on 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.220
 the actor 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.609
 this thing she's already a taboo with 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:19.010
 margarine and a little flour 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:27.080
 we will close the whole mass here looks good 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:29.600
 which is here in the case of cabense a 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.400
 force was on 15 minutes before 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.160
 low temperature 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.210
 And this recipe, which has already 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.510
 will talk on low heat 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.150
 about 35-40 minutes 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.570
 she will grow up and she will know who she has 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.419
 cool on staff 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.260
 the people that are closing up are the ones here 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.479
 stayed 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.860

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.300
 It's still hot then the afternoon telling 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.169
 dark local people and it gets better 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.150
 still 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.300
 I particularly prefer a pilot. 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.950
 You can kill cooler by 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.410
 preference in the refrigerator 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.630
 then it starts to get much harder and 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.460
 consistent and also more delicious 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.550
 Good people, we're closing it up for now.
