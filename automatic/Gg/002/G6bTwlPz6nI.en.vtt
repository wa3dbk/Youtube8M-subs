00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.800
 I had bought last year that I 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.769
 did not open because he 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.840
 was running out of place so today I 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.660

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.340
 I am very sweet 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.940

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:18.479
 another house on the other side we have 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.970
 text in other languages ​​site 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.920
 pet shop 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.320
 behind we have a picture that represents 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.820
 the hive we have also available is our 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.750
 house that I do not own I prefer 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.750
 largely this one 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.060
 so here we see a picture of both 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.660
 characters and here again the site 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.870
 internet i will now open the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.870
 box 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.000
 so here is the cabin boxer so I 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:08.740
 will start by showing you the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.770
 characters then in to a bee to 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.239
 green eyes she has some kind of 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.970
 makeup around the eyes like a 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.370
 purple flower shape she 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.459
 has purple hair these antennas are 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.410
 the same color 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.070
 we have small translucent wings of 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.070
 purple color 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:34.530
 so here's the six-legged and analyze 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.930
 a small notch a little hole for 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:44.519
 put a notch that actually serves to 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:47.670
 put on the flower then the little 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.969
 cub so he has soft ears 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.819
 so we have little fabric and brown color 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:57.120
 yellow he has blue eyes and there 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.430
 small flowers on the tram a little nose 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.840
 pink 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.840
 lc pink cushioned at the slopes 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.330
 so here she is super cute then 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.580
 I will show you a little bit 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.270
 hut in fact there is one element 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.200
 that can be removed and it's a toboggan 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.569
 we can imitate a tree trunk 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.600
 we have a little vegetation so we put 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:32.380
 the notch here so we can put some 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.450
 pet shop like that so above we have 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.340
 the purple roof 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:42.190
 we have small drawings of the little ones 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.190
 patterns there is a flower that turns on 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.780
 can put so the bei is both 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:53.769
 purple and green colors so there the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.690
 cages we have a room with a bed with 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.560
 cushion covers 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.569
 we have a little stuffed bee we have 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.900
 a window that shaped like the 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:08.260
 alveoli of hives there we have a small 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.110
 bookshelf with books ya alarm clock 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.200
 curtains a saw wallpaper with 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.169
 clouds 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.820
 so it's super cute and on the ground 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.150
 floor on the other room 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.729
 so it's the teddy bear so he 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.320
 has a blue color cover 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.970
 turquoise a white cushion he also 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.940
 a shelf with a jar of honey 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.130
 avaaz is a flower of the windows 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.169
 alveoli a paper otherwise from 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.390
 purple color so here is a 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.010
 window on the side 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.220
 no here we have cavities that makes 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.120
 really hive so on the other side that 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.270
 give it we can see the windows we can 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.270
 see them 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.620
 so it's super cute 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:11.680
 I love this hut announced so at the 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:14.530
 base we have a foot imitation wood and there 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.900
 we are a kind of small scale 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:24.190
 actually to go up so that's it for the 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.629
 review of the hive hut and chuck so 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.759

 take the opportunity to show you my 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.020
 pet shop shelves 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.090
 I changed the layout a little bit 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:50.009
 so here I put the cabin that I come 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:50.009
 to do in review there I have a house 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.190

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.280

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.280

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.050
 that's it 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:24.990
 I have it below so I kept 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:31.620
 packaged swim the mechanics what 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:34.220
 walking and what's dancing the new 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.220
 generation 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.610
 so that was my pet collection 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.610
