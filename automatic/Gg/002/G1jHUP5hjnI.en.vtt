which<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.420> let<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> go<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.380> try

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
which is which I let it go just to try

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.080 
which is which I let it go just to try
it<00:00:34.620> out<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.370> went<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> today

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
it out and it went up like this so today

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
it out and it went up like this so today
it<00:00:39.090> says<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.450> over<00:00:39.570> 5<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.860> look

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it says it's over 5 but if you look

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.580 
it says it's over 5 but if you look
closely<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.730> says<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.750> level<00:00:43.730> 133<00:00:45.230> yeah<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
closely it says it is level 133 yeah I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
closely it says it is level 133 yeah I
don't<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.920> why<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.760> hides<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
don't know why I just like hides the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.840 
don't know why I just like hides the
true<00:00:48.719> identity<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:51.079> here<00:00:52.079> is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
true identity I don't know but here is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
true identity I don't know but here is
basically<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.180> part<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> glitch<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.489> believe

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
basically a part of the glitch I believe

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
basically a part of the glitch I believe
it<00:00:56.789> always<00:00:56.969> goes<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> always<00:00:58.320> kills

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
it always goes first and it always kills

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.110 
it always goes first and it always kills
it<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.399> anything<00:00:59.730> tries<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.989> hurt<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:02.120> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
it but if anything tries to hurt it it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.469 
it but if anything tries to hurt it it
will<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.979> that<00:01:04.979> you'll<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.270> was

the<00:02:15.340> same<00:02:15.670> styling<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:16.709> abuse<00:02:18.120> doesn't

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the same styling it's abuse doesn't

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.180

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:39.550 
matter who attacks just any attack mm so
it's<00:02:27.370> just<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.709> last<00:02:29.980> thing<00:02:30.459> fire<00:02:31.390> hit

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.420 

tackle<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:41.390> now<00:02:41.660> as<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.349> can<00:02:42.530> see<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:43.220> goes

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
tackle and now as you can see it goes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.059 
tackle and now as you can see it goes
down<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.030> goes<00:02:44.270> back<00:02:44.750> up<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.709> does<00:02:45.920> this

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
down then it goes back up it does this

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.380 
down then it goes back up it does this
for<00:02:46.130> about<00:02:47.140> 20<00:02:48.140> minutes<00:02:48.530> or<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.270> then<00:02:50.270> it

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
for about 20 minutes or so then it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.740 
for about 20 minutes or so then it
finally<00:02:50.630> stops<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.880> like<00:02:53.120> basically<00:02:53.540> it

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
finally stops it's like basically it

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.350 
finally stops it's like basically it
goes<00:02:53.900> up<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.380> 9<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.160> then<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:55.730> goes<00:02:55.880> down<00:02:55.910> to

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
goes up to 9 and then it goes down to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.040 
goes up to 9 and then it goes down to
zero<00:02:56.569> but<00:02:57.349> then<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.680> only<00:02:57.800> goes<00:02:58.069> up<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.310> 9<00:02:59.120> 9<00:02:59.450> and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
zero but then it only goes up to 9 9 and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.170 
zero but then it only goes up to 9 9 and
sometimes<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.920> health<00:03:01.130> bar<00:03:01.459> right<00:03:01.790> here<00:03:02.030> will

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
sometimes the health bar right here will

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.050 
sometimes the health bar right here will
go<00:03:02.360> up<00:03:02.630> backwards<00:03:03.440> yeah<00:03:04.160> that's<00:03:04.310> really<00:03:04.519> weird
