00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
it's like tight I didn't do it to one of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:32.020 
it's like tight I didn't do it to one of
the<00:02:16.140> inside<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.799> I'm<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> do<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.549> now

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.120 

now<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.780> I've<00:02:32.870> done<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.110> I'm<00:02:33.500> going<00:02:34.040> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
now that I've done that I'm going to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.820 
now that I've done that I'm going to
tape<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.790> pinhole<00:02:35.500> onto<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.700> lens<00:02:37.700> plate

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
tape the pinhole onto the lens plate

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.660 
tape the pinhole onto the lens plate
I'll<00:02:39.830> be<00:02:40.430> back<00:02:40.640> after<00:02:40.910> I'm<00:02:41.270> done<00:02:41.450> taping<00:02:41.750> it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.090 

this<00:02:46.670> step<00:02:46.970> was<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.210> bit<00:02:47.450> too<00:02:47.630> time-consuming

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
this step was a bit too time-consuming

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.540 
this step was a bit too time-consuming
so<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.160> did<00:02:49.400> it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
so I did it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.550 
so I did it
off-camera<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.420> I'll<00:02:50.750> show<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.959> what<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.230> did

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
off-camera but I'll show you what I did

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.220 
off-camera but I'll show you what I did
so<00:02:52.490> what<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.670> did<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.240> took<00:02:53.300> my<00:02:53.510> old<00:02:53.840> film

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
so what I did and I took my old film

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.130 
so what I did and I took my old film
canister<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.070> new<00:02:55.220> film<00:02:55.520> canister<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
canister and I new film canister and I

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.640 
canister and I new film canister and I
cut<00:02:57.380> off<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.560> lead<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.250> menu<00:02:59.120> one<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.600> then<00:03:00.440> I

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
cut off the lead of menu one and then I

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.230 
cut off the lead of menu one and then I
taped<00:03:00.980> my<00:03:01.130> old<00:03:01.400> one<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.730> new<00:03:01.880> one<00:03:02.060> together

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
taped my old one and new one together

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.210 
taped my old one and new one together
right<00:03:02.990> here<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:04.450> then<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.480> taped<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.709> old<00:03:06.920> film

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
right here and then I taped the old film

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.050 
right here and then I taped the old film
canister<00:03:07.880> down<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:10.100> now<00:03:10.280> what<00:03:10.459> I'm<00:03:10.580> going<00:03:10.670> to

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
canister down so now what I'm going to

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.120 
canister down so now what I'm going to
do<00:03:11.239> is<00:03:11.840> I'm<00:03:12.020> going<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.350> take<00:03:12.620> my<00:03:12.830> cardboard

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
do is I'm going to take my cardboard

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.870 
do is I'm going to take my cardboard
piece<00:03:13.550> which<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.120> wrapped<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:15.100> tape<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:16.700> it

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
piece which I wrapped in tape so it

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.260 
piece which I wrapped in tape so it
would<00:03:17.000> be<00:03:17.209> like<00:03:17.480> proof<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:19.370> I'm<00:03:19.640> going<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:19.970> put

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
would be like proof and I'm going to put

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.210 
would be like proof and I'm going to put
it<00:03:20.390> right<00:03:20.420> over<00:03:20.630> here<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.380> no<00:03:21.590> light<00:03:21.830> can<00:03:22.100> get

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
it right over here so no light can get

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.970 
it right over here so no light can get
into<00:03:22.550> my<00:03:22.670> films<00:03:23.120> I'm<00:03:23.390> going<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.380> take<00:03:24.590> my<00:03:24.770> tape

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
into my films I'm going to take my tape

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.890 
into my films I'm going to take my tape
and<00:03:25.160> tape<00:03:25.459> this<00:03:25.670> down<00:03:25.970> I'll<00:03:26.239> show<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.690> what

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
and tape this down I'll show you what

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.780 
and tape this down I'll show you what
the<00:03:27.020> finished<00:03:27.320> result<00:03:27.770> is<00:03:27.920> after<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.430> finish

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
the finished result is after I finish

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.840 
the finished result is after I finish
taping<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:32.050> Wow<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.470> had<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.100> be<00:03:34.220> get<00:03:34.370> like<00:03:34.550> tight

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
taping it Wow I had to be get like tight

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.400 
taping it Wow I had to be get like tight
and<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.239> was<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:35.630> much<00:03:35.810> harder<00:03:36.170> than<00:03:36.320> I

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
and that was so much harder than I

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.100 
and that was so much harder than I
expected<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:37.790> have<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.180> close<00:03:38.510> up<00:03:38.720> every

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
expected you have to close up every

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.410 
expected you have to close up every
little<00:03:39.470> tiny<00:03:39.709> crevice<00:03:40.400> in<00:03:40.670> order<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.360> to

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
little tiny crevice in order for it to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.970 
little tiny crevice in order for it to
be<00:03:41.570> like<00:03:41.750> time<00:03:42.019> in<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.260> film<00:03:42.500> not<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.830> get

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
be like time in the film not to get

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.479 
be like time in the film not to get
exposed<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:43.959> also<00:03:44.959> made<00:03:45.290> my<00:03:45.320> shutter<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:46.010> shutter

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
exposed I also made my shutter a shutter

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.430 
exposed I also made my shutter a shutter
is<00:03:46.850> something<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.390> covers<00:03:47.690> up<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.989> pinhole

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
is something that covers up the pinhole

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.670 
is something that covers up the pinhole
so<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.970> doesn't<00:03:50.450> make<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.959> film<00:03:51.230> exposed

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
so that it doesn't make the film exposed

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.160 
so that it doesn't make the film exposed
before<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.220> want<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.760> this<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.450> my<00:03:53.600> shutter<00:03:53.930> I

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
before I want to this is my shutter I

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.560 
before I want to this is my shutter I
just<00:03:54.620> lifted<00:03:55.010> off<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.370> pinholes<00:03:55.760> exposed<00:03:56.239> and

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
just lifted off the pinholes exposed and

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.110 
just lifted off the pinholes exposed and
it<00:03:56.870> takes<00:03:57.080> a<00:03:57.200> picture<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.769> can<00:03:58.280> expose<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.670> for<00:03:58.850> a

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
it takes a picture I can expose it for a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.729 
it takes a picture I can expose it for a
little<00:03:59.450> bit<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.720> amount<00:04:00.080> of<00:04:00.170> time<00:04:00.410> in<00:04:00.650> order

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
little bit of amount of time in order

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.470 
little bit of amount of time in order
for<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.190> absorb<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.760> light<00:04:01.940> needed<00:04:02.299> to

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
for it to absorb the light needed to

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.440 
for it to absorb the light needed to
make<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.750> film<00:04:03.019> have<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.230> picture<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:05.060> then

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
make the film have a picture so then

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.960 
make the film have a picture so then
what<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.660> did<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:07.070> order<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.430> take<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.670> picture

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
what I did is in order to take a picture

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:19.650 
what I did is in order to take a picture
I<00:04:08.420> have<00:04:09.049> to<00:04:09.320> wind<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:09.980> five<00:04:10.940> times<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:12.320> way<00:04:13.000> so

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.250 

one

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:37.330 

-<00:04:26.810> that's<00:04:27.810> winding<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.380> film<00:04:31.460> three<00:04:34.430> four<00:04:35.430> and

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
- that's winding the film three four and

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.450 
- that's winding the film three four and
five<00:04:38.340> now<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.360> film<00:04:39.570> is<00:04:39.720> round<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:41.220> can

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
five now this film is round and I can

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.630 
five now this film is round and I can
take<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.670> picture<00:04:41.910> I<00:04:42.830> have<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.980> do<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.250> lift<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
take a picture I have to do is lift the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.220 
take a picture I have to do is lift the
shutter<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.000> then<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.360> take<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.660> picture<00:04:46.110> I'm

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
shutter and then I take a picture I'm

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.470 
shutter and then I take a picture I'm
not<00:04:46.410> going<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:46.740> right<00:04:47.040> now<00:04:47.220> but<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:48.150> is<00:04:48.300> how

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
not going to right now but that is how

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.470 
not going to right now but that is how
the<00:04:48.540> pinhole<00:04:49.050> camera<00:04:49.410> works<00:04:52.730> what<00:04:53.730> what<00:04:54.450> I

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
the pinhole camera works what what I

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.590 
the pinhole camera works what what I
learned<00:04:55.020> is<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:56.010> pinhole<00:04:56.400> camera<00:04:56.600> also

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
learned is that a pinhole camera also

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.380 
learned is that a pinhole camera also
known<00:04:57.750> as<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:57.990> camera<00:04:58.470> obscura<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:59.370> very<00:05:00.060> hard

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
known as a camera obscura is very hard

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.350 
known as a camera obscura is very hard
to<00:05:00.630> make<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.140> also<00:05:02.040> it<00:05:02.190> takes<00:05:02.400> a<00:05:02.610> lot<00:05:02.790> of<00:05:02.910> parts

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
to make and also it takes a lot of parts

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.200 
to make and also it takes a lot of parts
I<00:05:03.420> learned<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.900> parts<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.440> camera<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.210> I

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
I learned the parts of the camera and I

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.510 
I learned the parts of the camera and I
also<00:05:06.540> learned<00:05:06.930> how<00:05:07.050> many<00:05:07.380> times<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.920> wind<00:05:08.190> a
