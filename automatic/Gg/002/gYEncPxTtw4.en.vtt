00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.590 
pretty well so and how I went about
where<00:04:51.250> I'm<00:04:51.340> gonna<00:04:51.460> put<00:04:51.610> my<00:04:51.730> bangs<00:04:52.000> let<00:04:52.300> see

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
where I'm gonna put my bangs let see

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.050 
where I'm gonna put my bangs let see
what<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.810> end<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.050> my<00:04:53.140> eyebrow<00:04:53.610> stop<00:04:54.610> it

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
what the end of my eyebrow stop it

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.970 
what the end of my eyebrow stop it
I<00:04:55.090> base<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.480> off<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.290> like<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:56.530> like<00:04:56.950> my

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
I base it off that and like I like my

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.370 
I base it off that and like I like my
head<00:04:57.400> is<00:04:57.610> kind<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:57.910> shaped<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.750> where<00:04:59.050> of

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
head is kind of shaped to where of

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.400 
head is kind of shaped to where of
begging<00:04:59.620> should<00:04:59.950> go<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.330> guess<00:05:02.020> that's<00:05:02.200> what

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
begging should go so I guess that's what

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.790 
begging should go so I guess that's what
it<00:05:02.500> was

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
it was

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.700 
it was
so<00:05:03.400> I'll<00:05:03.700> be<00:05:03.970> back<00:05:04.240> stay<00:05:04.750> tuned<00:05:05.020> okay<00:05:05.230> y'all

on my ends it made it kind of heavier
but<00:05:43.900> it's<00:05:44.260> more<00:05:44.680> settled<00:05:45.370> with<00:05:45.520> that<00:05:45.730> on<00:05:45.970> it

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
but it's more settled with that on it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.720 
but it's more settled with that on it
this<00:05:46.690> hair<00:05:46.960> does<00:05:47.350> share<00:05:47.770> quite<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:48.100> bit<00:05:48.370> but<00:05:48.669> it

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
this hair does share quite a bit but it

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.870 
this hair does share quite a bit but it
was<00:05:49.000> only<00:05:49.300> $9.99<00:05:49.960> okay<00:05:50.290> so<00:05:51.040> this<00:05:51.640> is<00:05:51.790> the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
was only $9.99 okay so this is the

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.460 
was only $9.99 okay so this is the
outcome<00:05:52.270> I<00:05:52.360> guess<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.660> had<00:05:52.840> some<00:05:52.870> pictures<00:05:53.140> at
