00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
especially when you have the high speed

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.280 
especially when you have the high speed
kit<00:02:46.980> installed<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.819> do<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.959> never<00:02:49.110> go

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
kit installed like I do you can never go

kit installed like I do you can never go
back<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.709> play<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.010> slow<00:02:50.280> again<00:02:59.180> the<00:03:00.180> really

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
back and play it slow again the really

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.870 
back and play it slow again the really
big<00:03:00.780> difference<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.590> MS<00:03:02.069> pac-man<00:03:02.640> has

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
big difference is that MS pac-man has

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.620 
big difference is that MS pac-man has
multiple<00:03:03.510> mazes<00:03:07.579> and<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:09.150> fruit<00:03:09.390> moves

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
multiple mazes and the fruit moves

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.420 
multiple mazes and the fruit moves
around<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.230> screen<00:03:10.380> instead<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.950> sitting<00:03:11.250> in

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
around the screen instead of sitting in

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.690 
around the screen instead of sitting in
one<00:03:11.700> spot<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.739> find<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.099> be<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> faster

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
one spot so I find it to be a faster

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.770 
one spot so I find it to be a faster

more entertaining game for me personally

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.420 
more entertaining game for me personally
it's<00:03:18.780> probably<00:03:19.170> easier<00:03:19.530> than<00:03:19.590> pac-man<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.280> as

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
it's probably easier than pac-man but as

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.910 
it's probably easier than pac-man but as
you<00:03:20.549> might<00:03:20.730> expect<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:21.239> gets<00:03:21.389> difficult

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
you might expect it gets difficult

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.349
