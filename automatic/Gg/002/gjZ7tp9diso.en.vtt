00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:06.200
 good kids here we are another video 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.090
 with the shotgun the truth is that I'm not 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.759
 that man still and here you see me 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.339
 taking a chain of casualties the last 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.340
 that I had of ultra killer the 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:19.100
 moved is the truth is that that 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.750
 it was a complete massacre and now you're going to 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.670
 see there as I get up and say no 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.020
 it can be when they gave it to me I say no 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.900
 it could be was the only one that I had left 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.070
 to issue the last title of 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.500
 all of these have them all free 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.750
 chain of casualties and the truth is that good 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.940
 what teachers are and was not is the host 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.399
 it's a pass I have it now and it's 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.449
 an authentic past but good what 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.730
 I am going to comment on the example and go to 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.910
 see what's happened many times 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.980
 fast because good once you get the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.120
 dogs if you get all the roll the rock 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.179
 it starts to go plus it was hard 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.949
 by teams and take you out in uve sad the drone 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.269
 of attack and dogs costs you 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.640
 you do not have to kill 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.409
 how many and once you take them out you do not know 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.019
 the rock begins to run so in case 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.460
 You see that there are always times where 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.350
 they pass fast simply by the fact 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.270
 that there were no people and he was giving 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.950
 good turns you will see it totally from 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.240
 another way 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.119
 on the way but they commented on this 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.090
 shotgun is without a doubt my shotgun 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.890
 favorite without a doubt the shotgun of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.090
 I'm going to do a road to gold 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.189
 make a little goal of this shotgun 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.130
 sure you know what you are going to have now 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.479
 within the hurdler 's swim and after 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.909
 of the crossbow are going to visit the dogs 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.289
 are thrown would be joint or good are you going to 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.610
 have inside nothing of the hurdler 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.799
 after having the one of the hurdler 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.720
 you will have this shotgun and then 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.610
 I will have to make another and they will be longer 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.960
 you see no but a lot told me is that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.060
 because it was one of shotgun 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.880
 because he had already repeated the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.170
 snipers and it's because I do not know 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.119
 they gave to do it first you go 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.039
 so much to make this shotgun so 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.659
 why do not I say I'm going to do first the 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.909
 of the compes depends on the sniper 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.140
 that I wanted more and after doing 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.759
 the sniper's will have the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.530
 short really quiet and people who 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.810
 you really want many of 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.729
 you the best shotgun I said 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.890
 many times he kills long distance 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.209
 other times it's not something weird not but 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.500
 I guess you're like all the 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.750
 Shotguns there are times that kill from 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.530
 albacete other times you hit the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.539
 chest 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.780
 being the uncle right in front of you and not 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.280
 kills him 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.080
 nothing 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.700
 they are things that I think they do all 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.260
 the shotguns themselves not because sometimes the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.270
 caes is also what makes the house 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.270
 it's supposed to kill 20 meters there's no 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.000
 you take a turkey you shoot at the side and not 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.100
 dies but you see the gameplay was good 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.780
 super fast or does not know if it lasted three 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.910
 minutes and a half the game did not last 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.880
 in the first minute I already had the dogs 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.080
 so that's what there are kids wanted 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.760
 bring this example you want what 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 think and especially the first streak that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.989
 took me out and what I think is the title that 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.030
 you're going to see right here at the end of the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.100
 video that I'm going to leave a bit for 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.470
 that you see what the title is that they give you 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.380
 when you get all of the gusts 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.660
 so powerful and nothing kids I hope that 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.720
 good that you also want that 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.280
 make hell road to call with this weapon and 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.480
 I'll do it though good many times I think 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.290
 that the one I use is pretty 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.850
 entertaining that what I always say 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.850
 you have teachers
