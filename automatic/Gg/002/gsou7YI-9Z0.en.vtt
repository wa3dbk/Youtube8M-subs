sector and whatever usual sector it is

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.980 
sector and whatever usual sector it is
if<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.080> select<00:00:28.529> something<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.990> you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
if you select something here it is you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.250 
if you select something here it is you
selected<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> thing<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.620> like<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
selected on the thing so like that and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
selected on the thing so like that and
arms<00:00:37.260> are<00:00:37.380> rigid<00:00:37.739> bends<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.510> need<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
arms are rigid bends I need you just to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.450 
arms are rigid bends I need you just to
make<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> new<00:00:40.620> character<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.100> need<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> just

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
make a new character I need to just

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.260 
make a new character I need to just
change<00:00:41.969> two<00:00:42.600> textures<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:44.309> three<00:00:44.910> textures

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
change two textures this three textures

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
change two textures this three textures
this<00:00:47.239> let's<00:00:48.239> try<00:00:48.510> old<00:00:49.200> man<00:00:51.110> this<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this let's try old man this and the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
this let's try old man this and the
fingers<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> change<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.210> skin<00:00:54.539> over

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
fingers I have to change the skin over

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.680 
fingers I have to change the skin over
here<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:57.600> skin<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> legs<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> that's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
here and the skin for the legs so that's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
here and the skin for the legs so that's
that's<00:01:01.170> about<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> new

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that's about it and then you have a new

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.289 
that's about it and then you have a new
character<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:05.489> I'll<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:06.090> this

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
character so for now I'll just have this

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.820 
character so for now I'll just have this
skin<00:01:06.960> um<00:01:08.869> let<00:01:09.869> me<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:09.990> quickly<00:01:10.350> show<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
skin um let me just quickly show you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.510 
skin um let me just quickly show you
this<00:01:11.299> simulations<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.659> walking<00:01:13.520> run

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
this simulations the walking run

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
this simulations the walking run
simulations<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.900> will<00:01:16.049> use<00:01:16.320> for

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
simulations this is what we will use for

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
simulations this is what we will use for
characters<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.090> walking<00:01:18.330> around

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
characters that are just walking around

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.219 
characters that are just walking around
the<00:01:19.080> set<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.880> running<00:01:21.270> around<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.630> set<00:01:21.810> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the set so all running around the set so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.120 
the set so all running around the set so
if<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.500> hit<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.920> it'll<00:01:23.280> start<00:01:23.790> running<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
if you hit this it'll start running and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.649 
if you hit this it'll start running and
so<00:01:26.130> background<00:01:26.729> characters<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so background characters will have this

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.679 
so background characters will have this
simulation<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.729> walk<00:01:29.970> simulation

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
simulation going and a walk simulation

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.399 
simulation going and a walk simulation
hear<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.740> head<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.009> fully<00:01:32.430> rotatable<00:01:33.409> during

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
hear the head is fully rotatable during

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
hear the head is fully rotatable during
the<00:01:34.530> walk<00:01:34.710> cycle<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.700> why<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.210> have

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the walk cycle that's why I don't have

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.140 
the walk cycle that's why I don't have
it<00:01:36.509> moving<00:01:36.869> otherwise<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:38.520> won't<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.759> able<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it moving otherwise you won't be able to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
it moving otherwise you won't be able to
move<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.200> put<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.530> cycle<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
move it and you can put this cycle on a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.359 
move it and you can put this cycle on a
spline<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.119> something<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.040> we'll<00:01:44.040> follow<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
spline or something and we'll follow it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.840 
spline or something and we'll follow it
so<00:01:44.790> another<00:01:45.240> thing<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.229> has<00:01:46.470> items<00:01:47.310> like

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
so another thing is it has items like

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.289 
so another thing is it has items like
all<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.470> items<00:01:50.159> X<00:01:50.460> shallow<00:01:51.740> boots<00:01:52.939> it's<00:01:53.939> sword

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
all the items X shallow boots it's sword

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.719 
all the items X shallow boots it's sword
and<00:01:54.540> pickaxes<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.219> click<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and pickaxes here you just click on the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.209 
and pickaxes here you just click on the
item<00:01:59.880> nala<00:02:00.270> yeah<00:02:00.630> um<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:04.009> they're<00:02:05.009> fully

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
item nala yeah um and they're fully

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.669 
item nala yeah um and they're fully
rotatable<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.759> wait<00:02:08.759> oh<00:02:09.259> yeah<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.289> need<00:02:10.560> to

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
rotatable and wait oh yeah I need to

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.300 
rotatable and wait oh yeah I need to
select<00:02:10.920> them<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.250> here

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
select them in here

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.120 
select them in here
and<00:02:13.000> then<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.750> table<00:02:14.459> oops<00:02:16.500> yeah<00:02:17.500> all

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and then there's a table oops yeah all

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.089 
and then there's a table oops yeah all
you<00:02:18.370> need<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.520> change<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.000> axis<00:02:19.860> well<00:02:20.860> that's

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
you need to change the axis well that's

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.080 
you need to change the axis well that's
pretty<00:02:21.580> easy<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.090> change<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.480> axis<00:02:22.720> okay<00:02:23.349> so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
pretty easy just change the axis okay so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.680 
pretty easy just change the axis okay so
it<00:02:25.090> has<00:02:25.390> all<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.050> ammo<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.910> change<00:02:28.360> them
