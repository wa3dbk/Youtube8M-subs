I'll<00:01:15.270> crazy<00:01:15.539> idea<00:01:15.899> but<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.349> works<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.740> some

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
I'll crazy idea but it works in some

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.309 
I'll crazy idea but it works in some
ways<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.399> in<00:01:17.670> some<00:01:17.849> ways<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.300> doesn't<00:01:18.599> let's

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319

linear<00:01:42.959> compensator<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.950> really<00:01:44.280> need<00:01:44.399> all

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
linear compensator you really need all

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.100 
linear compensator you really need all
the<00:01:44.759> range<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.119> take<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.690> seriously

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the range you can take and seriously

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
the range you can take and seriously
take<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> look<00:01:46.709> at<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:46.890> starting<00:01:47.069> range<00:01:47.459> it's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
take a look at the starting range it's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.150 
take a look at the starting range it's
horrible<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.539> we<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.050> hipfire<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.009> one

have speed reload extended mag and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.199 
have speed reload extended mag and
perfect<00:02:13.290> balance<00:02:13.470> industry<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.060> don't

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
perfect balance industry we really don't

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.150 
perfect balance industry we really don't
have<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> choice<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:16.200> gun<00:02:16.410> reloads<00:02:16.800> like<00:02:16.980> auto

have a choice the gun reloads like auto

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.819 
have a choice the gun reloads like auto
rifle<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.270> has<00:02:18.330> amazing<00:02:18.720> reload<00:02:19.230> speed<00:02:19.469> you

having<00:02:25.930> an<00:02:26.079> extended<00:02:26.500> mag<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.950> really

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
having an extended mag is really

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.250 
having an extended mag is really

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
really lackluster / what it does is it

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.979 
really lackluster / what it does is it
gives<00:02:42.129> your<00:02:42.280> allies<00:02:42.609> plus<00:02:43.000> 3<00:02:43.239> recovery<00:02:43.720> when

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
gives your allies plus 3 recovery when

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.770 
gives your allies plus 3 recovery when
they<00:02:44.140> around<00:02:44.439> you<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:46.060> doesn't<00:02:46.540> stack<00:02:46.750> up

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
they around you and it doesn't stack up

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020 
they around you and it doesn't stack up
with<00:02:47.079> multiple<00:02:47.560> order<00:02:47.799> wolves<00:02:48.159> so<00:02:48.849> this

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
with multiple order wolves so this

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.759 
with multiple order wolves so this
recovery<00:02:49.359> boost<00:02:49.750> works<00:02:50.049> like<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.469> blessing

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
recovery boost works like the blessing

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.530 
recovery boost works like the blessing
of<00:02:50.829> light<00:02:51.069> you<00:02:51.430> have<00:02:51.609> to<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:51.909> really<00:02:52.209> close<00:02:52.359> to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
of light you have to be really close to

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.479 
of light you have to be really close to
allies<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.439> radius<00:02:53.829> is<00:02:54.040> only<00:02:54.280> about

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
allies and the radius is only about

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.970 
allies and the radius is only about
Titan<00:02:55.150> bubble<00:02:55.450> at<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.569> half<00:02:55.780> therefore<00:02:56.650> this

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
Titan bubble at a half therefore this

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.250 
Titan bubble at a half therefore this
30-second<00:02:57.670> recovery<00:02:58.120> boost<00:02:58.359> is<00:02:58.629> not<00:02:58.930> really

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
30-second recovery boost is not really

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.690 
30-second recovery boost is not really
going<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.470> play<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> big<00:02:59.859> role<00:02:59.889> in<00:03:00.280> many

going to play a big role in many

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.420 
going to play a big role in many
situations<00:03:01.560> alright<00:03:02.560> let's<00:03:02.889> take<00:03:03.129> a<00:03:03.159> look<00:03:03.370> at
