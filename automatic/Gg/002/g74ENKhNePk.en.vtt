00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 good guys welcome back video 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.630
 of gt5 online here we are back 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.630
 dying begins 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.470
 as the high of the highs turned in 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.630
 a war that is called if you can 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.509
 you can fly like that, and that's how you are 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.489
 you can fly as is, which 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.079
 which is typical of these careers 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.360
 which one has to fly with the bike thing 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.619
 that I like a lot so we're going to 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.619
 give him the whole canyon 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.960
 I put a word that is the goal is worth 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.690
 it is only in that direction 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.519
 according to the pawn of the mini map but really 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 I do not know what's wrong is in the middle of the river 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.440
 actually easy to reach is just 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 in the middle of the river but I'm already seeing it 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.230
 it's there in the middle of the river vale 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.909
 look how the first one arrives I retire 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.749
 how the first one arrives does not reach me 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.749
 delegate no no 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.350
 because suddenly life changes 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.330
 direction as you go curve and you have to 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.790
 get there flying with the bikes sometimes 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.100
 somewhat strange to understand and such 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.990
 but basically doing it accepts let's 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.790
 to give him cane that I do not want or will not catch or 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.790
 be the ramp is the only one that makes you lose 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.280
 speed is worth seeing I'm going to put the bike 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.890
 so that I go to the direction 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.090
 goal as I think that there is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.020
 perfect look and it's perfect 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.180
 moved sorry a little for the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.850
 right does not give even a little bit to 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.520
 the left now a little bit up 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.520
 ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.549
 so much 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:49.020
 uncle I do not control if it's possible seriously 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.760
 this is very difficult 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.150
 it's complicating me ok we go down 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.090
 here is how we see a lot of speed 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.100
 and we jump in there we're putting the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.270
 bicycle in the form of snow that you do not know 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.729
 go for the sides is that these 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.470
 they carried the waves I do not know if these 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.450
 play 3 we had an uncle over there and 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.479
 perfect perfect we will place 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.130
 exactly it's worth now we're just going 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.660
 advancing we turn a little bit seems little 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.300
 just a little bit so much mikkawi is worth it now 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.900
 now now it is worth now worth voucher 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.370
 vale vale vale vale it does not have the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.380
 God's goal already had the mind there 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.740
 because I'm there that would have makes me 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.959
 is what foolishness makes me shit on everything 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.350
 for the dough quiet guys does not pass 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.870
 nothing is all controlled water there is 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.700

 He gave thanks to that is not clear is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.780
 more funny 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:03.930
 but where will he demand the ball 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.490
 eye eye not entering well in the water 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.770

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.830
 Ok guys, see this, it's pretty 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.240

 applied another do this is much more 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.390
 complicated in play 3 and I do not know what happens 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.010
 but we stopped there to see now 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.410
 you really have to do like the previous 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.950

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.360
 like perfection because right now 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.230
 we are seeing on screen what is 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.670
 doing in Patera itself is the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.490
