00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.680
 Welcome dear 1000 ps fans 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.410
 here from the fair in milan yes yes 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.830
 faced with another absolute 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.289
 kracher hans zimmermann country manager 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.320
 from yamaha austria greets god 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:25.350
 Halo years are now 16 in 1998 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.650
 has yamaha with the first year 1 one 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.179
 absolute kracher is presented yes 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 meanwhile a legend of the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.180
 name now is the question beats the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.360
 New another chapter on definitely 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.219
 Yes 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 we have so much in this vehicle 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.850
 something new developed into something definite 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.590
 for yamaha did not step but one 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.920
 jump forward means in the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.190
 technology the supersport motorcycle there 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.840
 There are a lot of technical features 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.800
 hidden 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.190
 Of course, that's the first thing 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.400
 extraordinary design on 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.720
 for example, this tail here the fragrance 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.520
 by eating unbelievable 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.979
 I think that thanks reminds me already 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.790
 so easy or actually pretty strong 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.630
 at motogp forms so the new r1 is 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.340
 absolutely the design of the motogp m1 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.930
 imitated that begins with the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.049
 air intake in front 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.850
 it's not all that 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.659
 getting used to so mentioned but 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.540
 even the front looks very different than 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.040
 everything else in the market I love that 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.470
 By the way, if one really something 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.180
 absolutely new one dares to say one 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.049
 It took a little bit but it was good 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.840
 needs a while 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.939
 what should we say what we have now 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.200
 everything under the disguise inside 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.990
 at state-of-the-art phase the systems so 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.280
 we have 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.060
 1 6 axial surveying system where the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.200
 sensors then control units to which the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.240
 deliver data 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.340
 this is unique in the industry 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.470
 nobody else has six axes 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.160
 we have practically everything to helpers 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.530
 on board what the driver wants or 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.140
 also not that means the vehicle or 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.930
 or in a very intelligent part 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.709
 in the vehicle always knows exactly in which 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.450
 the engine is in the correct position 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.390
 then have start from land 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.819
 control over the light control abs 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.000
 resing existed and so on everything was there 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.250
 today already results with installed and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.400
 also available via a state-of-the-art dfd 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.560
 panel 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.260
 so i like the word will control 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.580
 but not light control that's me 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.310
 very sympathetic if i have that now 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.170
 hear now is the question there is yes 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.530
 Also a special version called itself 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.290
 airlines m 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.450
 That looks like a racing bike 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.820
 because these lights are so wonderfully discreet 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.709
 are integrated but is full 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.760
 roadworthy the situation is full 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.850
 roadworthy 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.180
 the big difference to the normal r1 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.920
 is just the semi active wings racing 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.780
 what you also about the eu 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.850
 is controlled or from 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.370
 driver can be programmed in advance 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.519
 if he wants and complete statue 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.880
 recording including gps sensor where i am 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.810
 call android candidate app 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.500
 or yourself 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.019
 program 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.640
 So I have to say I was hoping 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.560
 but also somehow knew that we 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.840
 sure to let some time that something completely 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.579
 terrific it comes out now is the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.850
 ask so priced but there is one 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.040
 actually do not measure any information 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.680
 but from when about now available 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.079
 his 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.480
 Shipments begin next march 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:52.290
 year and much more important 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:04:00.380
 when can 1000 ps drive with it from march 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.380
 Thank you very much next year
