00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.090 
live in like Alaska or somewhere where
it's<00:03:30.389> always<00:03:30.630> cold<00:03:30.989> because<00:03:31.560> I'll<00:03:31.709> be<00:03:31.829> bitch

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
it's always cold because I'll be bitch

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.039 
it's always cold because I'll be bitch
in<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.340> whole<00:03:32.489> time<00:03:32.730> because<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.810> always

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
in the whole time because it's always

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.500 
in the whole time because it's always
cold<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.130> I'll<00:03:35.340> stick<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.609> my<00:03:35.790> hot<00:03:36.000> weather<00:03:36.239> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
cold so I'll stick to my hot weather and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.610 
cold so I'll stick to my hot weather and
I'll<00:03:36.600> stick<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.870> being<00:03:37.139> burned<00:03:37.380> alive

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.490 
I'll stick to being burned alive
probably<00:03:38.220> because<00:03:39.000> he<00:03:39.150> says<00:03:39.450> being<00:03:39.959> slowly

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
probably because he says being slowly

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.009 
probably because he says being slowly
frozen<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.310> death<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.819> being<00:03:42.510> burned<00:03:42.750> alive
