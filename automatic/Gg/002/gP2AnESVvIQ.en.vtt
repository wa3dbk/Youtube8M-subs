project<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:44.980> could<00:02:45.160> hope<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.490> will<00:02:45.610> be<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
project and we could hope it will be a

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.880 
project and we could hope it will be a
successful<00:02:46.120> one<00:02:46.390> what<00:02:47.260> happened<00:02:47.650> with<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
successful one what happened with the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.470 
successful one what happened with the
original<00:02:48.040> installation<00:02:48.490> it<00:02:48.970> was<00:02:49.090> probably<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
original installation it was probably a

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.660 
original installation it was probably a
great<00:02:49.690> installation<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.470> its<00:02:50.590> time<00:02:50.800> but<00:02:51.550> this

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
great installation for its time but this

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.370 
great installation for its time but this
is<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.880> huge<00:02:52.180> improvement<00:02:52.390> because<00:02:53.050> it's<00:02:53.230> going

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
is a huge improvement because it's going

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.500 
is a huge improvement because it's going
to<00:02:53.470> integrate<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.040> screen<00:02:54.400> wall<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:55.240> is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
to integrate that screen wall that is

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.020 
to integrate that screen wall that is
the<00:02:55.810> back<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.890> Brewster<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.520> science<00:02:57.880> and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
the back of Brewster and science and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.550 
the back of Brewster and science and
technology<00:02:58.510> i<00:02:58.540> believe<00:02:58.840> built<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.350> and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
technology i believe built it and

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.950 
technology i believe built it and
ultimately<00:03:00.490> we<00:03:00.760> hope<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.240> have<00:03:01.270> more<00:03:01.600> than<00:03:01.780> one

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
ultimately we hope to have more than one

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.830 
ultimately we hope to have more than one
plaque<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.980> stair<00:03:03.250> steps<00:03:03.550> up<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.790> wall<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
plaque the stair steps up the wall the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.960 
plaque the stair steps up the wall the
same<00:03:05.110> way<00:03:05.320> that<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.710> retaining<00:03:06.430> wall<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
same way that the retaining wall in the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.730 
same way that the retaining wall in the
seat<00:03:07.150> wall<00:03:07.330> does<00:03:07.600> now<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:08.470> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> get

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
seat wall does now so it's going to get

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.280 
seat wall does now so it's going to get
integrated<00:03:09.550> into<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.030> environment<00:03:10.330> there<00:03:11.200> we

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
integrated into the environment there we

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.780 
integrated into the environment there we
have<00:03:11.410> some<00:03:11.590> nice<00:03:11.740> plantings<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.460> it<00:03:12.610> won't

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
have some nice plantings and it won't

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.360 
have some nice plantings and it won't
just<00:03:12.850> be<00:03:13.060> just<00:03:13.660> stuck<00:03:13.870> on<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> land<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:15.190> is

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
just be just stuck on the land this is

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.660 
just be just stuck on the land this is
really<00:03:15.550> going<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.790> fit<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.060> very<00:03:16.510> very<00:03:16.660> nicely
