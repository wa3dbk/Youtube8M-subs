actually the 60 gig it was easier to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.020 
actually the 60 gig it was easier to
work<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.050> i<00:00:40.079> guess<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:40.879> as<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.000> mentioned

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.609 
obviously but try and get the desktop
and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.869> together<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.409> quickly

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and then get it back together as quickly

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.010 
and then get it back together as quickly
as<00:01:25.920> possible<00:01:26.369> again<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> motherboard<00:01:27.900> is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
as possible again a motherboard is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.670 
as possible again a motherboard is
revised<00:01:28.610> look<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> clock<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.869> don't

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
revised look at the clock is on I don't

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
revised look at the clock is on I don't
know<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.280> design<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
know if I like this design you have to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.940 
know if I like this design you have to
pull<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.360> completely<00:01:33.960> apart<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
pull it completely apart just to get to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.510 
pull it completely apart just to get to
that<00:01:35.100> clock<00:01:36.140> battery<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> accessible

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that clock battery or is that accessible

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.690 
that clock battery or is that accessible
through<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> top<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.570> look<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
through the top and look like it and to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.969 
through the top and look like it and to
clean<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> ports<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.110> course<00:01:43.380> we

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
clean all the ports out of course we

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.580 
clean all the ports out of course we
could<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> somewhat<00:01:44.850> easy<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
could do it somewhat easy that way but

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.609 
could do it somewhat easy that way but
regardless<00:01:47.600> i'm<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.869> trying<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> clean<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
regardless i'm just trying to clean it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.020 
regardless i'm just trying to clean it
anything<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.549> again<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:52.640> plates<00:01:53.640> with

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
anything and again these two plates with

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.080 
anything and again these two plates with
two<00:01:54.299> screws<00:01:55.369> cinch<00:01:56.369> everything<00:01:56.610> together

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
two screws cinch everything together

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.010 
two screws cinch everything together
around<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:58.380> cpu<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.040> GPU<00:01:59.540> so<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
around the cpu and GPU so this is the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
around the cpu and GPU so this is the
motherboard<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.740> looks<00:02:01.979> eerily<00:02:02.640> similar<00:02:03.270> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
motherboard it looks eerily similar to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.680 
motherboard it looks eerily similar to

know<00:04:37.660> not<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:38.230> this<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.710> 40<00:04:39.010> i<00:04:39.040> keep

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
know not this this is the 40 i keep

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.270 
know not this this is the 40 i keep
getting<00:04:39.580> confused<00:04:40.300> i<00:04:40.450> did<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.840> 60<00:04:41.740> gig<00:04:41.950> first

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
getting confused i did the 60 gig first

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.490 
getting confused i did the 60 gig first
and<00:04:42.610> i<00:04:42.670> decided<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.330> get<00:04:43.480> into<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.870> 40<00:04:44.290> which

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
and i decided to get into the 40 which

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.650 
and i decided to get into the 40 which
obviously<00:04:45.130> get<00:04:45.370> digging<00:04:45.730> even<00:04:45.940> further<00:04:46.180> apart

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
obviously get digging even further apart

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.350 
obviously get digging even further apart
I<00:04:46.930> guess<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:47.560> looks<00:04:47.590> kind<00:04:48.070> of<00:04:48.130> cheaper<00:04:48.550> when

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
I guess it looks kind of cheaper when

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.000 
I guess it looks kind of cheaper when
you<00:04:49.450> look<00:04:49.600> at<00:04:49.750> these<00:04:49.900> compared<00:04:50.590> to<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:51.540> CPU

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
you look at these compared to the CPU

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.670 
you look at these compared to the CPU
GPU<00:04:54.360> from<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.480> back<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.960> front<00:04:55.990> kind<00:04:56.590> of

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
GPU from the back and the front kind of

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.120 
GPU from the back and the front kind of
look<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.830> same<00:04:56.980> on<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.730> original<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.600> as

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
look the same on the original and as

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.760 
look the same on the original and as
well<00:05:00.130> um<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.960> case<00:05:02.260> that<00:05:02.530> I<00:05:02.560> had<00:05:03.510> or<00:05:04.510> just<00:05:05.470> went

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
well um the case that I had or just went

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.340 
well um the case that I had or just went
up<00:05:05.920> kicking<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.460> thing<00:05:06.780> kicking<00:05:07.780> picking

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
up kicking the thing kicking picking

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.820 
up kicking the thing kicking picking
kicking<00:05:09.070> Wiccan<00:05:10.590> yeah<00:05:11.590> this<00:05:11.980> is<00:05:13.410> good<00:05:14.410> labeled

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.140 
other one had it made in China stamp
like<00:05:25.600> power<00:05:25.930> electric<00:05:26.500> company<00:05:26.950> in<00:05:27.070> Japan<00:05:27.400> in

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
like power electric company in Japan in

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.960 
like power electric company in Japan in
China<00:05:28.570> I<00:05:28.720> think<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.320> know<00:05:29.740> about<00:05:30.070> Japan<00:05:30.490> was

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
China I think that know about Japan was

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.420 
China I think that know about Japan was
made<00:05:31.210> in<00:05:31.360> China<00:05:31.660> but<00:05:31.890> normally<00:05:32.890> this<00:05:33.190> one

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
made in China but normally this one

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.980 
made in China but normally this one
would<00:05:33.610> separate<00:05:34.030> from<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.360> metal<00:05:34.600> which<00:05:34.840> is

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
would separate from the metal which is

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.020 
would separate from the metal which is
actually<00:05:35.200> a<00:05:35.440> better<00:05:35.590> design<00:05:36.130> so<00:05:36.610> I<00:05:36.700> think<00:05:36.760> they

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
actually a better design so I think they

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.660 
actually a better design so I think they
have<00:05:37.630> to<00:05:37.810> clean<00:05:38.080> all<00:05:38.230> that<00:05:38.260> dust<00:05:38.830> out<00:05:39.130> of<00:05:39.160> it

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
have to clean all that dust out of it

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.990 
have to clean all that dust out of it
it's<00:05:40.150> not<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.630> whole<00:05:41.050> lot<00:05:41.320> but<00:05:41.650> it's<00:05:42.460> still<00:05:42.700> not

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
it's not a whole lot but it's still not

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.560 
it's not a whole lot but it's still not
fun<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.840> be<00:05:44.080> honest<00:05:44.880> especially<00:05:45.880> have<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.330> tear

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
fun to be honest especially have to tear

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.600 
fun to be honest especially have to tear
it<00:05:46.720> down<00:05:46.750> so<00:05:47.200> far<00:05:47.470> to<00:05:47.650> get<00:05:47.770> all<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.160> dust<00:05:48.400> out

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
it down so far to get all the dust out

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.820 
it down so far to get all the dust out
of<00:05:48.790> it<00:05:48.970> but<00:05:49.150> it's<00:05:49.660> better<00:05:49.900> than<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.260> long<00:05:50.560> run

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
of it but it's better than the long run

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.990 
of it but it's better than the long run
when<00:05:50.980> it's<00:05:51.160> when<00:05:51.490> you're<00:05:51.640> worried<00:05:51.910> about

when it's when you're worried about

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.470 
when it's when you're worried about
overheating<00:05:52.600> everything<00:05:53.520> making<00:05:54.520> sure<00:05:54.550> as<00:05:55.300> I
