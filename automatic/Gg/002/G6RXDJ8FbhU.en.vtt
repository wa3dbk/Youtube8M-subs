I want to draw your attention to the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.049 
I want to draw your attention to the
form<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.430> mass<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:36.090> ejected<00:00:36.239> the

form of the mass that's ejected the
consistency<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> mass<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.260> ejected

consistency of the mass that's ejected

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
consistency of the mass that's ejected
and<00:00:42.079> there<00:00:43.079> was<00:00:43.670> another<00:00:44.670> coronal<00:00:45.239> mass

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and there was another coronal mass

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
and there was another coronal mass
ejection<00:00:46.250> much<00:00:47.250> larger<00:00:48.050> mass<00:00:49.489> that<00:00:50.489> was

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
ejection much larger mass that was

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.860 
ejection much larger mass that was
ejected<00:00:50.910> down<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.250> sixth<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.149> if

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
ejected down here on the sixth and if

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.740 
ejected down here on the sixth and if
you<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.579> consistency<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.480> mass

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you look at the consistency of this mass

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.279 
you look at the consistency of this mass
you'll<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.949> mass<00:01:00.109> persists<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you'll see that this mass persists and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
you'll see that this mass persists and
it's<00:01:01.440> sort<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.710> chunky<00:01:02.430> has<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> sort<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> chunky

it's sort of chunky has a sort of chunky

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.179 
it's sort of chunky has a sort of chunky
consistency<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:06.799> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.010> something

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
consistency to it and this is something

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
consistency to it and this is something
that<00:01:08.549> may<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:10.110> correlation<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.560> recent

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
volcanic eruptions I did one forecast so
far<00:01:58.430> for<00:01:59.430> volcanic<00:01:59.790> eruption<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> was<00:02:00.509> a

far for volcanic eruption it was a

far for volcanic eruption it was a
failure<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.799> trying<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.219> nail<00:02:02.369> down

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
failure and I was trying to nail down

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.190 
failure and I was trying to nail down
the<00:02:02.729> iceland<00:02:03.060> volcano<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.630> see<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.110> would

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the iceland volcano to see when it would

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.880 
the iceland volcano to see when it would
be<00:02:04.380> erupting<00:02:04.710> again<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.090> didn't

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
be erupting again and it really didn't

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.979 
be erupting again and it really didn't
erupt<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> was<00:02:08.340> sort<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.759> expected<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> but

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
erupt as it was sort of expected to but

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.570 
erupt as it was sort of expected to but
this<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.649> very<00:02:11.039> very<00:02:11.250> interesting

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
this is a very very interesting

a<00:02:25.319> way<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:26.159> we<00:02:26.250> could<00:02:26.400> potentially<00:02:28.459> validate

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
a way that we could potentially validate

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.030 
a way that we could potentially validate
this<00:02:29.609> theory<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.500> there's<00:02:31.500> another

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
this theory is that there's another

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.920 
this theory is that there's another
coronal<00:02:32.849> mass<00:02:32.969> ejection<00:02:33.540> with<00:02:34.230> even<00:02:34.769> more

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
coronal mass ejection with even more

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.640 
coronal mass ejection with even more
texture<00:02:36.930> even<00:02:37.799> more<00:02:38.040> seemingly<00:02:38.670> mass<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
texture even more seemingly mass to the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.470 
texture even more seemingly mass to the
ejection<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.389> sort<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.439> its<00:02:43.709> way<00:02:44.010> and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
ejection that is sort of on its way and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.080 
ejection that is sort of on its way and
so<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.079> another<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:47.430> very<00:02:47.760> large

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
so there is a another very very large

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.140 
so there is a another very very large
coronal<00:02:48.450> mass<00:02:48.720> ejection<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.819> happened

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
coronal mass ejection that just happened

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.530 
coronal mass ejection that just happened
on<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.359> seventh<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.609> I'm<00:02:53.609> very<00:02:54.239> concerned

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
on the seventh and I'm very concerned

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.490 
on the seventh and I'm very concerned
about<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:56.220> volcano<00:02:56.430> down<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.150> chill<00:02:57.299> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
about that volcano down and chill a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.659 
about that volcano down and chill a
because<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:59.659> this<00:03:00.659> mass<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.469> so<00:03:02.340> large

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
because this this mass is so so large

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.959 
because this this mass is so so large
and<00:03:03.030> because<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.500> consistency<00:03:05.219> of<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.519> seems

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
and because the consistency of it seems

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.890 
and because the consistency of it seems
to<00:03:06.239> be<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.859> sort<00:03:08.159> of<00:03:08.219> thing<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.760> might<00:03:09.659> be

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
to be the sort of thing that might be

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.670 
to be the sort of thing that might be
associated<00:03:10.290> with<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:11.129> higher<00:03:11.370> density<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.680> mass

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
associated with a higher density of mass

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.189 
associated with a higher density of mass
on<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:15.030> earth<00:03:15.389> in<00:03:15.780> its<00:03:16.620> hyper<00:03:17.340> symmetric

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.199

movement<00:03:19.199> now<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.949> astro<00:03:20.489> tama<00:03:20.699> tree<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:21.479> sun

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
movement now in astro tama tree the sun

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.589 
movement now in astro tama tree the sun
is<00:03:21.750> understood<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.349> be<00:03:22.519> sort<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.579> Lord<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.239> time

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
is understood to be sort of Lord of time

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.219 
is understood to be sort of Lord of time
it's<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.909> primary<00:03:26.909> time<00:03:27.120> axis<00:03:27.599> in<00:03:27.840> escrow

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
it's the primary time axis in escrow

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.710 
it's the primary time axis in escrow
tamo<00:03:28.470> tree<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.919> time<00:03:29.159> flows<00:03:29.459> out<00:03:29.720> as

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
tamo tree and so the time flows out as

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.500 
tamo tree and so the time flows out as
gravity<00:03:31.500> pulls<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.669> other<00:03:32.909> direction<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
gravity pulls in the other direction and

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.869 
gravity pulls in the other direction and
the<00:03:34.079> Sun<00:03:34.290> being<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.949> largest<00:03:35.099> source<00:03:35.729> of

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
the Sun being the largest source of

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.119 
the Sun being the largest source of
gravity<00:03:36.650> theoretically<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.919> solar

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
gravity theoretically in the solar

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.819 
gravity theoretically in the solar
system<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.699> what<00:03:39.689> I<00:03:39.959> refer<00:03:40.199> to<00:03:40.229> as<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:40.500> primary

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
system is what I refer to as the primary

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.129 
system is what I refer to as the primary
time<00:03:41.220> axis<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:41.819> so<00:03:42.269> through<00:03:42.689> the<00:03:42.930> primary

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
time axis and so through the primary

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.569 
time axis and so through the primary
time<00:03:43.560> axis<00:03:43.979> this<00:03:44.579> indicates<00:03:45.180> some<00:03:45.930> fairly

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
time axis this indicates some fairly

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.719 
time axis this indicates some fairly
significant<00:03:47.599> movement<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:49.019> mass<00:03:49.409> and<00:03:50.129> so<00:03:50.609> this

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
significant movement of mass and so this

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.330 
significant movement of mass and so this
is<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.939> movement<00:03:51.389> in<00:03:51.840> time<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:53.220> is

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
is a movement in time that is

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.080 
is a movement in time that is
approaching<00:03:53.939> the<00:03:54.150> Earth's<00:03:54.930> mass<00:03:55.819> that's<00:03:56.819> how

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
approaching the Earth's mass that's how

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.979 
approaching the Earth's mass that's how
it's<00:03:57.329> modeled<00:03:57.659> in<00:03:57.810> astro<00:03:58.109> Tama<00:03:58.319> tree<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.989> it

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
it's modeled in astro Tama tree and it

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.990 
it's modeled in astro Tama tree and it
will<00:04:01.139> be<00:04:01.229> very<00:04:01.349> interesting<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.859> see<00:04:02.250> what

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
will be very interesting to see what

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.539 
will be very interesting to see what
happens<00:04:03.389> with<00:04:03.509> this<00:04:03.659> unfortunately<00:04:04.379> I'm<00:04:04.709> very

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
happens with this unfortunately I'm very

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:12.490 
happens with this unfortunately I'm very
concerned<00:04:05.819> about<00:04:06.359> this<00:04:08.359> this<00:04:09.359> development<00:04:10.549> my

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
concerned about this this development my

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.530 
concerned about this this development my
prayers<00:04:13.500> go<00:04:13.590> out<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.189> people<00:04:14.609> in<00:04:15.060> chi<00:04:15.359> lai

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
prayers go out to the people in chi lai

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.719 
prayers go out to the people in chi lai
and<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:17.370> hope<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.509> is<00:04:18.810> not<00:04:19.729> something

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
and I hope that this is not something

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.290 
and I hope that this is not something
that<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.029> going<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.479> be

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
that is going to be

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.540 
that is going to be
become<00:04:22.810> more<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.199> global<00:04:23.530> sort<00:04:24.009> of<00:04:24.099> concern

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
become more of a global sort of concern

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.490 
become more of a global sort of concern
with<00:04:24.759> the<00:04:24.879> amount<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.120> cash<00:04:25.389> that<00:04:25.419> could<00:04:26.349> be

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
with the amount of cash that could be

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.399 
with the amount of cash that could be
released<00:04:26.889> if<00:04:27.819> there<00:04:28.629> is<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.750> proportionality

released if there is a proportionality

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.860 
released if there is a proportionality
between<00:04:31.409> the<00:04:32.409> ejection<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:34.060> was<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.750> was

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
between the ejection that was that was

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.379 
between the ejection that was that was
responsible<00:04:35.379> for<00:04:35.470> what<00:04:35.710> we've<00:04:35.860> seen<00:04:36.069> so<00:04:36.129> far

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
responsible for what we've seen so far

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.180 
responsible for what we've seen so far
if<00:04:37.389> this<00:04:37.659> is<00:04:37.840> what<00:04:37.990> we've<00:04:38.110> seen<00:04:38.289> so<00:04:38.349> far<00:04:38.560> and

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.420 

there<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.400> more<00:04:43.090> on<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.569> way<00:04:43.780> if<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:45.280> is

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
there is more on the way if this is

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.360 
there is more on the way if this is
what's<00:04:45.639> on<00:04:45.789> the<00:04:45.849> way<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:47.680> could<00:04:47.860> be<00:04:47.889> a<00:04:47.979> fairly

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
what's on the way this could be a fairly

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.869 
what's on the way this could be a fairly
serious<00:04:48.610> situation<00:04:49.389> and<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:50.650> I'm<00:04:51.370> watching

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
serious situation and so I'm watching

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.029 
serious situation and so I'm watching
this<00:04:52.000> very<00:04:52.180> closely<00:04:52.300> I've<00:04:53.139> been<00:04:53.530> doing<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.860> lot

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
this very closely I've been doing a lot

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.680 
this very closely I've been doing a lot
of<00:04:54.099> other<00:04:54.370> research<00:04:54.909> and<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.210> lot<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.419> other

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
of other research and a lot of other

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.909 
of other research and a lot of other
work<00:04:56.370> trying<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.930> model<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.080> hyper<00:04:59.259> symmetry

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
work trying to model the hyper symmetry

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.779 
work trying to model the hyper symmetry
of<00:05:00.270> what<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.389> happening<00:05:01.810> with<00:05:01.930> Fukushima

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
of what is happening with Fukushima

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.379 
of what is happening with Fukushima
because<00:05:03.789> in<00:05:03.969> estero<00:05:04.240> Tama<00:05:04.449> tree<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:06.389> photon

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
because in estero Tama tree the photon

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.600 
because in estero Tama tree the photon
and<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:08.409> high-energy<00:05:08.770> particles<00:05:09.430> are

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
and the high-energy particles are

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.719 
and the high-energy particles are
modeled<00:05:10.389> very<00:05:10.690> differently<00:05:11.259> than<00:05:12.039> in<00:05:12.460> the

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
modeled very differently than in the

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.040 
modeled very differently than in the
standard<00:05:13.060> physics<00:05:13.389> and<00:05:13.509> so<00:05:13.599> I've<00:05:13.690> been<00:05:13.780> trying

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
standard physics and so I've been trying

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.779 
standard physics and so I've been trying
to<00:05:14.139> wrap<00:05:14.319> my<00:05:14.349> head<00:05:14.710> around<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:15.069> significance

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
to wrap my head around the significance

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.209 
to wrap my head around the significance
of<00:05:15.969> having<00:05:16.780> all<00:05:17.199> of<00:05:17.259> this<00:05:17.560> radioactive

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
of having all of this radioactive

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.379 
of having all of this radioactive
material<00:05:18.669> released<00:05:18.909> into<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.270> environment

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
material released into the environment

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.830 
material released into the environment
and<00:05:20.229> that<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:21.250> not<00:05:21.430> going<00:05:21.940> too<00:05:22.180> well<00:05:22.210> as<00:05:22.569> far<00:05:22.810> as

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
and that is not going too well as far as

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.230 
and that is not going too well as far as
being<00:05:23.139> able<00:05:23.440> to<00:05:23.530> articulate<00:05:24.129> it<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.699> I

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
being able to articulate it and I

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.390 
being able to articulate it and I
apologize<00:05:25.810> for<00:05:25.840> that<00:05:28.229> also<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.860> earth<00:05:30.039> is<00:05:30.279> now

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
apologize for that also the earth is now

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.629 
apologize for that also the earth is now

in the northern hemisphere this could

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.070 
in the northern hemisphere this could

correspond to a aftershock in Japan it

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.430 
correspond to a aftershock in Japan it

15 and 40 degrees marsal most likely
north<00:06:17.199> we<00:06:18.159> could<00:06:18.400> be<00:06:18.550> seeing<00:06:18.819> an<00:06:18.940> earthquake

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
north we could be seeing an earthquake

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.680 
north we could be seeing an earthquake
in<00:06:19.509> the<00:06:19.750> next<00:06:20.050> few<00:06:20.319> days<00:06:20.560> from<00:06:21.069> this<00:06:21.279> and

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
in the next few days from this and

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.200 
in the next few days from this and
there's<00:06:22.690> been<00:06:22.900> so<00:06:23.259> much<00:06:23.440> solar<00:06:23.740> activity<00:06:24.210> that

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
there's been so much solar activity that

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.320 
there's been so much solar activity that
the<00:06:25.900> solar<00:06:26.139> wind<00:06:26.229> has<00:06:26.889> been<00:06:27.129> disturbed<00:06:27.490> by

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
the solar wind has been disturbed by

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.870 
the solar wind has been disturbed by
these<00:06:28.500> additional<00:06:29.500> events<00:06:29.800> and<00:06:30.219> so<00:06:30.520> the<00:06:30.639> solar

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
these additional events and so the solar

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.300 
these additional events and so the solar
wind<00:06:30.969> is<00:06:31.360> shaken<00:06:32.020> up<00:06:32.169> which<00:06:32.770> is<00:06:32.919> a<00:06:32.949> good<00:06:33.250> thing

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
wind is shaken up which is a good thing

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.879 
wind is shaken up which is a good thing
for<00:06:34.089> this<00:06:35.080> issue<00:06:35.320> this<00:06:35.589> look

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
for this issue this look

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.860 
for this issue this look
like<00:06:35.979> a<00:06:36.009> fairly<00:06:36.310> serious<00:06:36.729> earthquake<00:06:36.969> this<00:06:37.689> is

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
like a fairly serious earthquake this is

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.499 
like a fairly serious earthquake this is
something<00:06:38.080> that<00:06:38.289> I<00:06:38.710> thought<00:06:39.009> might<00:06:39.069> be

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
something that I thought might be

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:44.159 
something that I thought might be
possibly<00:06:41.159> 7.5<00:06:42.389> possibly<00:06:43.389> even<00:06:43.449> greater<00:06:43.870> in

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
possibly 7.5 possibly even greater in

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.309 
possibly 7.5 possibly even greater in
magnitude<00:06:44.740> and<00:06:45.279> so<00:06:45.819> hopefully<00:06:46.150> not<00:06:46.659> but

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 
magnitude and so hopefully not but

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.649 
magnitude and so hopefully not but
possibly<00:06:47.830> in<00:06:48.009> the<00:06:48.099> next<00:06:48.129> three<00:06:48.490> days<00:06:48.669> we<00:06:49.449> could

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
possibly in the next three days we could

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.809 
possibly in the next three days we could
see<00:06:49.870> an<00:06:49.960> earthquake<00:06:50.379> in<00:06:51.129> northern<00:06:51.310> hemisphere

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
see an earthquake in northern hemisphere

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.839 
see an earthquake in northern hemisphere
between<00:06:52.210> 15<00:06:53.080> and<00:06:53.110> about<00:06:53.650> 40<00:06:54.069> degrees<00:06:54.279> north

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.730 
between 15 and about 40 degrees north
not<00:06:55.449> don't<00:06:55.749> know<00:06:55.870> where<00:06:56.020> the<00:06:56.110> location<00:06:56.439> is

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
not don't know where the location is

most likely Japan second most likely

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.809 
most likely Japan second most likely
could<00:07:00.400> be<00:07:00.909> either<00:07:01.150> California<00:07:01.990> or<00:07:02.819> possibly

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:03.819 
could be either California or possibly

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.019 
could be either California or possibly
the<00:07:04.120> New<00:07:04.240> Madrid<00:07:04.389> fault<00:07:04.599> not<00:07:05.020> likely<00:07:05.439> so

the New Madrid fault not likely so

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:10.529 
the New Madrid fault not likely so
