00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
really will make a difference I think

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.810 
really will make a difference I think
particularly<00:00:33.739> it's<00:00:33.980> more<00:00:34.190> guidance<00:00:34.550> I<00:00:34.670> think

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
particularly it's more guidance I think

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.370 
particularly it's more guidance I think
it's<00:00:34.940> really<00:00:35.180> important<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.660> think<00:00:35.750> about<00:00:36.079> the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
it's really important to think about the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.470 
it's really important to think about the
garden<00:00:36.710> almost<00:00:37.399> as<00:00:37.520> an<00:00:37.700> additional<00:00:38.149> room<00:00:38.360> to

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
garden almost as an additional room to

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.049 
garden almost as an additional room to
the<00:00:38.570> house<00:00:38.780> it's<00:00:39.649> about<00:00:39.890> being<00:00:40.250> aspirational

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
the house it's about being aspirational

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.100 
the house it's about being aspirational
as<00:00:41.180> well<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:41.630> I<00:00:41.690> know<00:00:41.750> there's<00:00:42.020> the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
as well so I know there's the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.080 
as well so I know there's the
practicalities<00:00:42.860> of<00:00:42.890> daily<00:00:43.340> life<00:00:43.520> with<00:00:43.790> bins

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
bikes but hide all of those things

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.970 
bikes but hide all of those things
because<00:00:46.970> it's<00:00:47.180> really<00:00:47.420> about<00:00:47.510> showing<00:00:47.980> the

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
because it's really about showing the

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.340 
because it's really about showing the
true<00:00:49.190> potential<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.880> the<00:00:50.480> space<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.020> clearing
