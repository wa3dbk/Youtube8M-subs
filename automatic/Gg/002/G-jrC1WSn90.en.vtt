00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
sensation XE well first of all I didn't

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.939 
sensation XE well first of all I didn't
do<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> good<00:00:54.660> research<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.320> probably

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
do that have a good research I probably

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.260 
do that have a good research I probably
should<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.190> bought<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.430> device<00:00:56.910> instead

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
should have bought that device instead

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.330 
should have bought that device instead
because<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:57.780> better<00:00:57.989> specs<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.129> has<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.160 
because that's better specs but it has a
little<00:00:59.520> smaller<00:00:59.820> screen<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.449> my<00:01:00.570> three<00:01:00.809> inch
