00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.590 
letdowns in history was that goldberg
brock<00:03:32.010> lesnar<00:03:32.280> match<00:03:32.609> where<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.940> crowd<00:03:33.359> just

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
brock lesnar match where the crowd just

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.180 
brock lesnar match where the crowd just
completely<00:03:33.959> crapped<00:03:34.410> all<00:03:34.590> over<00:03:34.650> them<00:03:35.069> and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
completely crapped all over them and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.890 
completely crapped all over them and
that<00:03:35.280> was<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.880> for<00:03:36.060> Goldberg<00:03:36.329> that<00:03:36.600> was<00:03:36.750> his

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
that was it for Goldberg that was his

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.660 
that was it for Goldberg that was his
last<00:03:37.170> appearance<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.859> WWE

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
last appearance in WWE

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.120 
last appearance in WWE
so<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.389> Bret<00:03:39.690> Hart<00:03:39.959> maybe<00:03:40.560> not<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.980> that

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
so like Bret Hart maybe not to that

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.129 
so like Bret Hart maybe not to that
degree<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:41.880> like<00:03:42.120> Bret<00:03:42.359> Hart<00:03:42.569> he<00:03:42.690> also<00:03:42.840> kind

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
degree but like Bret Hart he also kind

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.900 
degree but like Bret Hart he also kind
of<00:03:43.230> went<00:03:43.410> out<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> whimper<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.639> that's<00:03:44.790> why

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
of went out with a whimper so that's why

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.460 
of went out with a whimper so that's why
I<00:03:44.940> say<00:03:45.209> they're<00:03:45.389> very<00:03:45.420> similar<00:03:46.049> in<00:03:46.139> that<00:03:46.170> way

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
I say they're very similar in that way

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.530 
I say they're very similar in that way
guys<00:03:47.340> who<00:03:47.519> were<00:03:47.639> big<00:03:47.850> stars<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.269> they're

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
guys who were big stars and they're

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.569

their home companies and their home turf

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.879 
their home companies and their home turf
who<00:03:50.760> came<00:03:51.000> over<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.540> weren't<00:03:52.230> used<00:03:52.440> properly

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
who came over and weren't used properly

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.430 
who came over and weren't used properly
and<00:03:53.359> went<00:03:54.359> out<00:03:54.450> with<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.660> whimper<00:03:54.900> instead<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.380> a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
and went out with a whimper instead of a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.160 
and went out with a whimper instead of a
bang<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.880> would<00:03:57.389> still<00:03:57.660> lean<00:03:57.840> towards

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
bang but I I would still lean towards

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.569 
bang but I I would still lean towards
