00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.859 
pencil and then you put a little violin
lodgings<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.149> does<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.329> won't<00:01:54.630> damage

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
lodgings if it does that won't damage

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.270 
lodgings if it does that won't damage
your<00:01:55.079> finish<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.710> set<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> back

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
your finish and then you set it back

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.749 
your finish and then you set it back
down<00:01:56.340> there<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.920> problem<00:01:59.549> with<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
down there and but the problem with that

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.819 
down there and but the problem with that
is<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.820> played<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.659> hard<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.649> many

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
is is that I played so hard and so many

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.540 
is is that I played so hard and so many
gigs<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.490> rest<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:05.939> hand<00:02:06.299> off<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:07.550> that

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
gigs I rest my hand off your a lot that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880 
gigs I rest my hand off your a lot that
I<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.119> decided<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.530> once<00:02:10.739> you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I just decided just and then once you

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.660 
I just decided just and then once you
you<00:02:11.190> put<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> rosin<00:02:12.060> down<00:02:12.270> if

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
you put the rosin down if

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.170 
you put the rosin down if
have<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.270> change<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.459> don't<00:02:15.610> know<00:02:15.700> exactly

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
have to change and I don't know exactly

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.699 
have to change and I don't know exactly
why<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.840> but<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.110> just<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.440> be<00:02:17.590> able

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
why this is but I just like to be able

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.440 
why this is but I just like to be able
to<00:02:17.980> move<00:02:18.099> this<00:02:18.340> thing<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.940> could<00:02:19.150> take<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
to move this thing so I could take the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.620 
to move this thing so I could take the
tape<00:02:19.660> off<00:02:19.900> at<00:02:20.140> any<00:02:20.319> time<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:21.270> adjust<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:22.450> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
tape off at any time and adjust this to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.020 
tape off at any time and adjust this to
make<00:02:22.780> sure<00:02:22.959> it's<00:02:23.110> gonna<00:02:23.260> fit<00:02:23.590> out<00:02:23.770> good<00:02:24.040> you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
make sure it's gonna fit out good you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.850 
make sure it's gonna fit out good you
know<00:02:25.180> if<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.480> decide<00:02:25.840> okay<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.530> where<00:02:26.739> I'll

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
know if I decide okay this is where I'll

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.530 
know if I decide okay this is where I'll
set<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.790> where<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.270> going<00:02:28.450> to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
set it and this is where it's going to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.620 
set it and this is where it's going to
be<00:02:29.020> good<00:02:29.500> enough<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.800> strobe<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.610> then<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.390> find

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
be good enough to strobe and then I find

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.140 
be good enough to strobe and then I find
that<00:02:31.690> wow<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.620> really<00:02:33.040> needed<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.459> be<00:02:33.700> up<00:02:33.850> about

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
that wow I really needed to be up about

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.850 
that wow I really needed to be up about
that<00:02:34.330> much<00:02:34.600> further<00:02:34.870> than<00:02:35.319> if<00:02:35.440> I'm<00:02:35.590> already

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
that much further than if I'm already

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.010 
that much further than if I'm already
you<00:02:36.100> know<00:02:36.220> kind<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.180> glued<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.600> down<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.930> the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
you know kind of glued it down to the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.850 
you know kind of glued it down to the
top<00:02:38.260> I've<00:02:38.530> got<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.860> redo<00:02:39.370> all<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.760> process<00:02:40.300> so

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
top I've got to redo all that process so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.470 
top I've got to redo all that process so
since<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.069> not<00:02:42.250> really<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.880> isn't<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.269> show

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
since it's not really this isn't a show

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.600 
since it's not really this isn't a show
guitar<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.410> he<00:02:44.470> bangs<00:02:44.650> my<00:02:44.890> working<00:02:45.310> guitar

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
guitar and he bangs my working guitar

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.400 
guitar and he bangs my working guitar
then<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:46.090> tape<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.989> just<00:02:47.140> pull

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
then I just tape it so I can just pull

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.470 
then I just tape it so I can just pull
it<00:02:47.440> up<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.160> know<00:02:48.310> screw<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.180> any

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
