vertebrae<00:00:18.439> it's<00:00:19.439> weird<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.070> most

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220

vertebrae it's weird that the most
important<00:00:20.670> part<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.880> rigging<00:00:21.210> doesn't<00:00:21.539> get

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
important part of rigging doesn't get

important part of rigging doesn't get
mentioned<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.109> lot<00:00:22.289> putting<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> bones<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.640> the

mentioned a lot putting the bones in the
right<00:00:23.880> place<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:25.199> good<00:00:25.350> example<00:00:25.769> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
right place a really good example of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
right place a really good example of
this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> clavicle<00:00:26.880> even<00:00:27.570> though<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this is the clavicle even though the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.169 
this is the clavicle even though the
shoulders<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.740> sloping<00:00:29.099> down<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.699> clavicle

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
shoulders are sloping down the clavicle

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.840 
shoulders are sloping down the clavicle
is<00:00:30.330> perfectly<00:00:30.869> horizontal<00:00:31.489> otherwise<00:00:32.489> when

is perfectly horizontal otherwise when

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.400 
is perfectly horizontal otherwise when
you<00:00:32.969> shrug<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.360> shoulders<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:34.260> would

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
you shrug your shoulders they would

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
you shrug your shoulders they would
actually<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.950> further<00:00:35.219> apart<00:00:35.700> instead<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
actually get further apart instead of

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.080 
actually get further apart instead of
going<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.930> towards<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.500> ears<00:00:38.090> but

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
going up and towards your ears but

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.970 
going up and towards your ears but
hands-down<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> toughest<00:00:40.290> piece<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.739> anatomy

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
hands-down the toughest piece of anatomy

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.819 
hands-down the toughest piece of anatomy
I've<00:00:41.309> ever<00:00:41.489> seen<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> bird<00:00:42.270> wing<00:00:42.829> luckily

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
I've ever seen as a bird wing luckily

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.110 
I've ever seen as a bird wing luckily
when<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.219> were<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.430> shooting<00:00:44.610> reference

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
when we were out shooting reference

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
when we were out shooting reference
footage<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.230> moment<00:00:46.530> where<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
footage we got this one moment where the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.580 
footage we got this one moment where the
pigeon<00:00:47.340> demonstrates<00:00:47.879> exactly<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.350> wing

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
pigeon demonstrates exactly how a wing

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.220 
pigeon demonstrates exactly how a wing
folds<00:00:50.219> usually<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.360> happened<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.809> fast<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
folds usually this happened so fast you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.660 
folds usually this happened so fast you
can't<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:52.890> I've<00:00:53.010> probably<00:00:53.250> looked<00:00:53.489> at

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
can't see it but I've probably looked at

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.430 
can't see it but I've probably looked at
this<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> hundred<00:00:54.090> times<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.050> pure

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this a hundred times because it's pure

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.040 
this a hundred times because it's pure
gold<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:56.039> animators<00:00:56.520> when<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.600> came<00:00:57.750> time<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
gold for animators when it came time to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.689 
gold for animators when it came time to
model<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> pigeon<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.309> things<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
model the pigeon one of the things that

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
model the pigeon one of the things that
we<00:00:59.760> decided<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.390> was<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.930> modeled<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we decided to do was that we modeled the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.280 
we decided to do was that we modeled the
wings<00:01:01.910> perfectly<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> scale<00:01:03.180> using<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> real

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
wings perfectly to scale using the real

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.630 
wings perfectly to scale using the real
proportions<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.040> everything<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.549> an

actual<00:01:06.030> pigeon<00:01:06.450> wing<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.680> let<00:01:07.920> us<00:01:08.070> use<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
actual pigeon wing that let us use the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760 
actual pigeon wing that let us use the
real<00:01:08.760> layout<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> bones<00:01:09.900> especially<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
real layout of the bones especially this

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
real layout of the bones especially this
hidden<00:01:11.040> shoulder<00:01:11.400> bone<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.510> you'd

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
hidden shoulder bone in there that you'd

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.120 
hidden shoulder bone in there that you'd
never<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.650> unless<00:01:13.920> you've

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
never know about unless you've

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.670 
never know about unless you've
researched<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> anatomy<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> feathers

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
researched the anatomy now the feathers

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.230 
researched the anatomy now the feathers
were<00:01:16.799> also<00:01:17.130> pretty<00:01:17.340> tough<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.909> ended<00:01:18.119> up

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
were also pretty tough so we ended up

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.840 
were also pretty tough so we ended up
just<00:01:18.299> using<00:01:18.600> set<00:01:19.229> driven<00:01:19.409> keys<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.159> spread<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just using set driven keys to spread and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520 
just using set driven keys to spread and
fold<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> outside<00:01:21.479> part<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> wing<00:01:22.290> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
fold the outside part of the wing you

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.109 
fold the outside part of the wing you
just<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.400> careful<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.880> no<00:01:23.970> matter

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
just have to be careful that no matter

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.910 
just have to be careful that no matter
what<00:01:24.450> position<00:01:24.990> they're<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.259> each<00:01:25.530> feather

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
what position they're in each feather

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
what position they're in each feather
still<00:01:26.340> stacks<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> right<00:01:27.360> order<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
still stacks up in the right order and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.410 
still stacks up in the right order and
they<00:01:27.990> don't<00:01:28.229> intersect<00:01:28.640> we<00:01:29.640> also<00:01:29.880> wanted<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
they don't intersect we also wanted to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
they don't intersect we also wanted to
add<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.840> flexibility<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> wings<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.280> we

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
add some flexibility to the wings so we

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.830 
add some flexibility to the wings so we
ended<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.790> doing<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.540> blend

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
ended up just doing that with blend

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
ended up just doing that with blend
shapes<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.320> each<00:01:34.350> object<00:01:34.970> originally<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> had

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
shapes on each object originally I had

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
shapes on each object originally I had
this<00:01:36.390> tied<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:37.020> Springs<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.040> they

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this tied to Springs that they

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.830 
this tied to Springs that they
automatically<00:01:38.670> Bend<00:01:39.030> according<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
automatically Bend according to the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
automatically Bend according to the
motion<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.740> after<00:01:41.070> doing<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.430> or<00:01:41.460> two<00:01:41.549> shots

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
motion but after doing one or two shots

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
motion but after doing one or two shots
like<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.329> realized<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.380> hate<00:01:43.890> rigs

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
like that I realized that I hate rigs

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.950 
like that I realized that I hate rigs
that<00:01:44.430> move<00:01:44.670> things<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.329> their<00:01:45.509> own

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that move things on their own

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.109 
that move things on their own
it<00:01:46.530> looks<00:01:46.710> cool<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.130> rigging<00:01:47.490> real<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it looks cool on a rigging real but the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.940 
it looks cool on a rigging real but the
animator<00:01:48.509> spends<00:01:48.899> more<00:01:49.079> time<00:01:49.140> fighting<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
animator spends more time fighting the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.760 
animator spends more time fighting the
automation<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.820> saves<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> prefer<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
automation that it saves so I prefer to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.170 
automation that it saves so I prefer to
keep<00:01:52.950> things<00:01:53.220> simple<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.880> give<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
keep things simple and just give the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.870 
keep things simple and just give the
animator<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.720> control<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.409> everything<00:01:55.880> now

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
animator a control for everything now

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.429 
animator a control for everything now
one<00:01:57.299> other<00:01:57.420> thing<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.869> tried<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
one other thing that I tried with the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.260 
one other thing that I tried with the
pigeon<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.890> something<00:01:59.219> called<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> broken<00:01:59.969> rig

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
pigeon is something called a broken rig

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.389 
pigeon is something called a broken rig
broken<00:02:01.259> rigging<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.829> means<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
broken rigging just means that the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.459 
broken rigging just means that the
different<00:02:02.790> parts<00:02:03.030> aren't<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.869> connected

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
different parts aren't really connected

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.499 
different parts aren't really connected
now<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> sounds<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.000> might<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.180> hard<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
now it sounds like that might be hard to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.570 
now it sounds like that might be hard to
animate<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.409> reality<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.069> lot<00:02:08.280> faster

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
animate but in reality it's a lot faster

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.219 
animate but in reality it's a lot faster
because<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.450> spending<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:10.020> much<00:02:10.050> time

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
because you're not spending as much time

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.800 
because you're not spending as much time
fighting<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.250> rig<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:12.120> spine<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.720> an

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
fighting with the rig the spine of an

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.880 
fighting with the rig the spine of an
actual<00:02:13.140> bird<00:02:13.349> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
actual bird is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.590 
actual bird is
shaped<00:02:14.280> which<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.700> why<00:02:14.880> they<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.300> extend

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
shaped which is why they can extend

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.930 
shaped which is why they can extend
their<00:02:15.780> heads<00:02:15.990> all<00:02:16.290> over<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.710> place<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.700> I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
their heads all over the place but I

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.120 
their heads all over the place but I
just<00:02:18.180> used<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.600> null<00:02:18.900> instead<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.590> bones<00:02:19.830> so

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
just used a null instead of bones so

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.830 
just used a null instead of bones so
that<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.550> move<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> head<00:02:21.060> anywhere<00:02:21.690> you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
that you can move the head anywhere you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.540 
that you can move the head anywhere you
want<00:02:22.080> without<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.650> limits<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.250> normal

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
want without the limits of a normal

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.510 
want without the limits of a normal
skeleton<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:25.020> only<00:02:25.290> other<00:02:25.470> control<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.310> there

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
skeleton the only other control in there

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.190 
skeleton the only other control in there
is<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.940> there's<00:02:27.120> an<00:02:27.209> extra<00:02:27.480> null<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
is that there's an extra null in the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.670 
is that there's an extra null in the
neck

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
neck

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.290 
neck
they<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.160> stays<00:02:29.370> between<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.880> body<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
they just stays between the body and the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.510 
they just stays between the body and the
head<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.660> help<00:02:30.810> smooth<00:02:31.110> things<00:02:31.380> out<00:02:31.620> and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
head to help smooth things out and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.430 
head to help smooth things out and
that's<00:02:32.700> also<00:02:32.880> useful<00:02:33.450> because<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:33.959> scale

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
that's also useful because we can scale

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.960 
that's also useful because we can scale
that<00:02:34.680> up<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.100> down<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.459> help<00:02:35.610> keep<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
that up and down to help keep the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.750 
that up and down to help keep the
volumes<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.660> neck<00:02:36.930> right<00:02:37.190> now<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.580> do

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
volumes on the neck right now if you do

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.580 
volumes on the neck right now if you do
go<00:02:38.910> with<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.090> broken<00:02:39.540> rib<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:40.020> always<00:02:40.350> put

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
go with a broken rib you can always put

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.229 
go with a broken rib you can always put
some<00:02:40.739> constraints<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.340> there<00:02:41.520> as<00:02:41.610> well<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:41.880> if

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
some constraints on there as well so if

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.790 
some constraints on there as well so if
you<00:02:42.360> need<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:42.870> connected<00:02:43.470> for<00:02:43.620> some

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
you need it to be connected for some

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.190 
you need it to be connected for some
reason<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.730> still<00:02:44.970> do<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.600> good

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
reason you can still do that a good

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.810 
reason you can still do that a good
example<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.830> would<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.070> when<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.520> pigeon

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
example of this would be when the pigeon

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.060 
example of this would be when the pigeon
is<00:02:47.940> flying<00:02:48.300> we<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.170> want<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.500> keep<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.890> head

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
is flying we do want to keep the head

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.680 
is flying we do want to keep the head
locked<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.610> body<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.360> turn<00:02:51.570> on

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
locked to the body so we just turn on

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.960 
locked to the body so we just turn on
the<00:02:51.720> constraint<00:02:52.320> now<00:02:53.160> there's<00:02:53.459> one<00:02:53.730> last

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the constraint now there's one last

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.820 
the constraint now there's one last
trick<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.570> comes<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.260> handy<00:02:55.440> when

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
trick that comes in really handy when

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.729 
trick that comes in really handy when
you're<00:02:56.070> doing<00:02:56.130> ika<00:02:56.820> chains<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.360> for<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> leg<00:02:57.930> a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
you're doing ika chains like for a leg a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.680 
you're doing ika chains like for a leg a
lot<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.220> times<00:02:59.459> people<00:02:59.730> will<00:03:00.000> build<00:03:00.300> these<00:03:00.450> in

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
lot of times people will build these in

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.710 
lot of times people will build these in
a<00:03:00.750> perfectly<00:03:01.320> straight<00:03:01.709> line<00:03:02.000> but<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:03.570> you

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
a perfectly straight line but then you

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.270 
a perfectly straight line but then you
get<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.050> problem<00:03:04.500> where<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.800> knee<00:03:05.010> will

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
get this problem where the knee will

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.400 
get this problem where the knee will
start<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.730> snap<00:03:06.060> as<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.480> goes<00:03:06.780> back<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.260> its

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
start to snap as it goes back to its

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.530 
start to snap as it goes back to its
default<00:03:07.560> pose<00:03:08.209> there's<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.269> bunch<00:03:09.480> of

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
default pose there's a bunch of

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.000 
default pose there's a bunch of
different<00:03:09.660> workarounds<00:03:10.380> people<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.769> used

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
different workarounds people have used

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.970 
different workarounds people have used
for<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.340> like<00:03:11.640> soft<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.330> K<00:03:12.390> but<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.380> much<00:03:13.769> easier

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
for this like soft I K but a much easier

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.250 
for this like soft I K but a much easier
solution<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.239> build<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.750> bones<00:03:15.989> at

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
solution is to just build the bones at

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.530 
solution is to just build the bones at
an<00:03:16.380> angle<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.010> use<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.640> IKE<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> limit<00:03:18.390> Stu

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
an angle and use the IKE a limit Stu

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.000 
an angle and use the IKE a limit Stu
keep<00:03:18.690> them<00:03:18.870> from<00:03:19.049> going<00:03:19.200> straight

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
keep them from going straight

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.100 
keep them from going straight
