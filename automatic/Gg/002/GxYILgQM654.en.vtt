00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.969
 one day you here was the first circus 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.089
 vt and the very charismatic ball today 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.520
 We will walk the 97th second generation 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.619
 not so famous, but there are many 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.910
 admirers like gustavo gustavo esse 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 here is the dream car 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.930
 that's always been done was forward 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.910
 who was in love with another always pay 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.920
 I really liked the look on him. I like him. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.610
 motor I like the way he dies rech 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.719
 Catch Wave is one so that your the car 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.559
 all day the day today we can exchange one 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.840
 telling this story is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.020
 logical now there is a net of ne 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.450
 now each explains the passion of the two 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.210
 around this special car is a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.190
 icon never 16 that this engine here in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.399
 time it was the largest aspirated bill 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.710
 specific before launching 355 to you 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.079
 think that this type of car there brings 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.690
 a more technical audience than a car 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.820
 Only a long time, I think so. 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.949
 time it was different the import had 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.659
 very little of that car, but today 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.640
 day only who really likes to buy 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.380
 nobody buys a vtr because they want one 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.350
 shopping cart because this is a duty and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.540
 Do not even think about selling that car one day. 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.689
 will not see the black plate in my hand 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.689
 This is cool, I can speed it up. 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.150
 kakÃ¡ change to 6 thousand 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.810
 he is not even 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.910
 and can up to 8 he is not even feeling the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.850
 highlight in this car was the globe 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.540
 boss to get back from here she asks me 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.760
 a jaffray 50 years since I went to 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.860
 me but it's awesome what my 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.540
 technical and think it will give Paulo ball 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.660
 will turn the producer faster without 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:55.220
 Legal provides in paragraph sought to 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.480
 that the horny and cietec is good now, right? 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.140
 too much noise 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.690
 now I'll leave it in the boss's hand looks 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.810
 who better than him is not better than her 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.810
 huh 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.220
 the daughter 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.800
 now woman this low 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.340
 It's cool, you choose. I know him. 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.330
 leave the target 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:30.120
 today back by a fallen bank 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.920
 if that bank also comes training 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.920
 a little child support is lacking 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.549
 because the family 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.930
 is 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:11.080
 he changes from the 6 thousand turns he 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.080
 he has a base he gets thicker 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.630
 Do I really want to do it? 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.410
 play look at the more power input 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.410
 from 6 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.530
 is higher in vt in 97 showed evolution of 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.670
 and was six tenths faster 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.500
 that 95 next week has s 2008 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.610
 Can he walk along with 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.020
 2015 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.870
 in 1971 and rear balanced on it is 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.570
 more planting when planting fig 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.040
 car more on the ground the evolution by 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.710
 95 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.420
 there is more it is more than chassis 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.220
 and what exactly motor 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.350
 The cavalry that was won was 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.210
 small, that's why 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.690
 I do not win the track too with more 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.780
 two cars are still fun 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.780
