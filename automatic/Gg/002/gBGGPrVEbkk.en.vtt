00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.129
 and both submit 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.230
 yes after the favorite clergy 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 and I do not 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.750
 rich 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.210
 I would have them show me what I ate in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.370
 one day that is four super meals 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 easy to do at home and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.180
 especially healthy this video has seen 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.040
 that some people have done so 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 I said it would be fun to do it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.970
 and remember that if you are not yet subscribed 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.860
 to my channel you just click on 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.989
 this little red button that is there underneath 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.150
 and you will receive a notification every 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.400
 Once you upload a new video and one of 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.650
 debit up videos if you like and now 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.640
 we are going to cook but after this 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.070
 service 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.290
 for breakfast I prepared a couple fate 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.449
 super easy to make in this jar that 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.760
 I'm re using of course use 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.950
 learn a little bit of granola after grapes 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.140
 black because they do not bring seed and they are 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.840
 super easy to use and also 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.940
 Greek yogurt then I went back to repeat every 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.160
 one of the layers until it reaches the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.160
 butt and this is the result 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.350
 for lunch prepare pita bread with 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.460
 some vegetables first in a container of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.270
 black beans also corn and piquÃ© 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.120
 a little red pepper in yellow red and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.370
 I think they are super delicious to me 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.490
 at least I like them very much and the 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.470
 I added to what I had already mixed 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.170
 previously also to these vegetables 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.160
 and the black beans that are in 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.390
 the container I added a little bit of 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.850
 rekalde remove the leaf a little bit 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.060
 smaller and also the juice of medium 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060
 lemon 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:17.600
 and of course then I came back very well 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.700
 so everyone will mix and then 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.800
 I took this pita bread that comes square and 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.650
 also cut in half previously 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.540
 and I started to fill in one of the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.060
 halves with the vegetables that had already 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.950
 prepared and here is the result them 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.560
 I say they should treat it because it is 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.670
 super good tastes delicious and is also 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.670
 super healthy 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.460
 but I took a slice of bread 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.220
 whole with raisins and then half more 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.140
 or less than an avocado and I made it puree 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.840
 then what I did was that simply 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.870
 corn on top of the slice of bread that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.180
 had previously removed and on top of 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.240
 the slice of bread then I put an egg 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.550
 that had already fried with organic oil 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.170
 of coconut and as I know that each of 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.120
 you know how to fry an entire egg 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.550
 I showed them how to do it and this 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.800
 I accompanied with a tea to which I gave a 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.200
 little bit of coffee cream if I like it that way 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:17.050
 but I did not record it and this is the result 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.240
 super delicious the head is how 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.550
 before the series after the meal 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.480
 I'm going to have a little melon too 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.880
 a mango minced milk and also ice 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.880
 well chopped I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.209
 put the mango melon in a blender 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.760
 a cup of milk you can take the one 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.190
 you want the one that better comes to you and a half 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.920
 sugar cup I'm also going to take a 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.700
 little bit of vanilla extract to taste 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.680
 for 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.720
 a greater flavor since I like to do with 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.640
 the shakes is first liquefy all the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.340
 ingredients without the ice and then 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.680
 then pour the ice to liquefy it 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.780
 about 15 seconds and that's how 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.610
 remain with ice chips have the 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.470
 comments you like in this way they 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.819
 I say to treat this shake because to know 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.819
 super delicious 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.780
 and 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.489
 you know these meals were super 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.350
 delicious so if you make them love 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.040
 please send my photos to my twitter 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.480
 concert my social networks on facebook 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.030
 internal and on twitter they find it 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.070
 easily because it is written of all 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.380
 forms we always have here in the box 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.210
 of information these links so that 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.710
 they can get directly now they 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.750
 I want to say that I'm going to start a new 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.850
 section of my videos the first Sunday 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.010
 of each month I will recommend a channel 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.990
 that this little one is still saying mine 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.790
 of course it is still small but 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.030
 I mean those channels that 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.010
 they still have less than a thousand subscribers 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.860
 because I know what it is to be in this 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.420
 place and that someone without needing 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.640
 desperately that someone helps you 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.100
 get out of there and that the actors take a 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.600
 little bit more so I decided that I'm going to 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.950
 make it easy when they know this 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.650
 situation I would have liked someone 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.020
 will help me and believe me receive very little 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.520
 help because I do not know why but the 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.950
 Most youtubers on all 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.890
 very large do not like to lend much 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.720
 video in this sense it is possible two of 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.010
 they will come their reasons 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.140
 and decides that I'm going to keep doing it 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.790
 although in the future my channel is still 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.650
 growing and that continues to grow that 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.880
 let's hope so , therefore, the 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.160
 channel that I will recommend in this 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.350
 occasion is alex mejÃ­a as they can 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.630

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.740
 very nice videos also her but she 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.990
 is starting but has less than a thousand 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.150
 subscribers so I recommend that you 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.220
