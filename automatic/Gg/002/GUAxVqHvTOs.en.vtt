there<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.050> several<00:00:28.260> reasons<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
there are several reasons for the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.089 
there are several reasons for the
development<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.060> injuries<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> arm<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
development of injuries in the arm and a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.709 
development of injuries in the arm and a
young<00:00:32.309> baseball<00:00:32.550> players<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.480> is

young baseball players one is

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
young baseball players one is
overtraining<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.770> meanings<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
overtraining it meanings that it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
overtraining it meanings that it
basically<00:00:36.329> means<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.660> their<00:00:36.930> coaches<00:00:37.469> are

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
basically means that their coaches are

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
basically means that their coaches are
pushing<00:00:39.300> them<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.750> they're<00:00:40.170> pushing

pushing them or they're pushing

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.410 
pushing them or they're pushing
themselves<00:00:40.829> too<00:00:41.610> hard<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.059> terms<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
themselves too hard in terms of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.010 
themselves too hard in terms of
preparing<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.350> play<00:00:43.590> baseball<00:00:44.570> second<00:00:45.570> even

preparing to play baseball second even

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.880 
preparing to play baseball second even
more<00:00:46.739> important<00:00:47.280> problem<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:49.200> use<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> our

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
more important problem is the use of our

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.920 
more important problem is the use of our
poor<00:00:50.190> techniques<00:00:50.780> unfortunately<00:00:51.780> many

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
poor techniques unfortunately many

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.560 
poor techniques unfortunately many
baseball<00:00:52.170> players<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.120> learn<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> proper

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570

throwing techniques and this without the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.290 
throwing techniques and this without the
proper<00:00:57.360> technique<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> lot<00:00:59.010> of

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
proper technique you really put a lot of

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.400 
proper technique you really put a lot of
stress<00:01:00.300> across<00:01:00.629> your<00:01:00.840> shoulder<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.230> elbow

that can place you at a higher risk for
injury<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.489> another<00:01:05.489> reason<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.090> many

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
injury and another reason is that many

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
injury and another reason is that many
kids<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.950> try<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> play<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.850> multiple<00:01:09.330> teams

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the second important thing is to make
