00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
it a certain amount it then comes back

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.010 
it a certain amount it then comes back
at<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.700> may<00:04:08.910> be<00:04:08.970> less<00:04:09.270> by<00:04:09.480> two<00:04:09.540> or<00:04:09.840> three

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
at you it may be less by two or three

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.500 
at you it may be less by two or three
megabytes<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.340> have<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.880> maybe<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.270> just

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
megabytes so I have to maybe just just

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.910 
megabytes so I have to maybe just just
be<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> little<00:04:12.780> conservative<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.590> don't<00:04:13.770> go

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
be a little conservative and don't go

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.440 
be a little conservative and don't go
over<00:04:14.190> there<00:04:14.220> give<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.910> little<00:04:15.090> bit<00:04:15.209> less

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
over there give a little bit less

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.590 
over there give a little bit less
needless<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.530> say<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.980> just<00:04:17.010> manually<00:04:18.000> went<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
needless to say I just manually went and

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.300 
needless to say I just manually went and
put<00:04:18.900> all<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.169> my<00:04:19.620> free<00:04:20.100> space<00:04:20.989> megabytes<00:04:22.310> back

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
put all of my free space megabytes back

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.180 
put all of my free space megabytes back
