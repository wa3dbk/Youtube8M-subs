cigarette at all this is a really good

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.190 
cigarette at all this is a really good
trick<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> looks<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.450> dramatic<00:01:34.049> it

trick because it looks so dramatic it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.020 
trick because it looks so dramatic it
looks<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> cigarette<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.400> getting

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
looks as if the cigarette is getting

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.039 
looks as if the cigarette is getting
beaten<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.479> quite<00:01:36.720> well

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
beaten up quite well

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.770 
beaten up quite well
but<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> fact<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.820> bill<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.299> taking

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
but the fact is that the bill is taking

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.260 
but the fact is that the bill is taking
most<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> beating<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.579> cigarette<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
most of the beating and the cigarette is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.840 
most of the beating and the cigarette is
safe<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:43.020> long<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.009> bill<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.460> wrapped

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
safe as long as the bill is wrapped

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.690
