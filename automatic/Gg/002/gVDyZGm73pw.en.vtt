it<00:02:23.940> wouldn't<00:02:24.330> transfer<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.500> purchases<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.250> I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
it wouldn't transfer the purchases so I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.010 
it wouldn't transfer the purchases so I
didn't<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.060> my<00:02:27.240> eye<00:02:27.270> upon<00:02:27.600> anymore

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
didn't have it on my eye upon anymore

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.480 
didn't have it on my eye upon anymore
but<00:02:28.350> it's<00:02:28.500> pretty<00:02:28.650> easy<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.100> go<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> help

I could get the gameplay and it's kind

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.400 
I could get the gameplay and it's kind
of<00:02:41.190> dark<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.820> think<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.480> don't<00:02:42.989> know<00:02:43.050> maybe<00:02:43.200> it's

of dark I think I don't know maybe it's

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.800 
of dark I think I don't know maybe it's
just<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.650> game<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:44.040> obviously<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.910> you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.330 
kind of laggy but i'm just going to go
through<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.750> thing<00:03:44.319> i'll<00:03:44.560> probably<00:03:44.769> review

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
through this thing i'll probably review

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.190 
through this thing i'll probably review
this<00:03:45.489> as<00:03:45.909> my<00:03:46.060> next<00:03:46.120> game<00:03:46.510> actually<00:03:46.780> because<00:03:47.139> i

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
this as my next game actually because i

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.440 
this as my next game actually because i
just<00:03:47.379> recently<00:03:47.590> downloaded<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.579> it's

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
just recently downloaded this and it's

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.830 
just recently downloaded this and it's
actually<00:03:49.659> a<00:03:49.989> really<00:03:50.260> good<00:03:50.379> for<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:52.389> music<00:03:52.689> is

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
actually a really good for the music is

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.330 
actually a really good for the music is
good<00:03:52.870> but<00:03:53.139> you<00:03:53.230> can't<00:03:53.409> hear<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.650> because<00:03:54.099> the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
good but you can't hear it because the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.839 
good but you can't hear it because the
audio<00:03:54.959> record<00:03:55.959> for<00:03:56.199> some<00:03:56.349> reason<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:57.609> said

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
audio record for some reason it said

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.059 
audio record for some reason it said
something<00:03:58.150> about<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.540> being<00:03:58.750> only<00:03:59.650> on<00:03:59.799> certain

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
something about it being only on certain

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.660 
something about it being only on certain
games<00:04:00.519> because

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
games because

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.400 
games because
remember<00:04:02.349> exactly<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:03.740> and<00:04:04.240> then<00:04:05.240> some<00:04:05.569> games

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
remember exactly so and then some games

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.050 
remember exactly so and then some games
that<00:04:06.590> don't<00:04:06.680> support<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.250> or<00:04:07.400> apps<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:07.880> don't

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
that don't support it or apps you don't

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.350 
that don't support it or apps you don't
support<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.480> then<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:10.550> turns<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.270> to

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
support it then it just turns it to

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.350 
support it then it just turns it to
video<00:04:11.599> mode<00:04:11.870> but<00:04:12.410> um<00:04:12.700> overall<00:04:13.700> this<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:14.060> good

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
video mode but um overall this is a good

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.289 
video mode but um overall this is a good
I<00:04:14.950> guess<00:04:15.950> it's<00:04:16.100> okay<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:18.250> solution<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.579> about

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
I guess it's okay a solution to about

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.420 
I guess it's okay a solution to about
having<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.570> jailbroken<00:04:20.900> ipod<00:04:21.290> if<00:04:22.040> you<00:04:22.220> want

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
having a jailbroken ipod if you want

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.360 
having a jailbroken ipod if you want
display<00:04:22.790> recorder<00:04:22.940> i<00:04:23.560> kind<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.590> fail<00:04:24.800> here<00:04:25.160> I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
display recorder i kind of fail here I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.100 
display recorder i kind of fail here I
figure<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.210> could<00:04:26.300> finish<00:04:26.540> them<00:04:26.750> off<00:04:26.810> with<00:04:26.990> some

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
figure I could finish them off with some

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.070 
figure I could finish them off with some
punches<00:04:27.440> but<00:04:27.620> wait<00:04:28.160> on<00:04:28.340> my<00:04:28.550> toes<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.970> here<00:04:29.180> but

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
punches but wait on my toes it here but

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.780 
punches but wait on my toes it here but
um<00:04:30.290> just<00:04:31.130> later<00:04:31.400> on<00:04:31.750> anyway<00:04:32.750> but<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.740> coming<00:04:34.669> up

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
um just later on anyway but so coming up

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.730 
um just later on anyway but so coming up
in<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.030> second<00:04:35.450> is<00:04:35.630> going<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.139> be<00:04:36.260> display

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
in a second is going to be display

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.930 
in a second is going to be display
recorder<00:04:36.889> from<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:40.220> actual<00:04:40.550> display

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
recorder from the actual display

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.070 
recorder from the actual display
recorder<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:41.600> can<00:04:41.720> see<00:04:41.870> it's<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.050> little

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
recorder and you can see it's a little

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.530 
recorder and you can see it's a little
brighter<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:43.729> looks<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.060> little<00:04:44.210> better<00:04:44.419> I

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
brighter and it looks a little better I

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.360 
brighter and it looks a little better I
think<00:04:47.200> and<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.350> doesn't<00:04:48.530> lag<00:04:48.770> quite<00:04:49.070> as<00:04:49.190> much

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.370 

right<00:04:52.030> here's<00:04:52.270> where<00:04:52.449> I<00:04:52.479> fail<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:52.960> think<00:04:53.199> I<00:04:53.229> can

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
right here's where I fail I think I can

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.770 
right here's where I fail I think I can
finish<00:04:53.590> off<00:04:53.830> punch<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:54.580> but<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:55.360> controls

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
finish off punch this but it controls

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.290 
finish off punch this but it controls
are<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:55.960> little<00:04:56.110> bit<00:04:56.290> weird<00:04:56.500> on<00:04:56.650> this<00:04:56.770> game<00:04:56.949> but

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
are a little bit weird on this game but

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.420 
are a little bit weird on this game but
it's<00:04:58.300> because<00:04:58.690> but<00:04:59.290> they're<00:04:59.590> pretty<00:04:59.770> good<00:05:00.010> for

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
it's because but they're pretty good for

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.670 
it's because but they're pretty good for
a<00:05:00.460> type<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.389> game<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:01.810> is<00:05:01.930> so<00:05:02.610> but<00:05:04.169> overall<00:05:05.169> the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
a type of game it is so but overall the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.590 
a type of game it is so but overall the
display<00:05:06.040> recorder<00:05:06.220> app<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.820> pretty<00:05:06.850> good<00:05:07.330> but

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
display recorder app is pretty good but

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.930 
display recorder app is pretty good but
it's<00:05:07.750> it<00:05:08.470> could<00:05:08.620> be<00:05:08.710> better<00:05:08.889> like<00:05:09.250> it's<00:05:09.610> okay

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
it's it could be better like it's okay

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.780 
it's it could be better like it's okay

simple game type of thing even like this

simple game type of thing even like this
kappa<00:05:14.860> game<00:05:15.070> is<00:05:15.220> not<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.490> big<00:05:15.639> of<00:05:15.699> a<00:05:15.820> deal<00:05:15.940> but

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
kappa game is not that big of a deal but

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.420 
kappa game is not that big of a deal but
as<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:16.960> can<00:05:17.080> tell<00:05:17.139> on<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.860> display<00:05:18.190> recorder

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
as you can tell on the display recorder

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.200 
as you can tell on the display recorder
here<00:05:18.940> it<00:05:19.300> runs<00:05:19.570> better<00:05:19.780> on<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.880> some

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
here it runs better on this and some

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.870 
here it runs better on this and some
games<00:05:22.389> won't<00:05:22.720> even<00:05:22.930> open<00:05:23.110> for<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.830> split<00:05:24.729> of

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
games won't even open for the split of

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.230 
games won't even open for the split of
the<00:05:25.030> app<00:05:26.020> store<00:05:26.220> display<00:05:27.220> recorder<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.910> just

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
the app store display recorder it just

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.140 
the app store display recorder it just
goes<00:05:28.419> like<00:05:28.600> a<00:05:28.660> blank<00:05:28.960> screen<00:05:29.110> for<00:05:29.560> some<00:05:29.710> reason

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
goes like a blank screen for some reason

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.280 
goes like a blank screen for some reason
so

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.080 

I've<00:05:35.290> I<00:05:35.710> don't<00:05:36.130> know<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.490> just<00:05:36.520> seems<00:05:36.699> that

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
I've I don't know it just seems that

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.460 
I've I don't know it just seems that
this<00:05:37.419> is<00:05:37.630> a<00:05:37.660> little<00:05:37.840> bit<00:05:38.020> better<00:05:38.139> than<00:05:38.410> the

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
this is a little bit better than the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.430 
this is a little bit better than the
other<00:05:38.770> than<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.460> one<00:05:39.729> that<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:40.030> get<00:05:40.260> in<00:05:41.260> the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
other than the one that you get in the

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.770 
other than the one that you get in the
app<00:05:42.280> store<00:05:42.310> but<00:05:42.699> i<00:05:42.729> think<00:05:42.910> it's<00:05:43.060> i<00:05:43.300> don't<00:05:43.570> know

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
app store but i think it's i don't know

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.969 
app store but i think it's i don't know
if<00:05:43.870> it's<00:05:43.960> made<00:05:44.110> by<00:05:44.229> the<00:05:44.290> same<00:05:44.380> people<00:05:44.530> but<00:05:44.889> i

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
if it's made by the same people but i

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.439 
if it's made by the same people but i
think<00:05:45.130> it's<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.280> good<00:05:45.370> idea<00:05:45.490> like<00:05:46.060> it's<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.300> good

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
think it's a good idea like it's a good

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.530 
think it's a good idea like it's a good
app<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:47.020> have<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.500> think<00:05:48.220> that<00:05:48.310> they<00:05:48.430> should

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
app to have I think that they should

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.090 
app to have I think that they should
patch<00:05:49.540> hopefully<00:05:50.199> and<00:05:50.380> updates<00:05:50.740> they'll

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
patch hopefully and updates they'll

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.740 
patch hopefully and updates they'll
change<00:05:51.910> it<00:05:52.090> so<00:05:52.300> that<00:05:52.330> it's<00:05:52.660> less<00:05:53.590> laggy<00:05:53.889> and<00:05:54.750> I

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
change it so that it's less laggy and I

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.439 
change it so that it's less laggy and I
fail<00:05:55.990> here<00:05:56.229> so<00:05:56.410> I<00:05:56.470> cut<00:05:56.740> off<00:05:57.010> I<00:05:57.310> don't<00:05:57.910> know<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.000> at

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
fail here so I cut off I don't know I at

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.030 
fail here so I cut off I don't know I at
fault<00:05:58.720> i<00:05:58.960> fell<00:05:58.990> through<00:05:59.410> the<00:05:59.470> first<00:05:59.830> one<00:05:59.979> I

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
fault i fell through the first one I

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.010 
fault i fell through the first one I
tried<00:06:00.070> it's<00:06:00.430> either<00:06:00.610> each<00:06:00.790> other<00:06:00.970> country<00:06:01.270> as

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
tried it's either each other country as

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.409 
tried it's either each other country as
you<00:06:02.229> phone<00:06:02.470> you<00:06:02.740> just<00:06:02.889> die<00:06:03.070> you<00:06:03.940> slowly<00:06:04.180> die

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
you phone you just die you slowly die

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.800 
you phone you just die you slowly die
but<00:06:04.660> anyway<00:06:05.229> so<00:06:05.910> overall<00:06:06.910> it's<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.090> good<00:06:07.300> app

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
but anyway so overall it's a good app

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.140 
but anyway so overall it's a good app
but<00:06:08.530> um<00:06:08.680> hopefully<00:06:09.400> they<00:06:09.699> fix<00:06:09.729> some<00:06:10.120> things

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
but um hopefully they fix some things

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.689 
but um hopefully they fix some things
and<00:06:10.510> patches<00:06:10.990> and<00:06:14.039> other<00:06:15.039> than<00:06:15.250> that<00:06:15.460> I<00:06:15.490> think

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
and patches and other than that I think

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.670 
and patches and other than that I think
it's<00:06:16.030> it's<00:06:16.330> okay<00:06:16.600> i'll<00:06:16.810> give<00:06:16.990> it<00:06:17.050> a<00:06:17.199> three
