we're going to repeat this process all
the<00:01:55.810> way<00:01:55.869> across<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.380> top<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.920> vehicle

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
the way across the top of the vehicle

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.570 
the way across the top of the vehicle
there<00:01:58.450> is<00:01:58.630> two<00:01:59.289> more<00:01:59.530> connectors<00:02:00.039> here<00:02:00.310> at<00:02:00.429> the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
there is two more connectors here at the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.200 
there is two more connectors here at the
bottom<00:02:00.910> on<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.060> sides<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.670> connector<00:02:04.149> on

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
and when a trigger is pushed down it

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.480 
and when a trigger is pushed down it
releases<00:02:10.140> these<00:02:11.140> triggers<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.860> these

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
releases these triggers on these

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.690 
releases these triggers on these
connectors<00:02:13.060> are<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:14.560> little<00:02:15.190> trigger<00:02:15.459> right

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
here at the very back and you push this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.980 
here at the very back and you push this
trigger<00:02:18.010> down<00:02:18.490> which<00:02:19.209> releases<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.900> and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
trigger down which releases it and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.180 
trigger down which releases it and
you're<00:02:20.080> able<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.319> wiggle<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.709> connector
