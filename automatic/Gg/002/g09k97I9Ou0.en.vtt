going it nicely the vehicle for all it
looks<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.650> bit<00:01:55.680> well<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.730> thought<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
looks a bit well what I thought it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
looks a bit well what I thought it
looked<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.360> bit<00:01:57.390> cheap<00:01:57.720> when<00:01:57.870> I<00:01:57.930> first<00:01:58.200> saw<00:01:58.410> but

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
looked a bit cheap when I first saw but

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.230 
looked a bit cheap when I first saw but
when<00:01:59.370> you're<00:01:59.460> opening<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.910> box<00:02:00.090> it's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
when you're opening out of the box it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.580 
when you're opening out of the box it's
exactly<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.690> same<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.050> take<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> clones

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
exactly the same as you take the clones

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.640 
exactly the same as you take the clones
one<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:03.030> looks<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.390> lot<00:02:03.810> cleaner<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.350> would

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
one just looks a lot cleaner I would

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.750 
one just looks a lot cleaner I would
have<00:02:04.740> liked<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.010> if<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.190> was<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> bit<00:02:05.460> dirtier

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
have liked it if it was a bit dirtier

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.500 
have liked it if it was a bit dirtier
maybe<00:02:06.980> but<00:02:07.980> I<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:08.970> goes<00:02:09.090> really<00:02:09.360> well

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
maybe but I think it goes really well

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.630 
maybe but I think it goes really well
with<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> collection<00:02:10.290> atom<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
with the collection atom out of a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.830 
with the collection atom out of a
possible<00:02:12.090> 10<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.750> would<00:02:13.020> give<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:14.780> about<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
possible 10 I would give it a about a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.400 
possible 10 I would give it a about a
nine<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.430> half<00:02:17.460> nine<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.290> it's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
nine and a half nine just because it's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.190 
nine and a half nine just because it's
so<00:02:19.650> nice<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.070> big<00:02:20.250> too<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.690> turrets<00:02:22.110> are

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
so nice and big too and the turrets are

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.030 
so nice and big too and the turrets are
a<00:02:22.230> bit<00:02:22.380> different<00:02:22.560> too<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:25.590> apart<00:02:25.860> from<00:02:25.920> that

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
a bit different too but apart from that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.830 
a bit different too but apart from that
a<00:02:26.310> really<00:02:26.760> good<00:02:26.880> vehicle<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> recommend<00:02:27.660> it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
a really good vehicle and I recommend it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.280
