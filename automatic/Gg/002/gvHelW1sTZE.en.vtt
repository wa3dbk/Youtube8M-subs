00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.900 

hey<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.680> nature<00:00:04.859> with<00:00:05.160> bright<00:00:05.400> Agrotech<00:00:05.580> and

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
hey this nature with bright Agrotech and

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.820 
hey this nature with bright Agrotech and
today<00:00:06.210> as<00:00:06.690> part<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.960> our<00:00:07.049> nutrient<00:00:07.440> series<00:00:07.680> I'm

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
today as part of our nutrient series I'm

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.980 
today as part of our nutrient series I'm
going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.040> talk<00:00:08.220> quickly<00:00:08.429> about<00:00:08.639> sulfur<00:00:14.870> so<00:00:15.870> we

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
going to talk quickly about sulfur so we

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.689 
going to talk quickly about sulfur so we
have<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.289> primary<00:00:16.529> plant<00:00:16.949> nutrients<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
have the primary plant nutrients and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.029 
have the primary plant nutrients and
everyone's<00:00:18.029> seen<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.539> mpk<00:00:19.199> within<00:00:19.920> our

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
everyone's seen this is mpk within our

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.599 
everyone's seen this is mpk within our
secondary<00:00:20.810> macronutrients<00:00:21.810> are<00:00:22.199> calcium

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
secondary macronutrients are calcium

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.870 
secondary macronutrients are calcium
magnesium<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.619> sulfur<00:00:25.730> we've<00:00:26.730> already

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
magnesium and sulfur we've already

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730 
magnesium and sulfur we've already
talked<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.300> calcium<00:00:27.689> we've<00:00:28.260> chatted<00:00:28.500> about

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
talked about calcium we've chatted about

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980 
talked about calcium we've chatted about
magnesium<00:00:29.220> pretty<00:00:29.699> quickly<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.359> today<00:00:30.810> I'm

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
magnesium pretty quickly and today I'm

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.840 
magnesium pretty quickly and today I'm
going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> quickly<00:00:31.439> address<00:00:31.920> sulphur<00:00:32.489> because

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
going to quickly address sulphur because

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.580 
going to quickly address sulphur because
a<00:00:32.880> lot<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.270> people<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.660> concerned<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
a lot of people are concerned about it

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
a lot of people are concerned about it
so<00:00:35.190> sulphur<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.730> present<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.270> our<00:00:36.360> system<00:00:36.420> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
so sulphur is present in our system in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.580 
so sulphur is present in our system in
the<00:00:36.989> form<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.410> sulfate<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.149> so4<00:00:39.149> okay<00:00:39.780> sulfate

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the form of sulfate or so4 okay sulfate

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.020 
the form of sulfate or so4 okay sulfate
is<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.890> floating<00:00:41.250> around<00:00:41.340> our<00:00:41.550> system<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
is just floating around our system and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.030 
is just floating around our system and
the<00:00:42.120> plants<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.540> taking<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.469> they're

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the plants are taking it up and they're

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.529 
the plants are taking it up and they're
reducing<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:44.969> using<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.480> for

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
reducing it and they're using it for

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.229 
reducing it and they're using it for
things<00:00:46.379> mostly<00:00:47.039> things<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.550> building<00:00:48.000> amino

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
things mostly things like building amino

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
things mostly things like building amino
acids<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.899> other<00:00:49.160> chemicals<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.489> very

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
acids and other chemicals that are very

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.920 
acids and other chemicals that are very
important<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.780> plan<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:53.539> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.750> how

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
important to the plan so this is how

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.529 
important to the plan so this is how
sulfur<00:00:55.710> occurs<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> system<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:57.360> you'll

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
sulfur occurs in the system now you'll

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.689 
sulfur occurs in the system now you'll
also<00:00:57.750> notice<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.559> lot<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> amendments

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
also notice that a lot of the amendments

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.849 
also notice that a lot of the amendments
that<00:00:59.730> we've<00:00:59.969> talked<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.480> over<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> years

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that we've talked about over the years

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
that we've talked about over the years
are<00:01:02.550> sulfate<00:01:03.329> based<00:01:03.570> amendments<00:01:04.140> Kay<00:01:04.320> so

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
are sulfate based amendments Kay so

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.850 
are sulfate based amendments Kay so
potassium<00:01:04.860> sulfate<00:01:05.750> we<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.320> last<00:01:07.500> video

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
potassium sulfate we in the last video

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
potassium sulfate we in the last video
we<00:01:08.010> talked<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.340> epsom<00:01:08.880> salts<00:01:09.240> magnesium

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
we talked about epsom salts magnesium

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.859 
we talked about epsom salts magnesium
sulfate<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.909> I've<00:01:11.909> heard<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> from<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.630> lot<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sulfate and I've heard it from a lot of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.750 
sulfate and I've heard it from a lot of
different<00:01:13.140> people<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.860> say<00:01:14.100> oh<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.520> use<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
different people I say oh well use a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.149 
different people I say oh well use a
potassium<00:01:15.180> sulfate<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.710> help<00:01:16.920> supplement

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
potassium sulfate to help supplement

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.899 
potassium sulfate to help supplement
potassium<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.299> they<00:01:18.750> say<00:01:18.930> okay<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.350> great

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
potassium and they say okay that's great

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.120 
potassium and they say okay that's great
but<00:01:20.909> I'm<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.380> worried<00:01:22.920> about

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
but I'm really really worried about

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.260 
but I'm really really worried about
having<00:01:23.670> too<00:01:23.850> much<00:01:24.000> sulfate<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:24.930> system<00:01:25.380> so

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
having too much sulfate in my system so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.219 
having too much sulfate in my system so
today<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> talk<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:28.080> bit

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
today I'm going to talk a little bit

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
today I'm going to talk a little bit
about<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.579> sulphur<00:01:30.150> toxicity

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
about that and and sulphur toxicity

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.069 
about that and and sulphur toxicity
sulfate<00:01:31.140> toxicity<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.880> we're<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:33.960> gonna

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
sulfate toxicity and we're just gonna

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.370 
sulfate toxicity and we're just gonna
kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.590> debunk<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.060> idea<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.780> sulfate<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
kind of debunk the idea that sulfate is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.130 
kind of debunk the idea that sulfate is
a<00:01:37.409> problem<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.130> most<00:01:38.280> aquaponic<00:01:39.000> systems<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
a problem in most aquaponic systems so

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.649 
a problem in most aquaponic systems so
sulfate<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.650> almost<00:01:40.920> never<00:01:41.220> deficient<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.060> have

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
sulfate is almost never deficient I have

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.020 
sulfate is almost never deficient I have
yet<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.799> an<00:01:43.920> aquaponic<00:01:44.549> system<00:01:44.880> where

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
yet to see an aquaponic system where

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.510 
yet to see an aquaponic system where
there<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> problem<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.649> sulfate<00:01:47.130> being

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
there was a problem with sulfate being

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.960 
there was a problem with sulfate being
too<00:01:47.759> low<00:01:47.990> I've<00:01:48.990> also<00:01:49.290> never<00:01:50.009> seen<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.430> system

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
too low I've also never seen a system

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.700 
too low I've also never seen a system
where<00:01:51.450> there's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.720> problem<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.350> sulfate

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
where there's a problem with sulfate

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.730 
where there's a problem with sulfate
being<00:01:52.950> too<00:01:53.220> high<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.659> will<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.590> in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
being too high now I will say that in

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
being too high now I will say that in
aquaponic<00:01:56.399> systems<00:01:56.759> sulfates<00:01:57.240> tend<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> run

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
aquaponic systems sulfates tend to run

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
aquaponic systems sulfates tend to run
pretty<00:01:57.990> high<00:01:58.200> some<00:01:58.799> folks<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.340> systems<00:01:59.790> that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
pretty high some folks have systems that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.520 
pretty high some folks have systems that
run<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.299> above<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> hundred<00:02:00.780> parts<00:02:01.170> per<00:02:01.320> million

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
run up above a hundred parts per million

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.230 
run up above a hundred parts per million
some<00:02:01.920> even<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.369> hundred<00:02:02.430> eighty<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:02.909> hundred

some even one hundred eighty two hundred

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110

above that

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.080 
above that
you're<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:14.980> gonna<00:02:15.160> be<00:02:15.340> hurting<00:02:15.610> your<00:02:15.730> plants

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
you're not gonna be hurting your plants

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.250 
you're not gonna be hurting your plants
and<00:02:16.270> you're<00:02:16.390> probably<00:02:16.600> not<00:02:16.930> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> be

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and you're probably not going to be

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.410 
and you're probably not going to be
hurting<00:02:17.470> your<00:02:17.620> fish<00:02:17.890> now<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.640> worst<00:02:19.060> thing

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
hurting your fish now the worst thing

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.090 
hurting your fish now the worst thing
that<00:02:19.450> can<00:02:19.690> happen<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:20.290> you'll<00:02:20.530> start<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.890> see<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
that can happen is you'll start to see a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.070 
that can happen is you'll start to see a
little<00:02:21.370> bit<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.790> nitrogen<00:02:22.390> deficiency

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
little bit of a nitrogen deficiency

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.230 
little bit of a nitrogen deficiency
because<00:02:23.530> what<00:02:23.920> happens<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:24.670> sulfate

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
because what happens is this sulfate

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.410 
because what happens is this sulfate
starts<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.140> interfere<00:02:26.650> with<00:02:27.060> nitrate<00:02:28.060> uptake

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
starts to interfere with nitrate uptake

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.930 
starts to interfere with nitrate uptake
in<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.660> plants<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.040> long<00:02:30.430> before<00:02:30.700> you

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
in the plants so long before you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.450 
in the plants so long before you
actually<00:02:31.300> see<00:02:31.660> any<00:02:31.870> kind<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.140> toxicity<00:02:32.710> you're

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
actually see any kind of toxicity you're

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.220 
actually see any kind of toxicity you're
just<00:02:33.640> gonna<00:02:33.730> see<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.000> reduction<00:02:34.330> in<00:02:34.660> your<00:02:34.780> your

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
just gonna see a reduction in your your

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.260 
just gonna see a reduction in your your
nitrate<00:02:35.710> use<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.520> way<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.700> recognize

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
nitrate use and the way you recognize

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.260 
nitrate use and the way you recognize
that<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> nitrogen<00:02:37.960> deficiency<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:40.030> when

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
that is a nitrogen deficiency but when

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.910 
that is a nitrogen deficiency but when
you<00:02:40.390> test<00:02:40.690> your<00:02:40.870> water<00:02:41.050> you've<00:02:41.530> got<00:02:41.740> high

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
you test your water you've got high

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.430 
you test your water you've got high
nitrates<00:02:42.430> consistently<00:02:43.240> so<00:02:43.750> that's<00:02:43.960> one<00:02:44.230> way

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
nitrates consistently so that's one way

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.140 
nitrates consistently so that's one way
to<00:02:44.500> diagnose<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.430> fact<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.790> you've<00:02:45.970> got<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
to diagnose the fact that you've got a

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.910 
to diagnose the fact that you've got a
little<00:02:46.420> bit<00:02:46.540> too<00:02:46.660> much<00:02:46.780> sulfate<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.470> your

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
little bit too much sulfate in your

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.800 
little bit too much sulfate in your
system<00:02:48.400> now<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.240> this<00:02:49.330> something<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.720> be

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
system now is this something to be

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.890 
system now is this something to be
worried<00:02:50.170> about<00:02:50.670> probably<00:02:51.670> not<00:02:51.970> like<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.630> said

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
worried about probably not like I said

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.200 
worried about probably not like I said
I've<00:02:53.080> seen<00:02:53.320> very<00:02:53.740> few<00:02:53.920> systems<00:02:54.610> where<00:02:54.790> sulfate

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
I've seen very few systems where sulfate

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.390 
I've seen very few systems where sulfate
is<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> problem<00:02:55.990> either<00:02:56.260> too<00:02:56.710> much<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.220> or

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
is a problem either too much of it or

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.760 
is a problem either too much of it or
too<00:02:57.910> little<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.540> remember<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.410> plants

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
too little of it remember that plants

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.590 
too little of it remember that plants
can<00:02:59.830> take<00:03:00.160> up<00:03:00.340> variable<00:03:00.970> amounts<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.480> these

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
can take up variable amounts of these

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.420 
can take up variable amounts of these
compounds<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:02.320> if<00:03:02.530> you've<00:03:02.890> got<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.070> little<00:03:03.280> bit

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
compounds so if you've got a little bit

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.010 
compounds so if you've got a little bit
too<00:03:03.610> much<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.970> something<00:03:04.180> oftentimes<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
too much of something oftentimes the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.080 
too much of something oftentimes the
plants<00:03:05.290> are<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.470> taking<00:03:05.830> up<00:03:05.950> extra<00:03:06.100> extra

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
plants are just taking up extra extra

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.780 
plants are just taking up extra extra
that's<00:03:07.360> called<00:03:07.570> luxury<00:03:08.110> consumption<00:03:08.790> it's

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that's called luxury consumption it's

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.060 
that's called luxury consumption it's
more<00:03:10.150> than<00:03:10.330> they<00:03:10.480> need<00:03:10.720> but<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.620> know<00:03:11.770> it's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
more than they need but you know it's

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.950 
more than they need but you know it's
not<00:03:12.430> gonna<00:03:12.640> hurt<00:03:12.850> them<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:13.570> not<00:03:13.720> always

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
not gonna hurt them it's not always

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.510 
not gonna hurt them it's not always
going<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.230> help<00:03:14.440> them<00:03:14.680> but<00:03:15.160> it's<00:03:15.280> certainly

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
going to help them but it's certainly

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.370 
going to help them but it's certainly
not<00:03:15.610> going<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.940> hurt<00:03:16.120> them<00:03:16.240> so<00:03:16.450> that's

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
not going to hurt them so that's

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.900 
not going to hurt them so that's
important<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.010> remember<00:03:18.130> when<00:03:18.580> you're<00:03:18.730> adding

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
important to remember when you're adding

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.300 
important to remember when you're adding
sulfate<00:03:19.720> based<00:03:20.140> supplements<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:20.950> potassium

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
sulfate based supplements so potassium

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.690 
sulfate based supplements so potassium
sulfate<00:03:22.180> magnesium<00:03:22.770> sulfate<00:03:23.770> that<00:03:24.250> kind<00:03:24.550> of

sulfate magnesium sulfate that kind of

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.420 
sulfate magnesium sulfate that kind of
thing<00:03:24.940> most<00:03:25.900> likely<00:03:26.560> you're<00:03:26.920> not<00:03:26.950> going<00:03:27.160> to

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
thing most likely you're not going to

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.030 
thing most likely you're not going to
have<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.760> be<00:03:27.880> worrying<00:03:28.420> about<00:03:28.890> having<00:03:29.890> too

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
have to be worrying about having too

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.710 
have to be worrying about having too
much<00:03:30.160> sulfate<00:03:30.610> in<00:03:30.730> your<00:03:30.850> system<00:03:31.180> any<00:03:31.390> kind<00:03:31.630> of

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
much sulfate in your system any kind of

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.350 
much sulfate in your system any kind of
toxicity<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:32.830> feel<00:03:33.100> free<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.340> add<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.580> way<00:03:33.940> until

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
toxicity so feel free to add a way until

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.240 
toxicity so feel free to add a way until
you<00:03:34.450> start<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.810> see<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:35.230> loss<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.650> efficiency

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
you start to see a loss of efficiency

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.210 
you start to see a loss of efficiency
when<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.000> comes<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.360> nitrate<00:03:37.720> uptake<00:03:38.290> again

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
when it comes to nitrate uptake again

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.160 
when it comes to nitrate uptake again
this<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.580> a<00:03:39.610> really<00:03:39.880> important<00:03:40.480> plant

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
this is a really important plant

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.940 
this is a really important plant
nutrient<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:41.920> sulfur<00:03:43.140> plants<00:03:44.140> use<00:03:44.260> almost<00:03:44.770> as

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
nutrient so sulfur plants use almost as

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.090 
nutrient so sulfur plants use almost as
much<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.459> as<00:03:45.490> as<00:03:46.380> phosphate<00:03:47.380> at<00:03:47.590> different

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
much of it as as phosphate at different

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.910 
much of it as as phosphate at different
times<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:50.020> is<00:03:50.200> definitely<00:03:50.560> something

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
times so this is definitely something

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.540 
times so this is definitely something
