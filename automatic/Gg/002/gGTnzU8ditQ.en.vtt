00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.370
 make a demonstration of how it is placed 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.230
 this rope around the rim to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.450
 when we are in the snow the week that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 enters its alternative system to the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.370
 chains that are normally used to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 me but like here in Monterrey not even 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.140
 they even sell them in addition to what 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.029
 we better use them once in this life 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.100
 system already comes with some internet 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.880
 modifications let's see if yes it is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.100
 practical and easy to press is a test 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.199
 theoretical practice we see it the week 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.370
 which enters when we are in the snow in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.290
 the hill of the potosÃ­ 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.829
 start here are about 6 to 7 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.829
 meters 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.400
 which is quite economical 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.199
 we made a buttonhole 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.450
 all right 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.820
 duc 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.320
 It's a long rope 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.030
 we can get confused a little but 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.030
 very simple 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.170
 here 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.170
 I know where it comes from 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.729
 and be careful with the pivot nothing more 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.729
 ah 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.550
 let's do 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.490
 a mooring to stay in that place 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.540
 to transport 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.620
 let's be something of m 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.870
 of tension so that I 'm not just going to 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.650
 loosen up 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.650
 with the movement 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.150
 but over here it's going to be 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.150
 enough 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.980
 have a little more traction of the 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.550
 snow 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.260
 and it is very important 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.610
 and it is that you can not circulate more than 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.380
 30 kilometers per hour with these 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.470
 chains 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.740
 for answers 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.750
 and we make one out of the movement 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.750
 noting that the rope does not interfere 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.709
 the parents 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.210
 make walking say no 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.840
 goodbye
