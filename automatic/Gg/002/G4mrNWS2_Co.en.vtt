00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
nice and soft and then I'm i got the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.219 
nice and soft and then I'm i got the
small<00:01:43.240> precision<00:01:43.780> brush<00:01:44.820> okay<00:01:45.820> um<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.900> have

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
small precision brush okay um I have

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.500 
small precision brush okay um I have
small<00:01:47.530> eyes<00:01:47.800> so<00:01:48.160> I<00:01:48.190> figured<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.790> smaller<00:01:49.180> brush

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
small eyes so I figured a smaller brush

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.900 
small eyes so I figured a smaller brush
would<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:49.930> good<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.890> get<00:01:51.040> in<00:01:51.220> color<00:01:51.490> underneath

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
would be good to get in color underneath

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.150 
would be good to get in color underneath
the<00:01:52.180> eyes<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.840> y'all<00:01:53.020> know<00:01:53.260> if<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.740> haven't
