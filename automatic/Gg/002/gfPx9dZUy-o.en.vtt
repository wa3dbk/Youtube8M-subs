00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.560
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.079
 look what today brought to you are 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.749
 these custom pendant pencils 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:15.449
 is have this rose that he is more 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:17.519
 More children for me so I put 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.130
 this butterfly pendant 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.529
 I used here as beads. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.949
 colored buttons and that gold here 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.349
 I found it very beautiful, that gold he is 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.089
 I put a golden stone to it. 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.740
 combine with pencils I painted with 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:35.820
 golden spray paint 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.610
 the active is a terminal to close collar 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.250
 There I used the chains I made this pendulum 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.350
 here I put a butterfly pendant 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.350
 this one is the silver that was also 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.840
 pretty nice paint with spray paint treats 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 I also used silver chains not 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.510
 It's for matching I put this pendant 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 with rhinestones this pebble made this one 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.960
 with silver pebbles 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.840
 finally there are pencils decorated with a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 pendant I hope you have enjoyed 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.080
 I brought this idea to you today. 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.910
 Let's go step by step. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.190
 in case I'll teach you how to do 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.960
 This gold here is ok, let's go to 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.870
 material needed step by step 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.880
 well of the three colored pencils that you saw 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.830
 There we are going to make a gold I 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.450
 I chose this color to do 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.540
 So we'll need it, I'll go. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.920
 use gold spray paint to paint 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 the apex 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.440
 we will need also chains 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.320
 so we'll need those little rings 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.240
 to make the amendment 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.290
 ours in force we will need it 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.420
 here o 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.130
 this is called a terminal to close 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.610
 the home 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.560
 if you can see oil and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 free you have round 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.869
 My name is very round but it has others. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.210
 he has a little hole in the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.430
 This is called a terminal to close 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.080
 necklace 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.979
 we will also need a line and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.930
 needle 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.690
 prefer nylon because it's more 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:16.680
 resistant and jewels so people buttons 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.540
 okay so you can decorate and axn 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.040
 we also need a gun 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.320
 hot glue 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.880
 let's go step by step then people at 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.160
 The first thing you will do is 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.000
 pick up your spray paint or paint it 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:37.590
 you want and paint your pencil 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.209
 Okay, here's my painted pencil. 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.970
 second step is to assemble the pendants 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.180
 so as you can see I have the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.910
 pearl pendant to match the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.799
 pendant on the chain there you go 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.780
 choosing the right size that you 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.640
 I want you to stay, I want you to stay more 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.489
 long maybe business that gets more 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.610
 Short then this will go to your liking here 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.010
 I chose a golden stone ring 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.049
 to mend the chain cnaa and form 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.010
 a pendant that I 'm going to make a 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.670
 pendulum 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.160
 so I have the beads here and I go 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.810
 that part that use the needle to 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.300
 join the beads here in the chain is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.590
 Okay, so this part is very easy. 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:27.640
 I'll join, get together, get together first 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.250
 now I'm going to the next one already in the second 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.880
 I'm going to go here, I'm going to spend here. 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.880
 in the pearl 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.190
 now this mission of the golden 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:50.170
 this one is transparent the double of 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:04:00.010
 new and now I'm going to spend 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:04:02.740
 I'm going to close everything and ready 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:11.590
 is ready that the three have people 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:13.800
 Now we come and pass the needle here. 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.800
 O 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:29.890
 Look, you pass needle here and sew 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.140
 these three pendants closing them 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.220
 joining these three 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.890
 these three chains here look only at 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.410
 people got stuck and joins the 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.940
 three chains with the thread and needle and 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.669
 they became like this 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.740
 Now we'll get that terminal. 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.180
 that I told you that it's a terminal 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.310
 to close collar 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.930
 then the terminal has a good hole 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.500
 here at the tip that is where I go 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.710
 pass the needle 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.690
 Look, I'm going to gather everything here. 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.220
 at the end of the terminal and then I just go 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:09.160
 sew on various models terminal 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.669
 it's just you choose what else you 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.669
 to like 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:23.040
 It's all over so look just stuck on the tip 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.040
 from the terminal 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.520
 now we are going to gather this terminal 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:37.630
 by pencil with the hot glue then the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:39.340
 People are going to pick up a pencil and pass a 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:45.400
 bit of hot glue here on the tip of the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:47.850
 pencil comes as terminal and puts it 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.850
 here o 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:57.580
 at the tip of the pencil and our 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:00.130
 then with pendants and here are the others 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.620
