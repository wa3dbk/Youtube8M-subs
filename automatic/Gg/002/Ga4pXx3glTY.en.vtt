00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.589
 and send it back there is no man to integrate in the product so I'm going 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.879
 do a search but before doing this 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.189
 2008 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.189
 the helmet of all the show 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.229
 m we'll have to see the light comes on and justice that fills 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.579
 we can believe 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.119
 for the time it ends more and it is turned on we did a few seconds on 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:33.879
 seeing it the periscope button 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.640
 then saturday seconds until light flashes de colo difference 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.399
 red carpets 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.939
 he is in Paris mode adding that he is waiting for a phone a product to 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.939
 connect with 8 what we are going to do immediately 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.869
 so here we are the fact that our product searches 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.469
 there is also in the grave although the number of products 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.999
 appear before linking them 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.369
 he was wearing a helmet 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.479
 by offering himself some fights the fact of having yes yes 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.479
 bp be careful I click on 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.109
 here it is with the headset during connection 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.959
 to bring his total wins we are connected the couple was getting ready 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 from that moment the most 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.230
 so he continues and here it's very simple often announced the application 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.369
 sic 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.369
 I realize in 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.269
 it's too much 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.989
 I throw 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.099
 a song 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.099
 Hello 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.499
 so we can the music appears so we do not necessarily have their account 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.499
 right here 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.289
 but the music does in the classical 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.679
 so I decided to increase either 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:05.869
 fire 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.099
 so we do not hear much 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.409
 when one does not have a headset on the ears by cons do in terms of 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.409
 comfort I can assure you that it is really very very interesting 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.189
 these are very warm very very friendly so here it was 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.389
 she just a little demonstration for the house the kids then 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.919
 obviously we will not get the camera every time in a year that the button 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.060
 the anapqui it still needs refrain page
