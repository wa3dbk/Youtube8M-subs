yet amongst the air blue signs they're
all<00:01:50.729> planted<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.149> little<00:01:51.329> bit<00:01:51.450> coin<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.490> not

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
all planted a little bit coin and not

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.219 
all planted a little bit coin and not
sort<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.820> been<00:01:53.969> too<00:01:54.149> outspoken<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.990> yet<00:01:55.170> i

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
sort of been too outspoken just yet i

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.749 
sort of been too outspoken just yet i
think<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.530> sort<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.859> biding<00:01:56.159> their<00:01:56.250> time<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
think they sort of biding their time and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.139 
think they sort of biding their time and
probably<00:01:57.329> wait<00:01:57.630> until<00:01:57.659> they<00:01:57.929> settle<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
probably wait until they settle in and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.310 
probably wait until they settle in and
get<00:02:00.149> maybe<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.509> couple<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:00.899> weeks<00:02:01.049> under

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
get maybe a couple more weeks under

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.580 
get maybe a couple more weeks under
their<00:02:01.530> belts<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.130> i'm<00:02:02.399> sure<00:02:02.460> from

reputations there's definitely a few

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.610 
reputations there's definitely a few
characters<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
characters that

today we started out we did a skills
assessment<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.460> morning<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.990> was<00:02:18.230> full

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
assessment this morning so it was full

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.400 
assessment this morning so it was full
metal<00:02:18.800> jacket<00:02:19.160> with<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.340> boys<00:02:20.410> doing

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
metal jacket with the boys doing

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.990 
metal jacket with the boys doing
tackling<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.160> ball<00:02:22.310> carrying<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.760> stuff

tackling and ball carrying and stuff

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.420 
tackling and ball carrying and stuff
just<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.480> guess<00:02:23.750> for<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.560> new<00:02:24.710> coaches<00:02:25.130> coming

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
just I guess for the new coaches coming

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.340 
just I guess for the new coaches coming
along<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.910> see<00:02:26.390> where<00:02:26.570> everyone's<00:02:26.930> at<00:02:27.080> and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
along to see where everyone's at and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.610 
along to see where everyone's at and
also<00:02:27.650> just<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.010> gauge<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.850> guess<00:02:29.380> which<00:02:30.380> boys

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
also just to gauge I guess which boys

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.900 
also just to gauge I guess which boys
might<00:02:30.890> need<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> little<00:02:31.220> bit<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.460> work<00:02:31.640> and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
might need a little bit of work and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.110 
might need a little bit of work and
technical<00:02:32.390> sort<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.870> details<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:35.000> was<00:02:35.090> a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
technical sort of details so it was a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.610 
technical sort of details so it was a
nice<00:02:35.300> shot<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> nervous<00:02:36.050> system<00:02:36.440> got

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
nice shot to the nervous system got

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.700 
nice shot to the nervous system got
everyone<00:02:36.890> gone<00:02:37.540> then<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.630> was<00:02:38.720> just<00:02:38.990> everyone

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
everyone gone then it was just everyone

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.010 
everyone gone then it was just everyone
was<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:39.980> doing<00:02:40.220> their<00:02:40.340> weights<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:41.020> rehab

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
was in doing their weights and rehab

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.490 
was in doing their weights and rehab
stuff<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.530> they<00:02:42.680> have<00:02:42.980> set<00:02:43.190> out<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.580> then<00:02:44.500> we

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
stuff that they have set out and then we

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.100 
stuff that they have set out and then we
had<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.680> lovely<00:02:46.000> wat<00:02:47.000> by<00:02:47.180> conditioning<00:02:47.720> session

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
had a lovely wat by conditioning session

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.520 
had a lovely wat by conditioning session
after<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.600> I'm<00:02:50.600> sure<00:02:50.900> everyone's<00:02:51.320> going

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
after that so I'm sure everyone's going

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.980 
after that so I'm sure everyone's going
to<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:51.710> feeling<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.370> little<00:02:53.150> soporific<00:02:53.540> and

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
to be feeling a little soporific and

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.230 
to be feeling a little soporific and
lethargic<00:02:54.290> after<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:54.980> but<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.970> comes<00:02:56.150> with

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
lethargic after that but it comes with

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.230 
lethargic after that but it comes with
the<00:02:56.330> territory<00:02:56.390> i<00:02:56.870> guess<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.970> finally<00:02:58.970> it's

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
the territory i guess and finally it's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.600 
the territory i guess and finally it's
been<00:02:59.480> pretty<00:03:00.110> warm<00:03:00.380> here<00:03:00.500> recently<00:03:01.070> yesterday

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
been pretty warm here recently yesterday

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.280 
been pretty warm here recently yesterday
was<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.790> hottest<00:03:02.090> day<00:03:02.450> for<00:03:02.750> quite<00:03:02.960> a<00:03:02.990> while

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
was the hottest day for quite a while

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.960 
was the hottest day for quite a while
how<00:03:03.800> was<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.040> out<00:03:04.220> there<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.580> pitch<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
how was it out there on the pitch and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.640 
how was it out there on the pitch and
the<00:03:05.060> heat<00:03:06.280> horrific<00:03:07.280> I'll<00:03:07.550> be<00:03:07.730> honest

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
the heat horrific I'll be honest

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.240 
the heat horrific I'll be honest
obviously<00:03:09.650> my<00:03:10.420> my<00:03:11.420> Irish<00:03:11.780> blood<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.350> pasty

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
obviously my my Irish blood and pasty

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.760 
obviously my my Irish blood and pasty
white<00:03:13.430> skin<00:03:13.459> isn't<00:03:14.390> necessarily<00:03:15.200> suited<00:03:15.650> to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
white skin isn't necessarily suited to

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.770 
white skin isn't necessarily suited to
the<00:03:15.860> weather<00:03:16.239> regardless<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.360> where<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.570> was

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the weather regardless of where I was

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.260 
the weather regardless of where I was
born<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.170> grew<00:03:18.410> up<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:19.000> there<00:03:20.000> are<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> few

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
born and grew up but there are a few

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.210 
born and grew up but there are a few
guys<00:03:20.450> are<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> very<00:03:21.020> pink<00:03:21.290> after<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.830> session

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
guys are a very pink after the session

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.040 
guys are a very pink after the session
but<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.640> guess<00:03:23.180> it's<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.420> baptism<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:23.959> fire

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
but I guess it's a baptism of fire

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.590 
but I guess it's a baptism of fire
almost<00:03:24.530> literally<00:03:25.130> with<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.090> heat<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.480> was

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
almost literally with the heat that was

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.680 
almost literally with the heat that was
there<00:03:26.930> was<00:03:27.020> going<00:03:27.230> around<00:03:27.380> but<00:03:27.770> I<00:03:28.450> guess<00:03:29.450> that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
there was going around but I guess that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.150 
there was going around but I guess that
you<00:03:29.870> know<00:03:29.989> you'd<00:03:30.170> rather<00:03:30.350> be<00:03:30.620> nice<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:31.010> warm

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
you know you'd rather be nice and warm

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.560 
you know you'd rather be nice and warm
and<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.400> boys<00:03:31.580> can<00:03:31.610> enjoy<00:03:32.030> running<00:03:32.239> around

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
and the boys can enjoy running around

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.660 
and the boys can enjoy running around
with<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> Sun<00:03:33.020> and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
with the Sun and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.910 
with the Sun and
you<00:03:34.390> know<00:03:34.510> tops<00:03:34.780> off<00:03:34.990> from<00:03:35.110> guns<00:03:35.349> out<00:03:35.530> really

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
you know tops off from guns out really

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.010 
you know tops off from guns out really
it's<00:03:36.580> going<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.760> be<00:03:36.880> better<00:03:37.030> than<00:03:37.180> snow<00:03:37.780> and

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
it's going to be better than snow and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.690 
it's going to be better than snow and
rain<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.440> hail<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.890> whatever<00:03:39.250> else<00:03:39.340> we<00:03:39.610> have

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
rain and hail and whatever else we have

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.460 
rain and hail and whatever else we have
to<00:03:39.819> deal<00:03:40.000> with<00:03:40.150> through<00:03:40.420> through<00:03:41.170> winter

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
to deal with through through winter

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.979 
to deal with through through winter
there<00:03:42.069> any<00:03:42.190> more<00:03:42.819> keen<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.209> other<00:03:43.330> stuff<00:03:43.660> top

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
there any more keen and other stuff top

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.050 
there any more keen and other stuff top
something<00:03:44.319> guns<00:03:44.530> out<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.770> mothers<00:03:45.060> I'm

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
something guns out of the mothers I'm

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.490 
something guns out of the mothers I'm
sure<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.360> few<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> backs<00:03:47.020> probably<00:03:47.410> had

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
sure a few of the backs probably had

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.670 
sure a few of the backs probably had
their<00:03:47.620> tops<00:03:47.830> off<00:03:47.980> very<00:03:48.280> quickly<00:03:49.620> probably<00:03:50.620> a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
their tops off very quickly probably a

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.780 
their tops off very quickly probably a
lot<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:50.980> forwards<00:03:51.370> had<00:03:51.489> a<00:03:51.520> good<00:03:51.700> offseason

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
lot of the forwards had a good offseason

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.150 
lot of the forwards had a good offseason
so<00:03:52.420> I'd<00:03:52.569> say<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.140> probably<00:03:53.380> not<00:03:53.650> too<00:03:53.800> many<00:03:54.010> of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
so I'd say that probably not too many of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
so I'd say that probably not too many of
them<00:03:54.250> will<00:03:54.370> be<00:03:54.489> getting<00:03:54.730> their<00:03:54.819> tops<00:03:55.030> off

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
them will be getting their tops off

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.870 
them will be getting their tops off
anytime<00:03:55.450> soon
