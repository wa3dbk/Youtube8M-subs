rededication
of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> temple<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.810> gave<00:01:58.159> Jesus<00:01:59.159> an

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
of the temple so this gave Jesus an

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.820 
of the temple so this gave Jesus an
opportunity<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.540> teach<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> large<00:02:01.530> number

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
opportunity to teach to a large number

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.030 
opportunity to teach to a large number
of<00:02:01.979> people<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:03.540> Feast<00:02:03.780> occurs<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.409> December

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
of people the Feast occurs in December

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.730 
of people the Feast occurs in December
and<00:02:05.340> during<00:02:05.820> cold<00:02:06.180> wet<00:02:06.450> season<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.990> Israel<00:02:07.470> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and during cold wet season in Israel and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.890 
and during cold wet season in Israel and
that's<00:02:08.310> why<00:02:08.520> he<00:02:08.729> was<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.929> temple<00:02:10.289> porch

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
that's why he was on of the temple porch

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.990 
that's why he was on of the temple porch
so<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.170> was<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.410> good<00:02:13.830> time<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.100> Jesus<00:02:14.700> to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so this was a good time for Jesus to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.290 
so this was a good time for Jesus to
clearly<00:02:15.720> declare<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:17.220> he<00:02:17.520> was<00:02:17.790> there

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
clearly declare that he was there

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.590 
clearly declare that he was there
awaiting<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.900> messiah<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:20.150> what<00:02:21.150> ended<00:02:21.450> up

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
awaiting a messiah and what ended up

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.050 
awaiting a messiah and what ended up
happening<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.350> as<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:23.250> know<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.640> they

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
happening and as as we know that they

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.809 
happening and as as we know that they
did<00:02:24.300> not<00:02:24.420> believe<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.410> evidence<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.280> they

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
did not believe the evidence and they

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.420 
did not believe the evidence and they
refused<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.540> accept<00:02:27.720> Jesus<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.650> follow<00:02:29.040> him

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
refused to accept Jesus and follow him

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.059 
refused to accept Jesus and follow him
in<00:02:29.700> essence<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.540> people<00:02:30.959> were<00:02:31.380> not<00:02:31.560> able<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
in essence the people were not able to

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.860 
in essence the people were not able to
learn<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.730> truth<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:35.100> again<00:02:35.459> as<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.420> prayed

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
