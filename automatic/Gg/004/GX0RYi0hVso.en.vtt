Hey bruh, welcome to Thug Notes.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.780
This week we payin tribute to "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.440
16 year old biddy Katniss Everdeen hustlin in a bent-ass vision of North America called Panem,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.320
which been split in to 12 districts
all run by the Capitol.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.180
See, back in the day the districts tried to throw down with the The Big C, but they got wrecked.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.700
Now the Capitol stages a televised Battle Royale called The Hunger Games to remind dem districts that they ain’t sh*t.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.400
Every year, 2 kids from each
district get picked to run around a stadium

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.640
glockin each other til only one G remains.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.120
That sh*t cray, right?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.440
So when time comes to pick da “tributes,” Katniss’s little sister Prim gets picked to represent da big District 1-2,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.380
but Katniss say, “Oh HEEELL NAW. Best back off my blood. I’m goin!”

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.780
The other tribute is some poor bastard named Peeta who Katniss know from da hood.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.260
So Katniss and Peeta start gettin schooled by their new teach Haymitch and roll up to the Capitol to gear up for the Games.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.380
Both of em recognize dat givin dem rich people a good show will give them a better chance of survivin.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.000
So when Peeta say on air that he got the hots for Katniss, Katniss all like, “Da Hell? You playin wit me boy?”

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.560
When the Games start, homies droppin like flies, so Katniss hauls ass into the woods.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.740
Eventually, Kat-neezy peep some badass mutha named Cato headin up a crew o hard-ass playas,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.891
and dat boy Peeta dun joined em!

00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:39.840
Damn!
What dat fool thinkin?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.620
When dem leet killaz run Katiss up a tree, 
some little G named Rue does her a solid

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.740
and helps her get the jump on dem haterz.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.460
Then Katniss jacks a bow off one of em when — oh sh*t! Cato runs up on our girl!

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.620
But just then Peeta drops down and say,  
 “Bitch run!”

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.040
Wait — Which side is he on?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.380
Later, Rue and Katniss hatch a plan
to mess wit dat killa crew’s stash o goods,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.451
but Rue gets straight OJ- ed.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.400
Kat don’t play dat game and ices Rue’s murderer. Street justice, son!

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.880
Then the Capitol lays down a new rule: two tributes can win as long as they from the same district.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.840
Oh snap!

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.560
So Katniss finds Peeta, whose leg all  
  jacked up, and then she say,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.780
“Hold up. Lovers fighting for
their lives is damn good television.”

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.220
So she drags his ass to a cave, and starts 
nursin mo than just his leg, naw mean?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.960
And just like she thought, 
the capitol start makin it rain gifts.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.120
Eventually dat fool Cato shows 
his face and almost mercs Peeta,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.140
but with a lil teamwork, Katniss and 
Peeta throw his ass to the dogs.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.880
Now that they the only ones still
standin, they all like,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.800
“We did it. Let us out, yo!”

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.260
Dem rich capitol folk decide to play dirty though, and change the rules back to only ONE survivor.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.160
But Kat and Peeta call them out on their bullsh*t and threaten to kill themselves by slammin some poison berries.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.200
Then the Capitol 
ain’t got NO winners!

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.680
So then they like “Aight, aight 
chill baby. You both win, aight."

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.560
Even though they live to see another day, Peeta start actin like a whiny bitch when he realize

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.640
Katniss was just gettin sweet on him to play
the audience.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.940
And to top it all off, Katniss at the top of the Capitol’s sh*tlist now for clownin em in front of the whole damn world.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.420
Now no matter how hard you
hustlin, you ain’t stackin bread like ol' Suzy-C.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.980
And I ain’t talkin bout her fat
pockets, blood.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.060
Naw, this girl stackin a mad bread motif all up in this text.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.280
Now let’s take a look at dat fool Peeta. First off, look at his damn name. Next, brutha works at a bakery.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.420
And most importantly, he saved Katniss by givin her some bread when she was a little girl.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.660
Like Katniss say:

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.140
"To this day, I can never shake the connection between this boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope."

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.500
But that ain’t all, son.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.700
The name of this backward-ass country is Panem, which is "bread" in Latin.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.960
Maybe Suzie givin a 
shoutout to my Roman homeboy Juvenal:

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.620
"The public has long since cast off its cares; the people that once bestowed commands, consulships, legions, and all else,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.840
now meddles no more and longs eagerly for just two things —&nbsp;Bread and Games!"

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.600
Just like Juvenal thought about them Romans, the thugs of Panem done handed over all that power to somebody else.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.360
Sad thing is, they did it
just for grub and entertainment.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.280
And you best be peepin this motif
too — flowers.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.980
Cuz in the face of all the ugliness of da Hunger Games, dem flowers constantly fillin our girl with hope.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.600
Not only is Katniss named after a plant that helps her stay alive,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.520
but Rue, the little thug who helps a sista out, is also the name of a flower.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.960
So when Rue gets shanked, somethin
changes inside of Katniss.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.340
Just survivin this mess ain’t enough no mo.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.980
Now she gotta step up and try to smoke dem haters up in the Capitol.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.320
And that’s what I dig so much about
Katniss.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.320
In a time where money is power, she gonna stand up for the poor who can’t protect themselves

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.080
and stick it to a culture as twisted as Rome before sh*t fell apart.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.960
Now while dis book got a whole lot in common
with Ancient Rome — here's the crazy thing:

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.700
It ain’t so different than ours.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.600
"I program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.420
You need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.300
hot and steamy, before you in less than a minute."

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.560
And like Katniss sayin throughout
the book:

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.200
How you gonna worry bout yo threadz, bling, and entertainment when erryone else around you just grindin for bread?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.800
All kinds of f**ked up.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.860
So focus on the essential things in
life: Like hitting dat subscribe button.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.260
Catch y’all later. Peace.
