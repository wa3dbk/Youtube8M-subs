said the book was to take anything
that's<00:00:18.630> easy<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.180> were

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
that's easy and do it as if it were

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880 
that's easy and do it as if it were
difficult<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> take<00:00:22.199> anything<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.650> was

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and i think that's a very profound

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.599 
and i think that's a very profound
statement<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.710> how<00:00:29.010> i<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.310> apply<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
statement and how i can apply to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640

they play their best game of the season

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
they play their best game of the season
that<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.290> them<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.740> play<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.040> hard

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
that you like them they play that hard

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
that you like them they play that hard
every<00:01:08.970> game<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.930> may<00:01:10.080> actually<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> good

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
team so that's a good example of taking

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
team so that's a good example of taking
things<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.590> seem<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.189> easy<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.610> doing

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
things that seem to be easy and doing

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.490 
things that seem to be easy and doing
them<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.330> they<00:01:15.479> were<00:01:15.509> difficult<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.290> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
them as if they were difficult so you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890 
them as if they were difficult so you
don't<00:01:16.710> relax<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:17.880> max<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.750> anything

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
don't relax you don't max up or anything

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.649 
don't relax you don't max up or anything
that<00:01:19.320> happens<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> second

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that happens to you and then the second

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
that happens to you and then the second
part<00:01:21.689> doing<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> difficult<00:01:22.920> things<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
part doing the difficult things that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
part doing the difficult things that
they<00:01:23.640> were<00:01:23.700> easy<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.570> all<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.140> go

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
they were easy because we all know we go

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.570 
they were easy because we all know we go
up<00:01:25.380> against<00:01:25.680> something<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.549> a
