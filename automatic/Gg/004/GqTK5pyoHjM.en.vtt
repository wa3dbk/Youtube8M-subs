yang more doing putting an idea out

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.450 
yang more doing putting an idea out
there<00:00:38.870> expressing<00:00:39.870> something<00:00:40.460> getting

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
there expressing something getting

things<00:00:41.730> done<00:00:42.000> driving<00:00:42.719> forward<00:00:43.019> there's<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
things done driving forward there's a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.040 
things done driving forward there's a
real<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:44.039> and<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> place<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
real time and a place for that

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.090 
real time and a place for that
acceptance<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> other<00:00:46.530> hand<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.949> more

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
acceptance of the other hand it's more

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.650 
acceptance of the other hand it's more
like<00:00:47.250> listening<00:00:47.850> receiving<00:00:48.780> more<00:00:49.649> yen

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
like listening receiving more yen

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.970 
like listening receiving more yen
nurturing<00:00:51.660> yourself<00:00:51.809> feeling<00:00:52.589> what's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
nurturing yourself feeling what's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.720 
nurturing yourself feeling what's
happening<00:00:53.609> may<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.030> slower<00:00:54.989> softer<00:00:55.859> so<00:00:56.460> both

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
happening may be slower softer so both

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
happening may be slower softer so both
ways<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.239> being<00:00:57.449> are<00:00:57.719> really<00:00:58.050> necessary<00:00:58.679> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
ways of being are really necessary and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
ways of being are really necessary and
I'm<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> show<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> practice<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:00.629> of
