I<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.240> thinking<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> case<00:01:36.840> would<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.170> even

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
I was thinking the case would have even

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.780 
I was thinking the case would have even
more<00:01:37.590> bug<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> device<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.369> make<00:01:38.640> your

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
more bug to the device and make your

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.350 
more bug to the device and make your
heavier<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.479> doesn't<00:01:41.360> very

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
heavier but it really doesn't very

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.420 
heavier but it really doesn't very
protective<00:01:42.930> obviously<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> cutout<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
protective obviously the cutout in the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.090 
protective obviously the cutout in the
port<00:01:44.810> has<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.049> multi<00:01:46.380> positional<00:01:46.799> Stan

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
port has that multi positional Stan

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.530 
port has that multi positional Stan
