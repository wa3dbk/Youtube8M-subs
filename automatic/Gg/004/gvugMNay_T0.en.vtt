be a lot of giving it like that now once

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
be a lot of giving it like that now once
you've<00:00:54.510> done<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.719> pony<00:00:55.020> tail<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.410> need<00:00:55.559> to

you've done your pony tail you need to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.350 
you've done your pony tail you need to
pin<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.239> at<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.510> top<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:57.960> head

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.150 

now<00:01:04.960> with<00:01:05.170> your<00:01:05.320> ponytail<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:05.830> need<00:01:06.010> to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
now with your ponytail you need to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.430 
now with your ponytail you need to
divide<00:01:06.760> it<00:01:06.970> into<00:01:07.060> four<00:01:07.480> sections<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.110> do<00:01:08.410> a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
divide it into four sections and do a

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.210 
divide it into four sections and do a
bun<00:01:08.770> in<00:01:09.040> each<00:01:09.280> section<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.710> this<00:01:11.830> will<00:01:11.980> be<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
bun in each section so this will be the

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.890 
bun in each section so this will be the
same<00:01:12.400> sort<00:01:12.730> of<00:01:12.790> bun<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.180> you've<00:01:13.390> done<00:01:13.600> for

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
same sort of bun that you've done for

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.950 
same sort of bun that you've done for
the<00:01:14.860> side<00:01:15.070> of<00:01:15.250> your<00:01:15.370> head<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.240> twist<00:01:16.780> it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
the side of your head so I twist it

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.380 
the side of your head so I twist it
round<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:19.270> circle<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.790> hair<00:01:22.060> around

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
round and then circle the hair around

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.940 
round and then circle the hair around
itself<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:23.110> create<00:01:23.440> a<00:01:23.470> bone

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.850 

so<00:01:26.950> roughly<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.990> have<00:01:29.080> two<00:01:29.320> buns<00:01:29.530> on<00:01:29.680> this

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
so roughly need to have two buns on this

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.180 
so roughly need to have two buns on this
side<00:01:30.180> until<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.330> other<00:01:31.540> side<00:01:35.070> once<00:01:36.070> you've

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
side until on the other side once you've

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.100 
side until on the other side once you've
got<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> bun<00:01:36.550> you<00:01:36.580> Disney<00:01:36.940> to<00:01:37.119> peel<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:37.990> your

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110

you don't have full bones this point

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.919

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
sort of looks good you have a sort of

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:13.589 
sort of looks good you have a sort of
funky<00:02:05.850> splicing<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.030> hair<00:02:07.240> happening<00:02:12.599> I'm

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
funky splicing of the hair happening I'm

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:52.250

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.380 

so<00:03:23.010> essentially<00:03:23.310> you've<00:03:23.550> got<00:03:23.700> six<00:03:23.970> bones

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
this looks a bit weird right now but

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.360 
this looks a bit weird right now but
what<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.640> need<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.819> next<00:03:30.239> get<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.569> rhythm<00:03:30.720> and

place it around the outside buns like so

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.229 
place it around the outside buns like so
and<00:03:38.400> tie<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.780> bow<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:40.410> know<00:03:40.790> tie<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.849> ribbon

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
in a bow in the back now this won't move

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.930 
in a bow in the back now this won't move
because<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.709> side<00:03:46.950> bones<00:03:47.250> are<00:03:47.489> keep<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.819> in

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940
