close<00:00:38.350> up<00:00:38.590> in<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.920> moment<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.399> show<00:00:39.670> you<00:00:39.730> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
close up in a moment and show you the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.040 
close up in a moment and show you the
details

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.280 

the<00:00:45.980> swim<00:00:46.280> fin<00:00:46.550> is<00:00:46.930> self-adjusting<00:00:47.930> with<00:00:48.170> the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
the swim fin is self-adjusting with the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.590 
the swim fin is self-adjusting with the
child<00:00:48.590> always<00:00:49.040> allowing<00:00:49.700> for<00:00:49.970> free<00:00:50.240> movement

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
child always allowing for free movement

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.830 
child always allowing for free movement
of<00:00:50.960> arm<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.590> leg<00:00:51.800> now<00:00:52.790> when<00:00:52.940> they<00:00:53.060> first<00:00:53.360> learn

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
of arm and leg now when they first learn

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.280 
of arm and leg now when they first learn
to<00:00:53.870> swim<00:00:54.670> they're<00:00:55.670> much<00:00:55.880> more<00:00:56.090> upright<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:57.080> the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
to swim they're much more upright in the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.830 
to swim they're much more upright in the
water<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:58.070> therefore<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.970> swim<00:00:59.270> fin<00:00:59.540> is

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
water and therefore the swim fin is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.380 
water and therefore the swim fin is
submerged<00:01:00.460> providing<00:01:01.460> much<00:01:01.670> more<00:01:01.879> support

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
submerged providing much more support

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.469 
submerged providing much more support
and<00:01:02.720> buoyancy<00:01:03.280> as<00:01:04.280> they<00:01:04.460> gradually<00:01:04.940> improve

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
and buoyancy as they gradually improve

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.180 
and buoyancy as they gradually improve
and<00:01:05.810> they<00:01:05.900> learned<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.500> correct<00:01:06.650> swimming

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
and they learned the correct swimming

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.490 
and they learned the correct swimming
position<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:09.380> swim<00:01:09.680> fin<00:01:10.240> gradually<00:01:11.500> is

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
position the swim fin gradually is

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.640 
position the swim fin gradually is
visible<00:01:13.100> above<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.700> water<00:01:14.260> providing<00:01:15.260> less

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
visible above the water providing less

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.060 
visible above the water providing less
and<00:01:15.890> less<00:01:16.070> support<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.990> ultimately<00:01:18.070> when

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
and less support and ultimately when

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.300 
and less support and ultimately when
they're<00:01:19.280> completely<00:01:19.790> horizontal<00:01:21.310> it's

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
they're completely horizontal it's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.300 
they're completely horizontal it's
almost<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.479> comfort<00:01:23.960> blanket<00:01:24.310> they're

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
almost a comfort blanket they're

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.770 
almost a comfort blanket they're
swimming<00:01:25.550> with<00:01:25.820> something<00:01:26.240> on<00:01:26.360> their<00:01:26.540> back

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
swimming with something on their back

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.650 
swimming with something on their back
which<00:01:27.440> isn't<00:01:27.920> helping<00:01:28.399> them<00:01:28.670> but<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.270> actually

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
which isn't helping them but is actually

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.770 
which isn't helping them but is actually
there<00:01:29.899> for<00:01:30.140> support<00:01:30.350> if<00:01:30.860> required<00:01:31.720> after<00:01:32.720> they

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
there for support if required after they

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.840 
there for support if required after they
improve<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.619> swim<00:01:33.860> fin<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.220> actually<00:01:34.550> great

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
improve the swim fin is actually great

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.350 
improve the swim fin is actually great
as<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.240> training<00:01:35.960> aid<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.470> improve<00:01:36.590> stamina<00:01:37.360> and

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
as a training aid to improve stamina and

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.200 
as a training aid to improve stamina and
finally<00:01:39.250> long<00:01:40.250> after<00:01:40.670> they've<00:01:40.790> learned<00:01:41.030> to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
finally long after they've learned to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.080 
finally long after they've learned to
swim<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:41.690> still<00:01:41.960> remains<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.649> top<00:01:43.340> favorite<00:01:43.850> toy
