when it came time to do John Matthews
book<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.260> actually<00:01:04.439> nervous<00:01:04.769> because<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
book I was actually nervous because a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
book I was actually nervous because a
lot<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.930> readers<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.680> care<00:01:08.040> about<00:01:08.130> him

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
lot of readers really care about him

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.270 
lot of readers really care about him
because<00:01:08.970> he's<00:01:09.119> eminently<00:01:09.810> heroic<00:01:10.320> he's<00:01:11.010> got

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
because he's eminently heroic he's got

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
because he's eminently heroic he's got
he's<00:01:12.030> mute<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.229> he<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> vulnerability

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
he's mute so he has a vulnerability

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.310 
he's mute so he has a vulnerability
that's<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.820> obvious<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.960> he's<00:01:16.110> also

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that's very obvious but he's also

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.990 
that's very obvious but he's also
powerful<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
powerful and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
powerful and
the<00:01:18.350> juxtaposition<00:01:19.350> between<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.770> two<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the juxtaposition between the two of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.520 
the juxtaposition between the two of
those<00:01:20.190> is<00:01:20.430> very<00:01:20.640> attractive<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:22.260> I<00:01:22.410> also

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
those is very attractive and I also

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.170 
those is very attractive and I also
think<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.040> his<00:01:23.250> relationship<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:23.910> hacks

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
think that his relationship with hacks

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.810 
think that his relationship with hacks
is<00:01:24.480> just<00:01:24.840> great<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.400> blight<00:01:26.610> echo

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
is just great when the blight echo

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
is just great when the blight echo
Brotherhood<00:01:27.300> started<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.870> it<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.200> vampires

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
Brotherhood started out it was vampires

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.820 
Brotherhood started out it was vampires
only<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:30.090> revenge<00:01:30.750> appeared<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.530> scene

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
only and then revenge appeared on scene

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.710 
only and then revenge appeared on scene
and<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.520> knew<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> minute<00:01:33.090> immediately<00:01:33.570> when<00:01:33.690> he
