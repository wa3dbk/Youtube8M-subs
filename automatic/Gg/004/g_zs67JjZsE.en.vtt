really kind of changed the way that I've

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.070 
really kind of changed the way that I've
been<00:00:14.269> tying<00:00:14.540> flies<00:00:14.750> very<00:00:15.200> very<00:00:16.009> easy<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.580> use

been tying flies very very easy to use
it's<00:00:18.080> got<00:00:18.320> some<00:00:18.500> cool<00:00:18.710> features<00:00:19.099> it's<00:00:19.310> got<00:00:19.369> a

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
it's got some cool features it's got a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.700 
it's got some cool features it's got a
tension<00:00:19.820> control<00:00:20.480> device<00:00:20.869> here<00:00:21.289> so<00:00:21.500> any

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
tension control device here so any

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.050 
tension control device here so any
school<00:00:22.070> that<00:00:22.250> you<00:00:22.310> put<00:00:22.490> in<00:00:22.609> there<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:22.939> can

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
school that you put in there you can

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.410 
school that you put in there you can
adjust<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.539> tension<00:00:23.750> to<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:25.490> think<00:00:26.060> one<00:00:26.269> of<00:00:26.300> the

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
adjust the tension to I think one of the

how to use the dubbing loop tool which

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.229 
how to use the dubbing loop tool which
is<00:01:02.960> built-in<00:01:03.440> so<00:01:03.680> at<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.460> end<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.820> this<00:01:04.970> that

is built-in so at the end of this that
little<00:01:05.509> pigtail<00:01:06.039> contraption<00:01:07.039> I<00:01:07.130> was<00:01:07.250> talking

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
little pigtail contraption I was talking

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:08.890 
little pigtail contraption I was talking
about<00:01:07.610> there's<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.939> small<00:01:08.270> little<00:01:08.510> arm<00:01:08.780> that

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
about there's a small little arm that

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.289 
about there's a small little arm that
catches<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.619> thread<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.850> that's<00:01:11.000> going<00:01:11.240> to

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
catches the thread and that's going to

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.960 
catches the thread and that's going to
enable<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:11.900> tie<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.740> loop<00:01:13.010> onto<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.490> hook

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
enable you to tie a loop onto the hook

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.380 
enable you to tie a loop onto the hook
shank<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:15.049> then<00:01:15.560> use<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:17.000> little<00:01:17.210> arm

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
shank and then use this this little arm

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.359 
shank and then use this this little arm
to<00:01:17.659> be<00:01:17.869> able<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.229> twist<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.009> dubbing<00:01:19.340> loop

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
to be able to twist the the dubbing loop

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.240 
to be able to twist the the dubbing loop
and<00:01:20.299> make<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:20.600> work<00:01:20.750> properly<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.560> I'm<00:01:22.070> just

and make it work properly so I'm just

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.640 
and make it work properly so I'm just
gonna<00:01:22.369> this<00:01:22.700> up<00:01:22.909> just<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.540> hook<00:01:23.720> shank<00:01:23.930> here<00:01:24.229> I'm

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
gonna this up just a hook shank here I'm

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.230 
gonna this up just a hook shank here I'm
gonna<00:01:24.770> take<00:01:24.950> my<00:01:25.100> thread<00:01:25.369> cover<00:01:25.729> up<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.060> whole

I've got some ice tub that any dubbing
will<00:01:53.060> work<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.930> conjunction<00:01:54.140> with<00:01:54.560> it

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
will work and in conjunction with it

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.399 
will work and in conjunction with it
like<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.130> magic<00:01:55.520> tool<00:01:55.990> there's<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.049> lot<00:01:57.259> of

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
like the magic tool there's a lot of

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.899 
like the magic tool there's a lot of
options<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:57.890> all<00:01:58.159> we're<00:01:58.340> going<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.490> do<00:01:58.610> is<00:01:58.729> just

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
options so all we're going to do is just

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.620 
options so all we're going to do is just
kind<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.180> take<00:01:59.360> our<00:01:59.570> bobbin<00:02:01.360> stick<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.479> onto

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
kind of take our bobbin stick it onto

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.859 
kind of take our bobbin stick it onto
that<00:02:02.810> little<00:02:03.110> pigtail<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.329> take<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.479> dubbing

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
that little pigtail and take the dubbing

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.160 
that little pigtail and take the dubbing
insert<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.680> clear<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:07.310> into<00:02:07.700> into<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.299> into

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
insert it clear on up into into the into

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.500 
insert it clear on up into into the into
the<00:02:09.259> loop<00:02:09.470> maybe<00:02:09.799> stretch<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.250> out<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.700> bit

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.240 

came<00:02:14.510> off<00:02:14.690> there<00:02:14.959> but<00:02:15.170> again<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:15.950> simple

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
came off there but again it's so simple

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.380 
came off there but again it's so simple
to<00:02:16.459> work<00:02:16.640> with<00:02:16.849> it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
to work with it

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.420 
to work with it
just<00:02:17.750> takes<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.110> moment<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.800> get<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.100> thing<00:02:19.280> all

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
just takes a moment to get the thing all

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.550 
just takes a moment to get the thing all
dialed<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.510> do<00:02:20.750> have<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.050> have<00:02:21.170> enough

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
dialed in so you do have to have enough

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.530 
dialed in so you do have to have enough
space<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.220> be<00:02:22.340> able<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.670> actually<00:02:22.819> spin<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
space to be able to actually spin the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.130 
space to be able to actually spin the
bobbin<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.170> order<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:26.450> get<00:02:26.600> this<00:02:26.750> dubbing

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
bobbin in order to to get this dubbing

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.930 
bobbin in order to to get this dubbing
loop<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.470> work<00:02:27.620> properly<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.700> we're<00:02:28.910> just

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
loop to work properly but we're just

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.059 
loop to work properly but we're just
going<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.209> make<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> small<00:02:29.690> twist<00:02:29.959> here<00:02:30.290> spin

going to make a small twist here spin
the<00:02:31.250> bobbin<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:32.750> see<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.470> dubbing<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.550> goes

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
the bobbin you see the dubbing this goes

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.350 
the bobbin you see the dubbing this goes
up<00:02:34.940> into<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.209> nice<00:02:35.420> little<00:02:35.600> noodle<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:38.060> do<00:02:38.209> have

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
up into a nice little noodle you do have

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360 
up into a nice little noodle you do have
to<00:02:38.480> keep<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.840> at<00:02:38.930> an<00:02:39.050> angle<00:02:39.260> off<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.130> tip

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
to keep it at an angle off of the tip

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.160 
to keep it at an angle off of the tip
here<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:41.030> can<00:02:41.150> see<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.780> know<00:02:41.870> we've<00:02:41.990> got

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
here you can see it's you know we've got

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.250 
here you can see it's you know we've got
three<00:02:42.530> three<00:02:42.860> pieces<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.430> string<00:02:43.880> there<00:02:44.260> we

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
three three pieces of string there we

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.870 
three three pieces of string there we

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
can just kind of make a couple wraps get

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.430 
can just kind of make a couple wraps get
caught<00:02:47.090> up<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.510> we're<00:02:47.780> ready<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.110> start<00:02:48.290> our

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
caught up and we're ready to start our

caught up and we're ready to start our
dubbing<00:02:48.800> process<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:50.450> just<00:02:50.480> kind<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.870> wrap

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
dubbing process you just kind of wrap

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.949 
dubbing process you just kind of wrap
that<00:02:51.410> forward<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.940> can<00:02:53.060> see<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.600> difference

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
that forward you can see the difference

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.710 
that forward you can see the difference
between<00:02:54.170> say<00:02:54.620> spinning<00:02:55.340> your<00:02:55.459> dubbing<00:02:55.850> onto

between say spinning your dubbing onto

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.440 
between say spinning your dubbing onto
the<00:02:56.870> thread<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:58.310> wrapping<00:02:58.850> forward<00:02:59.239> as

separate our loop a little bit unlike a
