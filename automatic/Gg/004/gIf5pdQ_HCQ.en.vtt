00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 it's cold outside and early dark 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.700
 herbst has berlin under control anyway 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.010

 here at tom tests it works for me now 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.269
 especially for a few navigation 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.480
 characteristics we start quite normally 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.949
 with the map with nokia maps we look 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 on it we are supposed to be in the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.910
 be benzo road that can street sign 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 We also make it easy to check 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 if that's going to get hot right here 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 of course , I search you correctly 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.109
 already shown in the other video 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.850
 Do it again in real life 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.800
 I just enter a pharmacy or 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
 I've already done that and here 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960
 should be right next to me and that 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.370
 is also actually and look times 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.719
 phone number and so on I have 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.559
 already told everything is displayed there 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.840
 is you congratulations 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.230
 Of course this does not work 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.300
 everything 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 we continue with the nokia city 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.320
 Compass super thing I have already 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.180
 sometimes hinted augmented 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.309
 reality we look through the camera from 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.379
 Mobile phone in one direction and see in 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.760
 In this case , something was happening around us 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.770
 eating is to buy 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 I chose this example here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.369
 that Montoya picked that's left there 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.990
 I see the bottom of the display 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.830
 accelerate my run now times so 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.760
 a bit like you see the distance 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.760
 is becoming less and less we are equal 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.310
 0,4 and now I am there 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.330
 click on this preu and 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.659
 then it opens again 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.299
 nokia maps 3.0 and shows me things 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.299
 in this case we see to these peu 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.159
 which we see that it will load a combo 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.990
 from barber shop to café and bar 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.970
 cozy living room feeling 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.049
 then come on me yes 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.490

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.380
 Barber standing there chairs out there can 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.320
 Definitely for nokia city 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.640
 compass you do not starve 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 we bring some photos and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.210
 reviews so that we know everything 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.430

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.740
 so we continue with one 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.920
 also know and interesting features 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.320
 Although willing to alexa in Berlin 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 Berlin Mitte is a shopping mall 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.799
 I'll just give it a us now 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.420
 Of course now many will be alexa 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.000

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.950

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.110
 shopping center I press again 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 on it and would like to go there 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.580

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.810
 press on route calculate get only 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.940
 times the card appears as I supposed 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.230
 generally must be able to pick up on foot 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.880
 by train or by car with the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.070
 I have chosen the train and I should 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.020
 samariterstraße go that I do 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.610
 but also like with which train should 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.290
 I drive because I am seated I know 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.280
 I would simply times bring out loose 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.800
 would now choose again 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.180
 alexanderplatz s and u-bahnhof he would 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.820
 i'll show you york 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.380

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.110
 I just want that too 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.030
 The next train will be coming soon 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.240
 half should go off then so want 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.710
 We'll walk to the platform afterwards 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.840
 again a bit faster so the 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.790
 flowering is boring when you look at yourself 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.750
 by the way, you have to look at everything yourself 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.430
 if you can, the whole twice as 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.810
 List for transfers is that 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.190
 Perfect here you always see how far 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.950
 you have to walk between the stations 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.170
 and so on 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.850
 Equal scoreboard also says track 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.770
 comes in two minutes 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.120

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.710

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.210
 minutes what comes in nine minutes what 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.500
 comes in 14 minutes is one 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.930
 samariterstraße a bit boring 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.690
 because it is only the u5 okay but there 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.290
 yes, we'll get started right away 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.180
 and Alexanderplatz piloted for 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.380
 and I would like to have such a test 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.930
 have a go and that I would like to 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.860
 driving with the train from frankfurter 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.110
 life east cross 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.060
 there is the train is coming in one 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.530
 minute to see if I can do it 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.000
 I can theoretically the footpath 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.010
 show up to the station or 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.209
 is station in the case but I know 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.840
 him yes and needed me a bit 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.220
 hurry 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.290
 One minute I had to look again 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.760
 I did not have time anymore 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.810
 the train is gone the perspectives purpose 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.860
 or or or or 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.180
 the stairs come up name is gone 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.120
 but nothing to pick up the lumia 800 again 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.230
 20 out and get that next one 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.310
 train on this route 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.010
 the s9 is the one I then spill 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.440
 comes the effort it is at night 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.910
 sorry yes the s8 is the us to 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.890
 would bring east cross 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.350
 in summary, one can say nokia 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.910
 Maps 3.0 works fine 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.870
 which is looking great I will 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.440
