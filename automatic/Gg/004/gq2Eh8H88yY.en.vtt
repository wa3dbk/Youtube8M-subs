00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.920
 [Music] 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.939
 well it's blackjack and the killers 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.789
 buy and no end up today 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.920
 for my first video on youtube 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.940
 so today it's a tutorial on 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.600
 how to unlock a phone without 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.910
 the code 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.700
 so that's to say get in a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.969
 phone without needing with the code 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.920
 So if you lose the code too 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 you for example where to find a phone 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 in the street eh ben it works we see there 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.059
 we lost against bompas what is it 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:04.110
 we make mach an asset so we are at 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:08.400
 our phone being here once 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.250
 which is off we will press the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.900
 button to unlock the phone 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 to last for them here to turn on the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:29.579
 volume duo button here and if some 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.710
 samsung or an apple an iphone there is a 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.680
 button so if a button there you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.979
 press the button to unlock 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.689
 the want more button and the button the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.939
 better me as follows no button 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.509
 I like or not so the strong support in 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.509
 same time until his saliva or 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:56.219
 once the room a young age if that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.430
 do you do that to challenge you do 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.250
 with the like that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.070
 here and so we'll take the fourth 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.550
 one two three four or six data was doing 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.690
 normally knows the home button for 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.650
 select but me if it's him I 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.690
 do not know then you select you 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.720
 you put there is this you 're sounded the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720
 charge 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.600
 and then it's a thing we wait at on 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:36.720
 reached is there a click on the first and 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.850
 it will restart the phone and we 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.340
 can go inside that that to 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.050
 do as if you reset it 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.330
 know all he's reached that had 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.959
 therefore deleted the password exceeded it 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.230
 so that's so you have a phone 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.330
 qazi 9.9 from the inside but after that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.310
 if the creney break you it's not very 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.989
 serious but you can go inside 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.870
 put your google account 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.209
 go on the internet could even put 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.600
 your neighborhood soho make a phone 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.580
 free of charge here and then if you block 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.660
 your phone or does that erases everything 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.750
 but it does not take you to that 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.840
 operators for whom to repair and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.840
 it saves you from paying for nothing by the fact 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:28.049
 that just a trick on the other hand I put a 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.739
 little long is this real but to 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.260
 to restart 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.890
 because I do not know why but 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.269
 here it takes a little time so I 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.870
 like to say it's good wearable one 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:44.640

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.480
