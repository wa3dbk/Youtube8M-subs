just<00:00:45.360> treat<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:46.050> own<00:00:46.170> hair<00:00:46.940> just

comb<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.379> wash<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.190> once<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
comb it out you know wash it once in a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.920 
comb it out you know wash it once in a
while

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
while

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.779 
while
style<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> spray<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.399> kind<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.699> thing

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
style it spray it that kind of thing

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.680 
style it spray it that kind of thing
again<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.629> human<00:00:55.140> hair<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
again it's not human hair so so the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.029 
again it's not human hair so so the
synthetic<00:00:57.930> tends<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.280> a<00:01:00.410> little<00:01:01.410> bit<00:01:01.710> more

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
synthetic tends to be a little bit more

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.030 
synthetic tends to be a little bit more
maintenance<00:01:02.850> than<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.930> human<00:01:04.320> hair<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> find

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
maintenance than the human hair I find

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.289 
maintenance than the human hair I find
but<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.689> synthetic<00:01:07.290> hair<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.939> curl

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but with synthetic hair you can curl

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.100
