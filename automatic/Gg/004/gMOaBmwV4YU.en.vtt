00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.130
 start right now and in the first place 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.839
 this is really about the version 1.7 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.520
 8 and I do not just write that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.529
 in the title like many others in it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.590

 I'm really about the version 1.8 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.200
 So first, this file must 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.570
 operation if this file then have 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.329
 double click on it and then 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.860
 there is therefore still click into the valley and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.289

 click here ok and then you know 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.650
 you start your minecraft so if you 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.090

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.030
 loaded 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.080
 and when you've finished loading 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 then we are already in here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.270
 Minecraft then we can on options 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.680
 go to graphics settings and then see 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.729
 We here the optics on successfully 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.380
 was installed 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.360
 For example, if we are an agent 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.450
 performance quality and all these 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.340
 find things down there for that are 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.320
 Everything is only with opti wan 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.299
 so be added here below 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.759
 Quality can be tons of stuff 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.650
 Adjusting for example what more it goes 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.090
 in minecraft because that too is fine 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.979
 known more fps in minecraft 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.100
 is for example also at low optimal too 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.330
 install and you can believe me 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.220

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.300
 Read comments below this video 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.520

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.980

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.540
 from opti wan tae we can see here 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.600

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.360
 play world if the whole thing is briefly charged 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.340
 you have downloaded down there 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.520
 so we are already the minecraft and 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.740
 So that's exactly what we are 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.200
 if the fine but all love if 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.940

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.680
 this tutorial i hope it has you 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.020

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.730
 shut down in version 1.8 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.840
 install so if it did too 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.490
