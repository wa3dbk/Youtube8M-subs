to cash on what the actual browsers like

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.380 
to cash on what the actual browsers like
so<00:00:20.820> I'm<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> give<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.330> an

so I'm just going to give you an
indication<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.930> how<00:00:22.020> fast<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.560> smooth<00:00:22.949> is

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
indication of how fast it is smooth is

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.000 
indication of how fast it is smooth is
in<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.460> today's<00:00:23.730> video<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> let's<00:00:25.529> go<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
in this today's video so let's go to the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.060 
in this today's video so let's go to the
top<00:00:26.359> let's<00:00:27.359> go<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> defer<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.470> search<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
top let's go to defer to search for the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.459 
top let's go to defer to search for the
verge<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.700> verge<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:34.140> gonna<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
verge so the verge it's gonna have a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.139 
verge so the verge it's gonna have a
load<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.860> google<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.280> us<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
load up in google for us and you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.180 
load up in google for us and you
probably<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.570> how<00:00:36.660> quick<00:00:36.899> actually<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.440> so

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
probably see how quick actually is so

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.440 
probably see how quick actually is so
hopefully<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.059> screen

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
hopefully you can see that on screen

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.500 
hopefully you can see that on screen
maybe<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.050> little<00:00:40.320> bit<00:00:40.500> bright<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> looks

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
maybe a little bit bright so it looks

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.540 
maybe a little bit bright so it looks
like<00:00:42.690> now<00:00:42.989> there<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.160> as<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.399> see

like now there we go so as you can see
the<00:00:44.670> obviously<00:00:44.940> loads<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> actual<00:00:45.719> mobile

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
Android browsers it seems to work

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.670 
Android browsers it seems to work
perfectly<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> go<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> the

perfectly on this one want to go to the
actual<00:00:55.770> full<00:00:56.219> set<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.579> let's<00:00:56.699> jump<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
actual full set so let's jump to the

actual full set so let's jump to the
full<00:00:57.270> website<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.489> quickly<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.180> proper

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
full website so that quickly on proper

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.529 
full website so that quickly on proper
nope<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.800> require<00:01:02.160> click<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:02.820> so

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
nope they require click to that time so

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.850 
nope they require click to that time so
operation<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.019> how<00:01:04.080> fast<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.530> actually

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
operation see how fast is actually

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.980 
operation see how fast is actually
rendering<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> web<00:01:05.339> pages<00:01:05.689> over<00:01:06.689> i'll<00:01:06.869> be

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
rendering the web pages over i'll be

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.899 
rendering the web pages over i'll be
pretty<00:01:07.380> impressive<00:01:07.770> how<00:01:07.890> fast<00:01:08.189> RC<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pretty impressive how fast RC is and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
pretty impressive how fast RC is and
there's<00:01:09.869> been<00:01:10.020> some<00:01:10.260> instances<00:01:10.770> where<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
there's been some instances where you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.969 
there's been some instances where you
can<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> gets<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.790> little<00:01:12.060> sluggish<00:01:12.420> but

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
can it gets a little sluggish but

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.550 
can it gets a little sluggish but
nothing<00:01:13.979> any<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:14.189> than<00:01:14.430> other<00:01:14.610> browsers<00:01:14.970> off

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
nothing any more than other browsers off

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.380 
nothing any more than other browsers off
so<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:17.040> fully<00:01:17.280> loaded<00:01:17.520> once

so you can see that's fully loaded once
again<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.869> show<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.320> gasthaus<00:01:19.770> move

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
again you show the gasthaus move

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
again you show the gasthaus move
actually<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.479> pretty<00:01:21.780> nice<00:01:21.930> and
