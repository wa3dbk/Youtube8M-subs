they say one pill about five or six
hours<00:03:37.049> later<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:38.070> I'll<00:03:38.549> probably<00:03:38.850> end<00:03:39.030> up

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
hours later so I'll probably end up

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.789 
hours later so I'll probably end up
taking<00:03:39.390> one<00:03:39.570> pill<00:03:39.989> for<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.260> first<00:03:40.530> two<00:03:40.769> or

taking one pill for the first two or
three<00:03:40.950> days<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.670> then<00:03:41.959> upping<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:44.190> two

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
three days and then upping it to two

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.090 
three days and then upping it to two
pills<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.790> day<00:03:44.820> after<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.959> then<00:03:46.620> after

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
pills a day after that and then after

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.979 
pills a day after that and then after
that<00:03:47.250> they<00:03:47.489> say<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.730> want<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.000> take<00:03:48.180> three<00:03:48.540> so

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090

I guess I'll really see how it's doing
for<00:03:51.360> me<00:03:51.480> if<00:03:51.600> it's<00:03:51.750> working<00:03:52.079> at<00:03:52.200> -<00:03:52.440> I'm<00:03:52.680> not
