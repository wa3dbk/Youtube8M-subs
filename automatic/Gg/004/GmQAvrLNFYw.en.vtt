00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.450> this<00:00:00.750> for<00:00:00.960> years<00:00:01.110> has<00:00:01.380> been<00:00:01.669> quite

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
I think this for years has been quite

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.640 
I think this for years has been quite
different<00:00:03.030> for<00:00:03.149> our<00:00:03.270> key<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.720> terms<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.200> we

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
different for our key in terms of we

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.590 
different for our key in terms of we
usually<00:00:05.009> come<00:00:05.310> together<00:00:05.609> just<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.359> year<00:00:06.540> before

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
usually come together just a year before

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.799 
usually come together just a year before
the<00:00:07.379> Olympics<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.360> from<00:00:09.360> England<00:00:09.660> Scotland

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
the Olympics and from England Scotland

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.100 
the Olympics and from England Scotland
Wales<00:00:09.990> then<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:10.530> become<00:00:10.800> gb<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.610> we<00:00:11.730> try<00:00:11.940> and

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
Wales then we become gb and we try and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.839 
Wales then we become gb and we try and
break<00:00:13.110> everything<00:00:13.410> down<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.920> sort<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.250> go

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
break everything down and sort of go

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.460 
break everything down and sort of go
within<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.299> year<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.719> build<00:00:15.870> up<00:00:16.080> towards<00:00:16.410> a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
within one year to build up towards a

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.040 
within one year to build up towards a
qualifier<00:00:16.920> an<00:00:17.100> Olympics<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.930> we've<00:00:18.930> been

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
qualifier an Olympics and we've been

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.779 
qualifier an Olympics and we've been
very<00:00:19.080> lucky<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.619> time<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.279> we've<00:00:20.400> had<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
very lucky this time that we've had a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.509 
very lucky this time that we've had a
longer<00:00:21.119> process<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.890> think<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
longer process and I think with the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.950 
longer process and I think with the
centralized<00:00:24.000> sort<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.240> program<00:00:24.600> we've<00:00:24.750> had

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
centralized sort of program we've had

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
centralized sort of program we've had
but<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> lot<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:26.099> time<00:00:26.310> together<00:00:26.699> would<00:00:27.090> not

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
but a lot more time together would not

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.050 
but a lot more time together would not
have<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.449> go<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.750> qualifier<00:00:28.910> it's<00:00:29.910> just

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
have to go to a qualifier it's just

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420 
have to go to a qualifier it's just
given<00:00:30.359> us<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.660> much<00:00:30.810> more<00:00:31.019> freedom<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
given us so much more freedom to to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.700 
given us so much more freedom to to
build<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> group<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.329> think<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.469> we

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
build a group and I think one thing we

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
build a group and I think one thing we
say<00:00:34.860> about<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.160> team<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.809> last

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
say about this team is that in the last

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200 
say about this team is that in the last
Olympics<00:00:37.410> well<00:00:38.129> two<00:00:38.489> Olympics<00:00:38.850> I've<00:00:38.940> been<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
Olympics well two Olympics I've been to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.940 
Olympics well two Olympics I've been to
in<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.570> tournaments<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.170> while<00:00:40.469> back<00:00:40.500> we

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
in a lot of tournaments a while back we

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100 
in a lot of tournaments a while back we
used<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> tournaments<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.930> hope

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
used to go to tournaments and we we hope

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
used to go to tournaments and we we hope
to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.410> quite<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.070> sort<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:45.210> we

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to do quite well and we sort of if we

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.240 
to do quite well and we sort of if we
got<00:00:45.539> lucky<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.960> could<00:00:46.110> make<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> semi-final<00:00:47.070> but

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
got lucky we could make a semi-final but

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
got lucky we could make a semi-final but
not<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.059> believe<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.600> could<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.899> anything

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
not really believe we could do anything

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.170 
not really believe we could do anything
there<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> whereas<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.910> two<00:00:51.059> or<00:00:51.149> three

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
there and whereas now for two or three

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.420 
there and whereas now for two or three
years<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.710> group<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.129> goes

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
years I think we have a group that goes

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.119 
years I think we have a group that goes
to<00:00:53.610> tournaments<00:00:54.260> believing<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.920> win

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
to tournaments believing we we can win

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.910 
to tournaments believing we we can win
and<00:00:56.539> answer<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.170> special<00:00:58.500> place<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> be

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and answer it's a special place to be

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.040 
and answer it's a special place to be
when<00:00:59.070> you're<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> team<00:00:59.579> like<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> makes

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
when you're in a team like that it makes

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
when you're in a team like that it makes
it<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.350> worthwhile<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.070> sort<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> training

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it all worthwhile the sort of training

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.240 
it all worthwhile the sort of training
and<00:01:03.180> everything<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> put<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:05.010> we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and everything you put in so I think we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.590 
and everything you put in so I think we
do<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> real<00:01:05.760> confidence<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> belief

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
do have a real confidence and belief

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.270 
do have a real confidence and belief
within<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> whole<00:01:07.470> squad<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.920> say<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.130> not

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
within the whole squad and say it's not

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.210 
within the whole squad and say it's not
just<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.580> 16<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:10.020> 27<00:01:10.650> whoever<00:01:10.950> would

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
just this 16 here the 27 whoever would

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.399 
just this 16 here the 27 whoever would
have<00:01:11.310> got<00:01:11.490> picked<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> 16<00:01:12.990> everybody

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
have got picked and for the 16 everybody

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
have got picked and for the 16 everybody
trusted<00:01:13.770> each<00:01:13.920> other<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:14.970> had<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.750> have

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
trusted each other that we had a we have

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.359 
trusted each other that we had a we have
a<00:01:15.869> strong<00:01:16.140> squad<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.040> challenge

for medals in this tournament and
tournaments<00:01:19.950> beyond<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.340> well<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
tournaments beyond as well I think and

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.490 
tournaments beyond as well I think and
say<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.750> togetherness<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
say I just think the togetherness of the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
say I just think the togetherness of the
group<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.130> been<00:01:26.310> brilliant<00:01:26.970> likely
