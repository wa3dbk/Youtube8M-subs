we're in that position we've got three
you<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:57.989> ideas<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> we're<00:00:58.890> gonna

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you know kind of ideas that we're gonna

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
you know kind of ideas that we're gonna
work<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.699> order<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> get<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.359> shot

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
work with in order to get this shot

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
work with in order to get this shot
going<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.260> us<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.219> being<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> toss

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
going for us the first being the toss

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.539 
going for us the first being the toss
okay<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:03.960> most<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:05.010> probably

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
okay I think most of you have probably

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.390 
okay I think most of you have probably
heard<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.530> generally<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.710> toss<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.280> ball

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
heard that generally you toss the ball

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.820 
heard that generally you toss the ball
to<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.850> o'clock<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.600> I've<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.930> 12<00:01:10.320> here

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
to one o'clock so if I've got 12 here

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.899 
to one o'clock so if I've got 12 here
we're<00:01:11.549> normally<00:01:12.000> thinking<00:01:12.450> toss<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.990> 1<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
we're normally thinking toss to 1 as a

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.480 
we're normally thinking toss to 1 as a
right-handed<00:01:14.909> player<00:01:15.470> for<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.650> serve<00:01:17.009> down

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
right-handed player for this serve down

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.230 
right-handed player for this serve down
the<00:01:17.700> tee<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.320> target<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.880> close

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the tee because that target is so close

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.450 
the tee because that target is so close
to<00:01:21.270> me<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> closest<00:01:22.380> target<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:22.950> have

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
to me it's the closest target I can have

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.810 
to me it's the closest target I can have
when<00:01:24.420> I'm<00:01:24.540> playing<00:01:24.780> singles<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.710> down<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> tee

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
when I'm playing singles is down the tee

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
when I'm playing singles is down the tee
so<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.299> want<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> toss<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.350> ball<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so I actually want to toss the ball a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.749 
so I actually want to toss the ball a
little<00:01:28.950> closer<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:30.570> 12<00:01:30.960> o'clock<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.430> just

little closer to 12 o'clock and it just

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.380 
little closer to 12 o'clock and it just
keeps<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.380> line<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.909> where<00:01:36.180> I'm

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
keeps me really on line with where I'm

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.630 
keeps me really on line with where I'm
trying<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.320> ball<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.650> end<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.369> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
start working a toss a little more to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.270 
start working a toss a little more to
the<00:01:40.470> left<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> down<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> tee<00:01:42.299> serve<00:01:42.570> here

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
the left for the down the tee serve here

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.090 
the left for the down the tee serve here
secondly<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.970> rocket<00:01:45.509> path<00:01:45.950> when<00:01:46.950> we

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
secondly the rocket path when we

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
secondly the rocket path when we
normally<00:01:47.670> swing<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> ball<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.020> at<00:01:49.229> 1

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
normally swing to a ball that's at 1

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.310 
normally swing to a ball that's at 1
o'clock<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.369> 2<00:01:50.640> o'clock<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:52.020> know<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
o'clock if not 2 o'clock you know that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.859 
o'clock if not 2 o'clock you know that
swing<00:01:52.710> comes<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.250> away<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.450> body<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
swing comes out away from your body a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.139 
swing comes out away from your body a
little<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.670> we're<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> be

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
little bit so if we're going to be

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880 
little bit so if we're going to be
tracking<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.869> ball<00:01:58.110> that's<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.469> little<00:01:58.680> more

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
tracking a ball that's a little more

clear out to the left a little bit in
order<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.180> create<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.780> nice<00:02:25.280> streamlined

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
order to create this nice streamlined

swing<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> ball<00:02:27.900> okay<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:29.460> then<00:02:29.790> thirdly

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
swing to the ball okay and then thirdly

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.290 
swing to the ball okay and then thirdly
this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.530> probably<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.250> serve<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.790> has<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
this is probably the serve that has the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.510 
this is probably the serve that has the
biggest<00:02:33.870> amount<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.410> pronation<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
biggest amount of pronation on it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.550 
biggest amount of pronation on it
because<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.300> know<00:02:36.390> more<00:02:36.660> often<00:02:36.840> than<00:02:37.170> not<00:02:37.200> if
