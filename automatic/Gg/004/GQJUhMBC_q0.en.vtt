competition<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.719> are<00:00:15.839> now<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.560> believe<00:00:17.100> seven

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
competition we are now I believe seven

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.580 
competition we are now I believe seven
weeks<00:00:17.940> out<00:00:18.119> nationals<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.960> both<00:00:19.140> qualified

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
weeks out nationals we both qualified

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.230 
weeks out nationals we both qualified
Trent<00:00:20.070> got<00:00:20.160> fourth<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.609> his<00:00:20.699> class<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.180> got

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
Trent got fourth in his class and I got

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720 
Trent got fourth in his class and I got
fifth<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.010> they've<00:00:23.010> pretty<00:00:23.250> much<00:00:23.400> said<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
fifth and they've pretty much said to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
fifth and they've pretty much said to
put<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.000> sighs<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.600> we're<00:00:24.900> starting<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.350> new

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
put on sighs so we're starting a new

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.769 
put on sighs so we're starting a new
type<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> room<00:00:26.130> workout<00:00:26.550> routine<00:00:26.910> which<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
type of room workout routine which is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.679 
type of room workout routine which is
push<00:00:28.140> pull<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:29.160> legs<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.939> three<00:00:30.330> times<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
push pull and then legs so three times a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.560 
push pull and then legs so three times a
week<00:00:30.779> yeah<00:00:31.619> basically<00:00:32.030> this<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> best<00:00:33.420> way

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
week yeah basically this is the best way

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.990 
week yeah basically this is the best way
to<00:00:33.600> put<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.620> size<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.160> quick<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:35.489> possible

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to put on size as quick as possible

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
to put on size as quick as possible
you're<00:00:36.270> hitting<00:00:36.510> every<00:00:36.690> muscle<00:00:36.870> group<00:00:37.079> twice

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you're hitting every muscle group twice

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.220 
you're hitting every muscle group twice
a<00:00:37.649> week<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.020> much

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
a week so that just that much

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080 
a week so that just that much
stimulation<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:41.010> help<00:00:41.160> help<00:00:41.670> your<00:00:41.790> muscle

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
stimulation will help help your muscle

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.420 
stimulation will help help your muscle
grow<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.660> we'll<00:00:42.809> probably<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.309> right<00:00:44.309> now

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
grow so we'll probably do right now

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.639 
grow so we'll probably do right now
we're<00:00:44.550> doing<00:00:44.700> lower<00:00:44.940> reps<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:46.500> heavy

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
we're doing lower reps and really heavy

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
we're doing lower reps and really heavy
weight<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.190> trying<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.789> stimulate

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
weight just trying to really stimulate

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.459 
weight just trying to really stimulate
the<00:00:48.329> muscle<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> we'll<00:00:49.020> probably<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the muscle and we'll probably do that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.040 
the muscle and we'll probably do that
for<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> few<00:00:49.890> weeks<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:50.840> switch<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
for a few weeks and then switch it to a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
for a few weeks and then switch it to a
little<00:00:52.289> bit<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.559> higher<00:00:52.739> volume<00:00:53.219> yeah

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
little bit more higher volume yeah

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.529 
little bit more higher volume yeah
exactly

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
exactly

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.299 
exactly
we're<00:00:55.020> gonna<00:00:55.110> pretty<00:00:55.320> much<00:00:55.410> -<00:00:55.680> also<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
we're gonna pretty much - also like a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.790 
we're gonna pretty much - also like a
mini<00:00:56.550> bulk<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.600> we're<00:00:57.899> reverse<00:00:58.230> dieting<00:00:58.500> up

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
mini bulk so we're reverse dieting up

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.799 
mini bulk so we're reverse dieting up
after<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.520> had<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.270> binge<00:01:00.510> eat

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
after we had a little bit of a binge eat

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
after we had a little bit of a binge eat
it's<00:01:01.050> obviously<00:01:01.440> after<00:01:01.800> our<00:01:01.920> competition

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it's obviously after our competition

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.030 
it's obviously after our competition
we're<00:01:02.699> gonna<00:01:02.789> eat<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.270> some<00:01:04.260> bad<00:01:04.470> food<00:01:04.769> but

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
we're gonna eat some some bad food but

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.560 
we're gonna eat some some bad food but
yeah<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.369> we're<00:01:05.460> gonna<00:01:05.519> reverse<00:01:05.850> diet<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
yeah so we're gonna reverse diet up and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780 
yeah so we're gonna reverse diet up and
then<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.020> another<00:01:07.470> mini<00:01:08.070> cuts<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
then do also another mini cuts and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.030 
then do also another mini cuts and
hopefully<00:01:09.450> come<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> lot<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.710> size

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
hopefully come in with a lot more size

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
hopefully come in with a lot more size
into<00:01:11.430> nationals<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> definitely<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.840> as

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
into nationals and definitely not as

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440 
into nationals and definitely not as
lean<00:01:13.320> yeah<00:01:14.100> basically<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.729> judges<00:01:15.030> said<00:01:15.210> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
lean yeah basically the judges said that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.190 
lean yeah basically the judges said that
we<00:01:16.380> were<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:17.189> too<00:01:17.600> lean<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.990> place

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we were a little bit too lean to place

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
we were a little bit too lean to place
in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> top<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.009> that's<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.430> still<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
in the top so that's what we still a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
in the top so that's what we still a
good<00:01:20.880> conditioning<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.659> why<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
good conditioning and that's why we

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.429 
good conditioning and that's why we
placed<00:01:22.700> reasonably<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:24.200> right<00:01:25.200> now<00:01:25.290> we're

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
placed reasonably well right now we're

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.320 
placed reasonably well right now we're
just<00:01:25.590> doing<00:01:25.680> shoulders<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
just doing shoulders we do a lot of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
just doing shoulders we do a lot of
pushing<00:01:27.540> movements<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.110> push<00:01:28.409> day<00:01:28.590> obviously

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
pushing movements on push day obviously

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
pushing movements on push day obviously
mainly<00:01:29.430> compounds<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.390> those<00:01:31.020> ones

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
mainly compounds because those ones

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200 
mainly compounds because those ones
activate<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> most<00:01:31.890> muscle<00:01:32.220> fibers<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.970> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
activate the most muscle fibers so I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
activate the most muscle fibers so I
think<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.200> come<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.439> after<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.950> is

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
think that when we come to after this is

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.030 
think that when we come to after this is
a<00:01:35.610> flat<00:01:36.570> bench<00:01:36.960> press<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.710> came<00:01:37.829> come

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
a flat bench press we just came come

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
a flat bench press we just came come
down<00:01:38.250> yeah<00:01:38.939> pretty<00:01:39.240> much<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:40.079> started<00:01:40.439> off

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
down yeah pretty much we started off

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.749 
down yeah pretty much we started off
with<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> incline<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.520> hit<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
with the incline then we hit the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.010 
with the incline then we hit the
dumbbell<00:01:42.060> shoulder<00:01:42.210> press<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:42.840> we're

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
dumbbell shoulder press and now we're

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.889 
dumbbell shoulder press and now we're
doing<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> flat<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.549> flat<00:01:44.759> bench<00:01:45.090> most<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
doing the flat the flat bench most of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.960 
doing the flat the flat bench most of
these<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.530> last<00:01:46.770> sets<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.430> most

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
these are all of our last sets so most

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.600 
these are all of our last sets so most
of<00:01:48.090> our<00:01:48.180> heaviest<00:01:48.659> weights<00:01:49.159> we<00:01:50.159> try<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.490> keep

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
of our heaviest weights we try and keep

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.300 
of our heaviest weights we try and keep
the<00:01:50.850> form<00:01:51.210> controlled<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.320> never<00:01:52.770> always<00:01:52.979> go

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the form controlled and never always go

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
the form controlled and never always go
down<00:01:53.490> all<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.790> way<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.270> chest<00:01:54.479> when

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
down all the way down to your chest when

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.810 
down all the way down to your chest when
doing<00:01:55.350> these<00:01:55.439> exercises<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.610> get<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
doing these exercises they can get the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
doing these exercises they can get the
best<00:01:57.090> stretch<00:01:57.450> yeah<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.530> definitely

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
best stretch yeah it's it's definitely

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.639 
best stretch yeah it's it's definitely
better<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> go<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.430> form<00:01:59.790> overweight<00:02:00.469> we<00:02:01.469> do

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
better to go with form overweight we do

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.109 
better to go with form overweight we do
do<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.159> bit<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.399> hip<00:02:02.610> action<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.060> we

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
do a little bit of hip action and we

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.660 
do a little bit of hip action and we
definitely<00:02:03.270> bounce<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.649> bar<00:02:05.130> off<00:02:05.310> our<00:02:05.490> chest

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
definitely bounce the bar off our chest

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520 
definitely bounce the bar off our chest
a<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:05.820> bit<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:06.990> still<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
a little bit but it's it's still for the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.869 
a little bit but it's it's still for the
most<00:02:07.590> part<00:02:07.920> fairly<00:02:08.280> controlled<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.819> we

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
most part fairly controlled and we

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.380 
most part fairly controlled and we
always<00:02:09.000> try

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
always try

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.840 
always try
push<00:02:10.080> through<00:02:10.350> failure<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.100> using<00:02:11.730> their

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
push through failure with using their

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.520 
push through failure with using their
spotters<00:02:12.120> yeah<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> always<00:02:13.020> remember<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.410> use

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
spotters yeah I always remember to use

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.900 
spotters yeah I always remember to use
your<00:02:13.560> spotters<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.280> if<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.520> need<00:02:14.700> those

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
your spotters and if you need those

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.320 
your spotters and if you need those
extra<00:02:15.150> last<00:02:15.870> one<00:02:16.530> or<00:02:16.680> two<00:02:16.830> reps<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.940> sure<00:02:18.150> to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
extra last one or two reps be sure to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
extra last one or two reps be sure to
use<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.660> spot<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.110> help<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.380> get<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.760> right

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
use the spot to help you get that right

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.210 
use the spot to help you get that right
here<00:02:20.940> we're<00:02:21.060> also<00:02:21.180> doing<00:02:21.569> dips<00:02:22.100> pretty<00:02:23.100> much

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
here we're also doing dips pretty much

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.860 
here we're also doing dips pretty much
for<00:02:23.430> our<00:02:23.459> chest<00:02:23.850> we're<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:24.300> we're<00:02:24.510> gonna

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
for our chest we're not we're gonna

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.300 
for our chest we're not we're gonna
stimulate<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.440> triceps<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.890> little<00:02:26.100> bit<00:02:26.190> as<00:02:26.280> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
stimulate the triceps a little bit as a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.770 
stimulate the triceps a little bit as a
secondary<00:02:26.760> but<00:02:26.940> we're<00:02:27.030> really<00:02:27.240> focusing<00:02:27.690> on

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
secondary but we're really focusing on

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.720 
secondary but we're really focusing on
our<00:02:27.930> chest<00:02:28.170> here<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.070> like<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.340> chains

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
our chest here and we like the chains

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.370 
our chest here and we like the chains
because<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> makes<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.330> also<00:02:30.480> lean<00:02:30.810> forward

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
because it makes you also lean forward

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.620 
because it makes you also lean forward
it<00:02:31.500> makes<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.740> hit<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.580> lower<00:02:32.940> PEC<00:02:33.360> at

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
it makes you hit that that lower PEC at

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.720 
it makes you hit that that lower PEC at
that<00:02:33.780> lower<00:02:34.260> PEC<00:02:34.590> development<00:02:35.190> yeah

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
that lower PEC development yeah

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.360 
that lower PEC development yeah
basically<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> chains<00:02:37.260> forcing<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.250> to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
basically with the chains forcing you to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.880 
basically with the chains forcing you to
lean<00:02:38.489> forward<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.750> really<00:02:40.230> takes<00:02:40.830> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
lean forward it it really takes the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.220 
lean forward it it really takes the
emphasis<00:02:41.340> mainly<00:02:42.060> off<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.360> your<00:02:42.480> tricep<00:02:42.959> your

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
emphasis mainly off of your tricep your

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.660 
emphasis mainly off of your tricep your
triceps<00:02:43.709> still<00:02:43.890> getting<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.160> worked<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.520> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
triceps still getting it worked but it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.630 
triceps still getting it worked but it
mainly<00:02:45.150> focuses<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.989> more<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.890> lower

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
mainly focuses it more on the lower

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280 
mainly focuses it more on the lower
chest<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.269> then<00:02:48.600> with<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.780> chains<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.080> also

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
chest and then with the chains that also

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.290 
chest and then with the chains that also
helps<00:02:50.130> bring<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.550> bunch<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.820> stabilizer

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
helps bring in a bunch of stabilizer

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.850 
helps bring in a bunch of stabilizer
muscles<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.870> well<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.290> think<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.530> chains<00:02:52.739> on

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
muscles as well I think the chains on

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.440 
muscles as well I think the chains on
they<00:02:52.950> weigh<00:02:53.070> like<00:02:53.190> 30<00:02:53.489> pounds<00:02:53.880> yeah<00:02:54.269> they're

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
they weigh like 30 pounds yeah they're

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.280 
they weigh like 30 pounds yeah they're
not<00:02:54.570> super<00:02:54.870> heavy

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
not super heavy

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.470 
not super heavy
after<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:55.830> did<00:02:56.010> V<00:02:56.459> Bar<00:02:56.610> push<00:02:56.820> as<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.360> can

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
after this we did V Bar push as you can

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.120 
after this we did V Bar push as you can
see<00:02:57.600> we<00:02:57.810> kind<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.290> lean<00:02:58.440> forward<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.860> little<00:02:59.010> bit

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
see we kind of lean forward a little bit

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.240 
see we kind of lean forward a little bit
cuz<00:02:59.430> we're<00:02:59.550> going<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.820> little<00:02:59.850> heavier<00:03:01.250> pretty

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
cuz we're going a little heavier pretty

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.949 
cuz we're going a little heavier pretty
much<00:03:02.400> we're<00:03:02.640> trying<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.269> go<00:03:03.390> heavier<00:03:03.810> with

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
much we're trying to go heavier with

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.810 
much we're trying to go heavier with
most<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.230> our<00:03:04.290> exercises<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.550> get<00:03:05.700> them

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
most of our exercises so we can get them

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.080 
most of our exercises so we can get them
to<00:03:05.850> grow<00:03:06.680> yeah<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.070> that's<00:03:08.370> about<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
to grow yeah so that's about it for the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.600 
to grow yeah so that's about it for the
V<00:03:09.300> bar<00:03:09.540> yeah<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.470> think<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:11.070> was<00:03:11.190> basically

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
V bar yeah I think that was basically

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.420 
V bar yeah I think that was basically
and<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.880> oh<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:13.080> actually<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.739> camera<00:03:14.040> died<00:03:14.190> on

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and I oh we actually the camera died on

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.190 
and I oh we actually the camera died on
that<00:03:14.579> last<00:03:14.820> one<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.360> now<00:03:15.540> Kate<00:03:15.780> had<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.049> pull

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
that last one so now Kate had to pull

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.259 
that last one so now Kate had to pull
out<00:03:16.230> his<00:03:16.440> phone<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.730> he<00:03:17.730> didn't<00:03:17.970> turn<00:03:18.120> it

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
out his phone and he didn't turn it
