00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.680 
I think the first thing I would say is
don't<00:01:52.440> throw<00:01:52.620> me<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.860> ground<00:01:53.390> don't<00:01:54.390> crack

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
don't throw me on the ground don't crack

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.530 
don't throw me on the ground don't crack
it<00:01:54.870> abuse<00:01:55.520> which<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:56.730> do<00:01:56.940> very<00:01:56.970> often<00:01:57.300> at

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it abuse which I don't do very often at

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.170 
it abuse which I don't do very often at
all<00:01:57.660> I<00:01:57.690> think<00:01:57.990> that's<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.230> bad<00:01:58.380> thing<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:59.220> mean<00:01:59.700> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
all I think that's a bad thing I mean I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.060 
all I think that's a bad thing I mean I
think<00:02:00.480> it<00:02:01.020> would<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> good<00:02:01.530> thing<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
think it would be a good thing to have a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.410 
think it would be a good thing to have a
rocket<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> talk<00:02:02.610> maybe<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> little

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
rocket to talk maybe to be a little

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020 
rocket to talk maybe to be a little
motivational<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.260> tell<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> few<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.700> few

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
motivational and tell you a few a few

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.820 
motivational and tell you a few a few
things<00:02:06.480> you<00:02:06.660> can<00:02:06.780> maybe<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.170> better<00:02:07.410> you<00:02:07.710> know

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
things you can maybe do better you know

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.800 
things you can maybe do better you know
like<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.520> few<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.090> stats<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.540> showing

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
like like a few of the stats and showing

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.420 
like like a few of the stats and showing
you<00:02:09.899> know<00:02:10.020> maybe<00:02:10.170> hit<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> bit<00:02:11.070> more<00:02:11.220> spin

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
you know maybe hit with a bit more spin

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.770 
you know maybe hit with a bit more spin
because<00:02:11.670> you're<00:02:11.940> missing<00:02:12.210> every<00:02:12.360> second<00:02:12.630> ball

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
because you're missing every second ball

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.850 
because you're missing every second ball
you<00:02:13.020> know<00:02:13.110> something<00:02:13.410> like<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.680> would<00:02:13.830> be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you know something like that would be

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.820 
you know something like that would be
helpful<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.280> sure<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:18.320> think<00:02:19.320> my<00:02:19.470> racquet

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
helpful for sure I think my racquet

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.090 
helpful for sure I think my racquet
would<00:02:19.950> describe<00:02:20.340> me<00:02:20.610> as<00:02:20.870> intense<00:02:21.950> maybe<00:02:22.950> a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
would describe me as intense maybe a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.010 
would describe me as intense maybe a
little<00:02:23.310> bit<00:02:23.400> impatient<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:24.240> like<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.870> play

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
little bit impatient I like to play

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.830 
little bit impatient I like to play
aggressive<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.710> really<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.070> know<00:02:26.360> go<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.600> my

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
aggressive and really you know go for my

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.930

shots at the point

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.510 
shots at the point
probably<00:02:30.720> maybe<00:02:31.620> he<00:02:31.950> would<00:02:32.070> hear<00:02:32.250> me<00:02:32.370> like
