00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.580
 to everyone the demanded and 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.670
 Welcome to my first trick mode 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.130
 aliens of the map extinction of the call of 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.170
 duty ghosts and this trick I 'm going to 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.110
 teach better said three compilations 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.980
 of tricks three spots where we can 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.410
 stay and be so to speak 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.840
 immortal or invincible what happens that 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.180
 rather that pile of aliens action already 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.310
 which is pretty good is pretty 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.930
 cash the trick and they will escape us 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.790
 some aliens and they can hit us here 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.800
 Okay, this is the first spot and here 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.690
 they can hit us but little the truth is 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.270
 what little if you see that it is coming towards 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.540
 we then directly take off 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.910
 soda we shot bullets worth and not the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.860
 we charge you know that they will mostly leave 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.600
 down or to the other side what happens 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.870
 that you may attack some of them 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.190
 Well, if that happens, the matrix and point as 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.420
 I'm telling you, this is pretty good 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.100
 to hold some rounds not 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.199
 infinite because it is quite complicated 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.750
 hold here and then I'm going to teach 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.430
 other more these maps to these spots 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.840
 they're just starting the game nothing 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.939
 more to put him 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.310
 the drill must be put to remove the 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.109
 plant in front and now we go to 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.600
 second spot the second spot is by 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.609
 here it 's pretty easy to do 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.140
 they are all quite easy what happens 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.090
 that the bad as if I'm saying so 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.590
 It is not 100% effective but if you can 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.869
 help to withstand some rounds not 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.159
 because less I'm being vice here 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.979
 we stick everything we can 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.149
 you should not notice any fall or anything 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.490
 you just have to stick everything 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.799
 we can and be here you see that the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.140
 zombies that have helped zombies the 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.520
 aliens stay down there and some of us 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.259
 will stick as I told you about this is 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.659
 Well I do not recommend it because we can 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.459
 give vale and good we will pass to the third 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.349
 spot I the truth that I prefer the 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.399
 first because it 's the easiest by that 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.590
 saying it good is also pretty 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.759
 easy but it's not that effective here you see 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.310
 that you have to jump because above and 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.989
 jump towards these stones and it depends 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.909
 as you put yourselves they can attack you a lot or 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.530
 little as I say I can attack you 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.000
 quite because as you see that bug we 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.640
 they are shooting here from all 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.740
 finally I will tell you that we have 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.510
 been with hack and we have come out of the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.390
 map and still come the bugs since 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.280
 this this way of aliens although you 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.470
 leave the map even if you get 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.060
 in the best spot you will come aliens 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.060
 yes or yes or it is going to be impossible 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.080
 look for good tricks on this map so 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.700
