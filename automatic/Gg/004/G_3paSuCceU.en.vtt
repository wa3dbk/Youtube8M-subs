00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.770
 10 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.549
 Hello and welcome surnamed Sirius today with another qantas- 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.409
 2 in multiplayer video 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.100
 and this time, Sun made the mode x-ray traction go 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 You can see her I'm in the lobby should Pier 17 or Wall Street 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.120
 yes and in the end the switching system has 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.580
 About the same evening, a thousand Simmel felt 28 times in the mode 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.210
 Thrown attack 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.340
 yes in the end I thought then leisure attack and explain one 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.040
 bit drove and goes 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.979
 Attack is Brian turn-based mode 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:41.970
 you have to go 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.230
 Only one life in each round may recall the first volume 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.720
 a bit of searching and destroying from computing 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.100
 but in the end is completely different what you have to imagine 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.970
 one group plays virtually every normal soldier and the other group 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.670
 with the Middle East 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.749
 and Bowman doing the fairway guys again 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.600
 have the defend 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.730
 Soldiers as a heavy gun and the names are carrier halt 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.960
 just a normal pistol 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 from the game he also gave it is relatively simple 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.570
 The soldiers are defending different spots here 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.850
 and the attackers need data from the Spurs documents 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.420
 that there really long so must be for a very long time a point and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.170
 Here you can see yourself as a defender 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.260
 on the first name badge Regensburg 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.180
 and doing those in which give the answer and look what to do 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.330
 because the colleagues 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.909
 nevertheless only lightly armed it is here I just went for it 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.920
 I believe I have with him 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.159
 first onslaught 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.869
 played with the stars shit apparently but it was not just me and there 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.360
 is it already the first round lost year was praise Unheilig 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.950
 short round apparently all defenders have to dead at the time 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.640
 have been 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.090
 although I have counted only three daycare of the chamber now 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.240
 then you switched sides and you can see you have to go out 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.090
 Select three predefined classes 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.730
 that's the post or the infiltration I'm here right now 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.589
 decided for infiltration 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.979
 Alsbach Israel m12 action 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.209
 and he 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.879
 he runs very little bit faster 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.439
 Adria paid 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.469
 Emperor in his movements 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.239
 and I thought well, maybe that's what it is 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.200
 how one then perhaps by my way of playing or how it recognizes 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.040
 I comment here I have 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.590
 This mode does not really play that often, I think this is mine 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.559
 second round 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.909
 I am at all 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.799
 Real often in these attacks have not dreamed 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.260
 and counselors leave each time because I actually percent in others 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.319
 appoint 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.189
 Here you can see now we have the towers VW Citi epd and you have to 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.259
 now go to a tower as well 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:49.449
 and already this countdown begins to draw that also gives Timmer 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.329
 absolutely bovis for you 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.419
 But it really takes a long time to get one hundred percent to the point 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.739
 and you can be relatively sure 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.069
 Dost area is definitely up here on Dekker 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.099
 the action i comment on this now i had had the pope on mode on 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.819
 The fourth success was still made here in Kiel the church was now 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.230
 maybe not the most convincing 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 Anyway, after all, I have to pop up there and share some data 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.359
 uploaded and that's what it's about 8 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.729
 so that's also the last colleague last and you can see me 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.279
 got zero but get 209 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:32.209
 for the university the university is lost and the opponent for it with 2 0 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.579
 you can see the three classes of defenders, that is, the group that is 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.499
 the guardian of the enforcers and the protector 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.869
 and here either the state guarantee was playing the CFI 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.999
 I have now decided again for the Philine so the protector 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.999
 and make me go hunting again 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.290
 In general, just have to say that I have a handle 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.830
 I do not like it so much right from the beginning I do not know if it's still 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.010
 changes if you then little exercise ThrÃ¤nhardt but I have to say 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.400
 "That I'm so warm with Capture mode so easy right from the start 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.480
 I'm so much fun 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.839
 and also crash site 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:07.839
 Somehow I'm not sure about Freis 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.679
 I really like to play my own classes my own 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:15.679
 Weapons have set anger on me and that's the reason and the reason 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:20.159
 Element of multiplayer in what you just now here in attacks not 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.520
 had more and that will show if this can really prevail 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.770
 you can believe a lot I also see the players quite well 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.229
 alone in the lobby with some pr-people 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.840
 and I'm running a bit unmotivated between these points 

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.949
 and forth I do not quite know where to know with me obviously that mine 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.550
 Colleagues too, not exactly 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.990
 It may be that changing that courage as easy with a few 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.490
 colleagues 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.139
 But at first I would blame a bit more on Texel 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.130
 just have to do so 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.750
 Two packages are quasi taken and over the more amount during the 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.699
 helicopter 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.270
 and that is so the very little bit takes mix maybe builds 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.259
 Slovenian and Capture the Flag 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.249
 and just when the first points were taken then it goes on 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.430
 second points are important 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.110
 yes, there all defenders and attackers meet at the same time and 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.349
 that it's not bad things i've never failed in 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.319
 Video games I already have ten Burch with the punk to the Medicopter 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.100
 way past 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.590
 but it is cheap and was dreamed in the middle of the week and then there was no new one 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.090
 round 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.970
 and that's why we're cheering for it now and we're giving it a go now 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.529
 Round won apparently 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.520
 but here all attackers were killed without being shot at impressively 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.919
 Then the whole thing turns very short and the funniest thing about the videos 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.639
 actually that I present you video today by I completely no 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.559
 Make keel 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:45.590
 Hagenacker 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.700
 Ork a cart true 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.449
 Prof 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.659
 5 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.659
 he has 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.310
 and is not that the blast I have not clarified I've been up all the time 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.230
 the fag rolling and as far as I die 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.610
 the round is won and now comes the cold clear most valuable 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.110
 player 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.969
 Bindig and I got 5 20 of the Moscow points for a thousand victims 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.020
 Neuenkirchen but 5 20 Gamers Cowboys 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.259
 I found that so sharp "I laughed that you can also watch my video 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.259
 fit 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.979
 percent 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.339
 Ute Vogt 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:22.509
 AFP 

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:32.709
 so that was again the stark opposite the top the second round directly 

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:34.070
 subsequently took place 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.999
 funny way back to the same card 

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:39.839
 Here I am doing five and we still lose one to three that 

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:42.839
 should only be enough to show that it is at 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.460
 attack 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.659
 not necessarily on the kills arrives 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:49.189
 So you can also with only kilt and many data packages of the most valuable players 

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:52.869
 if you like it then owner Olaf Manthey gets there too 

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:54.520
 I would definitely be happy 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.330
 thanks for watching and
