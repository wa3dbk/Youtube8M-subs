00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
so now we're here on it on the stairs we

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.579 
so now we're here on it on the stairs we
took<00:00:02.669> it<00:00:02.820> from<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.090> grass<00:00:03.300> we're<00:00:04.110> still<00:00:04.290> doing

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
took it from the grass we're still doing

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.559 
took it from the grass we're still doing
some<00:00:04.740> plyometric<00:00:05.339> routines<00:00:05.730> here<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.330> one

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
some plyometric routines here this one

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.030 
some plyometric routines here this one
we're<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.230> see<00:00:07.410> we're<00:00:07.560> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.830> do

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
we're going to see we're going to do

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.919 
we're going to see we're going to do
three<00:00:08.370> I'll<00:00:08.580> show<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.849> three<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.450> first<00:00:09.690> one

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
three I'll show you three the first one

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.499 
three I'll show you three the first one
is<00:00:10.080> called<00:00:10.380> double<00:00:10.679> leg<00:00:11.010> hops<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:12.059> second<00:00:12.420> one

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
is called double leg hops the second one

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.209 
is called double leg hops the second one
is<00:00:12.660> called<00:00:12.750> single<00:00:13.290> leg<00:00:13.440> hops<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.070> then<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
is called single leg hops and then the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.310 
is called single leg hops and then the
third<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.639> called<00:00:14.790> lunges<00:00:15.450> now<00:00:15.900> double

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
third one is called lunges now double

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.859 
third one is called lunges now double
leg<00:00:16.470> hops<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.190> single<00:00:17.850> leg<00:00:18.000> hops<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.510> pretty

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
leg hops and single leg hops just pretty

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.630 
leg hops and single leg hops just pretty
much<00:00:19.140> you're<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.560> simply<00:00:19.800> building

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
much you're just simply building

of cardio you know you're using a lot of
speed<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> agility<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:35.190> biometrics<00:00:36.120> are

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
speed and agility but biometrics are

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.240 
speed and agility but biometrics are
simply<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.719> build<00:00:36.930> power<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> load<00:00:38.040> your

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the way up the flight of stairs one leg

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.060 
the way up the flight of stairs one leg
and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.670> walk<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.900> down<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:25.950> go

and then walk it back down and then go

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.700 
and then walk it back down and then go
up<00:01:26.250> again<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.150> other<00:01:27.330> leg<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.470> you're

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
up again the other leg so as you're

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
up again the other leg so as you're
first<00:01:28.950> starting<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> might<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:30.000> able<00:01:30.060> to

first starting you might not be able to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.359 
first starting you might not be able to
make<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.750> way<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.220> get

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
make it all the way up but as you get

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
make it all the way up but as you get
stronger<00:01:32.700> you're<00:01:33.060> building<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.659> stamina

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
stronger you're building up that stamina

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
stronger you're building up that stamina
you<00:01:34.500> should<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.799> able<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> make<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you should be able to make it all the
