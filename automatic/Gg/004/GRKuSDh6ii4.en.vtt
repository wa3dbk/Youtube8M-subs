being<00:00:01.469> completely<00:00:01.890> honest<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.340> never<00:00:02.629> had

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
being completely honest I never had

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.680 
being completely honest I never had
support<00:00:04.049> from<00:00:04.170> his<00:00:04.319> side<00:00:04.529> so<00:00:05.210> I've<00:00:06.210> got<00:00:06.480> you

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
support from his side so I've got you

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.780 
support from his side so I've got you
know<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> lot<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.080> support<00:00:07.470> from<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.740> team<00:00:07.919> and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
know a lot of support from the team and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.490 
know a lot of support from the team and
I<00:00:08.880> think<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.450> team<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.660> supporting<00:00:10.170> both<00:00:10.320> of

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
I think the team is supporting both of

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.390 
I think the team is supporting both of
us<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.040> same<00:00:11.250> way<00:00:11.929> but<00:00:13.099> you<00:00:14.099> know<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.370> terms<00:00:14.400> of

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
us the same way but you know in terms of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.470 
us the same way but you know in terms of
relationship<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.520> mark<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.880> respect<00:00:18.240> him<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.449> lot

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
relationship to mark I respect him a lot

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.260 
relationship to mark I respect him a lot
as<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> racing<00:00:19.109> driver<00:00:19.850> but<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:21.150> there

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
as a racing driver but I think there

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.269 
as a racing driver but I think there
were<00:00:21.390> more<00:00:21.750> than<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.080> occasion<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> part

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
employees and he's leading the team so I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
employees and he's leading the team so I
think<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:50.009> any<00:01:50.159> other
