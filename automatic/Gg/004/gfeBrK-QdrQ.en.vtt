00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello and the comfort is not like jesse 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.109
 since my barbar image to the in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.769
 surely we do not know this form yet 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.440
 this is the group picture for 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.960
 prototypical ball for a so-called 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.300
 the just in the beta for a stir 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.900
 that he was offered here 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.910
 the 70 so crackles and in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.039
 Combination with the male you see 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.599
 the exploding hands are the new ones 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.980
 human being this position enormous and 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 in addition to this with the ball can be 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.500
 that really great play completely without 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.140
 ccs without tipping over as it does too 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 just had a really good mood 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 Together the models tested that was 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.829
 just the hammer and that simple 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 because of the reason then becomes constantly 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.329
 demanded that it is always the goal 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.760
 to build big groups as much as possible 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 with the harpoon you can always 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.039
 clean again attract new mops and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.500
 exploding end propagate 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 always on and on so if that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 whole if you do that now, for example 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.790
 time to date in the strongest zierer 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.500
 teams played with 3 x men plays 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.119
 Of course, that's all very much the case 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.520
 very violent but let's go 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.979
 the talents as you see we have here 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.740
 starts with blood just pulled out of the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.270
 reason there must be a bit against 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.490
 Pain is very important to suppress 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.830
 rest one for all so we ours 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.299
 group members just weapons that the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.460
 less harm then suffer 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.990
 stamp with cern and smash that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.780
 we just from a larger radius 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.240
 opponents contracting occupation 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.610
 unsettle need good regeneration 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.009
 and also with it the opponents 30 percent 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.869
 to beat more slowly that also makes 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.909
 then spear a significant difference 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.189
 the forebears with harpoon as before 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.490
 said again and again new box 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.380
 pull in and around the biggest ones 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.299
 the largest possible groups with it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.610
 build and then cry of course 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.680
 with vital hike just around the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.619
 dodge and so on again 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.899
 Push our allies with it 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.200
 do not over- collect the match and 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.670
 serve something to support nerves 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.030
 made of steel and relentless in the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.550
 passive skills as well as weapons master 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.230
 and of course superstition and subtle 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.940
 to take out and reduce the match 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.459
 after the whole slaughter and the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 talents the men so needed the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.690
 supports we look away now 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.060
 Of course, filled up to the required 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.090
 items in cannes ice cubes very important 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.430
 the proud rows with aching back 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.040
 Keep six seconds longer than you see 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.540
 we have pain with us 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.319
 one means for all goes for the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.720
 entire group 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.180
 that is, if we keep doing it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.489
 eleven seconds were now with the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.540
 cooldown is also constantly going through 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.640
 our obsidian re on again 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.070
 reduced and thus it is almost 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.620
 possible that throughout the entire 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.690
 matches or even throughout 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.959
 always struggling to maintain that 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.989
 means the whole group receives 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.420
 Constant less damage after that 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.160
 ring of royal point de morning 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.580
 yes, of course, and 2 went out and 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.590
 so we get the full foursome bonus from 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.840
 black sun set that means so 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.239
 we are also immune to that 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.220
 Soil effects so shame 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.220
 supplied melted that is quite complete 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.720
 important because retrieving 50plus does that 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.030
 already hurt so much but we can 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.160
 just stay in it then have 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.560
 we add 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.049
 in addition to that arise and indeed 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.950
 what makes the additionally immune against 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.930
 fire damage 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.269
 that's important because that's the way it is 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.459
 otherwise blue song airbags with fire 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.010
 chains just mean the end in the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.930
 higher weight so a necklace with 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.780
 is an additional immunity it 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.390
 now I would fire or frost you 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.880
 still very strong applied to the heart 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.790
 purely from it TAFFENÂ® ago that you can 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.430
 Otherwise, not at all against refueling 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.700
 and we still have a melting furnace 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.280
 I actually say that to the weapons slot 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.260
 we need one now 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.390
 but I have not yet slowness 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.100
 found but if he should find the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.109
 be alert when you see 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.180
 You have a chance to make a holy stop 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.820
 we do not know it works sacred 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.400
 einkehr is a talent is an award on 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.900
 floor set and the trainer holds 55 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.500
 percent less harm 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.220
 and because of the winter so now 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.940
 painting already 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.440
 we do a lot of swirl hits 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.990
 and every hit has a chance 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.060
 to act practically this stop 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.919
 to lay the circle on the ground and to me 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.810
 to protect our allies 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.539
 We also have an obolus 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.729
 ring also has this effect but 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.039
 running circle to put on the ground when he 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.710
 Of course then monk stands in it and 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.320
 then his hand explodes makes that 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.030
 another 35 to 40 percent more 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.720
 hurt how good the 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.900
 has rolled out something else we have 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.639
 still a certain time more precisely in the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.850
 Fourth bonus because that's very important 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.979
 so each time reduced damage 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.600
 Contribute that means in the rifts 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.010
 windows on the high levels goes 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.840
 you should not even stand 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.139
 stay because then you lose of course 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.970
 which does 40 less harm and does that 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.889
 guaranteed to be noticeable 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.539
 otherwise an ears chain for 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.220
 less rent harm and still the 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.930
 Raufbolde very important because of the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.620
 cabin or stamping and zernig points 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.320
 that's it 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.090
 so if you do this, this 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.160
 talents are all pulled in mops 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.660
 they get more harm and extra 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.620
 we still have the possibility with the 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.270
 harpoon with the spear of the forehead as ab 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.370
 without that, that means everything we do 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.949
 getting caught can be very forced here 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.470
 have seen and that means again 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.510
 that automatically also the raufbold poor 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.940
 that seemed to mean that he was 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.159
 the opponents just suffer a certain 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.949
 percentage more harm to participate 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.300
 your allies hurt more 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.830
 that is of course in the support of 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.260
 Most importantly, roll a little bit 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.320
 pull and make sure yours 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.099
 allied as much harm as only 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.800
 make possible 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:15.720
 I think that's it with mine 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.550
 page if there are questions with that 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.220
 Comment not so potter applies this 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.930
 not for everyone the group too 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.610
 if you do not want the amount of 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.300
 is a player but believe me 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.699
 it's especially in the handle then on 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.010
 70 plus resp 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.539
 if you're 60 plus that should be with now 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.090
 every group in every constellation 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.620
 be possible 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.570
 then it makes you really moody 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.669
 if you are against really tough opponents 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.010
 did not just fight it all away 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.290
 drives but should nevertheless not for 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.460
 you see, you see the good 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.580
 old bible winz baak 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.190
 take a look over and take a bath 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.260
 So scared the fastest so easy 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.240
 practically stir and only briefly 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.580
 stay for the last years and 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.130
 otherwise as always and as always against 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.419
 end of the video thanks for seeing 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.919
 Do not forget a thumb to me 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.280
 leave and see you next time 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.280
 times
