00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
I've got ptosis splinter good board for

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.740 
I've got ptosis splinter good board for
it<00:00:07.919> perfect<00:00:08.429> kick<00:00:08.580> tails<00:00:08.820> anymore<00:00:09.090> did<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.570> go

probably<00:00:33.760> learn<00:00:33.910> three<00:00:34.540> tricks<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:35.620> three

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
probably learn three tricks the three

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.990 
probably learn three tricks the three
tricks<00:00:36.130> you<00:00:36.220> should<00:00:36.370> learn<00:00:36.460> before<00:00:36.640> doing

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
tricks you should learn before doing

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.650 
tricks you should learn before doing
this<00:00:37.120> trick<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.630> a<00:00:38.020> big<00:00:38.770> spin<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.489> like<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.360> 180

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
felt like half gas but I don't think

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.710 
felt like half gas but I don't think
that's<00:00:45.640> what<00:00:45.790> it's<00:00:45.910> called<00:00:45.970> a<00:00:46.180> car<00:00:46.360> like<00:00:46.510> this

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
get all four off and just don't want to

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.250 
get all four off and just don't want to
eat<00:00:50.440> pivot<00:00:51.059> those<00:00:52.059> three<00:00:52.330> tricks<00:00:52.750> down<00:00:52.960> you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
eat pivot those three tricks down you

eat pivot those three tricks down you
can<00:00:53.410> advance<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:54.100> pole<00:00:54.340> yeah<00:00:54.580> but<00:00:54.790> now<00:00:54.879> I'm

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
can advance the pole yeah but now I'm

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.369 
can advance the pole yeah but now I'm
going<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.150> teach<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:55.510> how<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.750> do<00:00:55.930> that<00:00:56.110> ready

necklace okay
the<00:00:59.890> pole<00:01:00.160> cap<00:01:00.430> is<00:01:00.729> kind<00:01:00.970> of<00:01:01.030> like<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.210> 180<00:01:01.479> pivot

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.480 

to<00:01:14.860> do<00:01:14.979> that<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.620> get<00:01:17.799> your<00:01:17.979> wheels<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.340> do

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
to do that but to get your wheels to do

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.730 
to do that but to get your wheels to do
that<00:01:18.670> after<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.630> don't<00:01:19.840> like<00:01:20.080> your<00:01:20.409> first

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
that after you don't like your first

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.030 
that after you don't like your first
maybe<00:01:21.220> 150<00:01:21.970> degrees<00:01:22.270> right<00:01:22.540> there<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.710> really

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
maybe 150 degrees right there you really

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.969 
maybe 150 degrees right there you really
want<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.430> put<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.700> lot<00:01:25.120> of<00:01:25.270> pressure<00:01:25.450> on<00:01:25.979> your

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
want to put a lot of pressure on your

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.490 
want to put a lot of pressure on your
toe<00:01:27.190> so<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.000> board<00:01:28.210> kicks<00:01:28.450> up<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:29.170> when<00:01:29.409> you

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
toe so the board kicks up and when you

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
toe so the board kicks up and when you
do<00:01:29.619> that<00:01:29.790> you're<00:01:30.790> feel<00:01:31.180> your<00:01:31.690> right<00:01:31.840> heel

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
do that you're feel your right heel

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.630 
do that you're feel your right heel
usually<00:01:34.060> push<00:01:34.870> this<00:01:35.080> I<00:01:35.380> like<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.130> big<00:01:36.340> spin

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
usually push this I like in a big spin

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.470 
usually push this I like in a big spin
to<00:01:37.240> make<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.540> board<00:01:37.810> move<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.820> while<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.360> do

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
to make the board move and while you do

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.860 
to make the board move and while you do
that<00:01:44.370> your<00:01:45.370> body<00:01:45.760> just<00:01:45.970> kind<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.330> follows<00:01:46.660> with

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
that your body just kind of follows with

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.120 
that your body just kind of follows with
it<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.200> that's<00:01:53.470> pretty<00:01:53.680> much<00:01:53.920> how<00:01:54.100> you

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
it to it so that's pretty much how you

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.270 
it to it so that's pretty much how you
do<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.940> when<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.450> first<00:01:55.660> start<00:01:56.280> you're

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
do it and when you first start you're

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.420 
do it and when you first start you're
pivoting<00:01:57.730> point<00:01:58.150> might<00:01:58.570> take<00:01:58.870> longer<00:01:59.140> like<00:02:00.070> it

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
pivoting point might take longer like it

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.160 
pivoting point might take longer like it
might<00:02:00.640> go<00:02:00.670> further

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
might go further

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.960 
might go further
then<00:02:02.860> when<00:02:03.040> they're<00:02:03.189> getting<00:02:03.310> better<00:02:03.610> at<00:02:03.759> it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
then when they're getting better at it

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.789 
then when they're getting better at it
your<00:02:04.180> 15<00:02:04.390> foot<00:02:04.689> doesn't<00:02:04.869> go<00:02:05.049> as<00:02:05.110> far<00:02:05.320> like<00:02:05.530> I

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
your 15 foot doesn't go as far like I

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.070 
your 15 foot doesn't go as far like I
usually<00:02:06.220> pop<00:02:06.580> mine<00:02:06.820> up<00:02:07.000> like<00:02:07.210> at<00:02:07.330> 90<00:02:07.509> degrees

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
usually pop mine up like at 90 degrees

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.440 
usually pop mine up like at 90 degrees
right<00:02:08.259> there<00:02:08.580> well<00:02:09.580> when<00:02:10.000> you're<00:02:10.149> just

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
right there well when you're just

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.540 
right there well when you're just
starting<00:02:10.750> usually<00:02:11.230> pop<00:02:11.410> yours<00:02:11.590> up<00:02:11.680> like<00:02:11.860> 150

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
starting usually pop yours up like 150

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.770 
starting usually pop yours up like 150
degrees<00:02:13.110> 180<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.319> have<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.800> done<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.069> but

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
degrees 180 I have not done that but

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.110 
degrees 180 I have not done that but
it's<00:02:16.780> still<00:02:16.900> doable<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:18.489> should<00:02:18.640> never<00:02:18.760> put<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
it's still doable you should never put a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.010 
it's still doable you should never put a
lot<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.540> pressure<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:22.180> left<00:02:22.420> foot<00:02:22.690> back
