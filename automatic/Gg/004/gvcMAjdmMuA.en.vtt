00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
well what Ikon has done is they've

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.750 
well what Ikon has done is they've
injected<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.470> little<00:02:16.709> bit<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.980> their<00:02:17.370> flavour

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760

into the adventure tree market so it's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.690 
into the adventure tree market so it's
definitely<00:02:19.860> more<00:02:20.040> aggressive<00:02:20.129> than<00:02:20.550> we've

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
definitely more aggressive than we've

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.280 
definitely more aggressive than we've
seen<00:02:20.730> pretty<00:02:21.269> much<00:02:21.420> from<00:02:21.569> any<00:02:21.720> other<00:02:21.930> brand

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290

adapted<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.800> little<00:02:28.980> bit<00:02:29.069> thinner<00:02:29.370> so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
adapted it it's a little bit thinner so

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.670 
adapted it it's a little bit thinner so
it's<00:02:29.910> gonna<00:02:30.000> allow<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:30.840> more<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.560> an

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
of that but it also uses tech mesh

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
shoulders better flexibility it's also

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.220

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
well it uses another piece of rubber but

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.099 
well it uses another piece of rubber but
the<00:04:11.790> rubber<00:04:12.000> components<00:04:12.599> are<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> little<00:04:12.989> bit

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
the rubber components are a little bit

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.800 
the rubber components are a little bit
funky<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.709> my<00:04:13.859> opinion<00:04:14.310> also<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.180> styling<00:04:15.690> we

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
funky in my opinion also the styling we

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.060 
funky in my opinion also the styling we
said<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.079> was<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.200> great<00:04:16.440> thing<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:16.950> could

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
said it was a great thing but it could

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.259 
said it was a great thing but it could
also<00:04:17.190> be<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.400> bad<00:04:17.609> thing<00:04:17.789> if<00:04:17.940> it's<00:04:18.090> too

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
also be a bad thing if it's too

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.670 
also be a bad thing if it's too
aggressive<00:04:18.450> for<00:04:18.840> some<00:04:18.989> riders<00:04:19.200> it's

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
aggressive for some riders it's

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.839 
aggressive for some riders it's
obviously<00:04:20.010> going<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.250> turn<00:04:20.400> them<00:04:20.579> away<00:04:20.700> so

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.130 
obviously going to turn them away so
it's<00:04:21.090> going<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.299> be<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.450> love-hate<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.019> my

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140
