00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.100
 Oh 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.760
 where the anxious mentor this afternoon 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.620
 on the can on the other hand will have pleasure to 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.780
 all internally sunny releases it makes 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.730
 hot it is already 25 to 26 degrees 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.260
 in the water a bench 16 degrees hopscotch 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.030
 is coming down full of 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.879
 flakes at 14:10 the coefficients are 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.830
 the 73 the offshore wind but turns it 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.170
 passes with a south east sector sometimes 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.010
 a little younes a reinforcement of small 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.629
 races to one of them he got a little 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.739
 reinforced the body of water is a little bit 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.450
 wrinkled but still good 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.790
 clean with magical colors 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.370
 there are seven doubles of average to 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.160
 long 9 seconds two periods where the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.390
 andrÃ© orientated west south west which is 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.829
 clean and that is at the address for a 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.720
 breaking now regular to the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.520
 height of 80 cm to beat and on 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.930
 series enough spaced as in track 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.610
 the one that arrives there is a meter to a 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.460
 meter twenty with lamari who is 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.570
 gone down it's a little less good of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.300
 waves as the most goes back to the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.649
 edge a bit more in quick hollow spike of 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.290
 from time to time there are some and 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.240
 that happens is where there is most 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.830
 surfers and to the wide capes that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.060
 starts to break a little bit but 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.590
 only on the biggest series 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.090
 so it's not obvious there is still 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.890
 good jokes to score in the heap 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.990
 there is the fire of the action there is no 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.610
 bad weather with water good conditions 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.600
 in general evolution for the rest of the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.220
 day seeing her something is 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600
 still on the rise at 2 meters 30 and 7 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.020
 seconds the swell will continue to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.330
 swell 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.090
 the wind should turn pretty fast 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 in the early afternoon not an hour but 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.959
 a little after the change of tide at 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.759
 all the shots so we wait at 13h 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.200
 give our name with a south law 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.899
 west 9 second period wind 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.399
 south / south east of beaufort and on the 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.800
 shot of 14 hours he should turn a 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.360
 swing southwest mans and to 17 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.369
 hours we will have a clear setback with a 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.349
 West / Southwest Second Period Tablecloth 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.880
 and a wind that turns completely after 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.619
 West North West in two strong words 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.700
 in all cases there is surfing and 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.250
 action all day 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.119
 we keep you informed on the 08 92 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.890

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.450
 hours the good day the thinker
