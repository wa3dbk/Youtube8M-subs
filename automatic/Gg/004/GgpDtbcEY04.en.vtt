00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.400 
and go and that's according to Porsche
but<00:01:53.790> I've<00:01:54.540> been<00:01:54.690> driving<00:01:54.960> around<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.230> thing

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
but I've been driving around this thing

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.870 
but I've been driving around this thing
for<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.680> best<00:01:55.800> part<00:01:56.010> of<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> week<00:01:56.310> now<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
for the best part of a week now and I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.480 
for the best part of a week now and I
regularly<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.750> 30<00:01:58.020> mpg<00:01:58.440> out<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.130> it's

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
regularly see 30 mpg out of and it's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.060 
regularly see 30 mpg out of and it's
quite<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.850> young<00:01:59.940> engine<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.450> only<00:02:00.690> got<00:02:01.070> 2,400

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
quite a young engine is only got 2,400

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
quite a young engine is only got 2,400
miles<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:02.960> when<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.020> loosens<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
miles on it so when it loosens up it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.980 
miles on it so when it loosens up it
might<00:02:04.890> actually<00:02:05.130> manage<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:06.150> with<00:02:06.690> some

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
might actually manage that with some

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.910 
might actually manage that with some
aplomb

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.319 

let's<00:02:13.920> start<00:02:14.159> with<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> big<00:02:14.549> numbers<00:02:14.730> it's

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
let's start with the big numbers it's

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.559 
let's start with the big numbers it's
got<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> 3.4<00:02:16.290> liter<00:02:16.620> flat<00:02:16.889> 6<00:02:17.189> engine<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:18.420> got

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
got a 3.4 liter flat 6 engine it's got

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.949 
got a 3.4 liter flat 6 engine it's got
325<00:02:19.499> brake<00:02:20.010> horsepower<00:02:20.519> 0<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.030> 62<00:02:21.359> happens<00:02:21.840> in

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
325 brake horsepower 0 to 62 happens in

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.479 
325 brake horsepower 0 to 62 happens in
5<00:02:22.170> seconds<00:02:22.590> dead<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.099> top<00:02:23.340> speed<00:02:23.519> is<00:02:24.109> 175

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
5 seconds dead and it's top speed is 175

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.589 
5 seconds dead and it's top speed is 175
miles<00:02:26.489> an<00:02:26.730> hour<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.370> it's<00:02:29.519> pretty<00:02:29.760> brisk<00:02:30.269> then

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
miles an hour so it's pretty brisk then

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.539 
miles an hour so it's pretty brisk then
but<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.200> big<00:02:31.379> question<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:31.799> what<00:02:32.069> makes<00:02:32.340> this

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
but the big question is what makes this

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.259 
but the big question is what makes this
better<00:02:33.060> than<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.870> Boxster<00:02:35.000> quite<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> few

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
better than the Boxster quite a few

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.879 
better than the Boxster quite a few
things<00:02:36.569> actually<00:02:38.719> you<00:02:39.719> see<00:02:40.109> that<00:02:40.500> little<00:02:40.709> bit

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
things actually you see that little bit

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.949 
things actually you see that little bit
of<00:02:40.919> extra<00:02:41.099> power<00:02:41.639> it<00:02:42.299> gives<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.659> a<00:02:42.689> little<00:02:42.840> bit

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
of extra power it gives you a little bit

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.959 
of extra power it gives you a little bit
more<00:02:43.139> go<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.950> makes<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.280> whole<00:02:44.400> car<00:02:44.669> feel

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
more go and it makes the whole car feel

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.879 
more go and it makes the whole car feel
a<00:02:45.120> little<00:02:45.389> bit<00:02:45.540> more<00:02:45.719> complete<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:49.500> gearbox

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
a little bit more complete the gearbox

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.979 
a little bit more complete the gearbox
itself<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.549> great<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.209> nice<00:02:51.359> short<00:02:51.719> shift

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
itself is great it's nice short shift

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.349 
itself is great it's nice short shift
very<00:02:52.260> direct<00:02:52.680> brilliant<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:53.669> the<00:02:53.819> clutch<00:02:54.120> is

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
very direct brilliant but the clutch is

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.080 
very direct brilliant but the clutch is
a<00:02:54.419> little<00:02:54.900> bit<00:02:55.139> weird<00:02:55.799> it's<00:02:56.370> easy<00:02:56.669> enough<00:02:56.849> to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
a little bit weird it's easy enough to

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.709 
a little bit weird it's easy enough to
depress<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:58.430> when<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.519> go<00:02:59.669> to<00:02:59.730> lift<00:03:00.090> off<00:03:00.389> you

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
depress but when you go to lift off you

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.750 
depress but when you go to lift off you
get<00:03:00.900> half<00:03:01.169> way<00:03:01.199> up<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.680> then<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.949> throws<00:03:02.099> your

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
get half way up and then it throws your

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.250 
get half way up and then it throws your
foot<00:03:02.969> away<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.900> some<00:03:04.049> kind<00:03:04.230> of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
foot away like some kind of

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.849 
foot away like some kind of
spring-loaded<00:03:04.889> cannon<00:03:05.760> which<00:03:06.599> gets<00:03:07.469> quite

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
spring-loaded cannon which gets quite

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.300 
spring-loaded cannon which gets quite
annoying<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.750> stop-start<00:03:09.750> traffic<00:03:10.019> not<00:03:10.919> ideal

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
annoying in stop-start traffic not ideal

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.740 
annoying in stop-start traffic not ideal
it's<00:03:11.430> one<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.579> those<00:03:11.639> things<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:11.879> may<00:03:12.419> sort

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
it's one of those things that may sort

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.899 
it's one of those things that may sort
itself<00:03:13.049> out<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.530> car<00:03:13.739> gets<00:03:13.889> older<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.639> you

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
itself out as the car gets older or you

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.059 
itself out as the car gets older or you
may<00:03:15.060> have<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.389> tinker<00:03:15.719> it<00:03:15.870> either<00:03:16.199> way<00:03:16.560> bit

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
may have to tinker it either way bit

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.360 
may have to tinker it either way bit
strange

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.129 

one<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.459> my<00:03:20.609> absolute<00:03:20.729> highlights<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.900> car

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
one of my absolute highlights this car

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.349 
one of my absolute highlights this car
isn't<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.829> handling<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.549> isn't<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.030> power

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
isn't the handling it isn't the power

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.179 
isn't the handling it isn't the power
itself<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.959> power<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.290> wonderful<00:03:25.859> always

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
itself the power is wonderful always

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.080 
itself the power is wonderful always
lock<00:03:26.609> power<00:03:26.879> that's<00:03:27.569> always<00:03:27.870> pretty<00:03:28.349> but<00:03:29.090> it's

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
lock power that's always pretty but it's

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.210 
lock power that's always pretty but it's
the<00:03:30.359> noise<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:31.259> thing<00:03:31.500> produces<00:03:32.040> got

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the noise that this thing produces got

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.449 
the noise that this thing produces got
that<00:03:32.340> hollow<00:03:33.409> 6-cylinder<00:03:34.409> Porsche<00:03:35.069> engine

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
that hollow 6-cylinder Porsche engine

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.490 
that hollow 6-cylinder Porsche engine
how<00:03:35.699> it<00:03:36.000> sounds<00:03:36.269> like<00:03:36.389> Chewbacca<00:03:36.659> playing<00:03:37.319> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
how it sounds like Chewbacca playing the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.890 
how it sounds like Chewbacca playing the
didgeridoo<00:03:37.819> it's

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
didgeridoo it's

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.869 
didgeridoo it's
sometimes<00:03:40.680> things<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:41.010> absolutely<00:03:41.430> need<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
sometimes things I absolutely need the

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.900 
sometimes things I absolutely need the
door<00:03:42.239> about<00:03:43.050> cars<00:03:43.379> like<00:03:43.590> this<00:03:43.910> especially

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
door about cars like this especially

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.210 
door about cars like this especially
this<00:03:45.300> one<00:03:45.569> because<00:03:45.629> it's<00:03:46.140> mid-engine<00:03:46.739> that

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
this one because it's mid-engine that

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.339 
this one because it's mid-engine that
noise<00:03:47.519> comes<00:03:48.239> from<00:03:48.330> right<00:03:48.599> behind<00:03:48.959> your<00:03:49.170> head

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349

as<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:50.010> will<00:03:50.160> now<00:03:50.280> demonstrate

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.840 

so<00:04:01.290> why<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.530> sudden<00:04:01.830> change<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.280> heart<00:04:02.340> just

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
so why the sudden change of heart just

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.580 
so why the sudden change of heart just
what<00:04:03.000> makes<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.360> caiman<00:04:03.780> an<00:04:03.870> overall<00:04:04.260> better

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
what makes the caiman an overall better

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.670 
what makes the caiman an overall better
car<00:04:05.010> than<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.340> Boxster<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.820> 911<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:07.260> Boxster

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
better I was wrong about the box of

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.360 
better I was wrong about the box of
being<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.870> best<00:05:13.020> car<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:13.830> Porsche<00:05:14.130> makes

and I'm perfectly happy to admit that

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.860

because<00:05:16.140> if<00:05:16.440> Porsche<00:05:16.890> keeps<00:05:17.760> making<00:05:18.030> stalkers

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
because if Porsche keeps making stalkers
