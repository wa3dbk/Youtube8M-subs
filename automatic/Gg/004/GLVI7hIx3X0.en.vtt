level<00:00:58.570> was<00:00:58.690> just<00:00:59.079> down<00:00:59.470> and<00:00:59.829> I<00:00:59.920> was<00:01:00.070> always

tired<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:01.530> first<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.739> thought<00:01:02.920> it's<00:01:03.160> only

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
tired and first I thought it's only

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.609 
tired and first I thought it's only
because<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.790> over<00:01:04.089> exercised<00:01:04.600> but<00:01:05.470> then<00:01:05.590> I

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
because I over exercised but then I

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.260 
because I over exercised but then I
slowed<00:01:05.979> down<00:01:06.130> my<00:01:06.310> exercise<00:01:06.729> but<00:01:06.940> it's<00:01:07.090> still

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
slowed down my exercise but it's still

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.170 
slowed down my exercise but it's still
what<00:01:07.479> didn't<00:01:07.810> change<00:01:08.020> much<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.670> mean<00:01:09.850> it's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
what didn't change much and I mean it's

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.810 
what didn't change much and I mean it's
I<00:01:10.540> think<00:01:11.229> it's<00:01:11.470> true<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.070> saying<00:01:12.400> says

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
I think it's true that is a saying says

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.180 
I think it's true that is a saying says
you<00:01:13.150> you<00:01:13.360> are<00:01:13.540> what<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.900> eat<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.350> I'm<00:01:15.040> very

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
to try it's only five days and if it

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.680 
to try it's only five days and if it
works<00:01:35.710> it's<00:01:36.100> fine<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.520> doesn't<00:01:36.550> work<00:01:37.000> I<00:01:37.210> even
