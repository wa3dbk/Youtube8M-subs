extra<00:00:15.089> ass<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:15.900> I'm<00:00:15.990> not<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.320> say

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
extra ass on it but I'm not going to say

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.760 
extra ass on it but I'm not going to say
it<00:00:16.500> again<00:00:16.590> without<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.359> because<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.770> don't

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
it again without this because I don't

it again without this because I don't
think<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.160> will<00:00:20.250> go<00:00:20.369> down<00:00:20.550> too<00:00:20.760> well<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.180> these

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
tree the trunk some other little bits

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.979 
tree the trunk some other little bits
and<00:01:00.030> bobs<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.750> hang<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.350> tree

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
and bobs that can hang off your tree

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.000 
and bobs that can hang off your tree
we'll<00:01:03.989> figure<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.739> whenever

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
we'll figure out what they are whenever

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.719 
we'll figure out what they are whenever
I<00:01:05.070> build<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.830> Gihon<00:01:07.830> table<00:01:08.220> tree<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I build it we have Gihon table tree and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.399 
I build it we have Gihon table tree and
there's<00:01:08.970> two<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:09.270> bases<00:01:09.720> basically<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.260> this

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
there's two more bases basically in this

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.039 
there's two more bases basically in this
box<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.950> three<00:01:11.220> trees<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.090> wood<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.330 

plant<00:01:16.049> their<00:01:16.170> bets<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> trees<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.250> we

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
plant their bets for the trees here we

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.210 
plant their bets for the trees here we
have<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.110> believes<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.040> is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
have the believes the can of a this is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.999 
have the believes the can of a this is
the<00:01:20.340> underside<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.650> underside

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the underside of them well the underside

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.950 
the underside of them well the underside
on<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> upper<00:01:23.580> side<00:01:23.759> did<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.509> seem<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> have

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
on the upper side did don't seem to have

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
on the upper side did don't seem to have
us<00:01:25.080> yet

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
us yet

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.270 
us yet
I<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.299> set<00:01:27.689> pattern<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> some<00:01:29.100> more

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
I see it set pattern for it some more

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.210 
I see it set pattern for it some more
upper<00:01:29.759> branches<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.869> them<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> more

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
upper branches on them it's a more

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.940 
upper branches on them it's a more
canopy<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:32.909> over<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> place<00:01:33.540> Canha<00:01:34.380> bagian

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
canopy all over the place Canha bagian

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.460 
canopy all over the place Canha bagian
and<00:01:35.130> upper<00:01:35.909> branches<00:01:36.360> all<00:01:36.689> over<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> show

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and upper branches all over the show

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.510 
and upper branches all over the show
canopy<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.490> our<00:01:38.670> branches<00:01:39.119> canopy<00:01:40.520> there's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
canopy of our branches canopy there's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060 
canopy of our branches canopy there's
our<00:01:41.640> next<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.210> CM<00:01:42.710> yeah<00:01:43.710> we're<00:01:43.979> getting

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
our next one the CM yeah we're getting

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.170 
our next one the CM yeah we're getting
lower<00:01:44.340> box<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.470> canopy<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
lower box of the canopy of the of the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.080 
lower box of the canopy of the of the
leaves<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.780> whatnot<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.610> upper<00:01:50.610> branches

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
leaves and whatnot and upper branches

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.700 
leaves and whatnot and upper branches
and<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:53.479> looks<00:01:54.479> pretty<00:01:55.350> much<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> same

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and so on looks pretty much the same

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
and so on looks pretty much the same
from<00:01:56.070> both<00:01:56.189> sides<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.759> say<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.299> get

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
from both sides have to say do you get

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.950 
from both sides have to say do you get
to<00:01:57.570> see<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:59.219> smaller<00:02:00.090> bits<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
to see some of the that smaller bits the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.649 
to see some of the that smaller bits the
smaller<00:02:01.320> branches<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.110> our<00:02:04.350> base

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
smaller branches and we have our base

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.430 
smaller branches and we have our base
that<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.780> put<00:02:06.990> your<00:02:07.079> wood<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:09.259> fighting<00:02:10.259> guys

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that you put your wood on fighting guys

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.010 
that you put your wood on fighting guys
through<00:02:10.709> your<00:02:11.039> sports<00:02:11.400> obviously<00:02:11.840> one<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
through your sports obviously one of the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.390 
through your sports obviously one of the
things<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
things and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.270 
things and
it's<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> huge<00:02:15.690> issue<00:02:15.900> I'd<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:17.070> these

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
it's not a huge issue I'd like these

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.510 
it's not a huge issue I'd like these
things<00:02:17.840> designed<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.320> yes<00:02:20.190> they<00:02:20.370> are<00:02:20.400> a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
things designed that yes they are a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.030 
things designed that yes they are a
circle<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.210> they<00:02:21.420> are<00:02:21.570> sort<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.050> they<00:02:22.860> keep

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
circle but they are sort of they keep

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.830 
circle but they are sort of they keep
the<00:02:23.190> pattern<00:02:23.400> underneath<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.270> when<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.660> have

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
the pattern underneath so when you have

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.740 
the pattern underneath so when you have
to<00:02:24.990> take<00:02:25.170> your<00:02:25.320> tree<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.790> still<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
to take your tree out you still have the

people<00:04:35.330> get<00:04:35.510> it<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.870> use<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.200> BS<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.710> use<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
people get it to use the BS and use the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.640 
people get it to use the BS and use the
empty<00:04:37.430> tree<00:04:37.760> trunks<00:04:38.210> for<00:04:38.720> convenience<00:04:39.290> the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
empty tree trunks for convenience the

empty tree trunks for convenience the
trees<00:04:39.920> left<00:04:40.280> off<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:41.240> know<00:04:41.710> try<00:04:42.710> not<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.920> left

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
trees left off you know try not to left

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.980 
trees left off you know try not to left
them<00:04:43.190> by<00:04:43.250> their<00:04:43.370> branches<00:04:43.760> all<00:04:44.360> of<00:04:44.630> them<00:04:44.810> left

them by their branches all of them left
off<00:04:45.200> very<00:04:45.590> easily<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:46.400> get<00:04:46.550> these<00:04:46.670> other

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
off very easily you get these other

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.210 
off very easily you get these other
little<00:04:47.240> bits<00:04:47.600> of<00:04:47.960> pattern<00:04:48.440> around<00:04:48.530> I'll<00:04:49.160> just

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
little bits of pattern around I'll just

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.650 
little bits of pattern around I'll just
show<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.820> forest<00:04:50.120> from<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.330> different

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
show you the forest from the different

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.890 
show you the forest from the different
angles<00:04:51.020> you<00:04:52.120> get<00:04:53.120> these<00:04:53.270> other<00:04:53.450> little<00:04:53.690> bits

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
angles you get these other little bits

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.050 
angles you get these other little bits
that<00:04:54.140> goes<00:04:54.320> on<00:04:54.530> these<00:04:55.160> aren't<00:04:55.400> so<00:04:55.640> handy

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
that goes on these aren't so handy

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.520 
that goes on these aren't so handy
especially<00:04:56.120> if<00:04:56.510> you're<00:04:56.630> using<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:57.410> know

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
especially if you're using you know

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.440 
especially if you're using you know
rental<00:04:57.950> units<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.520> get<00:04:58.670> pasture<00:04:59.150> because<00:04:59.210> they

rental units to get pasture because they

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.060 
rental units to get pasture because they
don't<00:04:59.630> left<00:04:59.810> off<00:05:00.020> I've<00:05:00.290> juiced<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.770> stuff

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
don't left off I've juiced that stuff

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.720 
don't left off I've juiced that stuff
down<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:02.360> get<00:05:02.680> even<00:05:03.680> in<00:05:03.919> this<00:05:04.070> forest

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
down and you get even in this forest

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.580 
down and you get even in this forest
get<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.030> little<00:05:05.240> lantern<00:05:05.660> which<00:05:05.990> I<00:05:06.140> have<00:05:06.290> stuck

get a little lantern which I have stuck
in<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.430> middle<00:05:07.700> of<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.480> forest<00:05:08.750> just<00:05:09.169> because

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
in the middle of the forest just because

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.760 
in the middle of the forest just because
they<00:05:11.150> work<00:05:11.390> so<00:05:11.419> well<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:12.020> fantasy<00:05:12.440> battles

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
they work so well in fantasy battles

whenever you can your boxes we're seen I
like<00:05:30.740> them<00:05:30.919> guys<00:05:31.130> it<00:05:31.520> goes<00:05:31.760> together<00:05:32.030> easily

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
like them guys it goes together easily

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.990 
like them guys it goes together easily
enough<00:05:33.200> there's<00:05:33.530> no<00:05:33.650> issues<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.610> good<00:05:34.790> thing

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
points are underneath the canopy so you

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.120 
points are underneath the canopy so you

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
see the fact that might have squirt it

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.630 
see the fact that might have squirt it
too<00:05:42.440> much<00:05:42.620> glue<00:05:42.890> at<00:05:43.010> times<00:05:43.220> where<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:43.490> get

you<00:05:58.520> can<00:05:58.700> use<00:05:58.940> these<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.419> I<00:05:59.710> like<00:06:00.710> them<00:06:00.919> i

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
you can use these and I like them i

retreat's we're using the green board

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.890 
retreat's we're using the green board
because<00:06:05.060> i<00:06:05.120> think<00:06:05.180> if<00:06:05.419> these<00:06:05.540> were<00:06:05.750> nicely

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
because i think if these were nicely

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.120 
because i think if these were nicely
pinned<00:06:06.290> that<00:06:06.410> they<00:06:06.500> would<00:06:06.620> look<00:06:06.800> even<00:06:06.950> better

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
pinned that they would look even better

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.560 
pinned that they would look even better
and<00:06:07.550> they<00:06:08.030> have<00:06:08.240> that<00:06:08.600> all<00:06:10.360> nards

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570

sort of tree look off them as well the
trees<00:06:15.050> go<00:06:15.470> together<00:06:15.770> easy<00:06:15.979> enough<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.520> old
