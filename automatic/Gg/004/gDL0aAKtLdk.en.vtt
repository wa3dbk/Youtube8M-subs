even<00:03:45.599> have<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.959> much<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.500> big<00:03:46.739> difference

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
even have that much of a big difference

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.729 
even have that much of a big difference
for<00:03:47.400> example<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.120> gameplay<00:03:48.959> trailer<00:03:49.290> do<00:03:49.620> you

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739

for example a gameplay trailer do you
know<00:03:49.889> what<00:03:50.099> they<00:03:50.220> do<00:03:50.459> invest<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.389> actually

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
know what they do invest they actually

that<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.930> then<00:03:55.019> when<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:55.200> play<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.500> game<00:03:55.859> it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
that and then when you play the game it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.640 
that and then when you play the game it
more<00:03:56.700> or<00:03:56.910> less<00:03:57.090> looks<00:03:57.480> for<00:03:57.720> same<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.410> just

to<00:04:02.069> mute<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.280> video<00:04:02.519> because<00:04:03.060> your<00:04:03.299> analysis

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
to mute the video because your analysis

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.960
