00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
this is a flange tab that has a ski way

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.569 
this is a flange tab that has a ski way
with<00:04:06.489> no<00:04:06.730> set<00:04:07.269> screw<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.799> you<00:04:08.980> can<00:04:09.129> also<00:04:09.340> get

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
with no set screw and you can also get

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.839 
with no set screw and you can also get
this<00:04:09.849> this<00:04:10.299> is<00:04:10.569> a<00:04:11.099> pulley<00:04:12.099> with<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.430> set<00:04:12.819> screw

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.949 
this this is a pulley with a set screw
which<00:04:13.389> I<00:04:13.540> replaced<00:04:13.959> with<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.819> with<00:04:15.819> a<00:04:15.849> bolt<00:04:16.630> with

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
which I replaced with a with a bolt with

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.199 
which I replaced with a with a bolt with
a<00:04:16.989> thread<00:04:17.769> cut<00:04:18.039> in<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:18.639> that<00:04:18.789> I<00:04:18.820> can<00:04:19.030> get<00:04:19.150> to

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
a thread cut in it so that I can get to

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.620 
a thread cut in it so that I can get to
it<00:04:19.389> with<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.630> screwdriver<00:04:19.989> from<00:04:20.709> far<00:04:20.949> away<00:04:21.070> and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
it with a screwdriver from far away and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.210 
it with a screwdriver from far away and
this<00:04:22.630> one<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.900> have<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.050> drive<00:04:23.350> two<00:04:23.620> x<00:04:23.830> two<00:04:24.010> holes

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
this one I have to drive two x two holes

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.790 
this one I have to drive two x two holes
in<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:25.570> chose<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.020> hard<00:04:26.229> way<00:04:26.410> I'll<00:04:26.590> use

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
in it and I chose the hard way I'll use

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.740 
in it and I chose the hard way I'll use
this<00:04:26.979> one<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.550> took<00:04:27.789> a<00:04:27.820> half<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.300> hacksaw

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
this one and I took a half a hacksaw

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.689 
this one and I took a half a hacksaw
blade<00:04:29.110> put<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.070> through<00:04:30.190> here<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.520> cut<00:04:30.669> a

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
blade put it through here and cut a

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.610 
blade put it through here and cut a
keyway<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:31.570> is<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.780> key<00:04:31.960> way<00:04:32.139> with<00:04:32.320> a<00:04:32.349> set

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
keyway so this is a key way with a set

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.620 
keyway so this is a key way with a set
screw<00:04:32.650> which<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.820> best<00:04:34.030> but<00:04:34.300> it's<00:04:34.449> not

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
screw which is the best but it's not

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.900 
screw which is the best but it's not
necessary<00:04:35.229> this<00:04:36.009> one<00:04:36.190> here<00:04:36.370> will<00:04:36.520> slip<00:04:36.759> off

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
necessary this one here will slip off

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.980 
necessary this one here will slip off
and<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:37.410> actually<00:04:38.410> goes<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.710> way<00:04:38.949> and<00:04:39.990> this

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
and on actually goes this way and this

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.920 
and on actually goes this way and this
one<00:04:41.139> here<00:04:41.320> will<00:04:41.500> also<00:04:41.650> go<00:04:42.010> on<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.550> same<00:04:42.940> way

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.460 

like<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.139> so<00:04:47.800> those<00:04:48.310> are<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.550> options<00:04:49.470> you

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
like that so those are the options you

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.779 
like that so those are the options you
have<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.740> measure<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.280> distance<00:04:51.310> between

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
have to measure the distance between

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.980 
have to measure the distance between
here<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.659> top<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.990> casters

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
here and the top of the of the casters

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.909 
here and the top of the of the casters
and<00:04:56.229> for<00:04:57.159> this<00:04:57.280> one<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.699> ended<00:04:58.060> up<00:04:58.210> using<00:04:58.919> two

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
and for this one I ended up using two

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.120 
and for this one I ended up using two
pieces<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.340> plywood<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.650> first<00:05:02.889> thing<00:05:03.039> I

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
pieces of plywood and the first thing I

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.080 
pieces of plywood and the first thing I
did<00:05:03.340> was<00:05:03.460> I<00:05:03.610> drilled<00:05:05.190> my<00:05:06.190> sin<00:05:06.460> rings<00:05:06.699> put<00:05:06.940> my

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
did was I drilled my sin rings put my

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.850 
did was I drilled my sin rings put my
simmering<00:05:07.510> screws<00:05:07.810> through<00:05:07.990> this<00:05:08.139> through
