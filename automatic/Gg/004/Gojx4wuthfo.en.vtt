00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
first thing that should probably go is

first thing that should probably go is
the<00:00:15.570> anti<00:00:15.990> air<00:00:16.820> because<00:00:17.820> it's<00:00:18.000> preventing<00:00:18.390> me

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the anti air because it's preventing me

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.439 
the anti air because it's preventing me
from<00:00:18.480> getting<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> APC<00:00:19.730> as<00:00:20.730> well<00:00:21.060> as<00:00:21.180> this
