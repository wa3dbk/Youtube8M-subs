what<00:03:29.670> i<00:03:29.700> am<00:03:29.850> going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.180> do<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.450> want<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.630> say

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
what i am going to do is we want to say

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.680 
what i am going to do is we want to say
this<00:03:30.930> if<00:03:31.110> your<00:03:31.230> 100%<00:03:31.650> confirm<00:03:32.250> your<00:03:32.910> 100%<00:03:33.390> sure

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
this if your 100% confirm your 100% sure

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.020 
this if your 100% confirm your 100% sure
there<00:03:34.080> has<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.350> be<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.500> reason<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:35.160> why<00:03:35.730> you're

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
there has to be a reason that why you're

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.460 
there has to be a reason that why you're
one<00:03:36.150> hundred<00:03:36.239> percent<00:03:36.420> sure<00:03:36.660> right<00:03:36.989> there<00:03:37.170> has

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
one hundred percent sure right there has

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.229 
one hundred percent sure right there has
to<00:03:37.769> be<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:38.160> definite<00:03:39.000> reason<00:03:39.560> because<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:41.430> you

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
to be a definite reason because you you

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.140 
to be a definite reason because you you
one<00:03:42.720> hundred<00:03:43.050> percent<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.800> confirm<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.310> so

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
one hundred percent can confirm this so

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.570 
one hundred percent can confirm this so
that<00:03:45.300> means<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:46.200> either<00:03:46.230> seen<00:03:46.980> some<00:03:47.310> pictures

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
say this evidence is required if you can

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.850 
say this evidence is required if you can
all<00:04:03.660> have<00:04:03.840> two<00:04:03.900> percent<00:04:04.200> confirm<00:04:04.530> there<00:04:04.709> has

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
all have two percent confirm there has

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.920 
all have two percent confirm there has
to<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.130> reason<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.910> we<00:04:06.120> need<00:04:06.300> some<00:04:06.480> evidence

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
to be a reason so we need some evidence

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.620 
to be a reason so we need some evidence
where's<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.470> evidence<00:04:07.620> backing<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:08.430> up<00:04:08.630> not

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
where's the evidence backing this up not

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.320 
where's the evidence backing this up not
sure<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.080> all<00:04:10.410> sounds<00:04:11.010> lovely<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.610> this<00:04:11.790> this

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
sure this all sounds lovely in this this

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.030 
sure this all sounds lovely in this this
all<00:04:12.600> sounds<00:04:13.049> like<00:04:13.350> what<00:04:13.620> we<00:04:13.709> already<00:04:13.890> thought

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
all sounds like what we already thought

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.340 
all sounds like what we already thought
and<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:14.489> believable<00:04:15.000> it's<00:04:15.209> plausible<00:04:15.480> but

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
and it's believable it's plausible but

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.270 
and it's believable it's plausible but
we<00:04:16.950> need<00:04:17.190> evidence<00:04:17.900> we<00:04:18.900> do<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.620> can<00:04:19.830> 100<00:04:20.190> per

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
we need evidence we do you can 100 per

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.850 
we need evidence we do you can 100 per
se<00:04:20.400> confirm<00:04:20.790> this<00:04:20.970> more<00:04:21.180> reason<00:04:21.660> correct<00:04:21.989> so

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
se confirm this more reason correct so

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.360 
se confirm this more reason correct so
we<00:04:23.070> need<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.250> reason<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.120> 100<00:04:24.600> sent<00:04:24.780> believe<00:04:25.050> you

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
we need a reason to 100 sent believe you

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.740 
we need a reason to 100 sent believe you
so<00:04:26.370> we<00:04:26.490> need<00:04:26.640> some<00:04:26.789> evidence

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
so we need some evidence

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.180 
so we need some evidence
because<00:04:28.140> there<00:04:28.320> has<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.590> be<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.710> reason<00:04:28.890> for<00:04:29.040> you

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
because there has to be a reason for you

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.820 
because there has to be a reason for you
to<00:04:29.280> 100%<00:04:29.430> confirmed<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.660> there<00:04:31.410> has<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.800> be

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
to 100% confirmed this there has to be

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.160 
to 100% confirmed this there has to be
either<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.610> heard<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.150> word<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.960> name

either you heard the word the name
Adrian<00:04:34.740> tune<00:04:34.950> be<00:04:35.220> called<00:04:35.520> when<00:04:35.820> confit<00:04:36.480> air

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
Adrian tune be called when confit air

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.720 
Adrian tune be called when confit air
was<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.380> vicinity<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.130> word<00:04:38.340> being

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
was in the vicinity of the word being

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.880 
was in the vicinity of the word being
put<00:04:39.270> out<00:04:39.300> there<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.050> name<00:04:40.290> being<00:04:40.590> put<00:04:40.800> out

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.400 
put out there of the name being put out
there<00:04:40.950> so<00:04:41.790> you<00:04:42.510> obviously<00:04:42.780> know<00:04:43.380> something

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
there so you obviously know something

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.290 
there so you obviously know something

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
evidence i'm not going to call bull crap

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.140 
evidence i'm not going to call bull crap
on<00:05:22.620> this<00:05:22.770> article<00:05:23.070> yet<00:05:23.370> i'm<00:05:23.760> going<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.060> wait

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
on this article yet i'm going to wait

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.310 
on this article yet i'm going to wait
for<00:05:24.210> some<00:05:24.450> evidence<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:24.960> if<00:05:25.050> there's<00:05:25.200> no

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
for some evidence and if there's no

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.050 
for some evidence and if there's no
evidence<00:05:25.530> then<00:05:25.950> could<00:05:26.580> believe<00:05:26.790> what<00:05:26.970> you

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
evidence then could believe what you

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.820 
evidence then could believe what you
want<00:05:27.240> i'm<00:05:27.690> not<00:05:27.900> going<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.290> believe<00:05:28.500> it<00:05:28.560> if

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
want i'm not going to believe it if

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.080 
want i'm not going to believe it if
there's<00:05:29.280> no<00:05:29.430> evidence<00:05:31.520> evidence<00:05:32.520> we<00:05:32.940> need

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
there's no evidence evidence we need

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.330 
there's no evidence evidence we need
evidence<00:05:33.270> so<00:05:34.200> I'm<00:05:34.320> plausible<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.830> all<00:05:34.919> sounds

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
evidence so I'm plausible it all sounds

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.370 
evidence so I'm plausible it all sounds
lovely<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.790> all<00:05:35.910> sounds<00:05:36.450> like<00:05:36.600> something<00:05:37.350> that

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
lovely it all sounds like something that

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.130 
lovely it all sounds like something that
could<00:05:37.620> be<00:05:37.830> happening<00:05:37.950> right<00:05:38.419> but<00:05:39.419> for<00:05:39.990> you<00:05:40.050> to

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
could be happening right but for you to

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.980 
could be happening right but for you to
contradict<00:05:40.620> yourself<00:05:40.740> that's<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.250> problem<00:05:41.990> you

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990
