00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the same size but there's some big

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
the same size but there's some big
differences<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.869> biggest<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
differences here the the biggest one is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
differences here the the biggest one is
the<00:01:13.590> processor<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.400> year<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> quad-core

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the processor this year has a quad-core

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.770 
the processor this year has a quad-core
processor<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:17.159> running<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:18.509> point

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
processor and it's running at one point

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.039 
processor and it's running at one point
two<00:01:19.020> gigahertz<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.950> samsung<00:01:20.430> tab<00:01:20.729> 3<00:01:21.119> only

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
two gigahertz and the samsung tab 3 only

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
two gigahertz and the samsung tab 3 only
has<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> dual<00:01:22.710> core<00:01:23.009> processor<00:01:23.280> runs<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
has a dual core processor runs at the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.350 
has a dual core processor runs at the
same<00:01:24.630> speed<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.439> only<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.740> dual-core

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
same speed but it's only a dual-core

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
same speed but it's only a dual-core
another<00:01:27.360> big<00:01:27.630> difference<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.439> comes

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
another big difference is this comes

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.319 
another big difference is this comes
with<00:01:28.950> 16<00:01:29.369> gigs<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:30.259> storage<00:01:31.970> whereas<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> same

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
with 16 gigs of storage whereas the same

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.109 
with 16 gigs of storage whereas the same
song<00:01:33.570> only<00:01:33.840> comes<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.350> eight<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
song only comes with eight so that's a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.810 
song only comes with eight so that's a
pretty<00:01:36.329> big<00:01:36.630> deal<00:01:37.220> at<00:01:38.220> least<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.520> think<00:01:38.579> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
pretty big deal at least I think so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.480 
pretty big deal at least I think so
another<00:01:39.780> big<00:01:40.110> difference<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.310> this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
another big difference is is that this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.999 
another big difference is is that this
one<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:42.000> two<00:01:42.840> cameras<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.439> has<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> camera

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
one has two cameras it has a camera

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.340 
one has two cameras it has a camera
right<00:01:44.939> over<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:47.369> has<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.909> camera

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
right over here and it has a camera

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.560 
right over here and it has a camera
right<00:01:49.350> over<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
right over there and this one here is a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.380 
right over there and this one here is a
5<00:01:51.869> megapixel<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:56.390> 1

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
5 megapixel and this one here is a 1

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.560 
5 megapixel and this one here is a 1
point<00:01:57.630> 2<00:01:57.899> megapixel<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.549> Samsung<00:02:00.210> only

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
point 2 megapixel now the Samsung only

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.319 
point 2 megapixel now the Samsung only
has<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.990> camera<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.920> 1.3<00:02:02.640> megapixel
