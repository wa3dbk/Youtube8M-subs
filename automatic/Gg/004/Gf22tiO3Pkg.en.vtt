00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
reason there is a flight option that you

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.940 
reason there is a flight option that you
can<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.790> connects<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.630> LAX<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.619> flies

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
can get that connects and LAX that flies

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.140 
can get that connects and LAX that flies
to<00:01:25.979> Chicago<00:01:27.619> but<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:29.009> flight<00:01:29.400> option<00:01:29.909> has

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to Chicago but that flight option has

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.870 
to Chicago but that flight option has
actually<00:01:30.750> cheaper<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.700> can

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
actually cheaper so what you can

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
actually cheaper so what you can
actually<00:01:32.909> do<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.579> fly<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> LAX<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:37.290> not

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
actually do is fly to LAX and then not

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.460 
actually do is fly to LAX and then not
make<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.520> connecting<00:01:39.240> flight<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.810> as

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
make it on your connecting flight and as

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.840 
make it on your connecting flight and as
a<00:01:40.530> result<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.299> cheaper<00:01:42.899> flight<00:01:43.850> does

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
a result you have a cheaper flight does

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.990 
a result you have a cheaper flight does
that<00:01:44.970> make<00:01:45.180> sense<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:46.189> this<00:01:47.189> option<00:01:47.820> only

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that make sense so this option only

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.319 
that make sense so this option only
works<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.340> no<00:01:50.820> check<00:01:51.060> luggage

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
works if you have no check luggage

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.280 
works if you have no check luggage
because<00:01:51.930> otherwise<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.450> well

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
because otherwise you are going to well

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260 
because otherwise you are going to well
basically<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.310> check-in<00:01:56.700> luggage<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
basically if you do check-in luggage it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.639 
basically if you do check-in luggage it
will<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.780> arrive<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.290> your<00:01:58.500> final

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
will actually arrive at your final

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.069 
will actually arrive at your final
destination<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.790> especially<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:00.869> you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
destination because especially when you

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.999 
destination because especially when you
are<00:02:01.259> flying<00:02:01.530> within<00:02:01.860> domestic<00:02:02.460> flights<00:02:04.009> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
are flying within domestic flights that

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.029 
are flying within domestic flights that
baggage<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.149> not<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:07.979> to

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
baggage is not going is just going to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.059 
baggage is not going is just going to
keep<00:02:08.190> connecting<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.470> planes<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.770> are

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
keep connecting the planes that you are

keep connecting the planes that you are
connecting<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.930> used<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.319> do<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
connecting on now I used to do this

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.240 
connecting on now I used to do this

find flights like this budgets were a
very<00:02:20.690> very<00:02:20.840> big<00:02:21.319> issue<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.980> lot<00:02:22.909> of<00:02:23.030> gliese

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
very very big issue a lot of gliese

they're<00:03:56.599> not<00:03:56.720> gonna<00:03:56.900> be<00:03:57.200> arriving<00:03:57.769> at<00:03:57.889> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
they're not gonna be arriving at the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.930 
they're not gonna be arriving at the
destination<00:03:58.099> that<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.090> want<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.419> arrive<00:03:59.629> at

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
destination that you want to arrive at

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.740 
destination that you want to arrive at
this<00:04:01.940> is<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.569> very<00:04:02.959> very<00:04:03.799> good<00:04:04.129> method<00:04:04.700> for<00:04:05.389> a

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
this is a very very good method for a

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.110 
this is a very very good method for a
lot<00:04:06.019> of<00:04:06.169> things<00:04:06.379> so<00:04:06.680> if<00:04:07.639> there<00:04:07.940> are

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
lot of things so if there are

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.509 
lot of things so if there are
destinations<00:04:08.959> that<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.530> are<00:04:09.829> finding<00:04:10.310> that

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
destinations that you are finding that

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.400 
destinations that you are finding that
are<00:04:10.699> just<00:04:10.940> extremely<00:04:11.599> expensive<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.230> think

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
are just extremely expensive I think

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.229 
are just extremely expensive I think
this<00:04:12.530> works<00:04:12.739> for<00:04:12.919> international<00:04:13.760> flights<00:04:13.940> as

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
this works for international flights as

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.849 
this works for international flights as
well<00:04:14.510> obviously<00:04:15.199> if<00:04:15.560> you're<00:04:15.680> going

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
well obviously if you're going

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.159 
well obviously if you're going
internationally<00:04:16.669> more<00:04:16.880> than<00:04:17.060> often<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:18.049> know

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
internationally more than often you know

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.219 
internationally more than often you know
you<00:04:18.229> are<00:04:18.769> gonna<00:04:19.639> require<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.120> check<00:04:20.539> baggage<00:04:21.049> of

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
you are gonna require a check baggage of

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.260 
you are gonna require a check baggage of
some<00:04:21.500> sorts<00:04:21.919> right<00:04:22.130> anyways<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:22.849> think<00:04:22.909> that

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
some sorts right anyways I think that

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.839 
some sorts right anyways I think that
you<00:04:23.570> know<00:04:23.690> we<00:04:23.900> should<00:04:24.110> all<00:04:24.289> try<00:04:25.099> these<00:04:25.400> methods

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
you know we should all try these methods

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.190 
you know we should all try these methods
check<00:04:26.300> out

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
check out

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.170 
check out
website<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.160> actually<00:04:28.580> use<00:04:28.760> these<00:04:29.000> methods

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
website and actually use these methods

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.420 
website and actually use these methods
for<00:04:29.510> booking<00:04:29.930> flights<00:04:30.310> especially<00:04:31.310> if<00:04:31.370> you

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
for booking flights especially if you

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.520 
for booking flights especially if you
are<00:04:31.520> just<00:04:31.610> going<00:04:31.940> for<00:04:32.090> one<00:04:32.270> or<00:04:32.390> two<00:04:32.420> days<00:04:32.540> it

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
are just going for one or two days it

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.800 
are just going for one or two days it
could<00:04:34.460> save<00:04:34.700> you<00:04:34.820> actually<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> shit<00:04:35.570> ton<00:04:35.750> of

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
could save you actually a shit ton of

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.470 
could save you actually a shit ton of
money<00:04:36.110> there<00:04:37.070> are<00:04:37.190> flights<00:04:37.520> were<00:04:37.760> simply<00:04:38.240> it

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
money there are flights were simply it

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.680 
money there are flights were simply it
doesn't<00:04:38.990> make<00:04:39.170> sense<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.860> me<00:04:40.010> how<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:41.540> are

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
doesn't make sense to me how you are

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.670 
doesn't make sense to me how you are
using<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.710> much<00:04:42.950> plane<00:04:43.430> fuel<00:04:43.870> essentially<00:04:44.870> as

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
using so much plane fuel essentially as

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.550 
using so much plane fuel essentially as
a<00:04:45.770> passenger<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:47.180> know<00:04:47.300> sometimes<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.320> can

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
a passenger you know sometimes you can

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.690 
a passenger you know sometimes you can
there's<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.580> flight<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:51.340> you're<00:04:52.340> going<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.610> a

there's a flight to you're going to a

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.720 
there's a flight to you're going to a
certain<00:04:52.970> destination<00:04:53.060> right<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:54.610> you<00:04:55.610> know

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
certain destination right and you know

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.340 
certain destination right and you know
there's<00:04:56.060> certain<00:04:56.390> distance<00:04:56.780> right<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.260> it

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
there's certain distance right and it

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.260 
there's certain distance right and it
costs<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:57.830> certain<00:04:58.010> amount<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.460> get<00:04:58.610> there<00:04:58.820> but

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
costs a certain amount to get there but

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.880 
costs a certain amount to get there but
it<00:04:59.510> is<00:04:59.660> actually<00:05:00.020> cheaper<00:05:00.200> for<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.740> go

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
it is actually cheaper for you to go

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.380 
it is actually cheaper for you to go
like<00:05:01.880> that

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
like that

there<00:05:04.760> take<00:05:05.360> let's<00:05:05.600> say<00:05:05.660> 10<00:05:05.990> planes<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:07.100> get<00:05:07.220> to

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
there take let's say 10 planes to get to

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.160 
there take let's say 10 planes to get to
the<00:05:07.460> same<00:05:07.640> location<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.630> actually<00:05:08.930> becomes

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
the same location it actually becomes

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.430 
the same location it actually becomes
cheaper<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:10.540> lot<00:05:11.540> of<00:05:11.720> times<00:05:11.960> I<00:05:12.260> don't

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
cheaper a lot of times I don't

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.830 
cheaper a lot of times I don't
understand<00:05:13.040> this<00:05:13.280> I<00:05:14.030> know<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.600> there's

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
understand this I know that there's

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.590 
understand this I know that there's
certain<00:05:15.590> reasons<00:05:16.340> why<00:05:16.610> this<00:05:16.670> happens<00:05:17.360> but

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
certain reasons why this happens but

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.280 
certain reasons why this happens but
it's<00:05:17.990> dumb<00:05:18.290> at<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.710> end<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.040> day<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:20.290> think

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
it's dumb at the end of the day I think

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.530 
it's dumb at the end of the day I think
that<00:05:21.590> we<00:05:21.950> should<00:05:22.160> be<00:05:22.310> on<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.940> guy's<00:05:23.150> side

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
that we should be on this guy's side

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.200 
that we should be on this guy's side
especially<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:24.350> know<00:05:24.500> gas<00:05:24.860> prices<00:05:25.460> went<00:05:25.730> down

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
especially you know gas prices went down

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.930 
especially you know gas prices went down
did<00:05:26.570> price<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:27.200> plane<00:05:27.770> tickets<00:05:27.800> go<00:05:28.460> down<00:05:28.700> oil

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
did price of plane tickets go down oil

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.290 
did price of plane tickets go down oil
went<00:05:29.480> down<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:30.110> dropped<00:05:30.650> half<00:05:30.950> its<00:05:31.310> price<00:05:31.610> our

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
went down it dropped half its price our

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.350 
went down it dropped half its price our
plane<00:05:32.600> tickets<00:05:32.780> going<00:05:33.170> down<00:05:33.500> no<00:05:34.040> they<00:05:34.850> are<00:05:35.060> not

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
plane tickets going down no they are not

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.740 
plane tickets going down no they are not
it<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:35.750> still<00:05:36.260> bullshit<00:05:37.010> a<00:05:37.250> lot<00:05:37.520> of<00:05:37.700> stuff<00:05:37.940> like

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
it is still bullshit a lot of stuff like

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.560 
it is still bullshit a lot of stuff like
this<00:05:38.990> is<00:05:39.140> still<00:05:39.320> bullshit<00:05:39.800> with<00:05:40.360> people<00:05:41.360> don't

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
this is still bullshit with people don't

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.990 
this is still bullshit with people don't
adjust<00:05:41.840> their<00:05:42.050> prices<00:05:42.410> accordingly<00:05:42.950> and<00:05:43.520> so

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
adjust their prices accordingly and so

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.600 
adjust their prices accordingly and so
it<00:05:44.780> is<00:05:45.050> what<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.380> is<00:05:45.560> can't<00:05:46.070> do<00:05:46.220> anything<00:05:46.550> about

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
it is what it is can't do anything about

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.600 
it is what it is can't do anything about
it<00:05:46.790> I<00:05:47.150> think<00:05:47.840> I'm<00:05:47.930> on<00:05:48.140> I'm<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:49.040> this<00:05:49.280> twenty

two-year-old side I think it's a really

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.460 
two-year-old side I think it's a really
cool<00:05:52.790> system<00:05:53.240> that<00:05:53.450> this<00:05:53.600> guy<00:05:53.780> came<00:05:53.840> up<00:05:54.200> with

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
cool system that this guy came up with

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.800 
cool system that this guy came up with
that<00:05:54.710> anyone<00:05:55.340> really<00:05:55.700> can<00:05:55.910> use<00:05:56.150> that<00:05:56.420> you<00:05:56.480> know

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
that anyone really can use that you know

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.380 
that anyone really can use that you know
instead<00:05:57.260> of<00:05:57.340> taking<00:05:58.340> this<00:05:58.460> time<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.300> actually

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
instead of taking this time to actually

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.870 
instead of taking this time to actually
find<00:05:59.870> certain<00:06:00.200> flights<00:06:00.560> that<00:06:01.190> could<00:06:01.400> work<00:06:01.640> for
