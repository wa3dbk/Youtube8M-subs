00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
would you actually become a better

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.919 
would you actually become a better
driver<00:00:07.290> on<00:00:07.740> Forza<00:00:08.160> horizon<00:00:08.420> so<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.450> want<00:00:09.870> to

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
driver on Forza horizon so I want to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.290 
driver on Forza horizon so I want to
first<00:00:10.080> off<00:00:10.290> say<00:00:10.650> I'm<00:00:11.370> sorry<00:00:11.639> if<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.090> hear

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
the fan in the background to my left and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.930 
the fan in the background to my left and
to<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.179> right<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.630> really<00:00:16.199> really<00:00:16.440> hot<00:00:16.590> today

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
to my right it's really really hot today

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.630 
to my right it's really really hot today
and<00:00:18.439> I'm<00:00:19.439> literally<00:00:19.800> sweating<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.430> sitting

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and I'm literally sweating just sitting

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.970 
and I'm literally sweating just sitting
here<00:00:20.760> even<00:00:21.029> though<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> fan<00:00:21.859> all<00:00:22.859> right

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
here even though I have a fan all right

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.890 
here even though I have a fan all right
so<00:00:23.310> let's<00:00:23.970> head<00:00:24.029> over<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> garage<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.869> we

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
so let's head over to the garage so we

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.480 
so let's head over to the garage so we
can<00:00:25.080> look<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> staff<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.010> car<00:00:26.220> first

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
can look at the staff in this car first

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.040 
can look at the staff in this car first
cuz<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> first<00:00:27.390> car<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.750> want<00:00:27.960> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
cuz this is the first car that I want to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:38.299 
cuz this is the first car that I want to
talk<00:00:28.230> about<00:00:35.960> alright<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.410> highest

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
talk about alright so this is my highest

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.420 
talk about alright so this is my highest
rated<00:00:38.730> car<00:00:39.000> or<00:00:39.149> whatever<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:40.230> called<00:00:40.430> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
rated car or whatever it's called the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.080 
rated car or whatever it's called the
f50<00:00:42.360> GT<00:00:42.690> Ferrari<00:00:43.200> um<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.520> best<00:00:44.730> car<00:00:44.969> in

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
f50 GT Ferrari um it's the best car in

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.410 
f50 GT Ferrari um it's the best car in
my<00:00:45.270> opinion<00:00:46.399> just<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.239> it's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
my opinion just because it's not it's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690 
my opinion just because it's not it's
not<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> fastest<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.430> look<00:00:50.550> at

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
not the fastest at all if you look at

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.180 
not the fastest at all if you look at
the<00:00:50.789> stats<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.480> speed<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.870> 8.2<00:00:52.410> handling<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the stats the speed is 8.2 handling is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.959 
the stats the speed is 8.2 handling is
10<00:00:54.170> acceleration<00:00:55.170> 9.9<00:00:55.770> launched<00:00:56.190> 8.8<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
10 acceleration 9.9 launched 8.8 and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
10 acceleration 9.9 launched 8.8 and
braking<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.449> 10<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.859> things<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
braking is 10 so the two things that you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.970 
braking is 10 so the two things that you
mainly<00:00:59.820> want<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> focus<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.379> definitely

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
mainly want to focus on is definitely

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.670 
mainly want to focus on is definitely
the<00:01:02.070> handling<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> braking<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.539> mean<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the handling and braking I mean the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.410 
the handling and braking I mean the
speed<00:01:04.979> acceleration<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.939> launch<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.270> also

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
speed acceleration and launch are also

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
speed acceleration and launch are also
excruciatingly<00:01:07.140> ly<00:01:07.229> important<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
excruciatingly ly important but the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
excruciatingly ly important but the
handling<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> braking<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:10.110> completely

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
handling and braking will completely

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
handling and braking will completely
save<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.310> ass<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.000> comes<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> catching

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
save your ass when it comes to catching

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.670 
save your ass when it comes to catching
up<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.320> race<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:16.049> always<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> pick

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
up in a race you always want to pick

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
up in a race you always want to pick
something<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:16.950> higher<00:01:17.189> speed<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.549> most

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
something with higher speed but most

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.929 
something with higher speed but most
mostly<00:01:18.869> most<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.340> better

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
mostly most of the time you want better

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.210 
mostly most of the time you want better
acceleration<00:01:21.299> than<00:01:21.810> speed<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
acceleration than speed if you have to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.280 
acceleration than speed if you have to
choose<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> two<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.299> launch<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
choose one of the two and launch is

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
choose one of the two and launch is
always<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
always good to have just because it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.749 
always good to have just because it
gives<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.270> start<00:01:27.659> right<00:01:27.960> off<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> bat

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
gives you that start right off the bat

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.740 
gives you that start right off the bat
you<00:01:29.759> shouldn't<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.240> use<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.479> start

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you shouldn't have to use the start

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.410 
you shouldn't have to use the start
again<00:01:31.110> or<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.829> launch<00:01:32.040> again<00:01:32.820> throughout<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
again or the launch again throughout the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810 
again or the launch again throughout the
race<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:35.009> you're<00:01:35.250> handling<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
race because if you're handling and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.370 
race because if you're handling and
braking<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.180> good<00:01:36.270> enough<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.049> want<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
braking is good enough then you want to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.280 
braking is good enough then you want to
come<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> complete<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.250> total<00:01:38.280> stop<00:01:39.290> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
come to a complete and total stop so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.850 
come to a complete and total stop so
proper<00:01:41.040> braking<00:01:41.369> um<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.409> want<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> show<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> an

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
proper braking um I want to show you an

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
proper braking um I want to show you an
example<00:01:43.950> down<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> road<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> gain

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
example down the road but I want to gain

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.850 
example down the road but I want to gain
some<00:01:45.420> speed<00:01:45.899> first<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.619> show<00:01:46.799> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
some speed first so I can show you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.470 
some speed first so I can show you
exactly<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> mean

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
exactly what I mean

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.510 
exactly what I mean
as<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.230> tell<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.500> car<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
as you can tell this car is not the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.160 
as you can tell this car is not the
fastest<00:01:51.030> compared<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> other<00:01:51.720> cars<00:01:52.020> in

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
fastest compared to the other cars in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.680 
fastest compared to the other cars in
the<00:01:52.200> r1<00:01:52.950> class<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.180> only<00:01:54.300> reach

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
the r1 class this one can only reach

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.630 
the r1 class this one can only reach
like<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.260> think<00:01:55.800> like<00:01:55.980> 180<00:01:56.870> or<00:01:57.870> 190<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.860> but

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
like I think like 180 or 190 or so but

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
like I think like 180 or 190 or so but
this<00:01:59.850> turn<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:00.960> sharp<00:02:01.290> compared

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
this turn up here is very sharp compared

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.140 
this turn up here is very sharp compared
to<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.980> speed<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.250> I'm<00:02:02.520> gaining<00:02:02.820> right<00:02:02.970> now

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
to the speed that I'm gaining right now

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.940 
to the speed that I'm gaining right now
so<00:02:03.750> when<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.260> definitely<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.890> about

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
so when I have to definitely think about

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.130 
so when I have to definitely think about
how<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.520> gonna<00:02:05.610> break<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.300> when

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
how much I'm gonna break and when

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.040 
how much I'm gonna break and when
exactly<00:02:07.470> I'm<00:02:07.710> gonna<00:02:07.860> break<00:02:08.130> so<00:02:09.030> let's<00:02:09.840> give

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
exactly I'm gonna break so let's give

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.350 
exactly I'm gonna break so let's give
this<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.230> shot<00:02:10.350> right<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.370> slightly<00:02:12.000> tap<00:02:12.210> on

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
this a shot right here I slightly tap on

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.240 
this a shot right here I slightly tap on
the<00:02:12.450> brakes<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.680> made<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.070> turn

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the brakes and I just made that turn

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.460 
the brakes and I just made that turn
perfectly<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.840> could<00:02:15.990> have<00:02:16.080> been<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> little

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
perfectly it could have been a little

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.870 
perfectly it could have been a little
bit<00:02:16.560> better<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.100> bit<00:02:17.310> tighter<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:17.850> I

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
bit better a little bit tighter but I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.760 
bit better a little bit tighter but I
still<00:02:18.210> made<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> term<00:02:18.720> without<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:19.380> off<00:02:19.620> of

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
still made the term without going off of

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.700 
still made the term without going off of
the<00:02:19.860> road<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:21.750> completely<00:02:22.110> jumping

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
the road and just completely jumping

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.890 
the road and just completely jumping
into<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.040> wall<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.370> losing<00:02:23.820> my<00:02:24.030> position<00:02:24.780> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
into the wall and losing my position in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.140 
into the wall and losing my position in
the<00:02:24.990> race<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:26.130> I'm<00:02:26.400> gonna<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.850> same<00:02:26.880> thing

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the race so I'm gonna do the same thing

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.590 
the race so I'm gonna do the same thing

Rock all the way up here see my top
speeds<00:02:38.370> only<00:02:38.520> around<00:02:38.820> 181<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.660> 180<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.170> 185<00:02:40.710> so

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.970 
speeds only around 181 or 180 to 185 so
here<00:02:41.850> comes<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.150> turn<00:02:42.180> right<00:02:42.510> now<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.500> know

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
here comes the turn right now you know

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.040 
here comes the turn right now you know
lightly<00:02:44.460> tap<00:02:44.760> under<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> brakes<00:02:45.360> made<00:02:45.840> that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
lightly tap under the brakes made that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.800 
lightly tap under the brakes made that
turn<00:02:46.290> perfect<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.850> since<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.330> handling<00:02:48.690> this

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
turn perfect and since the handling this

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.680 
turn perfect and since the handling this
car<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.170> amazing<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.520> can<00:02:50.640> also<00:02:50.820> handle<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
car is amazing it can also handle this a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.500 
car is amazing it can also handle this a
lot<00:02:51.990> better<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.620> lot<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.280> cars<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.150> smaller

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
lot better a lot of cars in the smaller

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.230 
lot better a lot of cars in the smaller
classes<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.740> up<00:02:55.800> my<00:02:55.920> generated<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.640> lot

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
classes I up my generated a lot

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.530 
classes I up my generated a lot
of<00:02:57.360> cars<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.410> lower<00:02:58.800> classes<00:02:59.330> lower<00:03:00.330> than

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
of cars in the lower classes lower than

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.990 
of cars in the lower classes lower than
r1<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.959> mean<00:03:01.230> typically<00:03:01.800> just<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.220> all<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
r1 I mean typically just like all the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.430 
r1 I mean typically just like all the
letter<00:03:03.209> ones<00:03:03.450> not<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.810> r1<00:03:04.739> r2<00:03:05.100> r3<00:03:05.750> but<00:03:06.750> they

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
letter ones not the r1 r2 r3 but they

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.740 
letter ones not the r1 r2 r3 but they
definitely<00:03:07.709> are<00:03:08.220> well<00:03:08.940> obviously<00:03:09.120> they<00:03:09.570> could

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
definitely are well obviously they could

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.530 
definitely are well obviously they could
not<00:03:09.870> even<00:03:10.080> be<00:03:10.230> someone<00:03:10.650> close<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.540> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
not even be someone close to the the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.970 
not even be someone close to the the
abilities<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.200> car<00:03:13.410> has<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:14.489> um<00:03:15.980> they

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
abilities that this car has but um they

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.500 
abilities that this car has but um they
can't<00:03:17.220> go<00:03:17.400> as<00:03:17.520> fast<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.940> general<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.450> they

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
can't go as fast in general and they

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.240 
can't go as fast in general and they
have<00:03:18.690> less<00:03:18.930> braking<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.470> less<00:03:19.650> handling<00:03:20.100> so

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
have less braking and less handling so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.520 
have less braking and less handling so
you<00:03:20.370> definitely<00:03:20.550> have<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.030> take<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.530> into

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
you definitely have to take that into

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.650 
you definitely have to take that into
effect<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.190> lot<00:03:23.520> more<00:03:23.880> than<00:03:24.180> what<00:03:24.330> I'm<00:03:24.450> showing

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
effect a lot more than what I'm showing

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.100 
effect a lot more than what I'm showing
you<00:03:24.810> right<00:03:25.020> now<00:03:25.520> which<00:03:26.520> I'll<00:03:26.670> show<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:26.989> at<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
you right now which I'll show you at the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.510 
you right now which I'll show you at the
top<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.620> hill<00:03:28.860> I'll<00:03:29.040> grab<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.310> different

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
top of this hill I'll grab a different

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.979 
top of this hill I'll grab a different
car<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:29.910> show<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.450> complete<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.900> total

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
car and show you the complete and total

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.360 
car and show you the complete and total
difference<00:03:31.500> between<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.950> two

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
difference between the two

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.070 
difference between the two
you<00:03:33.940> definitely<00:03:34.360> have<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.540> break<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> lot

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
you definitely have to break a lot

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.600 
you definitely have to break a lot
harder<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:36.599> get<00:03:37.599> a<00:03:37.629> lot<00:03:37.810> tighter<00:03:38.170> turns

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
harder and get a lot tighter turns

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.820 
harder and get a lot tighter turns
because<00:03:39.610> there's<00:03:39.879> a<00:03:40.230> pretty<00:03:41.230> much<00:03:41.379> any<00:03:41.560> car<00:03:41.799> in

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
because there's a pretty much any car in

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.229 
because there's a pretty much any car in
this<00:03:41.980> game<00:03:42.190> is<00:03:42.370> definitely<00:03:42.549> not<00:03:42.849> as<00:03:42.970> good<00:03:43.150> as

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
this game is definitely not as good as

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.850 
this game is definitely not as good as
that's<00:03:43.420> going<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:43.989> I'll<00:03:44.409> just<00:03:44.560> show<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.769> that

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
that's going so I'll just show you that

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.850 
that's going so I'll just show you that
one<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:45.340> soon<00:03:45.489> as<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:45.670> get<00:03:45.760> up<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> tippy<00:03:46.299> top

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
one as soon as I get up to the tippy top

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.110 
one as soon as I get up to the tippy top
but<00:03:47.860> as<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.220> can<00:03:48.310> see<00:03:48.370> I'm<00:03:48.670> cutting<00:03:48.909> my

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
but as you can see I'm cutting my

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.360 
but as you can see I'm cutting my
corners<00:03:49.540> nice<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.989> nice<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.890> good<00:03:51.340> and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
corners nice and nice and good and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.759 
corners nice and nice and good and
hugging<00:03:51.970> all<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.299> turns<00:03:55.409> messed<00:03:56.409> up<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.650> little

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
hugging all the turns messed up a little

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.390 
hugging all the turns messed up a little
bit<00:03:56.950> right<00:03:56.980> there<00:03:57.280> but<00:03:57.459> that's<00:03:57.640> all<00:03:57.819> right

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
bit right there but that's all right

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.319 
bit right there but that's all right
there<00:04:00.400> we<00:04:00.519> go<00:04:00.640> hugging<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.060> line<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:03.329> keeping

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
there we go hugging the line and keeping

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.619 
there we go hugging the line and keeping
a<00:04:04.450> solid<00:04:05.140> amount<00:04:05.379> of<00:04:05.470> gas<00:04:05.709> on<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.069> pedal<00:04:06.400> so<00:04:07.390> I

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
a solid amount of gas on the pedal so I

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.130 
a solid amount of gas on the pedal so I
do<00:04:07.750> not<00:04:07.989> lose<00:04:08.680> speed<00:04:09.459> enough<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.780> lose<00:04:10.959> my

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
do not lose speed enough to lose my

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.440 
do not lose speed enough to lose my
position<00:04:11.290> if<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.220> were<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.549> be<00:04:12.640> in<00:04:12.700> first<00:04:13.000> of

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
position if I were to be in first of

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.390 
position if I were to be in first of
course<00:04:15.630> there<00:04:16.630> we<00:04:16.720> go<00:04:16.840> nice<00:04:17.680> good<00:04:18.010> time<00:04:18.250> out

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
course there we go nice good time out

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.680 
course there we go nice good time out
there<00:04:18.549> drift<00:04:18.850> it<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.000> little<00:04:19.239> bit<00:04:19.389> could<00:04:19.570> have

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
there drift it a little bit could have

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.170 
there drift it a little bit could have
been<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.810> little<00:04:19.930> bit<00:04:20.139> better

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.980 

look<00:04:24.180> that's<00:04:25.080> basically<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.780> almost<00:04:27.780> at

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
look that's basically it so almost at

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.200 
look that's basically it so almost at
the<00:04:28.379> outposts<00:04:29.250> right<00:04:29.430> now<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:29.849> I'll<00:04:29.970> show<00:04:30.180> you

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
the outposts right now so I'll show you

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.790 
the outposts right now so I'll show you
guys<00:04:30.449> with<00:04:30.780> another<00:04:30.810> car

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
guys with another car

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.760 
guys with another car
Oh<00:04:32.900> nuts<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.139> one<00:04:34.289> up<00:04:34.409> a<00:04:34.530> little<00:04:34.740> too<00:04:34.919> much

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.850 

it<00:04:38.310> takes<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.580> little<00:04:38.699> bit<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.030> time<00:04:39.569> to

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
it takes a little bit of time to

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.230 
it takes a little bit of time to
completely<00:04:40.860> grasp<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.520> idea<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.940> like

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
completely grasp the idea of like

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.820 
completely grasp the idea of like
breaking<00:04:42.569> at<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.870> proper<00:04:43.169> times<00:04:43.349> and<00:04:43.650> stuff

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
breaking at the proper times and stuff

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.950 
breaking at the proper times and stuff
and<00:04:44.069> being<00:04:44.340> able<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.759> uh<00:04:44.789> handle<00:04:45.690> your

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
and being able to uh handle your

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.830 
and being able to uh handle your
cartridges<00:04:46.440> full<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:46.919> stability<00:04:47.069> but<00:04:47.840> it's

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
cartridges full of stability but it's

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.180 
cartridges full of stability but it's
always<00:04:49.110> possible<00:04:49.289> with<00:04:49.620> each<00:04:49.710> card<00:04:50.009> you<00:04:50.069> just

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
always possible with each card you just

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.439 
always possible with each card you just
have<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.460> know<00:04:50.639> how<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.000> drive<00:04:51.479> it<00:04:52.909> so<00:04:53.909> I'm

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
have to know how to drive it so I'm

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.969 
have to know how to drive it so I'm
gonna<00:04:54.569> come<00:04:54.780> in<00:04:54.810> here<00:04:55.169> I'm<00:04:55.319> gonna<00:04:55.500> choose<00:04:55.949> a

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
gonna come in here I'm gonna choose a

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:09.850 
gonna come in here I'm gonna choose a
car<00:04:57.889> from<00:04:58.889> the<00:04:59.460> lower<00:04:59.729> spectrum<00:05:02.060> let's<00:05:03.060> say<00:05:03.720> I

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.180 

don't<00:05:10.860> know

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
don't know

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.800 
don't know
you<00:05:11.310> know<00:05:11.400> what<00:05:11.550> I'll<00:05:12.360> go<00:05:12.569> with<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:12.720> charger

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.790 

definitely<00:05:18.810> gonna<00:05:18.900> have<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.110> take<00:05:19.289> it<00:05:19.319> more<00:05:19.650> to

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
definitely gonna have to take it more to

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.439 
definitely gonna have to take it more to
affect<00:05:20.220> what<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.580> braking<00:05:21.000> even<00:05:21.240> though<00:05:21.330> I'm

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
affect what the braking even though I'm

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.939 
affect what the braking even though I'm
gonna<00:05:21.599> be<00:05:21.720> slower<00:05:22.080> it's<00:05:22.319> gonna<00:05:22.470> have<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:22.800> be<00:05:22.919> a

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
gonna be slower it's gonna have to be a

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.760 
gonna be slower it's gonna have to be a
little<00:05:23.220> bit<00:05:23.370> harder<00:05:23.880> compared<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.449> the<00:05:24.770> the

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
little bit harder compared to the the

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.090 
little bit harder compared to the the
Ferrari<00:05:26.159> f50<00:05:26.580> I<00:05:26.789> was<00:05:26.970> just<00:05:27.120> driving

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.130 

so<00:05:30.880> I'm<00:05:30.940> gonna<00:05:31.090> start<00:05:31.360> going<00:05:31.540> down<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.810> hill<00:05:32.110> a

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
so I'm gonna start going down the hill a

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.340 
so I'm gonna start going down the hill a
little<00:05:32.230> bit

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.990 

it's<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.860> little<00:05:36.100> bit<00:05:36.220> tougher<00:05:36.550> to<00:05:36.670> turn<00:05:36.880> in

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
it's a little bit tougher to turn in

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.210 
it's a little bit tougher to turn in
this<00:05:37.090> car<00:05:37.360> it's<00:05:37.570> a<00:05:37.690> lot<00:05:38.200> heavier<00:05:38.680> in<00:05:38.830> general

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
this car it's a lot heavier in general

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
this car it's a lot heavier in general
to

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
to

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:49.579 
to
so<00:05:40.840> I'm<00:05:41.319> trying<00:05:41.620> my<00:05:41.740> best<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:42.069> turn<00:05:42.250> right<00:05:42.430> now

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:49.589 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.589 

most<00:05:50.159> people<00:05:50.429> think<00:05:50.579> the<00:05:50.729> muscle<00:05:51.329> cars<00:05:51.509> in

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
most people think the muscle cars in

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.409 
most people think the muscle cars in
this<00:05:51.659> game<00:05:51.869> are<00:05:52.109> complete<00:05:52.499> goop<00:05:53.369> compared<00:05:54.089> to

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
this game are complete goop compared to

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.869 
this game are complete goop compared to
basically<00:05:55.169> all<00:05:55.409> the<00:05:55.649> rice<00:05:56.009> branders<00:05:56.579> and

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
basically all the rice branders and

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.199 
basically all the rice branders and
stuff<00:05:57.349> so<00:05:58.349> lots<00:05:58.979> of<00:05:59.069> cars<00:05:59.309> see<00:05:59.819> right<00:05:59.999> there<00:06:00.179> I

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:00.209 
stuff so lots of cars see right there I

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:02.269 
stuff so lots of cars see right there I
was<00:06:00.449> trying<00:06:00.659> to<00:06:00.749> brake<00:06:00.989> but<00:06:01.259> missed<00:06:02.069> it<00:06:02.189> I

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:02.279 
was trying to brake but missed it I

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.879 
was trying to brake but missed it I
didn't<00:06:02.549> take<00:06:02.669> him<00:06:02.789> to<00:06:02.879> effect<00:06:03.209> enough<00:06:03.889> that

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
didn't take him to effect enough that

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.889 
didn't take him to effect enough that
could<00:06:05.069> have<00:06:05.159> cost<00:06:05.789> me<00:06:05.969> a<00:06:05.999> position<00:06:06.479> or<00:06:06.599> two<00:06:06.749> on

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:06.899 
could have cost me a position or two on

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.480 
could have cost me a position or two on
a<00:06:06.929> race
