00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:09.509
 Hello Play Slit ex 2 0 1 4 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:14.790
 It is the author's time, the sixth video lecture time 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:17.089
 This section provides general curved so now once included in a national program modeled 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.089
 I'll do it 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.680
 Modeling Heaven In this case, only the form is shown on the surface and the exact dimensions or dimensions 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 The drawing is not displayed 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.489
 In the air and then I repeatedly watched the video lectures several times why 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:41.400
 You might want to practice together 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:47.100
 So, let's take a quick look at my free course. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:51.450
 After running SolidWorks , select Cones in Tax Office from the menu bar 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.640
 Please select a port icon and I will give you a long 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:02.220
 The first thing we need to do is to make the lighting part of the light bulb first 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 Below you must decide squat will make the bottom part of the first beam body 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:12.220
 If you are like me, make the bottom part first, then the lighting part 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:19.630
 Let's try to express it. 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:24.880
 First, always press the top right icon in the written press with glasses 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:28.900
 The icon is now hidden, so that the bottom of the icon to show in the snow 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:34.390
 I'll mark it as visible . 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:37.420
 And give the reference image based on the light body togu 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:44.200
 Click the icon 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:46.090
 I want you to make one more turquoise plane 300,000 feet away from the win side. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.630
 I'll do it 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.580
 If you select the top of the first reference condition 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:01.350
 This allows you to create a new plane that is parallel to the top 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.350
 I will enter the distance dimension from here to 30 OK 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:12.130
 After making the top and the plane like this 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:15.310
 Let's create a sketch by right-clicking on the top. 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:21.700
 Using the circle sketch tool 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:28.000
 You have 26 wans sketches 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.510
 When the sketch is complete, click the sketch tray icon to finish. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.510
 I will. 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.170
 And the new plane 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.069
 I put the sketch again on plane 1 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.710
 Let's create a center rectangle. 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.670
 Center square 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.670
 Click 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.850
 The length of all sides is 35 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.850
 35 Enter the dimensions 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:07.150
 In the corner of the sketch 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.450
 Let's try inputting the number of paddles for environment 10 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.450
 Confirm 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.030
 When the sketch is complete, I 'll select the Finish Sketch icon . 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:27.990
 Thus the two-to-face sketch was completed 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:35.010
 I'll link this sketch and create it as a loft cop. 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:38.280
 Before we used the sketch plane and top surface again, right mouse 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:45.680
 I will hide it by pressing 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.680
 And I'll select the Loft Poses face icon from the feature. 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:56.600
 Then , 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.600
 Let's try selecting a circle sketch and a rectangle sketch. 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:06.409
 If you select only a scene, you will see that the same section is directly connected 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:12.670
 It will be displayed as a preview 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:18.400
 Here, let's choose the beginning and ending constraints. 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:23.410
 I have entered the bottom sketch first so the bottom sketch starts 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:30.970
 And the top sketch will be the end condition 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:35.290
 After the start, the vertical distance of the profile will be 1 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:40.380
 And the end- cap is the resin in the profile 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.380
 We'll have a redemption of 1.5 . 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:51.240
 Start loft and end loft at loft 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:56.360
 You can create a loft feature that takes smooth curves as follows : 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.360
 When I tried to check in Pyeongtaek Oh icon 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:06.479
 This completes the face feature. 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:10.270
 Let's add a flap feature and a rotating bezier here. 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:14.699
 After choosing Philippe Iron, 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.699
 I'll select the edge of the selected item. 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:25.640
 And Sir Fillesefang will be five. 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.640
 When preview comes up, I'll select the OK icon. 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.850
 And in the design tree 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:38.120
 Let's create a new sketch by right-clicking on the front 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.120
 Clay 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:50.939
 Change the table to Abandon vertically on the face 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:53.719
 Use the sketch lines to try to square a sketch properties such as To The Moon 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:53.719
 I'll do it 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:08.330
 When creating a sketch, be sure to connect the point and the vertex to create it . 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.850
 Gyawoottung proposals will please the cheongri be straightened using a second vertical gum 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.440
 I will. 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.440
 I'll enter the dimensions. 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:23.150
 As high as 15 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.150
 And the width is 13. 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:35.120
 And using the fillet sketch flat 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:41.840
 We will fill out 5 pieces of environmental paper. 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:44.710
 And then use the circle sketch in the next section to enter a little moody. 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.710
 I'll do it 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:52.100
 Pi added a circle sketch of this amount 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:07:01.040
 Now when the next sketch is complete 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:07.460
 Turn to light 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:11.110
 Select the icon to create the next sketch as a rotation bee. 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.110
 Click on the rotating four-space 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:21.740
 And the axis of rotation of the polygon . 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:26.090
 I will be this straight 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:29.449
 And the selected profile is Tom 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:34.460
 Select all of the following areas 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:35.960
 Make sure that all of the areas you have created will have a rotation feature 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.500
 I'll see. 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:43.250
 The rotation angle is 360 degrees 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:46.880
 If you select Finish, 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.000
 The body of the light bulb has been created 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:53.170
 Now, 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.750
 So that you can work with drawings a little more comfortably. 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:08:07.440
 Let's try dimensioning once in SolidWorks . 

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:07.440
 Next, model the body of the claim with reference to the dimensions of the venture
