00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
they come from the right they usually go

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.750 
they come from the right they usually go
to<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.019> front<00:04:21.380> door<00:04:21.500> anyway<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:24.400> but<00:04:25.400> it<00:04:25.580> just

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
to the front door anyway so but it just

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.250 
to the front door anyway so but it just
makes<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:25.970> easier<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.270> kill<00:04:26.510> as<00:04:27.050> they're

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
makes it easier to kill as they're

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.480 
makes it easier to kill as they're
coming<00:04:27.350> up<00:04:27.560> those<00:04:27.740> stairs<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:30.340> you're<00:04:31.340> about

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
coming up those stairs and you're about

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.180 
coming up those stairs and you're about
halfway<00:04:31.850> done<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.780> moving<00:04:33.230> about<00:04:33.980> halfway

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
halfway done and moving about halfway

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.340 
halfway done and moving about halfway
done<00:04:34.460> but<00:04:34.820> more<00:04:35.480> than<00:04:35.600> halfway<00:04:35.750> through<00:04:35.960> the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
done but more than halfway through the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.879 
done but more than halfway through the
video<00:04:36.440> only<00:04:36.889> three<00:04:37.160> minutes<00:04:37.310> left<00:04:37.639> but<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.770> is

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
video only three minutes left but so is

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.530 
video only three minutes left but so is
this<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.160> laziest<00:04:43.550> strategy<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.240> think<00:04:44.270> of

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
this the laziest strategy you think of

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.090 
this the laziest strategy you think of
laziest<00:04:47.540> strategy<00:04:48.110> how<00:04:48.560> can<00:04:48.740> I<00:04:48.770> make<00:04:48.919> this

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
laziest strategy how can I make this

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.790 
laziest strategy how can I make this
lazier<00:04:50.710> hmm<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.889> don't<00:04:52.880> know<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.560> didn't<00:04:54.560> find

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
lazier hmm I don't know I didn't find

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.180 
lazier hmm I don't know I didn't find
any<00:04:55.960> exploits<00:04:56.960> throughout<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.650> game<00:04:57.860> where

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
any exploits throughout the game where

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.219 
any exploits throughout the game where
you<00:04:58.250> can<00:04:58.430> really<00:04:58.729> make<00:04:59.150> your<00:04:59.210> teammates<00:05:00.020> do

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
you can really make your teammates do

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.170 
you can really make your teammates do
all<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.500> killing<00:05:00.800> which<00:05:01.580> is<00:05:01.729> the<00:05:01.790> next<00:05:02.000> point

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
all the killing which is the next point

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.310 
all the killing which is the next point
that<00:05:02.210> I'd<00:05:02.389> take<00:05:02.510> advantage<00:05:02.630> of<00:05:02.960> all<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.139> time

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
that I'd take advantage of all the time

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.050 
that I'd take advantage of all the time
in<00:05:03.470> Halo<00:05:03.800> because<00:05:04.669> they<00:05:04.760> have<00:05:04.880> unlimited

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
in Halo because they have unlimited

in Halo because they have unlimited
rocket<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:06.200> give<00:05:06.410> them<00:05:06.500> rocket<00:05:06.889> launch

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
rocket and give them rocket launch

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.110 
rocket and give them rocket launch
oh<00:05:07.160> one<00:05:07.580> shot<00:05:08.389> left<00:05:08.600> in<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:09.640> nothing<00:05:10.640> like<00:05:10.940> that

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
oh one shot left in it nothing like that

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.300 
oh one shot left in it nothing like that
I<00:05:11.450> couldn't<00:05:12.140> find<00:05:12.320> like<00:05:12.530> an<00:05:12.650> infinite<00:05:13.070> supply

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
I couldn't find like an infinite supply

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.219 
I couldn't find like an infinite supply
of<00:05:13.400> claymores<00:05:13.940> but<00:05:14.660> I<00:05:14.690> probably<00:05:14.930> could<00:05:15.169> have

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
of claymores but I probably could have

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.300 
of claymores but I probably could have
done<00:05:15.289> is<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.650> probably<00:05:15.860> should<00:05:16.039> have<00:05:16.070> put<00:05:16.160> a

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
done is I probably should have put a

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.380 
done is I probably should have put a
claymore<00:05:17.830> by<00:05:18.830> a<00:05:18.860> car<00:05:19.250> outside<00:05:19.550> because<00:05:20.240> that's

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
claymore by a car outside because that's

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.190 
claymore by a car outside because that's
an<00:05:20.510> old<00:05:20.660> trick<00:05:22.210> well<00:05:23.210> I<00:05:23.360> say<00:05:23.600> from<00:05:23.750> multiplayer

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
an old trick well I say from multiplayer

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.900 
an old trick well I say from multiplayer
but<00:05:24.350> definitely<00:05:24.979> not<00:05:25.100> just<00:05:25.310> for<00:05:25.490> multiplayer

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
but definitely not just for multiplayer

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.510 
but definitely not just for multiplayer
yeah<00:05:26.390> anyway<00:05:26.979> something<00:05:27.979> I<00:05:28.039> picked<00:05:28.250> up<00:05:28.370> from

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
yeah anyway something I picked up from

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.300 
yeah anyway something I picked up from
one<00:05:29.120> more<00:05:29.320> call<00:05:30.320> of<00:05:30.380> duty<00:05:30.560> for<00:05:30.770> multi<00:05:31.039> players

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
one more call of duty for multi players

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.120 
one more call of duty for multi players

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
you put a claim over by a car and you

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.090 
you put a claim over by a car and you
can<00:05:34.250> sometimes<00:05:35.169> like<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.320> exploding<00:05:36.889> car

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
can sometimes like the exploding car

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.260 
can sometimes like the exploding car
will<00:05:37.250> take<00:05:37.400> out<00:05:37.520> a<00:05:37.550> lot<00:05:37.729> of<00:05:37.820> other<00:05:37.940> people

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
will take out a lot of other people

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.760 
will take out a lot of other people
mm-hmm<00:05:40.780> what<00:05:41.780> else<00:05:41.900> could<00:05:42.020> I<00:05:42.110> done<00:05:42.350> make<00:05:42.620> this

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
mm-hmm what else could I done make this

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:50.740 
mm-hmm what else could I done make this
easier<00:05:45.220> um<00:05:46.570> now<00:05:47.570> there<00:05:47.780> was<00:05:47.990> an<00:05:48.080> edits<00:05:49.630> then<00:05:50.630> it

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
easier um now there was an edits then it

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.700 
easier um now there was an edits then it
was<00:05:50.840> a<00:05:50.870> meta<00:05:51.080> I<00:05:51.169> don't<00:05:51.350> know<00:05:51.410> if<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.560> was<00:05:51.680> a

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
was a meta I don't know if it was a

00:05:51.710 --> 00:06:01.930 
was a meta I don't know if it was a
pause<00:05:52.130> or<00:05:54.130> death<00:05:55.330> drink<00:05:56.330> anyway<00:05:56.720> okay<00:06:00.850> so<00:06:01.850> I'm

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
pause or death drink anyway okay so I'm

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.010 
pause or death drink anyway okay so I'm
trying<00:06:02.180> to<00:06:02.240> think<00:06:02.389> is<00:06:02.570> there<00:06:02.690> ever<00:06:02.840> been

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
trying to think is there ever been

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.230 
trying to think is there ever been
another<00:06:03.380> game<00:06:03.800> where<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:06.830> part<00:06:07.610> of<00:06:07.820> the<00:06:07.970> title

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
another game where the part of the title

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.140 
another game where the part of the title
behind<00:06:08.840> that<00:06:09.350> comes<00:06:09.560> after<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.100> colon<00:06:10.520> will

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
behind that comes after the colon will

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.440 
behind that comes after the colon will
took<00:06:11.479> over<00:06:11.690> as<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.200> name<00:06:12.729> took<00:06:13.729> over<00:06:14.000> as<00:06:14.270> the

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
took over as the name took over as the
