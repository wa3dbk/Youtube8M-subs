00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the foot in the foot plan and keep in

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.429 
the foot in the foot plan and keep in
mind<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> three<00:00:24.510> reasons<00:00:24.810> why<00:00:25.109> that's

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
mind the three reasons why that's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.040 
mind the three reasons why that's
important<00:00:26.039> number<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:27.240> allows<00:00:27.420> number

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
important number one it allows number

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
important number one it allows number
one<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.529> two<00:00:29.130> most<00:00:29.460> important<00:00:30.000> reasons<00:00:30.300> one

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
one the two most important reasons one

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.110 
one the two most important reasons one
is<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> allows<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.679> kind<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.489> bounces<00:00:32.640> ahead

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
is it allows it kind of bounces ahead

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.590 
is it allows it kind of bounces ahead
and<00:00:33.329> allows<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.719> rotation<00:00:33.980> within<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.219> spine

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
and allows for rotation within the spine

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
and allows for rotation within the spine
also<00:00:36.600> by<00:00:37.020> counterbalancing<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> head<00:00:38.280> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
also by counterbalancing the head it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.639 
also by counterbalancing the head it
allows<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> not<00:00:39.600> forget<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.930> Intersolar

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
allows you to not forget to Intersolar

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.340 
allows you to not forget to Intersolar
but<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> allows<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.969> center<00:00:42.360> mass<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
but it allows the center mass to be the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
but it allows the center mass to be the
driving<00:00:43.680> force<00:00:43.890> anytime<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> head<00:00:45.090> starts<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
driving force anytime the head starts to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
driving force anytime the head starts to
go<00:00:45.690> forward<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.770> body's<00:00:47.129> built-in<00:00:47.489> mechanism

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
go forward the body's built-in mechanism

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
go forward the body's built-in mechanism
to<00:00:48.030> protect<00:00:48.390> itself<00:00:48.690> forces<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> foot<00:00:49.739> down

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
to protect itself forces the foot down

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220 
to protect itself forces the foot down
early<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.520> almost<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.180> you've<00:00:51.870> ever<00:00:52.020> been

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
early it's almost as if you've ever been

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.020 
early it's almost as if you've ever been
walking<00:00:52.379> down<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> stairs<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.610> suddenly<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
walking down the stairs and suddenly you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.490 
walking down the stairs and suddenly you
think<00:00:54.059> there's<00:00:54.390> another<00:00:54.629> stair<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
think there's another stair you put it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
think there's another stair you put it
down<00:00:55.680> well<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.039> start<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.910> start<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> trip

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
down well you start to you start to trip

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.479 
down well you start to you start to trip
forward<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> same<00:00:58.230> thing<00:00:58.500> happens<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.219> this

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
forward the same thing happens in this

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.209 
forward the same thing happens in this
situation<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.530> counterbalance<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.649> ahead<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
situation so counterbalance is ahead and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
situation so counterbalance is ahead and
allows<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> center<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> driving

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
allows for the center to be the driving

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.969 
allows for the center to be the driving
force<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.250> also<00:01:05.630> allows<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.260> power<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.950> be

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
force but it also allows for power to be

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.030 
force but it also allows for power to be
transferred<00:01:08.700> from<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.450> back<00:01:10.200> side<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
transferred from the back side to the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
transferred from the back side to the
front<00:01:11.280> side<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.700> watch<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.750> go<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
front side so watch this as you go to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.929 
front side so watch this as you go to
the<00:01:13.290> slow<00:01:13.619> motion<00:01:13.830> he's<00:01:14.130> showing<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.490> partial

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the slow motion he's showing a partial

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.780 
the slow motion he's showing a partial
sole<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> foot<00:01:15.830> call<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> tilted<00:01:17.549> heel

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
sole of the foot call it a tilted heel

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.249 
sole of the foot call it a tilted heel
whatever<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> call<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.900> hide<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
whatever you want to call it hide and

whatever you want to call it hide and
Athan<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.799> don't<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.220> care<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:21.180> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
Athan I don't really care what you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.719 
Athan I don't really care what you
really<00:01:21.720> refer<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.460> you're<00:01:23.640> going

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
really refer to it as but you're going

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.270 
really refer to it as but you're going
to<00:01:23.820> notice<00:01:24.030> watch<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.259> knee<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.070> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
to notice watch the back knee at this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.080 
to notice watch the back knee at this
time

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.250 

this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.330> if<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.750> back<00:01:34.020> knee<00:01:34.580> forces<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:36.260> hip

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
this is if the back knee forces the hip

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.850 
this is if the back knee forces the hip
opens<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.510> you<00:01:39.510> can<00:01:39.660> see<00:01:39.810> there's<00:01:40.050> there's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
opens that you can see there's there's

this the bottom does not promote any

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.690 
this the bottom does not promote any
type<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.630> arm<00:02:01.050> speed<00:02:01.470> simply<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.430> they

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
type of arm speed simply because they

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.780 
type of arm speed simply because they
open<00:02:02.970> early<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.320> body<00:02:04.590> goes<00:02:04.890> into<00:02:05.070> rotation

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
open early the body goes into rotation

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
open early the body goes into rotation
too<00:02:06.420> early<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.050> doesn't<00:02:07.410> build<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
too early so it doesn't build up that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.199 
too early so it doesn't build up that
that<00:02:08.550> linear<00:02:08.970> speed<00:02:09.300> that's<00:02:09.600> later<00:02:09.869> converted

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
that linear speed that's later converted

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.810 
that linear speed that's later converted
to<00:02:12.209> rotation<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:13.530> not<00:02:13.770> influencing<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
to rotation so it's not influencing the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.910 
to rotation so it's not influencing the
arm<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.390> move<00:02:15.570> faster<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.380> matter<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.680> fact

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
arm to move faster as a matter of fact

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.610 
arm to move faster as a matter of fact
it<00:02:17.100> allows<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.610> arm<00:02:17.790> guys<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.260> with

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it allows the arm guys that do this with

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.840 
it allows the arm guys that do this with
the<00:02:19.709> front<00:02:19.890> leg<00:02:20.010> you're<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.489> see<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> very

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
the front leg you're going to see a very

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.050 
the front leg you're going to see a very
inefficient<00:02:21.530> path<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.430> arm<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.030> see

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
inefficient path of the arm you can see

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.620 
inefficient path of the arm you can see
he's<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:28.010> really<00:02:29.010> blocked<00:02:29.550> off<00:02:29.910> at<00:02:30.420> this

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
he's really really blocked off at this

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.510 
he's really really blocked off at this
time<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.230> happens<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.860> lot<00:02:31.890> when<00:02:32.310> guys

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
time and this happens a lot when guys

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.190 
time and this happens a lot when guys
are<00:02:32.850> taught<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:35.060> get<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.330> hill<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.959> load

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
are taught to get to the hill to load

the<00:02:37.470> glute<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.980> see<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.549> lot<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
the glute I see this a lot this is a

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.050 
the glute I see this a lot this is a
very<00:02:39.690> front<00:02:40.320> hip<00:02:40.620> dominate<00:02:41.130> action<00:02:41.610> watch<00:02:41.820> it

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
very front hip dominate action watch it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.770 
very front hip dominate action watch it
just<00:02:43.190> it's<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.400> front<00:02:44.670> hip<00:02:44.850> that's<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
just it's the front hip that's the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.870 
just it's the front hip that's the
dominant<00:02:46.230> force<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.830> often<00:02:47.280> you'll<00:02:47.430> see<00:02:47.640> guys

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
dominant force and often you'll see guys

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.970 
dominant force and often you'll see guys
if<00:02:48.239> you're<00:02:48.360> watching<00:02:48.540> straight<00:02:48.900> on<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.620> over

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
if you're watching straight on you over

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.250 
if you're watching straight on you over
rotates<00:02:50.459> with<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.180> foot<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:51.810> at<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.019> point

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
rotates with the foot but at this point

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.420 
rotates with the foot but at this point
you<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:52.680> how<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.860> hips<00:02:53.100> are<00:02:53.280> still

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
you can see how the hips are still

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.030 
you can see how the hips are still

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
in a straight line it looks nothing like

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.460 
in a straight line it looks nothing like

the upper body or the upper video so if

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.570 
the upper body or the upper video so if
you're<00:03:04.590> watching<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:05.070> right<00:03:05.220> now<00:03:05.280> what

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
you're watching this right now what

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.090 
you're watching this right now what
happens<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.390> back<00:03:07.140> hip<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.860> arm

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
happens is that back hip and the arm

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.729 
happens is that back hip and the arm
they<00:03:09.000> go<00:03:09.180> simultaneously<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.320> there's<00:03:10.500> no

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
they go simultaneously so there's no

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.759 
they go simultaneously so there's no
separation<00:03:11.730> between<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.360> back<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
separation between the back you in the

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.229 
separation between the back you in the
throwing<00:03:13.980> side<00:03:14.280> shoulder<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:14.850> there<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.120> an

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
throwing side shoulder so there is an

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.690 
throwing side shoulder so there is an
example<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.870> front<00:03:16.200> hip<00:03:16.380> dominant<00:03:16.829> action

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
example of a front hip dominant action

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.630 
example of a front hip dominant action
at<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.910> bottom<00:03:18.920> versus<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.190> back<00:03:20.370> hip

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
at the bottom versus the back hip

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.069 
at the bottom versus the back hip
dominant<00:03:21.060> action<00:03:23.120> seen<00:03:24.120> at<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.360> top<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.900> in

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
dominant action seen at the top and in

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.160 
dominant action seen at the top and in
one<00:03:25.350> more<00:03:25.530> point<00:03:25.680> I'd<00:03:25.829> like<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.160> point<00:03:26.700> out

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
one more point I'd like to point out

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.420 
one more point I'd like to point out
with<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.350> step<00:03:28.620> over<00:03:28.920> with<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.160> step<00:03:29.340> up

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
with the step over with the step up

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.470 
with the step over with the step up
you're<00:03:29.519> going<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.700> see<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:29.940> front<00:03:30.209> foot

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
you're going to see this front foot

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.270 
you're going to see this front foot
actually<00:03:30.870> start<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.230> elevate<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:31.799> loud<00:03:32.040> for

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
actually start to elevate it's loud for

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.259 
actually start to elevate it's loud for
that<00:03:32.430> hip<00:03:33.060> joint<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.540> roll<00:03:33.720> over<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:36.090> is

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
that hip joint to roll over and this is

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.170 
that hip joint to roll over and this is
something<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.810> lot<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.110> guys<00:03:37.670> try<00:03:38.670> they

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
something that a lot of guys try they

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.970 
something that a lot of guys try they
practice<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:39.900> use<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.109> step<00:03:40.410> over<00:03:40.560> inside

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
practice and we use a step over inside

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.830 
practice and we use a step over inside
the<00:03:41.100> mastermind<00:03:41.639> drill<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:42.299> we<00:03:42.389> use<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.630> by

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
the mastermind drill but we use it by

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.470 
the mastermind drill but we use it by
showing<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.320> sole

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
showing the sole

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.170 
showing the sole
bottom<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.170> another<00:03:45.920> example<00:03:46.159> of<00:03:46.640> guys<00:03:46.879> that

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
bottom is another example of guys that

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.820 
bottom is another example of guys that
will<00:03:47.330> show<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.959> step<00:03:48.170> up<00:03:48.349> which<00:03:48.500> was<00:03:48.650> made

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
will show the step up which was made

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.940 
will show the step up which was made

changed it doing the growing issues but

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.860 
changed it doing the growing issues but
this<00:03:54.379> is<00:03:54.530> another<00:03:54.860> lower<00:03:55.310> body<00:03:55.640> action<00:03:56.209> when

another way of leading with or link or

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.380 
another way of leading with or link or
keeping<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.239> heel<00:04:03.010> down<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.940> activate<00:04:05.269> the

glute it really blocks the hips and does

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.940 
glute it really blocks the hips and does
not<00:04:08.330> create<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:08.989> peer<00:04:09.260> pressure<00:04:09.290> effect

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
not create that peer pressure effect

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.059 
not create that peer pressure effect
which<00:04:10.160> leads<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.760> promotes<00:04:11.120> arm<00:04:11.660> speed<00:04:12.230> so

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
which leads and promotes arm speed so

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.000 
which leads and promotes arm speed so
we'll<00:04:13.220> go<00:04:13.310> through<00:04:13.519> this<00:04:14.349> slow<00:04:15.349> motion<00:04:15.920> let's

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
we'll go through this slow motion let's

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.990 
we'll go through this slow motion let's
watch<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:21.400> let's<00:04:22.400> throw<00:04:22.550> them<00:04:22.610> at<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.760> same

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
watch this let's throw them at the same

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.580 
watch this let's throw them at the same
time

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.590 

there<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.430> go<00:04:32.520> there's<00:04:32.730> an<00:04:32.850> example<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.510> the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
there you go there's an example of the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.140 
there you go there's an example of the
back<00:04:33.810> hip<00:04:34.080> dumb<00:04:34.320> bit<00:04:34.500> action<00:04:34.860> which<00:04:35.150> promotes

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
back hip dumb bit action which promotes

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.020 
back hip dumb bit action which promotes
arm<00:04:36.780> speed<00:04:37.320> first<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> front<00:04:38.700> hip<00:04:38.820> dummy

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
arm speed first is the front hip dummy

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.170 
arm speed first is the front hip dummy
at<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.240> bottom<00:04:39.630> which<00:04:40.260> really<00:04:40.970> causes<00:04:41.970> the

at the bottom which really causes the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.270 
at the bottom which really causes the
arm<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.450> take<00:04:42.600> an<00:04:42.750> inefficient<00:04:43.320> path<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.980> does

arm to take an inefficient path and does

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.750 
arm to take an inefficient path and does
not<00:04:44.490> lead<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:44.820> increased<00:04:45.330> Ormsby
