 attention should be paid to keep or 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.519
 devices 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.250
 it consists of two parts firstly here 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.559
 This clothespin allows you to mount 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.120
 recorder on clothes laptop and so 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.010
 no further 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.410
 the second part is 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 stand with hinge for mounting on 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.769
 plane you can just set it on 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.170
 surface 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.240
 and also fix using the Baltic 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.990
 or velcro first thing immediately 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.469
 pay attention by taking md80 in hand 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.960
 its weight for such a small device 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.940
 50 grams is still too much due 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.750
 this is a full metal body 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 the registrar 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.270
 I don't have any 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.840
 claims to its build quality are all on 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.850
 height 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.610
 of the controls on the case 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.640
 there are two slider switches 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 on the sides as well as the record activation button 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.489
 from above next to the last can be seen 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.989
 tiny led indicator 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.080
 note that there is a case 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.280
 eyelet for fastening lace 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.030
 The recorder can be worn around the neck like 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.100
 pendant on the bottom of the device 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.799
 is the standard microusb port 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.710
 employee for both charging and connecting 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.960
 with a computer on the right side you will find 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.259
 micro sd memory card slot 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.350
 it is being built in video recording 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.500
 there is no memory let's install a flash drive 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 and so having turned on the recorder we can 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.600
 follow his work with 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.070
 LED having three colors green 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.770
 blue and red 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.619
 from here we get data about being under way 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.990
 does the battery charge record and so on 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.189
 notice the switch under 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.280
 name vox 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.310
 on the right activating it you set 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.869
 the mode in which the recorder will be 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.299
 analyze the volume of the noise around in 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.340
 If, within two minutes , 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.009
 will not exceed 65 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.859
 moron device will automatically go into 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.079
 standby stop recording work 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.929
 will resume immediately after increasing 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.060
 noise level recorded video 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.000
 automatically saved to card 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.700
 vodka memory videos that I made during 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.060
 I offer quality testing time 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.950
 estimate your own viewing angle 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.959
 md80 camera is 80 degrees 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.510
 battery capacity 260 milliamps 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.000
 hours as I said this should 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.640
 enough for about two hours continuous 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.620
 work or 250 hours of operation 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.709
 expectations 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.769
 among possible uses md80 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.819
 can be called as portable 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.829
 DVR and car 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.170
 device and even a webcam 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.799
 computer connection occurs 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.799
 elementary
