reminded<00:00:29.160> me<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> Terminator<00:00:29.760> 2<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.779> it's

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
reminded me of Terminator 2 I think it's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.170 
reminded me of Terminator 2 I think it's
because<00:00:31.170> they're<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.470> silver<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.910> think

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
because they're all silver and I think

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.319 
because they're all silver and I think
of<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.540> model<00:00:34.430> t1000<00:00:35.430> when<00:00:35.850> he<00:00:35.940> would<00:00:36.059> melt

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
of that model t1000 when he would melt

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.959 
of that model t1000 when he would melt
into<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> floor<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.309> he'd<00:00:38.430> sneak<00:00:38.730> into

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
into like the floor and he'd sneak into

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.670 
into like the floor and he'd sneak into
a<00:00:39.180> bunch<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.690> different<00:00:39.809> cracks<00:00:40.200> or<00:00:40.350> something

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
a bunch of different cracks or something

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.590 
a bunch of different cracks or something
this<00:00:41.370> looks<00:00:41.550> like<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> material<00:00:42.210> he<00:00:42.329> was<00:00:42.420> made

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this looks like the material he was made

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.569 
this looks like the material he was made
out<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> think<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:43.890> why<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.280> that

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
out of so I think that's why I like that

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
out of so I think that's why I like that
because<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.360> movie<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.660> awesome<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.289> these

kitties and these are very appropriately

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.279

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.130 
named because they have a cute cat eye
silhouette<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.570> really

attitude in their system I think they're

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410

it<00:01:15.270> could<00:01:15.659> air<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.950> act<00:01:17.549> damn<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.540> damn

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it could air and I act damn it but damn

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
it could air and I act damn it but damn
it<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.140> word<00:01:19.320> these<00:01:19.920> sunglasses<00:01:20.130> also

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it is one word these sunglasses also

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.450 
it is one word these sunglasses also
have<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.060> Merit<00:01:21.330> effect<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.830> colors

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
have that Merit effect but the colors

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
have that Merit effect but the colors
are<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.119> cool<00:01:24.600> toned<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> think

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
are more cool toned and so I think

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.499 
are more cool toned and so I think
they're<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:26.939> awesome<00:01:27.180> to

Bedford Street laundry and I have been
wearing<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:35.159> non-stop<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.390> are

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
wearing them non-stop because they are

so<00:01:36.930> freakin<00:01:37.439> comfortable<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.040> love<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.700> retro

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so freakin comfortable I love the retro

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880 
so freakin comfortable I love the retro
print<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> best<00:01:39.869> part<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.530> shorts

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
print but the best part of these shorts

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.789 
print but the best part of these shorts
is<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.700> snapback<00:01:41.970> detail<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> back<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
is the snapback detail on the back so

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
is the snapback detail on the back so
technically<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.579> make<00:01:44.759> them<00:01:44.970> smaller<00:01:45.270> or

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
technically you can make them smaller or

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.060 
technically you can make them smaller or
bigger<00:01:45.630> depending<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> size<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.040> your

more<00:02:08.550> these<00:02:08.670> when<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:08.940> went<00:02:09.090> hiking<00:02:09.330> walls<00:02:09.929> in

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
more these when I went hiking walls in

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.690 
more these when I went hiking walls in
Korea<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.009> was<00:02:11.100> probably<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
Korea and it was probably one of the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.610 
Korea and it was probably one of the
worst<00:02:11.910> decisions<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.569> made<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.290> trip

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
worst decisions I made on that trip

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.340 
worst decisions I made on that trip
because<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.459> freaking<00:02:14.970> hot<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.450> looked<00:02:16.260> at

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
because it was freaking hot I looked at

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.720 
because it was freaking hot I looked at
the<00:02:16.440> temperature<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.310> said<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.610> was<00:02:17.700> going

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the temperature and it said it was going

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.270 
the temperature and it said it was going
to<00:02:17.910> be<00:02:18.030> 75<00:02:18.569> degrees<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.500> was<00:02:19.770> like<00:02:19.950> all<00:02:20.190> right

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
to be 75 degrees so I was like all right

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.820 
to be 75 degrees so I was like all right
I<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.819> handle<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.209> but<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.959> fail<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.500> check<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
I can handle it but I fail to check the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.490 
I can handle it but I fail to check the
humidity<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.420> end<00:02:24.600> result<00:02:24.780> was<00:02:25.230> me

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
humidity and so the end result was me

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.490 
humidity and so the end result was me
sweating<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.520> these<00:02:26.970> overalls<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.140> this

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
sweating in these overalls this is this

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.650 
sweating in these overalls this is this
fabric<00:02:28.980> really<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:29.760> retains<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.390> lot<00:02:30.420> of

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
fabric really really retains a lot of

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
fabric really really retains a lot of
heat<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.200> they're<00:02:31.860> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.069> be<00:02:32.250> really

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
heat so they're going to be really

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.280 
heat so they're going to be really
excellent<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.270> when<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.840> temperature

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
excellent for when the temperature

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
excellent for when the temperature
starts<00:02:34.620> dropping

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
