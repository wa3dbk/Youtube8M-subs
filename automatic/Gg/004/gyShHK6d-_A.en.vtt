00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
player in those little stats there it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880

kind of skim across internet so that was
perfect<00:03:18.569> for<00:03:18.900> him<00:03:19.079> he<00:03:19.260> was<00:03:19.380> doing<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:19.889> quite

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
perfect for him he was doing that quite

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.190 
perfect for him he was doing that quite
a<00:03:20.280> lot<00:03:20.370> found<00:03:21.120> quite<00:03:21.329> effective<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.049> then

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
a lot found quite effective and then

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.039 
a lot found quite effective and then
just<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.950> general<00:03:23.310> aspect<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.090> was<00:03:24.780> it

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
just the general aspect of that was it

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.920 
just the general aspect of that was it
very<00:03:25.290> very<00:03:25.560> good<00:03:25.829> its<00:03:26.340> general<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.150> agility

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
very very good its general and agility

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.840 
very very good its general and agility
and<00:03:28.410> kind<00:03:28.859> of<00:03:28.950> jumping<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.459> things<00:03:29.700> that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and kind of jumping and things that

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.240 
and kind of jumping and things that
aspect<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.870> was<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.319> was<00:03:31.440> decent<00:03:31.620> for<00:03:32.010> me<00:03:32.100> he

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
aspect it was it was decent for me he

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.009 
aspect it was it was decent for me he
was<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.400> scottie<00:03:32.910> wasn't<00:03:33.389> really<00:03:33.540> scoring<00:03:33.810> many

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
was a scottie wasn't really scoring many

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.509 
was a scottie wasn't really scoring many
headers<00:03:34.410> but<00:03:34.440> he<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:34.769> getting<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> end<00:03:35.340> of

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
headers but he was getting on the end of

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.580 
headers but he was getting on the end of
him<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:35.760> popping<00:03:36.600> him<00:03:36.690> onto<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.019> bars<00:03:37.290> into

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
him and popping him onto the bars into

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.259 
him and popping him onto the bars into
all<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:38.010> little<00:03:38.250> places<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.760> which<00:03:39.120> is

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
all the little places like that which is

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.809 
all the little places like that which is
quite<00:03:39.510> good<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.500> then<00:03:41.069> there's<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.370> general

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
quite good and then there's this general

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.420 
quite good and then there's this general
attack<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.329> position<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.989> his<00:03:43.859> work<00:03:44.130> rates

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
attack in position and his work rates

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.920 
attack in position and his work rates
think<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.819> was<00:03:44.910> medium<00:03:45.269> defensive<00:03:45.720> workrate

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
think it was medium defensive workrate

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.050 
think it was medium defensive workrate
that<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:46.889> cause<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.100> slight<00:03:47.670> problem

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
that can cause a slight problem

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.539 
that can cause a slight problem
sometimes<00:03:48.450> when<00:03:48.989> he<00:03:49.709> isn't<00:03:49.829> always<00:03:50.100> making

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
sometimes when he isn't always making

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.979 
sometimes when he isn't always making
those<00:03:50.670> runs<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.269> would<00:03:51.359> want<00:03:51.540> into<00:03:51.840> his

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
those runs that you would want into his

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.430 
those runs that you would want into his
not<00:03:52.200> incredibly<00:03:53.069> attacking<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.109> like<00:03:55.109> the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
not incredibly attacking and like the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.050 
not incredibly attacking and like the
striker<00:03:55.829> was<00:03:56.010> playing<00:03:56.280> next<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.730> him<00:03:56.849> he<00:03:56.970> was

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
striker was playing next to him he was

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.640 
striker was playing next to him he was
always<00:03:57.299> making<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.810> runs<00:03:58.019> forward<00:03:58.260> sprint

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
always making the runs forward sprint

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.069 
always making the runs forward sprint
along<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.400> was<00:03:59.549> trying<00:03:59.910> to<00:03:59.970> hold<00:04:00.569> back<00:04:00.750> as

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
along so I was trying to hold back as

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.569 
along so I was trying to hold back as
much<00:04:01.230> as<00:04:01.290> he<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.680> but<00:04:01.859> eventually<00:04:02.190> he<00:04:02.489> would

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
much as he can but eventually he would

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.270 
much as he can but eventually he would
let<00:04:02.760> himself<00:04:02.910> go<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:04.200> his<00:04:04.349> lightning<00:04:04.829> pace<00:04:05.040> is

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
let himself go and his lightning pace is

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.370 
let himself go and his lightning pace is
very<00:04:05.549> very<00:04:05.790> very<00:04:06.120> quick<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.630> know<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.900> says<00:04:07.019> 82

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
very very very quick I know it says 82

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.949 
very very very quick I know it says 82
on<00:04:07.739> his<00:04:07.859> card<00:04:08.099> stuff<00:04:08.370> but<00:04:09.000> his<00:04:09.269> pace<00:04:09.510> did<00:04:09.720> not

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
on his card stuff but his pace did not

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.229 
on his card stuff but his pace did not
cause<00:04:10.169> me<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.380> problem<00:04:10.440> at<00:04:10.919> all<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.849> overall<00:04:12.150> I

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
cause me a problem at all so overall I

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.780 
cause me a problem at all so overall I
would<00:04:12.510> probably<00:04:12.900> recommend<00:04:13.650> him<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.340> maybe

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
would probably recommend him and maybe

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.129 
would probably recommend him and maybe
wait<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> little<00:04:15.269> bit<00:04:15.389> longer<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.810> his<00:04:15.930> price

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
wait a little bit longer to his price

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.690
