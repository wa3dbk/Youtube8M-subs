items and assembling when you can just
pay<00:01:58.290> $50<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.490> done<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.939> over<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.240> so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
pay $50 and get it done and over with so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.649 
pay $50 and get it done and over with so
anyways<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.950> concept<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> teleprompter<00:02:03.540> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
anyways the concept of a teleprompter is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.069 
anyways the concept of a teleprompter is
simple<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.259> here<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.719> now<00:02:06.719> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
simple and here it is right here now I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.830 
simple and here it is right here now I
knew<00:02:07.619> when<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> purchased<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.720> was

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
knew when I purchased it that it was

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.960 
knew when I purchased it that it was
going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.259> kind<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.709> craft<00:02:11.009> type<00:02:11.790> of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to be kind of a craft type of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.930 
going to be kind of a craft type of
product<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:13.170> what<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.500> have

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
product and so what you have

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.630 
product and so what you have
here<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.330> as<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:15.020> appears<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.590> almost<00:02:15.950> like<00:02:16.130> two

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
here is as it appears is almost like two

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.890 
here is as it appears is almost like two
picture<00:02:17.030> frames<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:18.410> there<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.940> joint<00:02:20.540> here

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
picture frames and there is a joint here

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.210 
picture frames and there is a joint here
and<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.050> joint<00:02:21.290> here<00:02:21.590> holding<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.040> together

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
and a joint here holding it together

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.730 
and a joint here holding it together
there's<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.090> couple<00:02:23.330> drill<00:02:23.720> marks<00:02:24.110> there<00:02:24.350> with

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
of a like a particle board and what was

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.160 
of a like a particle board and what was
really<00:02:31.310> nice<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.730> unexpected<00:02:32.510> there<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.140> a

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
really nice and unexpected there is a

screw for a tripod mount and that's what

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.840 
screw for a tripod mount and that's what
you<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.630> there<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.050> my<00:02:36.320> my<00:02:37.310> quick-release

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
you see there is my my quick-release

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.150 
you see there is my my quick-release
bracket<00:02:38.540> screwed<00:02:39.290> into<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.590> bottom<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.010> this

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
bracket screwed into the bottom of this

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.890 
bracket screwed into the bottom of this
but<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.520> can<00:02:40.700> mount<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.450> standard

but it can mount to a standard

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.440 
but it can mount to a standard
teleprompter<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.910> have<00:02:44.060> some<00:02:44.240> glass

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
teleprompter and you have some glass

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.650 
teleprompter and you have some glass
here<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.440> seller<00:02:46.400> put<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.730> tent<00:02:47.120> on<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.540> and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
here and the seller put a tent on it and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.600 
here and the seller put a tent on it and
it's<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.810> reflective<00:02:48.410> tint<00:02:48.680> which<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.070> required

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
it's a reflective tint which is required

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.900 
it's a reflective tint which is required
in<00:02:50.030> order<00:02:50.540> for<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:50.990> work<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.670> way<00:02:52.790> it

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
in order for this to work so the way it

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.230 
in order for this to work so the way it
works<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.630> have<00:02:53.930> your<00:02:54.830> video<00:02:55.340> camera<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:56.180> a

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
works is you have your video camera on a

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.570 
works is you have your video camera on a
tripod<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.290> then<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.620> have<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.520> a

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
tripod and then you have this on a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.430 
tripod and then you have this on a
tripod<00:02:58.940> right<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.630> front<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.110> video

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
tripod right in front of that video

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.650 
tripod right in front of that video
camera<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.820> video<00:03:02.090> camera<00:03:02.480> will<00:03:02.630> be

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
camera and so the video camera will be

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.290 
camera and so the video camera will be
like<00:03:03.020> this<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.800> what<00:03:04.520> you<00:03:04.550> do<00:03:04.820> is<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.060> take

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
like this and what you do is you take

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.690 
like this and what you do is you take
your<00:03:05.540> iPad<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.440> lay<00:03:06.710> it<00:03:06.890> right<00:03:06.920> here<00:03:07.130> face

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
your iPad and you lay it right here face

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.880 
your iPad and you lay it right here face
up<00:03:07.970> there's<00:03:08.480> plenty<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.930> applications<00:03:09.110> for

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
up there's plenty of applications for

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.500 
up there's plenty of applications for
the<00:03:09.980> iPad<00:03:10.460> that<00:03:10.670> allow<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:13.480> have<00:03:14.480> a

glass<00:04:43.950> which<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.550> fine<00:04:45.030> it's<00:04:45.300> gonna<00:04:45.510> work<00:04:45.750> fine

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
glass which is fine it's gonna work fine

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.130 
glass which is fine it's gonna work fine
anyway<00:04:46.710> however<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:48.090> wasn't<00:04:48.330> applied<00:04:48.810> well

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
anyway however it wasn't applied well

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
there's a couple bubble spots and if

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.440 
there's a couple bubble spots and if
you've<00:04:51.240> ever<00:04:51.480> seen<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.350> bad<00:04:52.920> tint<00:04:53.430> job<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> car

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
that's kind of what this looks like to

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.660 
that's kind of what this looks like to
me<00:04:56.780> which<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:58.140> doesn't<00:04:58.560> affect<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.280> video<00:04:59.580> too

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.420 
me which it doesn't affect the video too
much<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:00.990> wouldn't<00:05:01.290> worry<00:05:01.530> about<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:01.920> but<00:05:02.400> I

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
much so I wouldn't worry about it but I

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.020 
much so I wouldn't worry about it but I
definitely<00:05:03.270> wasn't<00:05:03.930> happy<00:05:04.500> about<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:05.070> so

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030
