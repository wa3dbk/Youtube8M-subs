the tissues of the body where it can be
used<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.969> aorta<00:01:03.480> however<00:01:03.899> develops<00:01:04.500> with

used if the aorta however develops with

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.190 
used if the aorta however develops with
a<00:01:04.799> pinch<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> where<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.689> large

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a pinch in it where it's not large

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.260 
a pinch in it where it's not large
enough<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.619> carry<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.280> blood<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:09.030> some

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
enough to carry all that blood at some

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
enough to carry all that blood at some
point<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:10.320> pressure<00:01:10.710> backs<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.610> heart

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
point then pressure backs up the heart

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
point then pressure backs up the heart
is<00:01:12.510> trying<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.080> hard<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.560> move<00:01:13.740> blood

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
is trying really hard to move blood

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.820 
is trying really hard to move blood
through<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.820> aorta<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.960> order<00:01:16.350> can't

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
through this aorta and they order can't

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
through this aorta and they order can't
carry<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.520> blood<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> heart

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
carry all the blood so the heart

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.410 
carry all the blood so the heart
squeezes<00:01:19.110> extra<00:01:19.950> hard<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.880> blood

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
squeezes extra hard that's blood

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.840 
squeezes extra hard that's blood
pressure<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.229> how<00:01:22.710> would<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.100> know<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.670> your

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
pressure so how would you know if your

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.210 
pressure so how would you know if your
baby<00:01:24.060> had<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> coarctation<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.200> aorta<00:01:25.320> well

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
baby had a coarctation of the aorta well

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.950 
baby had a coarctation of the aorta well
this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> things<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
this is one of the things that the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
this is one of the things that the
doctors<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.500> nurses<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.950> hospital<00:01:29.090> check

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
doctors and nurses in the hospital check

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
doctors and nurses in the hospital check
for<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> things<00:01:31.229> your

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
for and it's one of the things your

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.469 
for and it's one of the things your
baby's<00:01:31.710> doctor<00:01:32.130> should<00:01:32.340> check<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.790> every

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
baby's doctor should check for every

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
baby's doctor should check for every
time<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:33.960> baby<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> wellness<00:01:34.890> exam<00:01:35.280> how

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
time your baby has a wellness exam how

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.969 
time your baby has a wellness exam how
do<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.119> check<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.869> simplest<00:01:37.350> check<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
do we check the simplest check is to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.700 
do we check the simplest check is to
listen<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> heart<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.689> should<00:01:40.259> hear<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
listen to the heart we should hear a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
listen to the heart we should hear a
murmur<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.430> some<00:01:41.729> cases<00:01:42.000> that's<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> noise

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
murmur in some cases that's the noise

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
murmur in some cases that's the noise
made<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:43.649> blood<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.979> rushing<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.790> the

i<00:02:13.040> Orta<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.580> those<00:02:13.970> are<00:02:14.000> clues<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.599> we<00:02:14.750> can

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
i Orta and those are clues that we can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.990 
i Orta and those are clues that we can
look<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.409> when<00:02:16.010> doctors<00:02:16.400> are<00:02:16.519> worried<00:02:16.879> about

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
look for when doctors are worried about

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.149 
look for when doctors are worried about
that<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.689> do<00:02:17.900> check<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> baby's<00:02:18.560> blood<00:02:18.799> pressure

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
that we do check a baby's blood pressure

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.280 
that we do check a baby's blood pressure
we<00:02:19.730> usually<00:02:19.849> check<00:02:20.269> blood<00:02:20.510> pressure<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:21.049> both

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
we usually check blood pressure in both

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.069 
we usually check blood pressure in both
arms<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.829> in<00:02:22.280> both<00:02:22.430> legs<00:02:22.760> because<00:02:23.689> the<00:02:23.930> blood

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
arms and in both legs because the blood

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.440 
arms and in both legs because the blood
pressure<00:02:24.409> will<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.709> much<00:02:25.010> higher<00:02:25.280> before<00:02:26.209> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
pressure will be much higher before the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.850 
pressure will be much higher before the
part<00:02:26.659> of<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.810> artery<00:02:27.140> where<00:02:27.379> it's<00:02:27.500> pinched

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
part of the artery where it's pinched

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.580 
part of the artery where it's pinched
off<00:02:28.040> then<00:02:28.549> it<00:02:28.670> will<00:02:28.879> be<00:02:29.060> after<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:29.959> blockage

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
off then it will be after that blockage

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.250 
off then it will be after that blockage
now<00:02:31.310> there<00:02:31.730> are<00:02:31.760> some<00:02:31.940> rare<00:02:32.480> kidney<00:02:32.750> diseases

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
now there are some rare kidney diseases

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.470 
now there are some rare kidney diseases
in<00:02:33.709> babies<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.340> may<00:02:34.489> also<00:02:34.760> cause<00:02:35.180> high<00:02:35.450> blood

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
in babies that may also cause high blood

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.530 
in babies that may also cause high blood
pressure<00:02:36.049> but<00:02:36.860> they<00:02:37.519> are<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.000> rare<00:02:38.299> it's

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
pressure but they are so rare it's

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.949 
pressure but they are so rare it's
probably<00:02:39.019> not<00:02:39.260> even<00:02:39.530> worth<00:02:39.859> going<00:02:40.159> into<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
probably not even worth going into the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.449 
probably not even worth going into the
biggest<00:02:42.470> thing<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:42.859> look<00:02:43.069> at<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.430> a

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
biggest thing that we look at is a

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.690 
biggest thing that we look at is a
baby's<00:02:43.909> growth<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.780> development<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.980> if<00:02:46.430> your

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
baby's growth and development so if your

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.220 
baby's growth and development so if your
doctor<00:02:46.879> notices<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.659> your<00:02:47.810> baby<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.079> not

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
