00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590

through some of my older hard drives
one<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> thing<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> intrigued<00:00:26.790> me<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.270> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
one of the thing that intrigued me was a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.679 
one of the thing that intrigued me was a
lick<00:00:28.110> I<00:00:28.380> think<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.980> created<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.670> 2007<00:00:30.480> or

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
lick I think I created in 2007 or

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.150 
lick I think I created in 2007 or
something<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.020> that<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.770> doesn't<00:00:31.980> really

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
something like that it doesn't really

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.770 
something like that it doesn't really
matter<00:00:32.400> as<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.730> turned<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.060> to<00:00:33.239> be<00:00:33.270> quite<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
matter as it turned out to be quite a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
matter as it turned out to be quite a
challenge<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.320> me<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.530> play<00:00:34.710> today<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.520> I've

revisited it so I thought I provide the
tap<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.300> backing<00:00:39.480> track<00:00:39.840> because<00:00:40.230> I'm

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
tap and the backing track because I'm

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.260 
tap and the backing track because I'm
pretty<00:00:40.710> curious<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.580> you<00:00:41.640> guys<00:00:41.970> deal

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
cheers okay let's have a look at how

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.069 
cheers okay let's have a look at how
this<00:00:53.040> thing<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.460> slow<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
this thing that was slow and what it is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.810 
this thing that was slow and what it is
it's<00:00:55.260> basically<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:56.010> series<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> art

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it's basically just a series of art

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.040 
it's basically just a series of art
videos<00:00:57.440> sequenced<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.040> few<00:00:59.340> different<00:00:59.640> ways

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
videos sequenced in a few different ways

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.120 
videos sequenced in a few different ways
mostly<00:01:01.050> utilizing<00:01:03.380> strings<00:01:04.380> give<00:01:04.559> arpeggios

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
mostly utilizing strings give arpeggios

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.630 
mostly utilizing strings give arpeggios
as<00:01:05.309> well<00:01:05.520> as<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.850> old<00:01:07.280> free<00:01:08.280> string

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
as well as the old free string

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.109 
as well as the old free string
traditional<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.840> picture<00:01:10.229> type<00:01:10.440> patterns<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
traditional or picture type patterns and

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.310 
traditional or picture type patterns and
if<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> put<00:01:12.420> them<00:01:12.570> together<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> play<00:01:13.170> them

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
if you put them together to play them

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:22.030 
if you put them together to play them
slowly<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.740> goes<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.040> this

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.020 

actually<00:01:23.040> honest<00:01:23.250> sounds<00:01:23.490> horrible<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:23.970> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
actually honest sounds horrible when you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.270 
actually honest sounds horrible when you
play<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.299> slow<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.750> there's<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:26.040> key

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
play it slow because there's this key

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.820 
play it slow because there's this key
right<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.869> that<00:01:27.869> clashes<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> E<00:01:28.680> flat

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
right here that clashes with the E flat

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.980 
right here that clashes with the E flat
minor<00:01:29.190> harmony<00:01:29.760> so<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.510> ghost<00:01:30.690> note

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
minor harmony so it's just a ghost note

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.149 
minor harmony so it's just a ghost note
because<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> play<00:01:31.920> fast<00:01:33.920> doesn't<00:01:34.920> really

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
because if you play fast doesn't really

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.100 
because if you play fast doesn't really
matter<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.970> don't<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.330> down<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.510> it<00:01:36.900> it's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
matter you don't be down here it it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.370 
matter you don't be down here it it's
just<00:01:37.290> something<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.979> fills<00:01:38.580> up<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> space

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
just something that fills up the space

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
just something that fills up the space
so<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.830> into<00:01:40.979> two<00:01:41.369> more

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 

both<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.380> major<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.580> same<00:01:47.790> thing<00:01:48.030> two

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
both be major and the same thing two

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.890 
both be major and the same thing two
frets<00:01:48.480> out<00:01:52.040> comes<00:01:53.040> an<00:01:53.220> interesting<00:01:53.370> little<00:01:54.090> B

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
frets out comes an interesting little B

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.440 
frets out comes an interesting little B
flat<00:01:55.110> minor<00:01:55.350> sequence<00:01:55.830> goes<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.220> this

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.240 

that's<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:00.840> where<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.050> use<00:02:01.260> some<00:02:01.590> some

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that's actually where I use some some

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.360 
that's actually where I use some some
pull<00:02:02.670> offs<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.120> sweeps<00:02:03.890> I'm<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.070> gonna<00:02:05.160> play

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
pull offs and sweeps I'm just gonna play

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.590 
pull offs and sweeps I'm just gonna play
it<00:02:05.400> once<00:02:05.610> more<00:02:05.760> I'm<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:05.970> really<00:02:06.150> sure<00:02:06.390> how<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
it once more I'm not really sure how to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.210 
it once more I'm not really sure how to
play<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.290> playing<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.620> fast<00:02:07.860> because

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
play it if I'm playing it fast because

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.300 
play it if I'm playing it fast because
it's<00:02:08.340> something<00:02:08.820> I'm<00:02:09.090> doing<00:02:09.330> intuitively<00:02:10.229> but

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.390 

then<00:02:14.310> serious<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.970> sweeps<00:02:15.980> which<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> most

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
then serious of sweeps which is the most

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.830 
then serious of sweeps which is the most
unforgettable<00:02:19.940> lot<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.060> shifting<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.630> though

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
unforgettable lot of shifting in though

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.700 
unforgettable lot of shifting in though
in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> left<00:02:23.130> hand<00:02:27.050> going<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.350> all<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
in the left hand going down all the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.260 
in the left hand going down all the
inversions<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.280> B<00:02:29.490> flat<00:02:29.670> minor

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.300 

Oh
