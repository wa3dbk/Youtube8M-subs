00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.289
 otherworldly creatures 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.769
 Vanya to the word painting as I him 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.410
 use as it existed grass 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.660
 experienced art but somewhere before 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.320
 twentieth century is of course a relationship 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.320
 no has 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.730
 Yes, in principle, if we consider that 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.780
 the buyer is equally looking for the canvas 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.830
 oil is a normal situation if 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.260
 of course here is such a strange her nell 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:02.710
 pseudo chew without erasing not painting like 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.710
 everyone thinks 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.439
 and now I thought what that might mean 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.439
 relation to painting 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.280
 painting why I insist on 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.680
 the volume that you need to carefully use this 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.310
 words and that is scripture live or 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.660
 transfer of live on some surface 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.330
 canvas and cypress wall boards since 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.230
 we are no longer a live transmission 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.690
 we deal that is, nobody cares how 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:49.530
 the girl under the translucent skin 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.020
 warm blood is built as a radiant and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.740
 eyes or like and so on so on up 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.560
 infinity can be like a mist swirling 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.390
 waste, and no one cares nothing of 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.010
 what does this have to do with it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.580
 the first root of the word 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.230
 the letter remained alive which represents 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.970
 some kind of painted surface 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.400
 actually in this case the whole place in 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.730
 that you are dealing with some of 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.489
 painted surface mechanically or 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.650
 with your own hand the whole month 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.290
 that someone painted over 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.850
 surface that check from this place g 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.850
 leads to his problems too 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:46.310
 those whom I know you can 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.120
 characterize as a human amphibian 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.550
 which is to live the seas dragged him on 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.730
 he has enough of his gills there 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.310
 the air is trying to concept what is going on 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.080
 how to survive in these brand new ones 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.600
 conditions that is in the conditions of modern 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.180
 arts and he was taught to swim in the ocean 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.130
 poduma it seemed that the ocean had dried it 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.010
 graduated from high school teachers there are no exams 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.710
 no he is somewhere already in the desert 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.470
 he has gills fins he can 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.330
 beautiful you there now i don't know 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.600
 what tricks in the water showed water 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.590
 only there is actually one who can 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.810
 become amphibians get out and well how is it 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.510
 happened there how many hundreds of millions 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.340
 or billions don't know years ago 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.730
 get to the surface this little animal 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.010
 I could fins fell away 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.170
