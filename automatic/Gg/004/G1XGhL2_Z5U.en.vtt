00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 ahoy from my ship 2 before dubai 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.920
 we are at the moment 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.940
 and the question is of course why now 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.600
 I have actually for dubai 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.160
 decided 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.450
 in winter when I want it warm 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.650
 I do not have that many 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.809
 possibilities if I am not so far 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.639
 for example , one wants to fly 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.049
 I can clearly say that I have now 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.330
 already made canaries twice 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.580
 Cruise caribbean would be back 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.350
 considerably further from south america or 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.060
 asia aside 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.480
 that's also pretty far and dubai 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.220
 is such a goal that is so achievable 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
 with a flight time of about six 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 Hours needed by now 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.980
 frankfurt to dubai how is the flight 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.350
 that was now a folk father with 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 condor and what can i say that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 airplane was an ancient device 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.270
 aircraft and the seat distance was 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.219
 low low low so that was 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.780
 really there already pretty 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.480
 You can not do it pretty exhausting 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.399
 say differently what is annoying in the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
 destination dubai the flight times are 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.730
 extremely unfavorable one comes either 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.430
 very early in the morning 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.840
 or very late in the evening so that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.949
 case we had the night flight and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.339
 we have arrived 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.520
 4 o'clock 15 dubai time that then corresponds 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.560
 Germany 1 o'clock 15 so that's one 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.390
 time where i just go to bed 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.369
 go and how is that normally 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.659
 Normally you will get on the ship 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.640
 but can not get into it yet 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.189
 Cabin because they are of course still 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.259
 inhabited but there you are only at 14 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.790
 About 15 o'clock also so that we ourselves 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.759
 We have now considered 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.650
 do it differently and we have that 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.770
 first stayed in the hotel and have 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.450
 then checked in at six in the morning 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.040
 Passport control before at the airport 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.259
 That took me a long time 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.820
 snake and then about 45 minutes 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.619
 wait, of course that's the way you look 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.570
 middle of the night you can read it at 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 pretty annoying but with the hotel 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.899
 has turned out quite well and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
 in the morning comfortable and completely 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.340
 cheap by taxi the few miles 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.899
 then driven here on the ship and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.640
 if you arrive here in the afternoon 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.899
 then the whole plane does not come 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.270
 come to the so yes as I said 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.439
 early in the morning or late at night so that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.600
 we did not have to wait at all and 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.590
 So it was right on board 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.329
 really good 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.729
 yes there will be some videos from 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.140
 this journey and you can then 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.509
 I always see in this playlist 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.539
 Link you now at the end and yes 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.650
 check it out 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.189
 otherwise see you again next time 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.189
 time distance
