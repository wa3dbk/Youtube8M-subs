already started on a project and got got
the<00:00:38.610> basics<00:00:39.149> down<00:00:39.680> I'm<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> revise

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the basics down I'm just got to revise

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.400 
the basics down I'm just got to revise
it<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.570> finished<00:00:42.840> product

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it to the finished product

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
it to the finished product
we<00:00:43.559> don't<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.950> doing<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.370> length<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.850> video

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
we don't be doing that a length of video

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.299 
we don't be doing that a length of video
I<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:46.320> wild<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:46.980> Bezdek<00:00:47.370> forget<00:00:47.700> apart

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
I go wild on this Bezdek forget apart

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.639 
I go wild on this Bezdek forget apart
and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.489> start<00:00:50.820> your<00:00:51.000> portions<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:52.079> portions

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and then start your portions my portions

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.930 
and then start your portions my portions
I'll<00:00:53.340> feed<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.210> Meccano<00:00:55.640> Center<00:00:56.640> stripped

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I'll feed a bit Meccano Center stripped

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.010 
I'll feed a bit Meccano Center stripped
it<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> top<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.719> string

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it to the top that is for the string

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.310 
it to the top that is for the string
which<00:01:01.230> goes<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.829> basically<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> door<00:01:03.049> okay<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
which goes to basically the door okay I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
which goes to basically the door okay I
figured<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:07.729> this<00:01:08.729> sensors<00:01:11.030> its

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
figured out that this sensors its

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
figured out that this sensors its
sensors<00:01:12.689> basically<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> fire<00:01:13.710> portions<00:01:14.250> part

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
sensors basically the fire portions part

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.120 
sensors basically the fire portions part
little<00:01:14.700> gaps<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> plastic<00:01:16.130> well

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
little gaps in the plastic well

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.230 
little gaps in the plastic well
basically<00:01:17.820> toked<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.229> five<00:01:19.409> gaps

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
basically toked up all the five gaps

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.039 
basically toked up all the five gaps
because<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.360> only<00:01:21.509> want<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:23.659> try<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> die

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
because I only want it to go try to die

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.330 
because I only want it to go try to die
so<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> hundred<00:01:26.220> eighty<00:01:26.369> degrees

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
so I want at the hundred eighty degrees

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.160 
so I want at the hundred eighty degrees
cut<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.670> basically<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> opposite<00:01:30.960> side

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
cut so basically on the opposite side

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
cut so basically on the opposite side
119<00:01:31.829> degrees<00:01:31.920> from<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> wall<00:01:32.520> my<00:01:32.610> cat<00:01:32.880> I'll

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
119 degrees from the wall my cat I'll

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.679 
119 degrees from the wall my cat I'll
put<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> cat<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.229> sense<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.420> 50/50<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
put a cat so that sense is it a 50/50 so

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.760 
put a cat so that sense is it a 50/50 so
on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.380> upstroke<00:01:37.860> opens<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.320> door<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
on the upstroke opens the door on a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.609 
on the upstroke opens the door on a
downstroke<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.759> shuts<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.210> door<00:01:42.619> fairly

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
downstroke it shuts the door fairly

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.270 
downstroke it shuts the door fairly
simple<00:01:43.920> ready<00:01:44.899> okay<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.380> basically<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.130> what

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
simple ready okay so basically but what

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.850 
simple ready okay so basically but what
about<00:01:47.460> together<00:01:48.860> shape<00:01:49.860> physically<00:01:50.369> work

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
about together shape physically work

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.770 
about together shape physically work
okay<00:01:52.860> I've<00:01:53.430> made<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.790> little<00:01:54.030> pulley<00:01:54.299> system

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
okay I've made a little pulley system

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.859 
okay I've made a little pulley system
seat<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:56.009> represent<00:01:56.579> where<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.299> door<00:01:57.600> this

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
seat to represent where the door this

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.550 
seat to represent where the door this
would<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.140> sitting<00:01:58.380> flat<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> surface<00:01:59.189> a

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
would be sitting flat on the surface a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.149 
would be sitting flat on the surface a
big<00:02:01.560> ID<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:03.180> string<00:02:03.479> would<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:04.159> sitting

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
big ID and the string would be sitting

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.249 
big ID and the string would be sitting
over<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.640> top<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:08.420> well<00:02:09.420> he<00:02:09.629> says<00:02:09.899> trying

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
over the top like so well he says trying

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.390 
over the top like so well he says trying
do<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.500> one-handed

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
do it one-handed

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.520 
do it one-handed
Hey<00:02:13.400> look<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.910> will<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.420> helping<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:14.930> light<00:02:15.200> side

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
Hey look I will be helping on light side

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.710 
Hey look I will be helping on light side
but<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.430> revised<00:02:16.760> would<00:02:17.030> be<00:02:17.180> using<00:02:17.540> better

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
but in the revised would be using better

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.440 
but in the revised would be using better
spring<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:19.420> okay<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:22.180> why<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.239> is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
spring and so on okay so that why it is

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.740 
spring and so on okay so that why it is
that<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.879> need<00:02:26.980> open<00:02:27.980> position<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:28.750> now

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
that is it's a need open position so now

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.440 
that is it's a need open position so now
we<00:02:30.319> will<00:02:30.500> start<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:31.130> let's<00:02:31.730> say<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.180> timer

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
we will start it let's say the timer

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.660 
we will start it let's say the timer
says<00:02:32.750> what<00:02:33.050> time<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.590> close<00:02:39.220> box<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.459> eight

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
says what time to close box the eight

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.070 
says what time to close box the eight
centimeters<00:02:41.360> down<00:02:41.599> or<00:02:42.260> eight<00:02:42.500> inches<00:02:43.160> down<00:02:43.459> to

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
centimeters down or eight inches down to
