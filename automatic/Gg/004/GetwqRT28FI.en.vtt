00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790

this<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.860> minis<00:01:14.450> but<00:01:16.070> now<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.490> really

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this of these minis but now I really

and I think it looks very nice of course
it's<00:03:39.280> it's<00:03:39.730> crap<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:41.110> don't<00:03:41.459> don't<00:03:42.459> worry<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
it's it's crap so don't don't worry the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.210 
it's it's crap so don't don't worry the
finished<00:03:43.420> model<00:03:43.570> will<00:03:44.350> be<00:03:44.530> thought<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:45.070> look

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
finished model will be thought to look

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.130 
finished model will be thought to look
like<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:47.620> we<00:03:47.769> have<00:03:50.070> black<00:03:51.070> paint<00:03:51.489> and

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
like this here we have black paint and

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.930 
like this here we have black paint and
magenta<00:03:53.140> highlight<00:03:55.470> it's<00:03:56.470> too<00:03:57.190> red<00:03:57.430> for<00:03:57.760> my

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
magenta highlight it's too red for my

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.550 
magenta highlight it's too red for my
taste<00:03:58.630> but<00:04:00.060> looks<00:04:01.060> pretty<00:04:01.420> nice

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
taste but looks pretty nice

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.140 
taste but looks pretty nice
and<00:04:04.090> here<00:04:05.090> is<00:04:06.370> black<00:04:07.370> with<00:04:08.890> gray<00:04:09.890> violets<00:04:10.819> and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
and here is black with gray violets and

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.490 
and here is black with gray violets and
I<00:04:11.569> think<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:12.050> is<00:04:12.260> this<00:04:13.250> is<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.580> best

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
I think this is this is the best

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.120 
I think this is this is the best
