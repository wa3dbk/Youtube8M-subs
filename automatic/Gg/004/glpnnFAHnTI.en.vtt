we're<00:04:34.249> gonna<00:04:34.400> shoot<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.849> bulletproof<00:04:35.150> glass

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
we're gonna shoot the bulletproof glass

00:04:35.509 --> 00:05:06.879 
we're gonna shoot the bulletproof glass
right<00:04:35.960> here<00:04:58.419> is<00:04:59.419> the<00:04:59.659> camera<00:04:59.870> safe<00:05:05.889> that's

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
right here is the camera safe that's

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.170 
right here is the camera safe that's
what<00:05:07.069> bulletproof<00:05:07.460> glass<00:05:07.580> looks<00:05:07.909> like<00:05:08.029> from

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
what bulletproof glass looks like from

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.520 
what bulletproof glass looks like from
the<00:05:08.330> inside<00:05:10.810> recording

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.600 

so<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:17.680> doesn't<00:05:18.010> count<00:05:18.190> because<00:05:18.370> I'm<00:05:18.520> a

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
so this doesn't count because I'm a

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.900 
so this doesn't count because I'm a
terrible<00:05:18.880> shot<00:05:19.000> I<00:05:19.450> was<00:05:19.750> trying<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.020> hit<00:05:20.140> here

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
right on the edge so punched right

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.960 
right on the edge so punched right
through<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.790> took<00:05:24.910> out<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.090> chunk<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.450> tree

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
through and took out a chunk of the tree

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.400 
through and took out a chunk of the tree
hey<00:05:27.970> it's<00:05:28.090> recording<00:05:28.480> okay<00:05:29.050> so<00:05:29.110> we're<00:05:29.320> gonna

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
hey it's recording okay so we're gonna

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.570 
hey it's recording okay so we're gonna
see<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.680> hollow-point<00:05:30.160> does<00:05:30.340> to<00:05:30.490> the

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
see the hollow-point does to the

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.490 
see the hollow-point does to the
bulletproof<00:05:30.850> glass<00:05:31.120> on<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.900> second<00:05:32.260> shot<00:05:32.380> the

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
bulletproof glass on the second shot the

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:45.140 
bulletproof glass on the second shot the
first<00:05:32.710> shot<00:05:32.980> is<00:05:33.130> just<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.520> different<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:38.620> ready

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.380 

okay<00:05:46.980> okay<00:05:47.980> so<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:48.400> hollow-point<00:05:49.300> 45<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:51.390> hope

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
okay okay so the hollow-point 45 I hope

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.860 
okay okay so the hollow-point 45 I hope
that<00:05:52.570> focuses<00:05:53.670> but<00:05:54.670> you<00:05:54.760> can<00:05:54.940> see<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.570> can<00:05:55.720> see

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
that focuses but you can see you can see

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.290 
that focuses but you can see you can see
where<00:05:56.020> it<00:05:56.110> tried<00:05:56.320> to<00:05:56.350> expand<00:05:56.970> but<00:05:57.970> it<00:05:58.120> still

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
where it tried to expand but it still

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.020 
where it tried to expand but it still
didn't<00:05:58.540> do<00:05:58.600> much<00:05:58.780> more<00:05:58.960> damage<00:05:59.350> to<00:05:59.500> the<00:05:59.620> glass

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
didn't do much more damage to the glass

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.850 
didn't do much more damage to the glass
so<00:06:01.030> there's<00:06:01.240> the<00:06:01.480> non<00:06:01.960> hollow<00:06:02.290> point<00:06:02.560> in<00:06:02.740> the

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
so there's the non hollow point in the

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.050 
so there's the non hollow point in the
hollow<00:06:03.010> point<00:06:03.250> shot<00:06:03.460> right<00:06:03.640> next<00:06:03.910> to<00:06:03.970> it<00:06:04.000> so

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
hollow point shot right next to it so

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.960 
hollow point shot right next to it so
you<00:06:04.180> could<00:06:04.360> see<00:06:04.390> the<00:06:04.570> comparison<00:06:05.970> here's

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
you could see the comparison here's

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.490 
you could see the comparison here's
nine-millimeter<00:06:07.660> hollow<00:06:07.840> point<00:06:08.200> on<00:06:08.380> the

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
nine-millimeter hollow point on the

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.200 
nine-millimeter hollow point on the
glass<00:06:13.080> good<00:06:14.080> work<00:06:14.260> let's<00:06:14.500> go<00:06:14.620> inspect<00:06:15.210> okay

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
glass good work let's go inspect okay

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.330 
glass good work let's go inspect okay
and<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.420> final<00:06:16.660> shot<00:06:17.230> into<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.620> glass<00:06:17.950> is

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
and the final shot into the glass is

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.540 
and the final shot into the glass is
hollow<00:06:18.760> point<00:06:19.120> nine<00:06:19.390> millimeter<00:06:20.280> and<00:06:21.280> it's<00:06:21.460> he

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
hollow point nine millimeter and it's he

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.000 
hollow point nine millimeter and it's he
actually<00:06:21.940> dug<00:06:22.870> in<00:06:23.080> and<00:06:23.260> broke<00:06:23.470> out<00:06:23.650> a<00:06:23.680> pretty

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
actually dug in and broke out a pretty

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.210 
actually dug in and broke out a pretty
big<00:06:24.250> chunk<00:06:25.140> compared<00:06:26.140> to<00:06:26.230> the<00:06:26.350> 45<00:06:26.770> this<00:06:27.040> with

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
big chunk compared to the 45 this with

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.270 
big chunk compared to the 45 this with
it<00:06:29.100> Gordon
