all right so now that you know the
basics<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.080> different<00:00:13.769> body<00:00:13.950> movements<00:00:14.549> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
basics of different body movements and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.790 
basics of different body movements and
golden<00:00:15.360> rules<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.690> climbing<00:00:16.049> now<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.710> going

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
golden rules of climbing now we're going

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.620 
golden rules of climbing now we're going
to<00:00:16.859> go<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.160> how<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.460> actually<00:00:17.760> hold<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
to go over how to actually hold on to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.540 
to go over how to actually hold on to
things<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> wall<00:00:19.260> how<00:00:19.859> these<00:00:20.039> holds<00:00:20.430> are

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
things on the wall how these holds are

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.550 
things on the wall how these holds are
shaped<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> how<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.449> wall<00:00:21.779> formations<00:00:22.410> are

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
shaped and how the wall formations are

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.380 
shaped and how the wall formations are
shaped<00:00:22.830> which<00:00:23.250> change<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.910> style<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
shaped which change the style of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.620 
shaped which change the style of
climbing<00:00:28.699> all<00:00:29.699> right<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.240> hold<00:00:30.510> we're

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
climbing all right the first hold we're

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.970 
climbing all right the first hold we're
going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.810> talk<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.560> call<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
going to talk about is what we call a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.729 
going to talk about is what we call a
jug<00:00:32.750> basically<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.840> comes<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> idea<00:00:34.260> of

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
jug basically it comes from the idea of

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.170 
jug basically it comes from the idea of
like<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> milk<00:00:35.309> jug<00:00:35.370> handle<00:00:35.850> something<00:00:36.030> you're

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
like a milk jug handle something you're

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.790 
like a milk jug handle something you're
going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> wrap<00:00:36.570> your<00:00:36.600> entire<00:00:36.870> hand<00:00:37.500> around

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
going to wrap your entire hand around

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
going to wrap your entire hand around
this<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.760> basically<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.570> want<00:00:39.930> when

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
this is basically what you want when

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.569 
this is basically what you want when
you're<00:00:40.170> really<00:00:40.500> tired<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.040> want<00:00:41.219> something

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you're really tired you want something

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
you're really tired you want something
this<00:00:41.790> big<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.600> notice<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.020> put<00:00:43.260> my

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
this big if you notice I can put my

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.740 
this big if you notice I can put my
almost<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.800> entire<00:00:43.920> hand<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:45.210> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
almost my entire hand into here just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.560 
almost my entire hand into here just
hold<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.620> positive<00:00:47.340> edge<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.910> really

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
hold on really positive edge a really

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.119 
hold on really positive edge a really
good<00:00:48.719> rest<00:00:48.960> spot<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> ever<00:00:49.710> climbing

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
good rest spot so if you ever climbing

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
good rest spot so if you ever climbing
and<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.280> come<00:00:50.489> across<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.789> jug<00:00:51.239> that's

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
and you come across a jug that's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.660 
and you come across a jug that's
probably<00:00:52.289> where<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.920> hold<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
probably where you want to hold on and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.520 
probably where you want to hold on and
rest<00:00:54.000> before<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.870> climbing<00:00:55.199> gets<00:00:55.350> more

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
rest before the climbing gets more

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.360 
rest before the climbing gets more
difficult<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:01.350> next<00:01:01.680> climbing<00:01:01.980> hold<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> can

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
difficult the next climbing hold you can

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.060 
difficult the next climbing hold you can
come<00:01:02.550> across<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.300> call<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> pinch<00:01:04.070> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
come across is what we call a pinch it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
come across is what we call a pinch it
literally<00:01:05.430> sounds<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:06.900> doing

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
literally sounds like what you're doing

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.960 
literally sounds like what you're doing
is<00:01:07.380> you're<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.950> grab<00:01:08.189> over<00:01:08.490> top<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
is you're going to grab over top and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
is you're going to grab over top and
then<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.479> thumb<00:01:09.720> plays<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.140> integral<00:01:10.260> part

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
then your thumb plays an integral part

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.320 
then your thumb plays an integral part
in<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.010> hold<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.610> you're<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.270> be

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
in this hold is you're going to be

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330 
in this hold is you're going to be
pinching<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> upward<00:01:13.890> pressure<00:01:14.100> of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
pinching with this upward pressure of

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.499 
pinching with this upward pressure of
the<00:01:14.400> thumb<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.000> really<00:01:15.150> locks

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the thumb and that's what really locks

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.420 
the thumb and that's what really locks
you<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> piece<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> really

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
you into the piece now this is a really

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.820 
you into the piece now this is a really
positive<00:01:17.729> tiny<00:01:18.270> pinch<00:01:18.600> sometimes<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.710> get

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
positive tiny pinch sometimes you get

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
positive tiny pinch sometimes you get
some<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.250> wide<00:01:20.700> almost<00:01:21.360> open<00:01:21.720> hand

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
some really wide almost open hand

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.289 
some really wide almost open hand
pinches<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.580> you're<00:01:23.729> really<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> again

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
pinches so you're really going to again

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.210 
pinches so you're really going to again
grab<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.020> fingers<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.070> all

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
grab with your fingers and then it all

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.649 
grab with your fingers and then it all
comes<00:01:26.460> from<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> power<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.420> thumb

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
comes from the power of that thumb

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.819 
comes from the power of that thumb
pushing<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> give<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> extra

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
pushing in to give you the extra

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.539 
pushing in to give you the extra
pressure<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.909> hold<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> hold<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.380 

finally<00:01:35.549> we're<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> go<00:01:35.939> over<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> most

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
finally we're going to go over the most

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.890 
finally we're going to go over the most
notorious<00:01:36.960> hold<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> wall<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.130> sloper<00:01:38.900> by

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
notorious hold on the wall the sloper by

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.929 
notorious hold on the wall the sloper by
most<00:01:40.140> climbers<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.979> least<00:01:41.579> desirable

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
most climbers it's the least desirable

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.730 
most climbers it's the least desirable
hold<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> come<00:01:42.540> across<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:43.170> because<00:01:43.500> this

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
hold to come across just because this

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
hold to come across just because this
hold<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.100> different<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.700> relies<00:01:45.180> purely<00:01:45.570> on

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
hold is different it relies purely on

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.170 
hold is different it relies purely on
friction<00:01:46.290> nothing<00:01:47.250> about<00:01:47.460> edges<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.030> anything

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
friction nothing about edges or anything

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.450 
friction nothing about edges or anything
to<00:01:48.360> grab<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.799> trying<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.250> is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to grab so what you're trying to do is

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
to grab so what you're trying to do is
work<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.030> angle<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> hold<00:01:51.780> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
work with the angle of the hold so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.080 
work with the angle of the hold so
here's<00:01:52.229> my<00:01:52.439> plane<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.009> want<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> push<00:01:53.670> directly

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
here's my plane I want to push directly

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
here's my plane I want to push directly
against<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.720> angle<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> engage<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.680> you're

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
against that angle to engage it you're

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.830 
against that angle to engage it you're
going<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.430> put<00:01:56.549> much<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.390> hand<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
going to put much as your hand as you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
going to put much as your hand as you
can<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> surface<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:58.979> again<00:01:59.219> it's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
can on the surface because again it's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.039 
can on the surface because again it's
all<00:01:59.520> about<00:01:59.549> friction<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.240> surface<00:02:00.570> contact

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
all about friction and surface contact

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.139 
all about friction and surface contact
and<00:02:01.320> try<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.009> keep<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.340> weight<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.579> against

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and try to keep your weight in against

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
and try to keep your weight in against
that<00:02:03.270> angle<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> slope<00:02:04.950> ER

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that angle so really on a slope ER

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550 
that angle so really on a slope ER
friction<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.210> much<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.509> possible<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.170> really

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
friction as much as possible and really

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.550 
friction as much as possible and really
pull<00:02:07.799> against<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.280> angle

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.410 

and<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.430> next<00:02:13.640> hole<00:02:13.790> we're<00:02:13.909> going<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> go<00:02:14.239> over

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and the next hole we're going to go over

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.929 
and the next hole we're going to go over
is<00:02:14.540> called<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.900> crimp<00:02:15.219> so<00:02:16.219> this<00:02:16.430> type<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.670> hole

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
is called a crimp so this type of hole

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.390 
is called a crimp so this type of hole
basically<00:02:17.239> has<00:02:17.689> an<00:02:17.959> edge<00:02:18.230> plane<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.829> top<00:02:19.040> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
basically has an edge plane on top and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.160 
basically has an edge plane on top and
then<00:02:19.909> nothing<00:02:20.090> else<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.750> you're<00:02:20.900> literally

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
then nothing else so you're literally

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.839 
then nothing else so you're literally
just<00:02:21.409> placing<00:02:21.799> your<00:02:21.890> fingers<00:02:22.189> on<00:02:22.310> top<00:02:22.519> trying

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
just placing your fingers on top trying

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.360 
just placing your fingers on top trying
to<00:02:22.939> find<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.269> edge<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.780> pull<00:02:24.439> directly<00:02:24.799> down

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
to find that edge and pull directly down

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.610 
to find that edge and pull directly down
or<00:02:25.640> whatever<00:02:25.849> angle<00:02:26.359> that<00:02:26.450> hold<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.870> at<00:02:27.019> it's

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
or whatever angle that hold is at it's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.229 
or whatever angle that hold is at it's
been<00:02:27.799> a<00:02:27.829> long<00:02:28.040> debate<00:02:28.220> about<00:02:28.459> how<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.849> properly

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
been a long debate about how to properly

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.300 
been a long debate about how to properly
hold<00:02:29.629> these<00:02:29.840> holds<00:02:30.200> some<00:02:30.799> people<00:02:31.099> what<00:02:31.220> they

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
hold these holds some people what they

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.009 
hold these holds some people what they
like<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.519> do<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.970> feel<00:02:32.150> more<00:02:32.329> comfort<00:02:32.870> is

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
like to do to feel more comfort is

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.660 
like to do to feel more comfort is
they'll<00:02:33.500> take<00:02:33.680> their<00:02:33.829> thumb<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:34.129> roll<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.579> on

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
they'll take their thumb and roll it on

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.759 
they'll take their thumb and roll it on
top<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.030> their<00:02:35.269> fingers<00:02:35.659> on<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.959> edge<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.680> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
top of their fingers on the edge of the

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.309 
top of their fingers on the edge of the
hold<00:02:37.010> now<00:02:37.519> what<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:37.879> does<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.569> puts<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.139> really

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
hold now what this does it puts a really

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.709 
hold now what this does it puts a really
sharp<00:02:39.650> bend<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.189> your<00:02:40.219> finger<00:02:40.609> tendons<00:02:41.030> making

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
sharp bend in your finger tendons making

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.899 
sharp bend in your finger tendons making
them<00:02:41.840> more<00:02:41.989> prone<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.379> overuse<00:02:43.129> syndromes<00:02:43.639> and

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
them more prone to overuse syndromes and

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.270 
them more prone to overuse syndromes and
wear<00:02:44.359> and<00:02:44.540> tear<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.439> to<00:02:45.500> reduce<00:02:45.829> that<00:02:46.220> and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
wear and tear so to reduce that and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.640 
wear and tear so to reduce that and
climb<00:02:46.700> longer<00:02:47.209> what<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> really<00:02:48.169> encourage<00:02:48.260> is

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
climb longer what I really encourage is

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.860 
climb longer what I really encourage is
do<00:02:48.769> an<00:02:48.859> open<00:02:49.280> hand<00:02:49.519> crimp<00:02:49.849> this<00:02:50.419> is<00:02:50.599> where<00:02:50.750> your

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
do an open hand crimp this is where your

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.809 
do an open hand crimp this is where your
fingers<00:02:51.230> grab<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.650> edge<00:02:51.799> your<00:02:52.489> hand<00:02:52.700> is

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
fingers grab the edge your hand is

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.119 
fingers grab the edge your hand is
really<00:02:53.120> relaxed<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:54.349> allows<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:55.010> your

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
really relaxed this allows just your

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.800 
really relaxed this allows just your
fingers<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.609> engage<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.299> you<00:02:56.389> can<00:02:56.540> put<00:02:56.689> your

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
fingers to engage and you can put your

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.000 
fingers to engage and you can put your
thumb<00:02:56.959> on<00:02:57.109> the<00:02:57.230> side<00:02:57.409> for<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> little<00:02:57.769> more

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
thumb on the side for a little more

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.119 
thumb on the side for a little more
support<00:02:58.159> but<00:02:58.879> at<00:02:59.090> all<00:02:59.359> costs<00:02:59.870> avoid<00:03:00.129> rolling

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
support but at all costs avoid rolling

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.720 
support but at all costs avoid rolling
your<00:03:01.280> thumb<00:03:01.489> on<00:03:01.519> top<00:03:01.669> of<00:03:02.000> your<00:03:02.150> fingers<00:03:06.609> so<00:03:07.609> in

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
your thumb on top of your fingers so in

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.059 
your thumb on top of your fingers so in
round<00:03:07.879> climbing<00:03:08.450> it's<00:03:09.139> usually<00:03:09.409> referred<00:03:09.709> to

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
round climbing it's usually referred to

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.670 
round climbing it's usually referred to
having<00:03:10.639> static<00:03:11.090> movements<00:03:11.840> now<00:03:12.349> what<00:03:12.530> that

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
having static movements now what that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.319 
having static movements now what that
means<00:03:12.919> is<00:03:13.129> that<00:03:13.159> when<00:03:13.549> I'm<00:03:13.639> going<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.879> grab<00:03:14.150> on

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
means is that when I'm going to grab on

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.659 
means is that when I'm going to grab on
something<00:03:14.750> I'm<00:03:14.959> just<00:03:15.650> going<00:03:15.889> to<00:03:15.919> reach<00:03:16.370> and

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
something I'm just going to reach and

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.330 
something I'm just going to reach and
grab<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:16.879> next<00:03:17.329> piece<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:17.780> I'll<00:03:17.840> demonstrate

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
grab the next piece and I'll demonstrate

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.000 
grab the next piece and I'll demonstrate
so<00:03:19.340> wrap<00:03:19.549> climbing<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.120> here<00:03:20.739> you're<00:03:21.739> going<00:03:21.919> to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
so wrap climbing is here you're going to

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.939 
so wrap climbing is here you're going to
statically<00:03:22.609> reach<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.299> grab<00:03:23.569> get<00:03:24.560> your<00:03:24.680> feet

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
statically reach and grab get your feet

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:34.440 
statically reach and grab get your feet
higher<00:03:27.760> step<00:03:28.760> up

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.690 

so<00:03:35.050> that's<00:03:35.230> all<00:03:35.440> considered<00:03:35.890> static<00:03:36.250> moving

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
so that's all considered static moving

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.750 
so that's all considered static moving
because<00:03:36.790> it's<00:03:37.000> really<00:03:37.420> slow
