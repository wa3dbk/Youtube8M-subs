00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello everyone we find ourselves on the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.719
 wg server one is with pilou in the process of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.840
 check in this gap we have big 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.260
 worries right now the act of the server 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.050
 so instead of hacking accounts from 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.599
 some players on the server 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.570
 so we check a little bit we had 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.329
 had clean the white list 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 finally the look heap had worked well 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.840
 for for to try to find the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 problem solution 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 so we had seals of afp were 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.309
 put everywhere we had from the west 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.920
 the leader here are things really 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.100
 awesome on a server on tifour where we 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.210
 put himself between us to be 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.850
 on a server a bit mature and that's 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 so that's not cool 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.360
 so here we are checking a 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.520
 grand nephew to b 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.860
 all places this is typical 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.880
 someone coming down and hatches 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.260
 like that just to annoy the world 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 we had a problem I think it's 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:22.300
 thomas who even had a problem 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.890
 sorry for the sound ah yes we had 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.570
 thomas with had worries 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.410
 apparently with his own since 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.940
 got disconnected by getting 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:37.930
 reconnecting he was at another place 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.869
 and the wii so here's thomas had some 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.520
 worries he will reconnect to another 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.200
 where they had connected to the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.340
 standby so that's clearly it's his 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.840
 account that had been hacked but 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.460
 apparently it's not the only one because 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.990
 that we have reinstalled the white list 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.820
 by not integrating while waiting to see 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.090
 what was going on and boom what that 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.410
 start again either he was innocent or 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.170
 it was not his account that had been hacked 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.670
 there are other things and many 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.690
 contacts and on the same server that's 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.160
 still a little strange 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.570
 unless they have people who are 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:18.820
 know yesterday she so in my opinion to 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.239
 my sense here it is it is perhaps the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.190
 server that has a problem 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.530
 I know I know nothing there 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.240
 this time both of them both 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.900
 people who have been affected is 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.300
 these little guys no it will go no 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:41.270
 tigran ans and then pilou this time 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.620
 rather earlier by fire at once 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.100
 it was lava and we found some 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.630
 there too in a mixed l2 men then 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.490
 from the big mystery blow those who did 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.380
 that's back in desert we put a 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.620
 max of obsidian it's completely 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.080
 just plugged around home 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.090
 tigra no and then little by little we had 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.410
 less and less and so his friend just 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.540
 only a few blocks the right on the left 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.540
 so in my opinion have connected by that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:15.170
 so that's what it's really 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.730
 pity it but a nasty blow 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.810
 Stop the series has clearly because 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.790
 that it's still 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.810
 not cool 2000 hours and hours to 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.750
 build something and the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.600
 to find destroyed in 10 seconds 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.190
 what clearly more in the month of June 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.770
 I had for reasons 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.710
 professional I had lifted a 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.950
 little bit of walking on the 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.080
 series for two weeks there but there 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.900
 clearly it is to ask if we are going 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:50.300
 continue what because I really 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.790
 really do not want to do 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.410
 constructions during during 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.190
 hours and hours and then to get 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.750
 find with nothing more loop there is 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.160
 thankfully the look you are there and 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.350
 then to handle the trick to clean the 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.390
 white star is doing a roll back and this is the 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.740
 1st time since me downright the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.250
 palace was destroyed 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.250
 happily now clearly the 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.930
 question is is that is that it 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.000
 completely stop the series and then 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.070
 we're going to have a quiet ep or something 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.810
 but that I would be disgusted because 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.390
 really the multiplayer side is the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.730
 coolest thing what half of 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.260
 things that I like and make 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.170
 players detectors will do some 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.340
 stuff 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.740
 most of these are things that are 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.560
 really cool in multi the multi is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.920
 in minecraft it's really the top 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.750
 now now if the solution 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.100
 it's trying to recover the map and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.370
 of tales to continue solo 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.950
 too bad what I did not do shit 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.130
 no man 2 in any case 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.540
 in any case, it's a 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.880
 little video to say that there will be 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.550
 a pause the time we solve that 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.220
 so I do not know maybe firing 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.930
 fire everyone from the server and then 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.820
 reinstated people one by one in 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.580
 starting with the w ie not 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.900
 not me you're still that the assistant if 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.850
 I do not know what you 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.700
 join assistant there to leave so voila 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:32.220
 what because the thing is not no 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:33.860
 no longer bother him with dirty and to those 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.950
 who were on observe originally what 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.120
 gw especially also it's by integrating 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.330
 new members who found themselves 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.550
 with a server like that it's really 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.740
 shame I will post but I love this 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.819
 because I had removed them in 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.530
 in the desert to see 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:57.520
 something and then I try and croma 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:02.860
 its way really really not cool 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:07.419
 really not nice so I wanted to see 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.039
 what was it all about 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.440
 so here I was able to villager 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.610
 I had nothing more but I even 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.949
 could not connect because their 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.240
 guards seeing this has removed all 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:20.199
 white list but hey there the milk brick 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.380
 needed is really much clearer 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.090
 with this texture pack yeah I would be 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.569
 disgusted at having to leave my castle 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:32.110
 what the palace there we started well 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:42.720
 to advance it starts to be very nice at 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:45.520
 flat the episode fail yeah right so we 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.080
 see there I assure you of nothing it is 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.000
 maybe the last episode on the 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.909
 wg server i will keep you posted to 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.990
 my opinion is rather in this summer there 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:54.520
 may have some episodes but 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.710
 rather practical minecraft especially this 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.440
 that we saw a little on detectors to 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:03.099
 bed on the fireplace since I 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.180
 advanced the design a bit and then ben on 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:07.240
 keeps abreast 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.979
 we keep informed if if those 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.719
 do this type of hack look at this 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.300
 video 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:16.440
 bages and guys it's not cool it's 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.780
 not cool at all and then it's useless 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.130
 or maturity is a little bit 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:27.160
 important after a while it takes 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:31.030
 grow up guys so here is to listen 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.230
 goodbye and then maybe to the 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.230
 next ciao
