00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.670
 today in 30 30 the life of 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.300
 ah 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.299
 ah 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.929
 ah 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.929
 all right 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.930
 look 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.300
 all right 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.900
 it's time to present this 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.020
 set aside the life of we have gotten into 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.390
 the time machine as we usually say 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.100
 we go to the old testament 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.890
 we agree with our friend David and 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.879
 also with a group of people we are 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.879
 hidden in a cave 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.059
 God in his great mercy chose him 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.329
 being the least to be the greatest god 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.040
 God has chosen us God saved us 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.980
 has given us the opportunity to have a 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.960
 good church god has given us 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.479
 God has covered us and we 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.420
 has opened the possibility of serving God 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.580
 in his mercy he has chosen us without 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.009
 But when God chose and anointed 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.290
 David did not sit on the throne 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.960
 David was chosen but David had to 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.300
 prepare David was chosen but he had 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.090
 to fight David had the mandate but 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.920
 had to plot the strategy god in his 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.960
 wonderful mercy has chosen us 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.179
 but we have to get our hands 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.179
 to the work we have to have initiative 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 David put his trust in God and was 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.820
 faithful was wise and was also brave 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.350
 we have heard many times that we must 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.810
 pray knowing that everything depends on God 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.810
 but work as if everything depended on 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.520
 us that's a great truth god does not 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.080
 He sends us to cross our arms and wait 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.480
 everything falls from the sky you have to 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.170
 work but trusting and looking for 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.170
 God's address 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.850
 David had an army of men among 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.860
 which highlighted 30 or 33 now 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.500
 no no I remember it as they in 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.539
 post and interpret the brave 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.540
 David's were not always brave 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.630
 some time ago they were ordinary people and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.510
 current let's read Samuel's first 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.879
 chapter 22 verses 1 and 2 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.370
 being is then gives life there fled to the 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.010
 cave of adulam and when his brothers and 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.049
 all his father's house they knew 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.019
 they came there to him and they joined him 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.030
 all afflicted and everyone who was 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.549
 indebted and all those who were in 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.400
 bitterness of spirit and was made head of 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.579
 them and he had about four hundred 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.579
 mens 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.470
 this is the passage of the durán cave 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.440
 that was there in the block of adulam 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.800
 Well, as we have read vagabonds 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.900
 exiled embittered indebted people who 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.840
 had fled from his social circle for being 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.340
 considered human scum 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.110
 if you like to speculate, it is not possible 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.210
 doubt that there were those who 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.820
 a future would be the brave david 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.800
 we have to meditate on this and we have 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.800
 to put hands to work you have to fight 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.610
 the brave david were forged 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.439
 by the circumstances the brave ones of 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.750
 David were committed to his 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.090
 life with david is what we need 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.640
 as children of god they were originally 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.290
 about 400 men then they left 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.959
 adding more until it becomes a 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.989
 great army of these distinguished themselves 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.970
 30 and of these only stood out some 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.970
 how many do not know if it was 3 or 4 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.810
 I'm going to mention the three brave 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.820
 of David they were willing to give 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.280
 all even give your life for David and his 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.130
 village when they learned that their king had 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.660
 thirst and dreamed of the water of velen them 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.850
 without hesitation they were at the cost of his life 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.370
 because of the risk that this involved 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.950
 your king's dream needs goodbye this 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.300
 same kind of courage through the 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.190
 Christian history of the people of God 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.140
 there have always been men and women who 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.850
 they have given everything up to their own life by 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.760
 achieve or maintain your king's dream 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.980
 these sons and daughters of god have given it 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.720
 everything for him have been able to not 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.590
 back one millimeter in this 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.590
 spiritual battle 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.660
 have been able as we have said of no 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.730
 yield one millimeter of land to 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.380
 satan have been able to wield the 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.450
 sword of the word of god in his hand 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.310
 has fought the battle of faith and of 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.720
 truth against anyone or whatever 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.240
 that rises up against God 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.970
 according to second of samuel chapter 21 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.940
 verse 15 david was about to 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.650
 die in battle but his brave ones what 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.650
