00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.339
 problems in Brazilian public health are not new 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.849
 since the beginning of the last century another point of concern about 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.149
 professionals 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.819
 the support that the general population 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.969
 the objective of forming graduates still capable of acting in the 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.930
 industry planning 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.260
 next to the technician 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.290
 the course of policy analysis if we do health 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.400
 but revealed in collective health 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.879
 you to iob 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.960
 the abih general national demand the tinga 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.730
 I would say then same time two peter praet laps 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.440
 in the training and sanitarist that did not yet exist in undergraduate 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.790
 on the third, the curitibanos already have a whole tradition in the 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.330
 master's doctorate and schaars sedimented segregation exist 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.710
 so there was a star 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.240
 how many untrained people in the country 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.060
 is the first in the academic unit 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.279
 directed specifically with public health was created in 1945 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.300
 in fact they are paulo a pak public health unit 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.920
 under this faculty they did not have the baccalaureate course but she was raised 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.570
 community as well 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.630
 in the 1990s the institute of collective health was created in the bahia station 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.710
 are invited to academic and also already underway 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.940
 are age who register 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.870
 that we have with accumulation of knowledge 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.350
 which records that we have scientific production in the areas of 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.180
 knowledge 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.720
 we had not graduated we had one month 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.650
 the doctor 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.020
 The specialist 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.220
 we recently created the coach intends again 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.990
 in recent years have been 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.930
 then with this course is recreated in the edicts resulting from these vacancies 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.069
 It is a circumstance that I chose the course of external political analysis of health 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.560
 wrong goretti 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.609
 Then I'm already graduated. It'll be a 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.949
 four years since I was a nursing student 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:17.449
 knew some chem teachers and set up a course in 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.449
 adaptation and disappointed tatiane 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.559
 I really liked the pedagogical proposal of the course 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.689
 in how is the cost of this collective is not a bachelors in health 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.290
 collective for me it would work as a specialization to cross 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.290
 magic marolas 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.749
 contents and 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.079
 a differentiated proposal 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.049
 which allows you to work during the day so you will already have objective night course 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.049
 skills and professional skills 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.610
 to narrate strengthen 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.359
 the management of the service management system 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.949
 and these areas the fifth 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.709
 in relation to important 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.439
 a secondary installation in the training is of the other professions to 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.030
 surveillance to promotion actions is a 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.249
 in our constitution that is the document that fashion 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.779
 the functioning of the single health system 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:18.489
 it was made a priority but I discovered we found a year in an article 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.499
 which defines the health system 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.929
 that he should 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:23.369
 producing 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.710
 integrality in service 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.510
 and this integrality is conceptualized at least by the integration between 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.420
 assistance 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.699
 more traditional 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.550
 and promotion actions 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.449
 prevention is the aim of the course is to train professionals who have 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.870
 more capacity 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.139
 to strengthen the single health system 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.469
 this theme 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:49.219
 generous and supportive in its origin its initial ideas but which is still 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.809
 in phase of implementation is in the implementation phase among other things 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:56.879
 they claim other professional skills is exactly what the 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.219
 course is looking to create the purpose of this course has to do with a 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.430
 innovation perspective 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.850
 but we are living in a moment when there is a lot of talk about 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.309
 interdisciplinarity 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:14.179
 and in fact today we have some historical possibilities of conforming 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.179
 in courses né in the case an undergraduate course 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.079
 is an author of interdisciplinary training 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.079
 and this course has this interdisciplinary nature 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.430
 and he has a character 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.020
 it's multipurpose, I'd say because it's got a lot of issues involved with the idea 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.169
 not only of health care but mainly of social production 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.100
 health systems from the health system institutions, but also from the 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.820
 besides the health system I graduated in biomedicine and nowadays also 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.499
 work in this area 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.009
 only with many of the other graduations of the health area 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.979
 there are gaps and need to be filled through 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.020
 she comments that I have been searching through this new course given the last 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.219
 collective action 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.389
 what country 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.159
 rats return 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.240
 a more humane look at some other faculties in the area of ​​management of 

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:12.089
 planning 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:13.460
 In the health area 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.839
 I think as all this is missing 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:20.979
 have entered a large part of the basic training in the other graduations in the 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:21.650
 Cheers 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.650
 I think if this cost it just comes to form 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.509
 bringing 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.699
 methods through these benefits that in other areas people are not 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:30.939
 unusual
