00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and then this like yellow so the slope

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.760 
and then this like yellow so the slope
piece<00:02:14.610> runners<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:17.120> onion<00:02:18.120> pieces<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:19.140> think

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
piece runners to onion pieces I think

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.710 
piece runners to onion pieces I think
these<00:02:19.920> are<00:02:19.980> supposed<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.730> yellow<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> don't

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
