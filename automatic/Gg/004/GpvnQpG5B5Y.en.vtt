 necessary amount of water and the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 dehydration during periods of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.149
 drought the watermelon is also used 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.300
 widely when the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.280
 water sources for example the ancient ones 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 Egyptians used to receive the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.329
 tired and thirsty travelers who

 that watermelon is very beneficial when 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.740

 of water the melons are loaded with 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.640
 vitamin a and b beta carotene lycopene 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.230
 iron zinc potassium and other minerals 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.600

 body like water melons 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.840
 purifies the body of all waste 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.630
 and then it is partially removed through 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 of urine this also helps clean 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.700
 the kidneys ingest melons is also 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.070
 extremely important to preserve 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.990
 our health since they are so rich in 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.330
 iron content like spinach is 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.760
 which means that they are the most 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.280
 rich in iron a lot of iron is 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.320
 found in red meat too but 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.360
 the watermelons are more appropriate to be 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.350
 eaten since they are not so rich in 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.810
 calories like meat is 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.910
 iron as a nutritious mineral increases 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.040
 the energy in our body makes us 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.800
 active and gives us the resistance 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.140
 iron is closely linked to the 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.090
 hemoglobin that carries oxygen from 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.400
 the lungs to all the cells of the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.230
 body and is also part of systems of 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.900
 key enzymes for the production of 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.850
 energy and metabolism iron 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.650
 It also strengthens and protects all 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.900
 organs within our body and it's 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.270
 essential to menstruate women 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.550
 pregnant or lactating whose bodies 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.410
 usually they lack the iron 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.450
 iron plays a decisive role in the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.670
 growth and physical development of 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.710
 children and adolescents as it helps 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.920
 your body to grow in a healthy way and 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.020
 harmonious medical experts also 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.180
 they found that in addition to tomatoes 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.670
 watermelons are one of the richest sources 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.290
 of lycopene a red pigment of origin 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.570
 natural in plants that is a 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.970
 very powerful antioxidant and anti agent 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.620
 cancer the lycopene is the carotene and 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.620
 other asset and it works like 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.540
 antioxidant against free radicals 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.400
 antioxidant properties of the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.440
 natural pigments fight against 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.170
 molecular oxidation by radicals 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.030
 free in our body an infinity 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.610
 number of chemical reactions have 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.409
 place every day a part of the 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.209
 chemical changes in the cells that 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.220
 They used to deliver oxygen to the 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.980
 free radicals that are harmful 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.079
 for the cells and the organism a 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.090
 excessive amount of free radicals 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.920
 interact with the agn or parts of the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.549
 other cells in the body and can 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.099
 damage them 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.019
 but antioxidants in fruits and 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.079
 vegetables counteract and neutralize 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.359
 these organic enemies on the other hand 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.790
 the watermelons provide our bodies with 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.090
 high doses of vitamin c that is also 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.319
 a very powerful antioxidant and not only 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.170
 in addition to the antioxidant properties 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.450
 lycopene also helps improve 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.549
 short and long term memory protects and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.500
 prevents from heart disorders and 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.480
 some types of cancer is 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.549
 extremely beneficial against 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.950
 prostate and testicles and prevents the 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.500
 breast cancer skin and cancer 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.539
 of prostate lycopene is also a 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.920
 detoxifying the waste in the 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.500
 body and inhibits the way 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.600
 of cholesterol the vitamin ay 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.820
 beta-carotene are also abundant in 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.160
 these fruits and improve the accuracy of 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.380
 our vision prevention at the same 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.540
 time diseases related to 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.180
 eyes such as cataracts or the 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.040
 macular degeneration beta-carotene and 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.900
 vitamins are generally fine 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.000
 connected inside our body and 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.130
 besides preserving the health of eyes 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.110
 help the heart to function with 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.480
 precision strengthen the system 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.640
 immunological prevent against cancer and 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.240
 It is an anti aging and anti aging agent
