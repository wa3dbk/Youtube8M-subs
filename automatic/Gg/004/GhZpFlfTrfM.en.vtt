buildings<00:01:36.429> and<00:01:37.429> it<00:01:37.549> looks<00:01:37.729> like<00:01:37.880> we're<00:01:37.999> gonna

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
buildings and it looks like we're gonna

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.359 
buildings and it looks like we're gonna
be<00:01:38.179> at<00:01:38.270> about<00:01:38.450> 47%<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:39.709> I<00:01:39.829> did<00:01:39.979> have<00:01:40.130> six

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
be at about 47% and I did have six

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.010 
be at about 47% and I did have six
barbarians<00:01:40.939> left<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.329> dropped<00:01:41.630> those<00:01:41.810> on

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
barbarians left so I dropped those on

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.779 
barbarians left so I dropped those on
that<00:01:42.049> elixir<00:01:42.709> collector<00:01:43.069> and<00:01:43.340> then<00:01:43.609> now

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
that elixir collector and then now

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.059 
that elixir collector and then now
looking<00:01:44.119> at<00:01:44.209> what<00:01:44.299> we<00:01:44.420> have<00:01:44.599> left<00:01:44.869> we<00:01:45.799> were<00:01:45.920> at

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
looking at what we have left we were at

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.279 
looking at what we have left we were at
48%<00:01:46.639> and<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:47.149> just<00:01:47.329> dropped<00:01:47.450> my<00:01:47.539> clan<00:01:47.810> castle<00:01:48.170> at

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
48% and I just dropped my clan castle at

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.489 
48% and I just dropped my clan castle at
the<00:01:48.319> top<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.889> that<00:01:49.009> was<00:01:49.159> enough<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.549> destroy

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
the top and that was enough to destroy

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.949 
the top and that was enough to destroy
another<00:01:51.499> building<00:01:51.920> or<00:01:52.009> two<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.520> get<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.029> 50%

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
another building or two to get the 50%

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.839 
another building or two to get the 50%
so<00:01:54.469> it<00:01:54.560> all<00:01:54.649> worked<00:01:54.829> out<00:01:54.920> great

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
so it all worked out great

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.370

that<00:01:56.270> one<00:01:56.389> was<00:01:56.569> for<00:01:56.810> about<00:01:56.899> eight<00:01:57.169> trophies

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380

stay away from that wizard tower in the

right now we're making our way through

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.949 
right now we're making our way through
the<00:02:56.430> base<00:02:56.580> we're<00:02:56.760> at<00:02:56.820> 23%<00:02:57.300> we're<00:02:57.660> taking<00:02:57.870> out

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the base we're at 23% we're taking out

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.570 
the base we're at 23% we're taking out
that<00:02:58.050> Inferno<00:02:58.440> tower<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.280> doesn't<00:02:59.489> take

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that Inferno tower so it doesn't take

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.890 
that Inferno tower so it doesn't take
out<00:02:59.700> any<00:02:59.880> of<00:02:59.910> our<00:03:00.030> witches<00:03:00.209> we're<00:03:00.600> taking<00:03:00.780> out

helped out with a few of the buildings

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.820 
helped out with a few of the buildings
but<00:03:05.310> he<00:03:05.430> just<00:03:05.610> went<00:03:05.700> down<00:03:06.410> my<00:03:07.410> witches<00:03:07.709> are

but he just went down my witches are

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.470 
but he just went down my witches are
still<00:03:08.100> making<00:03:08.250> new<00:03:08.520> people<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:08.970> don't<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.330> how

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
still making new people I don't like how

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.090 
still making new people I don't like how
they're<00:03:09.600> hugging<00:03:09.840> into<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.260> Waldo<00:03:10.709> but

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
they're hugging into that Waldo but

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.160 
they're hugging into that Waldo but
they're<00:03:11.340> moving<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.780> now<00:03:12.959> they're

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
they're moving now and now they're

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.479 
they're moving now and now they're
finding<00:03:13.380> their<00:03:13.590> way<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.920> Town<00:03:14.100> Hall<00:03:14.250> so

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
finding their way to the Town Hall so

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.310 
finding their way to the Town Hall so
this<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.850> important<00:03:15.270> part<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.989> just<00:03:16.080> a

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
this is the important part it's just a

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.560 
this is the important part it's just a
matter<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.830> if<00:03:17.220> my<00:03:17.580> witches<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.180> cast<00:03:18.420> the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
matter of if my witches can cast the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.300 
matter of if my witches can cast the
enough<00:03:18.810> skeletons<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.680> keep<00:03:19.920> them<00:03:20.100> protected

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
enough skeletons to keep them protected

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.880 
enough skeletons to keep them protected
so<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.480> inferno<00:03:21.840> tower<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.260> expose<00:03:22.650> stuff

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
so the inferno tower the expose stuff

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.080 
so the inferno tower the expose stuff
like<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.190> doesn't<00:03:23.400> reach<00:03:23.580> them<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.940> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
like that doesn't reach them and it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.250 
like that doesn't reach them and it
looks<00:03:24.239> like<00:03:24.299> we're<00:03:24.540> doing<00:03:24.690> pretty<00:03:24.810> well<00:03:25.110> right

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
looks like we're doing pretty well right

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.590 
looks like we're doing pretty well right
now<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:26.459> cannon<00:03:26.700> on<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.940> right<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.360> out<00:03:27.480> of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
now the cannon on the right is out of

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.920 
now the cannon on the right is out of
range

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
range

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.810 
range
so<00:03:28.320> my<00:03:28.590> witches<00:03:28.890> are<00:03:29.010> safe<00:03:29.190> from<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.760> I

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
so my witches are safe from that and I

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.340 
so my witches are safe from that and I
think<00:03:29.880> they're<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.330> gonna<00:03:30.540> be<00:03:30.660> able<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.900> go

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
think they're just gonna be able to go

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.870 
think they're just gonna be able to go
to<00:03:31.410> work<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:32.070> town<00:03:32.250> hall<00:03:32.459> from<00:03:32.700> with

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
to work on this town hall from with

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.759 
to work on this town hall from with
their<00:03:33.030> ranged<00:03:33.299> attack<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.840> get<00:03:34.470> us<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.680> at

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
their ranged attack and get us to at

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.759 
their ranged attack and get us to at
least<00:03:34.799> one<00:03:35.220> star<00:03:35.900> okay<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.170> Town<00:03:37.350> Hall<00:03:37.530> is

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
least one star okay so the Town Hall is

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.710 
least one star okay so the Town Hall is
just<00:03:38.220> going<00:03:38.400> down<00:03:38.640> right<00:03:38.910> now<00:03:39.090> we<00:03:39.150> did<00:03:39.480> get<00:03:39.600> our

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
just going down right now we did get our

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.050 
just going down right now we did get our
one<00:03:39.900> star<00:03:40.170> we're<00:03:40.530> at<00:03:40.620> 44%<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.760> would<00:03:41.970> be

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
one star we're at 44% so it would be

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.030 
one star we're at 44% so it would be
nice<00:03:42.209> if<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.510> could<00:03:42.600> get<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.840> 50%<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.680> let's<00:03:43.860> let

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
nice if we could get to 50% so let's let

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.770 
nice if we could get to 50% so let's let
our<00:03:44.130> witches<00:03:44.340> run<00:03:44.700> down<00:03:44.910> here<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:45.510> they<00:03:45.630> can

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
our witches run down here and they can

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.080 
our witches run down here and they can
destroy<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.110> few<00:03:46.350> buildings<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.850> they're<00:03:47.970> gonna

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
destroy a few buildings so they're gonna

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.000 
destroy a few buildings so they're gonna
be<00:03:48.209> focused<00:03:48.510> on<00:03:48.570> their<00:03:48.720> clan<00:03:48.900> castle<00:03:49.350> again

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
be focused on their clan castle again

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.039 
be focused on their clan castle again
you<00:03:50.190> can<00:03:50.310> see<00:03:50.459> he<00:03:50.610> has<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.730> level<00:03:51.060> 7<00:03:51.450> wizard

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
you can see he has a level 7 wizard

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.509 
you can see he has a level 7 wizard
tower<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.530> whenever<00:03:52.709> there's<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.100> level<00:03:53.250> 7

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
tower and whenever there's a level 7

wizard<00:03:53.760> tower<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.180> takes<00:03:54.360> out<00:03:54.510> these

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
wizard tower it takes out these

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
trophy's pretty successful it was to

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.770 
trophy's pretty successful it was to
star<00:04:28.250> raid<00:04:28.460> he<00:04:29.180> didn't<00:04:29.330> have<00:04:29.449> a<00:04:29.479> whole<00:04:29.630> lot<00:04:29.750> of

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
star raid he didn't have a whole lot of

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.999 
star raid he didn't have a whole lot of
trophies<00:04:29.990> available<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.650> thought<00:04:30.800> that

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
trophies available but I thought that

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.439 
trophies available but I thought that
was<00:04:31.099> an<00:04:31.190> easy<00:04:31.400> win<00:04:31.669> but<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:31.970> turned<00:04:32.120> out<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.270> be

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
was an easy win but it turned out to be

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.790 
was an easy win but it turned out to be
a<00:04:32.479> little<00:04:32.720> tougher<00:04:32.990> than<00:04:33.110> what<00:04:33.229> I<00:04:33.259> thought<00:04:33.500> but

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
a little tougher than what I thought but

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.920 
a little tougher than what I thought but
we<00:04:33.860> still<00:04:34.009> got<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.190> done<00:04:34.599> go<00:04:35.599> ahead<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.810> go<00:04:35.870> to

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
we still got it done go ahead and go to

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.020 
we still got it done go ahead and go to

someone named like got gala dawn he he

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.860 
someone named like got gala dawn he he
has<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.520> video<00:05:01.909> series<00:05:02.180> where<00:05:02.449> he's<00:05:02.569> been<00:05:02.720> using

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
has a video series where he's been using

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.450 
has a video series where he's been using
the<00:05:03.050> coop<00:05:03.289> strategy<00:05:03.710> so<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:03.860> sort<00:05:04.099> of<00:05:04.159> looked<00:05:04.340> at

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
the coop strategy so I sort of looked at

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.649 
the coop strategy so I sort of looked at
that<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:04.699> I<00:05:04.789> saw<00:05:04.940> that<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.210> was<00:05:05.240> a<00:05:05.360> viable

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
that and I saw that it was a viable

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.800 
that and I saw that it was a viable
option<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.409> use<00:05:06.909> up<00:05:07.909> there<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:08.389> don't<00:05:08.479> have<00:05:08.599> to

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
option to use up there you don't have to

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.930 
option to use up there you don't have to
just<00:05:08.990> use<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.199> witch<00:05:09.349> strategy<00:05:09.889> so<00:05:10.639> this<00:05:10.789> one

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
just use the witch strategy so this one

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.760 
just use the witch strategy so this one
definitely<00:05:11.090> is<00:05:11.389> possible<00:05:11.569> in<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.229> mean<00:05:12.650> it

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
definitely is possible in it I mean it

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.379 
definitely is possible in it I mean it
still<00:05:12.979> is<00:05:13.099> really<00:05:13.280> expensive<00:05:13.699> it<00:05:13.970> costs<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.270> lot

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
still is really expensive it costs a lot

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.909 
still is really expensive it costs a lot
of<00:05:14.449> elixir<00:05:14.900> for<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.110> Pekka<00:05:15.319> as<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.620> wizards

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
of elixir for the Pekka as the wizards

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.180 
of elixir for the Pekka as the wizards
even<00:05:16.789> dark<00:05:16.970> elixir<00:05:17.150> for<00:05:17.449> the<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.979> golems<00:05:18.979> but

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
even dark elixir for the the golems but

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.559 
even dark elixir for the the golems but
it's<00:05:19.340> still<00:05:19.520> fun<00:05:19.699> to<00:05:19.789> do<00:05:19.909> this<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.300> mix<00:05:20.479> it

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
it's still fun to do this and to mix it

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:20.860 
it's still fun to do this and to mix it
up

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
up
