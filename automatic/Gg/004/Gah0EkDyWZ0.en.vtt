gone<00:01:06.340> down<00:01:06.400> all<00:01:07.330> right<00:01:07.450> let's<00:01:07.720> keep<00:01:07.870> on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.819 

even<00:01:11.750> though<00:01:11.840> wells<00:01:12.140> are<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.530> biggest

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
to hang out with they live in the water

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.209 
to hang out with they live in the water
often<00:01:17.350> freezing<00:01:18.350> cold<00:01:18.649> water

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
often freezing cold water

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.209 
often freezing cold water
they<00:01:19.520> swim<00:01:19.819> fast<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.509> dive<00:01:20.869> deep<00:01:21.259> some<00:01:22.009> whales

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
they swim fast and dive deep some whales

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.219 
they swim fast and dive deep some whales
like<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.609> sperm<00:01:23.030> whale<00:01:23.270> dive<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.200> deep

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
like the sperm whale dive so deep

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.559 
like the sperm whale dive so deep
they're<00:01:24.950> impossible<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.670> follow<00:01:26.030> down<00:01:26.360> there

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
they're impossible to follow down there

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.419 
they're impossible to follow down there
where<00:01:26.959> they<00:01:27.049> hunt<00:01:27.259> giant<00:01:27.860> squid<00:01:30.310> imagine<00:01:31.310> if

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
where they hunt giant squid imagine if

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.550 
where they hunt giant squid imagine if
we<00:01:31.579> had<00:01:31.610> whale<00:01:32.030> powers<00:01:32.719> and<00:01:33.020> could<00:01:33.319> join

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
we had whale powers and could join

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.800 
we had whale powers and could join
whales<00:01:33.920> wherever<00:01:34.490> they<00:01:34.700> go<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.149> do<00:01:35.509> whatever

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
whales wherever they go and do whatever

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:46.809 
whales wherever they go and do whatever
they<00:01:36.140> do<00:01:36.250> what<00:01:37.250> if<00:01:45.340> there<00:01:46.340> are<00:01:46.520> two<00:01:46.789> different

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
they do what if there are two different

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.940 
they do what if there are two different
groups<00:01:47.209> of<00:01:47.569> whales<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.079> toothed<00:01:48.289> whales<00:01:48.679> and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
groups of whales the toothed whales and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.219 
groups of whales the toothed whales and

and dolphins have teeth and their

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.229 
and dolphins have teeth and their
predators<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.679> they<00:01:57.709> hunt<00:01:58.129> their<00:01:58.340> prey<00:01:58.369> using

their food the water comes in this side
goes<00:02:16.940> through<00:02:17.359> the<00:02:17.600> baleen<00:02:18.079> and<00:02:18.260> then<00:02:18.620> when<00:02:18.769> it

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
goes through the baleen and then when it

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.860 
goes through the baleen and then when it
comes<00:02:19.040> out<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.549> side<00:02:19.819> these<00:02:20.269> little<00:02:20.600> hairs
