00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.260
 Speak people, I'm milton medeiros. 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.420
 I'm here to present a tip for 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.150
 you of enlightenment that we will soon have 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.589
 many lights for you on the dvd that's what 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.050
 You now understand if a little bit 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.760
 of this shadow thing is that everyone 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 cares very much for example when I 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 I put the umbrella next to the model and she 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.239
 it's near the bottom 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 we have a shadow that designed here 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.649
 from the moment the model came 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.100
 A little bit ahead were shadows. 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.019
 going sideways and we can 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.360
 exactly take it totally in the shade 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.710
 when the model comes back again, the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.060
 shadow attack 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.160
 So, how do we do it? 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.500
 get rid of this shadow when you do not want 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.280
 puts you model a little further 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.429
 of the fund but today, 2013 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.800
 fashion is a shadow in the pictures I always 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.990
 I love the shade. I like it, right? 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.040
 we have photography we have oneself 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.869
 We have light soon we have shadow then 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.000
 pushing model away from the background you looking 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.920
 the light modeling you realize that she 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 Come out then, you will not have any more 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.850
 that sharp shadow that would continue 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.110
 but for those who do not 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 want a shadow passes this is the ideal is 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.399
 that the light is always closer to the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.439
 model also looks only as brightness 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.719
 increases as we get closer to the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.090
 Model and when we go away 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.930
 the light becoming softer then a little 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.479
 closer 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.219
 I'm looking for more brightness, ok let's make a 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.439
 picture of it to see how it looks 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:11.790
 the photometer is not always there we have 11 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.690
 exactly 11 and 8 to knee height 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.340
 what would it be 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.709
 Let's try to make an American cut. 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.970
 Ok I'll do both ways and let's go 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.100
 see what this light is 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.600
 just this little bit of light a source only 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.560
 You can do for us 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:30.620
 Let's get a light on doing a test with the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.060
 test photo always needs much easier 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.530
 let's do little more backwards finding 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.530
 what to do with the shadow 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:45.720
 Ok let's check it out to give a 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.310
 checked it 's okay 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.220
 It's always easier after we 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.990
 continues to make the model marking is 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.990
 very good there 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:35.890
 Come on now, okay on the body. 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.810
 all 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.810
 Well, there we have that projected shadow. 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.330
 in the background now she uses when she goes to walk 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.750
 A little bit before the shadow has already been 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.890
 on the side went to the side and we also 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.519
 Let's go a little bit to the side and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.970
 let's take a picture with the model 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.799
 automatically 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.810
 We are required to take a photo. 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.739
 here because she walked a meter ahead 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.650
 huh 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.569
 one meter forward already changing our light 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:14.260
 so let's correct this here check it out 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:17.099
 on 11 almost the same thing more 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.099
 point is too much 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.669
 Let's see how it goes away from the 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:29.550
 background uses a comparative photo made 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.550
 What else to box this? 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:59.000
 a close now in very good face always 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.310
 waiting for the flash to recharge very good 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.840
 Cigar thank you very much. 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.100
 together since the first book that the 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.600
 we did right 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.750
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.880
 Today 's podcast tip that was a 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.980
 closest to the model we 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.350
 let's get brighter we get a lot more 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.540
 nice but also if the model 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.210
 approach the bottom we will have the shadow 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.550
 move away from the bottom of the shade will leave 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.350
 side and this is a great tip for 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.580
 those who have problems with shadows I 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.180

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.780
