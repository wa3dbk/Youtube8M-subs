00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
pump got a stiffener on there so it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.200 
pump got a stiffener on there so it
keeps<00:00:37.890> tension<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> belt<00:00:38.640> keeps<00:00:39.059> this

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.240 
keeps tension on the belt keeps this
thing<00:00:39.270> from<00:00:39.629> wobbling<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:40.950> got<00:00:41.160> the

thing from wobbling you also got the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.889 
thing from wobbling you also got the
battery<00:00:41.610> tray<00:00:41.790> done<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.540> we're<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
battery tray done which we're going to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.900 
battery tray done which we're going to
have<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> make<00:00:43.410> some<00:00:43.680> brackets<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.640> go<00:00:44.670> down

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
have to make some brackets that go down

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.490 
have to make some brackets that go down
to<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> brush<00:00:45.300> guard<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:46.350> be

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
to the brush guard which we will be

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
to the brush guard which we will be
putting<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> front<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.670> protect<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
putting on the front just to protect the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.959 
putting on the front just to protect the
oil<00:00:48.180> pan<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.629> everything<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.789> started<00:00:50.789> working

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
oil pan and everything I started working

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.110 
oil pan and everything I started working
on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> forward<00:00:51.539> reverse<00:00:51.750> lever<00:00:52.410> yesterday

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
on the forward reverse lever yesterday

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
on the forward reverse lever yesterday
so<00:00:54.120> I'm<00:00:54.180> having<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> heck<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.870> time<00:00:55.079> place<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
so I'm having a heck of a time place in

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
so I'm having a heck of a time place in
this<00:00:55.890> trying<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.340> get<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.850> spot

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this trying to get it in the right spot

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540 
this trying to get it in the right spot
because<00:00:57.510> these<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> over<00:00:59.100> Center<00:00:59.430> on

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
because these have to over Center on

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.029 
because these have to over Center on
themselves<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> lock<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.050> I'll<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
themselves to lock in but I'll get that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.500 
themselves to lock in but I'll get that
it's<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> matter<00:01:02.579> moving<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.359> down

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's just a matter moving it up and down

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.899 
it's just a matter moving it up and down
to<00:01:03.809> get<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> right<00:01:04.229> spot<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.309> today<00:01:05.760> I'll

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to get the right spot and today I'll

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.149 
to get the right spot and today I'll
probably<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.330> doing<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> high-low<00:01:07.159> shift

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
probably be doing the high-low shift

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.270 
probably be doing the high-low shift
lever<00:01:08.430> along<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> PTO<00:01:09.680> shift<00:01:10.680> lever<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
lever along with the PTO shift lever and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.399 
lever along with the PTO shift lever and
the<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> swift<00:01:12.540> somatic<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.290> I'll

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the one for the swift somatic so I'll

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
the one for the swift somatic so I'll
probably<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.740> mountain<00:01:14.040> those<00:01:14.220> right<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
probably be mountain those right up in

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
probably be mountain those right up in
this<00:01:15.420> area<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.990> they're<00:01:16.110> easy<00:01:16.350> access<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.009> can

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this area so they're easy access you can

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.330 
this area so they're easy access you can
reach<00:01:17.640> down<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:17.939> grab<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.189> some<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
reach down and grab them and some of you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.950 
reach down and grab them and some of you
guys<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.670> asking<00:01:20.850> about<00:01:21.180> fenders<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> hood

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
guys are asking about fenders and hood

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
guys are asking about fenders and hood
this<00:01:22.500> thing<00:01:22.770> will<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.040> getting<00:01:23.220> fenders<00:01:23.729> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
this thing will be getting fenders I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.910 
this thing will be getting fenders I
probably<00:01:24.659> won't<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.960> doing<00:01:24.990> them<00:01:25.350> until<00:01:25.590> after

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
probably won't be doing them until after

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.230 
probably won't be doing them until after
the<00:01:26.040> show<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.790> gonna<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> get

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.580 
wheel horse hood probably from the 70s I
think<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> 70s<00:01:43.409> CC<00:01:43.920> hood<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> be

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
think this is the 70s CC hood so be

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.340 
think this is the 70s CC hood so be
putting<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> fits<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.880> nice

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
putting this on and it fits really nice

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.569 
putting this on and it fits really nice
covers<00:01:49.350> everything<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> that'll<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
covers everything up and that'll be

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.880 
covers everything up and that'll be
sitting<00:01:50.939> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> low<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.259> it'll<00:01:52.680> probably

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
sitting kind of low so it'll probably

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.340 
sitting kind of low so it'll probably
only<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:53.869> here<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> tractor

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
only be up to about here on the tractor

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.100 
only be up to about here on the tractor
just<00:01:55.740> enough<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.100> clear<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> battery<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
just enough to clear the battery and

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
just enough to clear the battery and
then<00:01:58.110> it'll<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.710> make<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> mount<00:01:59.790> over

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
then it'll have to make a mount over

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690 
then it'll have to make a mount over
here<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> set<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:02.430> what's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
here for it to set on but that's what's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.069 
here for it to set on but that's what's
going<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.600> today

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
going on for today

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
going on for today
trying<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.590> some<00:02:04.770> more<00:02:04.920> shift<00:02:05.159> work<00:02:05.399> done

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
trying to get some more shift work done

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.429 
trying to get some more shift work done
because<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.270> main<00:02:06.719> priority<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
because that's main priority now the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.169 
because that's main priority now the
hydraulics<00:02:08.129> should<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.459> coming<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:08.940> Monday

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
hydraulics should be coming in on Monday

right<00:02:59.050> now<00:02:59.260> I'm<00:02:59.470> working<00:02:59.650> on<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.190> Swift

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
right now I'm working on the Swift

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.900 
right now I'm working on the Swift
Ematic<00:03:01.150> shifter<00:03:01.630> rod<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.140> lever<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:03.520> for<00:03:03.730> this

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
Ematic shifter rod and lever so for this

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.670 
Ematic shifter rod and lever so for this
and<00:03:04.510> I'm<00:03:04.630> going<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.780> be<00:03:04.870> doing<00:03:05.020> relatively<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
and I'm going to be doing relatively the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.010 
and I'm going to be doing relatively the
same<00:03:05.770> thing<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.220> did<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.580> back<00:03:06.810> with<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
same thing I did in the back with the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.680 
same thing I did in the back with the
same<00:03:08.260> setup<00:03:08.710> like<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.330> only<00:03:10.330> instead<00:03:10.600> of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
same setup like that only instead of

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.420 
same setup like that only instead of
going<00:03:10.900> off<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.260> advanced<00:03:11.590> casting<00:03:12.160> here

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
going off of the advanced casting here

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.030 
going off of the advanced casting here
I'm<00:03:12.880> going<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.180> going<00:03:13.450> off<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
I'm going to be going off of the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.190 
I'm going to be going off of the
advanced<00:03:15.040> casting<00:03:15.190> swivel<00:03:16.180> plate<00:03:16.420> because

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
advanced casting swivel plate because

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.570 
advanced casting swivel plate because
it's<00:03:17.350> going<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.560> put<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.100> up<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.280> little<00:03:18.400> bit

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
it's going to put it up a little bit

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.980 
it's going to put it up a little bit
farther<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.209> won't<00:03:19.330> have<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.510> reach<00:03:19.750> back

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
farther and I won't have to reach back

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.820 
farther and I won't have to reach back
as<00:03:20.230> far<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.030> made<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.300> bracket<00:03:22.750> for<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:23.080> as<00:03:23.620> you

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
as far so I made a bracket for it as you

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.960 
as far so I made a bracket for it as you
can<00:03:23.950> see<00:03:24.010> just<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.580> really<00:03:24.820> quick<00:03:25.230> Zee<00:03:26.230> Bend<00:03:26.500> and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
can see just a really quick Zee Bend and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.820 
can see just a really quick Zee Bend and
then<00:03:27.970> that'll<00:03:28.300> be<00:03:28.330> going<00:03:28.750> like<00:03:28.959> that<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.739> that

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
then that'll be going like that and that

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.380 
then that'll be going like that and that
will<00:03:29.920> get<00:03:30.070> welded<00:03:30.430> onto<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.700> plate<00:03:31.060> on<00:03:31.270> the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
will get welded onto the plate on the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.150 
will get welded onto the plate on the
yellow<00:03:31.570> mark<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:33.250> then<00:03:33.489> our<00:03:33.940> lever<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:36.010> going

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
yellow mark and then our lever is going

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.010 
yellow mark and then our lever is going
to<00:03:36.340> sit<00:03:36.580> on<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.850> like<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:38.739> for<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:40.570> most<00:03:40.690> part

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
to sit on it like that for the most part

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.270 
to sit on it like that for the most part
and<00:03:41.140> I'll<00:03:41.200> have<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.350> hole<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.800> I'll<00:03:41.890> cut<00:03:42.100> this

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
and I'll have a hole and I'll cut this

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280 
and I'll have a hole and I'll cut this
off<00:03:42.520> and<00:03:43.270> then<00:03:43.540> I'm<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:43.720> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.989> make

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
off and then I'm just going to make

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.010 
off and then I'm just going to make
another<00:03:44.590> rod<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.100> goes<00:03:45.130> from<00:03:45.489> here<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.090> there

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
another rod that goes from here to there

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.140 
another rod that goes from here to there
obviously<00:03:47.860> enough<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.310> then<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.850> will<00:03:48.970> have

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
obviously enough and then that will have

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.330 
obviously enough and then that will have
our<00:03:49.299> shifter<00:03:49.750> will<00:03:50.410> be<00:03:50.500> placed<00:03:50.799> right<00:03:50.950> around

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
our shifter will be placed right around

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.640 
our shifter will be placed right around
in<00:03:51.489> this<00:03:51.640> area<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.450> it'll<00:03:53.140> give<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.470> enough

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
in this area so it'll give it enough

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.470 
in this area so it'll give it enough
room<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.890> move<00:03:54.070> without<00:03:54.790> hitting<00:03:55.299> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
room to move without hitting the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.090 
room to move without hitting the
steering<00:03:55.870> column<00:03:56.019> or<00:03:56.290> anything<00:03:56.470> when<00:03:56.980> the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
steering column or anything when the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.000 
steering column or anything when the
tractor<00:03:57.370> turns<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:59.530> should<00:03:59.709> work<00:03:59.860> out

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
tractor turns and that should work out

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.810 
tractor turns and that should work out
pretty<00:04:00.220> good<00:04:00.430> right<00:04:00.640> in<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.880> location<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.790> I

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
pretty good right in that location so I

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.550 
pretty good right in that location so I
finished<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.390> linkages<00:04:04.989> for<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.350> Swiss

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
finished the linkages for the Swiss

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.800 
finished the linkages for the Swiss
pneumatic<00:04:06.010> on<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.220> front<00:04:06.430> transmission<00:04:07.150> this

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
pneumatic on the front transmission this

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.390 
pneumatic on the front transmission this
one<00:04:08.019> was<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> real<00:04:08.380> easy<00:04:08.620> one<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:08.950> do<00:04:09.070> because<00:04:09.310> I

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
one was a real easy one to do because I

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.710 
one was a real easy one to do because I
was<00:04:09.519> able<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.760> keep<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.150> straight<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.660> then

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
was able to keep it straight and then

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.560 
was able to keep it straight and then
just<00:04:11.170> adjust<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.220> keep<00:04:13.030> everything<00:04:13.299> in<00:04:13.540> line

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
just adjust this keep everything in line

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.289 
just adjust this keep everything in line
so<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.350> welded<00:04:14.920> that<00:04:15.070> right<00:04:15.430> up<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.850> plate

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
so I welded that right up to the plate

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.130 
so I welded that right up to the plate
so<00:04:16.540> now<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.169> have<00:04:17.320> high<00:04:17.500> range<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:18.190> low<00:04:19.030> range

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.260 

so<00:04:23.140> put<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.860> tractor<00:04:24.130> in<00:04:24.370> high<00:04:24.490> range<00:04:24.790> both<00:04:25.090> of

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
so put the tractor in high range both of

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.520 
so put the tractor in high range both of
them<00:04:25.450> are<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.690> inside<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.290> put<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
them are to the inside you put the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.909 
them are to the inside you put the
tractor<00:04:26.919> in<00:04:27.010> low<00:04:27.160> range<00:04:27.960> they<00:04:28.960> both<00:04:29.140> go<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.650> the

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
tractor in low range they both go to the

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.630 
tractor in low range they both go to the
outside<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:31.320> worked<00:04:32.320> out<00:04:32.470> pretty<00:04:32.650> well<00:04:32.770> now

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
outside so worked out pretty well now

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.159 
outside so worked out pretty well now
I'm<00:04:33.729> going<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:33.910> be<00:04:33.970> working<00:04:34.270> on<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.690> forward

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
I'm going to be working on the forward

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.370 
I'm going to be working on the forward
reverse<00:04:35.380> shifter<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.900> had<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:38.229> do<00:04:38.350> a

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
reverse shifter and this I had to do a

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.810 
reverse shifter and this I had to do a
little<00:04:38.590> bit<00:04:38.800> of<00:04:38.830> thinking<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.370> get<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.610> right

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
little bit of thinking to get it right

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.880 
little bit of thinking to get it right
we're<00:04:40.540> having<00:04:40.660> trouble<00:04:41.110> finding<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.590> pivot

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
we're having trouble finding the pivot

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.400 
we're having trouble finding the pivot
point<00:04:42.160> for<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.700> arm<00:04:42.970> here<00:04:43.419> because<00:04:44.260> the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
point for this arm here because the

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.640 
point for this arm here because the
original<00:04:44.860> one<00:04:45.540> here<00:04:46.540> that<00:04:46.960> they<00:04:47.169> originally

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
original one here that they originally

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.440 
original one here that they originally
use<00:04:47.830> on<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.100> 400<00:04:48.580> series<00:04:48.790> for<00:04:49.090> your<00:04:49.210> Ford

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
use on the 400 series for your Ford

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.510 
use on the 400 series for your Ford
reverse<00:04:49.750> mounted<00:04:50.350> like<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:50.530> on<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.890> tractor

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
reverse mounted like this on the tractor

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.450 
reverse mounted like this on the tractor
but<00:04:52.030> both<00:04:52.210> pivot<00:04:52.599> points<00:04:52.960> are<00:04:53.140> on<00:04:53.169> one<00:04:54.099> pin

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
but both pivot points are on one pin

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.850 
but both pivot points are on one pin
unlike<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.870> high-low<00:04:56.260> shifter<00:04:56.680> where

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
unlike the high-low shifter where

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.470 
unlike the high-low shifter where
they're<00:04:56.979> on<00:04:57.099> two

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
they're on two

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.680 
they're on two
ever<00:04:57.600> pins<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:59.340> was<00:05:00.030> having<00:05:00.270> trouble<00:05:00.390> with

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
ever pins and I was having trouble with

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.210 
ever pins and I was having trouble with
him<00:05:00.840> over<00:05:01.140> camming<00:05:01.530> because<00:05:01.680> when<00:05:01.800> these<00:05:01.950> lock

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
him over camming because when these lock

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.940 
him over camming because when these lock
in<00:05:02.520> they<00:05:03.390> have<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.600> be<00:05:03.990> just<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.620> little<00:05:04.740> bit

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
in they have to be just a little bit

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.430 
in they have to be just a little bit
over<00:05:05.160> Center<00:05:05.670> this<00:05:06.330> way<00:05:06.540> or<00:05:06.840> else<00:05:06.960> they'll<00:05:07.200> pop

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
over Center this way or else they'll pop

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.770 
over Center this way or else they'll pop
out<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.680> gear<00:05:07.980> like<00:05:08.160> that<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.640> I<00:05:09.420> was<00:05:09.540> having<00:05:09.720> a

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
out of gear like that and I was having a

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.330 
out of gear like that and I was having a
tough<00:05:09.960> time<00:05:10.020> keeping<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.740> in<00:05:10.890> but<00:05:10.920> because

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
tough time keeping it in but because

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.820 
tough time keeping it in but because
these<00:05:11.490> ones<00:05:11.700> are<00:05:11.850> spread<00:05:12.120> farther<00:05:12.420> apart<00:05:12.830> it

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
these ones are spread farther apart it

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.320 
these ones are spread farther apart it
was<00:05:13.950> easier<00:05:14.280> to<00:05:14.340> do<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.730> with<00:05:14.970> because

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
was easier to do that with because

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.210 
was easier to do that with because
they're<00:05:15.660> higher<00:05:15.870> up<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.500> higher<00:05:16.680> down<00:05:16.950> well

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
they're higher up and higher down well

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.730 
they're higher up and higher down well
then<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:17.400> makes<00:05:17.520> any<00:05:17.790> sense<00:05:17.880> or<00:05:18.210> not<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:19.560> it

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
then it makes any sense or not but it

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.190 
then it makes any sense or not but it
did<00:05:19.890> work<00:05:20.040> out<00:05:20.330> so<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.360> still<00:05:21.660> have<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:21.840> cut<00:05:22.020> down

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
did work out so I still have to cut down

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.780 
did work out so I still have to cut down
this<00:05:22.380> pushing<00:05:22.800> here<00:05:23.100> because<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.430> took<00:05:23.490> the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
this pushing here because I took the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.460 
this pushing here because I took the
needle<00:05:24.060> bearings<00:05:24.420> out<00:05:24.570> of<00:05:24.720> this<00:05:24.870> I'll

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
needle bearings out of this I'll

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.840 
needle bearings out of this I'll
probably<00:05:25.620> put<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.890> grease<00:05:26.160> fitting<00:05:26.460> on<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:26.700> at

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
probably put a grease fitting on it at

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.760 
probably put a grease fitting on it at
some<00:05:27.060> point<00:05:27.090> so<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:27.900> got<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> cut<00:05:28.230> that<00:05:28.350> bushing

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
some point so I got a cut that bushing

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.920 
some point so I got a cut that bushing
down<00:05:28.950> I<00:05:29.250> have<00:05:29.670> to<00:05:29.850> Bush<00:05:30.030> this<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.630> get<00:05:30.810> the

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
down I have to Bush this and get the

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.960 
down I have to Bush this and get the
washer<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.770> nut<00:05:31.800> on<00:05:32.130> it<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.430> then<00:05:32.880> I'm

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
washer and the nut on it and then I'm

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.400 
washer and the nut on it and then I'm
just<00:05:33.150> going<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.330> have<00:05:33.480> to<00:05:33.630> make<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.810> shift<00:05:34.140> lever

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
just going to have to make a shift lever

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.990 
just going to have to make a shift lever
which<00:05:34.650> for<00:05:34.830> that<00:05:34.950> probably<00:05:35.610> going<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:35.910> be

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
which for that probably going to be

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.390 
which for that probably going to be
using<00:05:36.390> some<00:05:36.660> 1/2<00:05:36.840> inch<00:05:37.110> or<00:05:37.350> 3/4<00:05:38.010> inch<00:05:38.130> round

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
using some 1/2 inch or 3/4 inch round

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.570 
using some 1/2 inch or 3/4 inch round
stock<00:05:38.790> come<00:05:39.480> up<00:05:39.630> about<00:05:39.870> 18<00:05:40.680> inches<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.340> it'll

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
stock come up about 18 inches and it'll

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.310 
stock come up about 18 inches and it'll
be<00:05:41.730> about<00:05:42.210> here<00:05:42.510> with<00:05:42.660> the<00:05:42.750> steering<00:05:43.140> column

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
be about here with the steering column

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.500 
be about here with the steering column
because<00:05:44.040> it's<00:05:44.190> very<00:05:44.430> easy<00:05:44.700> to<00:05:44.910> shift<00:05:45.150> when<00:05:45.390> you

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
because it's very easy to shift when you

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.780 
because it's very easy to shift when you
get<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.660> long<00:05:45.900> bar<00:05:46.200> on<00:05:46.410> it<00:05:46.590> so<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:47.100> it's<00:05:47.580> just<00:05:47.730> a

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
get a long bar on it so and it's just a

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.670 
get a long bar on it so and it's just a
matter<00:05:47.940> of<00:05:48.060> attaching<00:05:48.420> a<00:05:48.690> attaching<00:05:49.530> it<00:05:49.650> to

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
matter of attaching a attaching it to

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.480 
matter of attaching a attaching it to
this<00:05:50.540> so<00:05:51.540> for<00:05:51.990> our<00:05:52.110> forward<00:05:52.440> reverse<00:05:52.830> lever<00:05:53.190> I

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
this so for our forward reverse lever I

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.300 
this so for our forward reverse lever I
came<00:05:54.360> up<00:05:54.480> with<00:05:54.510> this<00:05:54.810> bracket<00:05:55.320> here<00:05:55.650> just<00:05:56.160> a

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
came up with this bracket here just a

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.280 
came up with this bracket here just a
piece<00:05:56.610> of<00:05:56.790> one<00:05:56.910> and<00:05:57.030> a<00:05:57.060> half<00:05:57.090> inch<00:05:57.540> by<00:05:58.080> quarter

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
piece of one and a half inch by quarter

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.800 
piece of one and a half inch by quarter
inch<00:05:58.530> flat<00:05:58.800> stock<00:05:59.100> and<00:05:59.940> I<00:06:00.210> got<00:06:00.390> it<00:06:00.510> bolted

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
inch flat stock and I got it bolted

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.300 
inch flat stock and I got it bolted
through<00:06:00.990> this<00:06:01.140> hole<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:01.620> then<00:06:01.830> what<00:06:01.980> I<00:06:02.010> did<00:06:02.130> is

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
through this hole and then what I did is

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.260 
through this hole and then what I did is
I<00:06:02.640> mounted<00:06:03.480> it<00:06:03.570> heated<00:06:04.350> it<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.740> bent<00:06:04.920> it<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.270> I

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
I mounted it heated it and bent it and I

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.270 
I mounted it heated it and bent it and I
drilled<00:06:06.630> and<00:06:06.870> tapped<00:06:06.930> a<00:06:07.320> quarter-twenty<00:06:07.860> bolt

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
drilled and tapped a quarter-twenty bolt

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.340 
drilled and tapped a quarter-twenty bolt
right<00:06:08.640> here<00:06:08.700> just<00:06:09.180> to<00:06:09.270> keep<00:06:09.420> it<00:06:09.600> from<00:06:09.810> moving

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
right here just to keep it from moving

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.790 
right here just to keep it from moving
like<00:06:10.680> this<00:06:10.920> and<00:06:11.360> I<00:06:12.360> have<00:06:12.570> a<00:06:12.600> half-inch<00:06:13.530> rod

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
like this and I have a half-inch rod

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.040 
like this and I have a half-inch rod
that's<00:06:14.100> threaded<00:06:14.520> on<00:06:14.640> one<00:06:15.150> end<00:06:15.360> so<00:06:15.720> I<00:06:15.750> was<00:06:15.930> able

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
that's threaded on one end so I was able

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.470 
that's threaded on one end so I was able
to<00:06:16.170> get<00:06:16.320> a<00:06:16.380> shifter<00:06:16.920> knob<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:17.430> I'm<00:06:18.240> going<00:06:18.420> to

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
to get a shifter knob and I'm going to

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.810 
to get a shifter knob and I'm going to
cut<00:06:18.660> that<00:06:18.840> down<00:06:19.080> right<00:06:19.380> there<00:06:19.620> you<00:06:20.490> can<00:06:20.640> see

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
cut that down right there you can see

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.910 
cut that down right there you can see
this<00:06:20.940> line<00:06:21.210> I<00:06:21.240> have<00:06:21.570> on<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.840> bracket<00:06:22.290> I'll<00:06:22.680> cut

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
this line I have on the bracket I'll cut

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.520 
this line I have on the bracket I'll cut
that<00:06:23.040> off<00:06:23.250> with<00:06:23.910> a<00:06:24.000> cut-off<00:06:24.240> wheel<00:06:24.300> and<00:06:25.260> then

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
that off with a cut-off wheel and then

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.070 
that off with a cut-off wheel and then
that<00:06:25.800> will<00:06:26.670> get<00:06:26.820> welded<00:06:27.180> on<00:06:27.300> just<00:06:27.630> like<00:06:27.840> that

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
that will get welded on just like that

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.330 
that will get welded on just like that
so<00:06:28.350> our<00:06:28.470> shifter<00:06:29.330> be<00:06:30.330> about<00:06:30.830> like<00:06:31.830> that<00:06:32.040> if<00:06:32.220> you

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
so our shifter be about like that if you

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.100 
so our shifter be about like that if you
can<00:06:32.490> see<00:06:32.700> that<00:06:32.940> well<00:06:33.120> so<00:06:33.420> you'll<00:06:33.600> have<00:06:33.750> reverse

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
can see that well so you'll have reverse

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.080 
can see that well so you'll have reverse
is<00:06:34.440> down<00:06:34.740> about<00:06:34.980> there<00:06:35.220> and<00:06:35.490> forward<00:06:35.910> will<00:06:36.060> be

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
is down about there and forward will be

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.740 
is down about there and forward will be
almost<00:06:36.540> straight<00:06:37.440> up<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:39.000> forward<00:06:39.600> reverse

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
almost straight up the forward reverse

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.110 
almost straight up the forward reverse
shift<00:06:40.560> rod<00:06:40.830> is<00:06:41.040> all<00:06:41.220> done<00:06:41.490> they<00:06:41.670> got<00:06:41.760> the<00:06:41.910> lever

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
shift rod is all done they got the lever

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.420 
shift rod is all done they got the lever
on<00:06:42.390> there<00:06:42.710> everything<00:06:43.710> that's<00:06:43.860> been<00:06:44.040> welded

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
on there everything that's been welded

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.550 
on there everything that's been welded
up<00:06:44.640> on<00:06:44.820> the<00:06:44.940> bracket<00:06:45.390> and<00:06:46.110> it<00:06:46.260> worked<00:06:46.410> out

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
up on the bracket and it worked out

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.760 
up on the bracket and it worked out
pretty<00:06:46.800> nice<00:06:47.040> we<00:06:47.280> got<00:06:48.590> forward<00:06:49.590> and<00:06:50.510> reverse

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
pretty nice we got forward and reverse

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.770 
pretty nice we got forward and reverse
real<00:06:52.770> simple<00:06:53.220> and<00:06:53.430> when<00:06:53.910> the<00:06:54.030> steers<00:06:54.420> it<00:06:54.630> has

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
real simple and when the steers it has

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.540 
real simple and when the steers it has
plenty<00:06:55.200> of<00:06:55.230> room<00:06:55.410> to<00:06:55.470> go<00:06:55.740> past<00:06:56.010> the<00:06:56.160> steering

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
plenty of room to go past the steering

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.060 
plenty of room to go past the steering
column<00:06:56.700> it<00:06:57.000> just<00:06:57.180> misses<00:06:57.420> it<00:06:57.720> so<00:06:57.990> no<00:06:58.590> problems

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
column it just misses it so no problems

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.420 
column it just misses it so no problems
there

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
there

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.430 
there
and<00:07:00.000> the<00:07:00.390> next<00:07:00.600> one<00:07:00.720> I'm<00:07:00.810> going<00:07:00.900> to<00:07:00.960> be<00:07:01.080> working

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
and the next one I'm going to be working

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.290 
and the next one I'm going to be working
on<00:07:01.590> is<00:07:01.830> going<00:07:02.010> to<00:07:02.100> be<00:07:02.190> our<00:07:02.370> high-low<00:07:02.820> shifter

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
on is going to be our high-low shifter

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.750 
on is going to be our high-low shifter
and<00:07:03.510> that's<00:07:04.140> not<00:07:04.350> brought<00:07:04.770> far<00:07:05.100> as<00:07:05.280> forward

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760 
and that's not brought far as forward

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.390 
and that's not brought far as forward
far<00:07:06.330> backwards<00:07:06.840> as<00:07:06.960> this<00:07:07.110> one<00:07:07.350> is

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
far backwards as this one is

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.070 
far backwards as this one is
it's<00:07:08.520> a<00:07:08.580> little<00:07:08.820> more<00:07:08.940> forwards<00:07:09.449> so<00:07:09.870> I'm<00:07:09.960> going

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
it's a little more forwards so I'm going

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.330 
it's a little more forwards so I'm going
to<00:07:10.169> be<00:07:10.229> using<00:07:10.500> the<00:07:10.590> same<00:07:10.800> arm<00:07:11.100> obviously

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
to be using the same arm obviously

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.510 
to be using the same arm obviously
enough<00:07:12.090> but<00:07:12.870> for<00:07:13.110> the<00:07:13.199> shifter<00:07:13.650> I'll<00:07:14.220> probably

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
enough but for the shifter I'll probably

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.070 
enough but for the shifter I'll probably
be<00:07:14.699> doing<00:07:14.940> something<00:07:15.270> along<00:07:15.479> the<00:07:15.630> lines<00:07:15.840> of

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
be doing something along the lines of

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.439 
be doing something along the lines of
this<00:07:16.320> just<00:07:17.310> to<00:07:17.400> move<00:07:17.550> it<00:07:17.669> back<00:07:17.850> a<00:07:17.910> little<00:07:18.240> bit

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.449 
this just to move it back a little bit

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.320 
this just to move it back a little bit
and<00:07:18.660> then<00:07:18.810> it'll<00:07:19.080> move<00:07:19.430> something<00:07:20.430> about<00:07:20.790> like

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
and then it'll move something about like

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.909 
and then it'll move something about like
that<00:07:21.570> I<00:07:21.840> just<00:07:22.139> got<00:07:22.380> to<00:07:22.470> make<00:07:22.560> a<00:07:22.620> bracket

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
that I just got to make a bracket

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.920 
that I just got to make a bracket
similar<00:07:23.520> to<00:07:23.699> this<00:07:23.820> one<00:07:24.030> pretty<00:07:24.330> much<00:07:24.540> to<00:07:24.780> go

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:24.930 
similar to this one pretty much to go

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.680 
similar to this one pretty much to go
and<00:07:25.530> wrap<00:07:25.740> around<00:07:25.770> this<00:07:26.250> piece<00:07:26.520> here<00:07:26.850> so<00:07:27.270> after

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.690 
and wrap around this piece here so after

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.320 
and wrap around this piece here so after
that<00:07:28.199> it'll<00:07:29.190> be<00:07:29.250> the<00:07:29.370> PTO<00:07:29.699> shifter<00:07:30.150> in<00:07:30.240> the

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330 
that it'll be the PTO shifter in the

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.909 
that it'll be the PTO shifter in the
front<00:07:30.570> and<00:07:30.750> then<00:07:30.930> all<00:07:31.020> the<00:07:31.169> shifter<00:07:31.560> odds<00:07:31.710> will

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 
front and then all the shifter odds will

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.250 
front and then all the shifter odds will
