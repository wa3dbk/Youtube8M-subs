00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.929
 Sokolov buried last project choir Viewty Modern Warfare 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:20.560
 by wind it blows and now but where no Schmarrn with the first mission yes 

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.559
 spoken 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.829
 Here is change is about her 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.000
 the serious change new players appear but also takes place at night 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Alpine region 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.190
 we fought with the Russians and got them in the blood 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.420
 Sastre falls off 7 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.480
 The story is written by winners and I thought the Werners 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.420
 If you switch it off for a while it will make all the worse substitutes 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880
 AUD are changing 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.380
 yesteryear are the recruits of today 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.920
 Let's pray that I will not ultimately decide the roads and the side 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 switch 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.770
 every day the old lyre 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.360
 let her read 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.280
 keep your eyes shut 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 hapag-lloyd USA 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 me WS 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.810
 Son Tim researches takes seriously and that is the group 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.719
 who actually sees more of a Vettel so who a tutorial 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.439
 but not necessary 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.870
 female rambo and cleaning winslet yellow 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.049
 such an animal can be printed also warned you want to remain silent 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.079
 and why would like to let that mean 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.229
 around samples above or below 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:33.019
 good laps 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.949
 That's enough to want to 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.689
 what I can not do 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.689
 in standby Fernandez 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.339
 lies 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.019
 lies 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.099
 that's right 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.879
 raise properly 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.359
 I'm looking for 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.359
 become 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:05.899
 APA 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.199
 so now you have to book the tempo only from the pro Cura you have to spÃ¶ 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.479
 But shooting targets must also be 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.509
 Looks once a week 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.330
 by repeated Caspar 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.309
 Nevertheless, it is clear Red 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:52.569
 Rottweil 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.569
 for the pursuers better than they arrive 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.840
 Well, I'm not very good in carports 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.419
 Pretoria 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.209
 so the now play-off cemetery sentence game expects 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.559
 because 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:58.689
 yes that's just faster and faster 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.719
 New year old sorry 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.489
 he has that was super stay Pauli oil coming 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.849
 Motor Corp dissatisfied at this point 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:36.279
 as expected
