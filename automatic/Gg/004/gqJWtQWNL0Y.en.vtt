00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
silly and crash it's silly and when it's

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.639 
silly and crash it's silly and when it's
done<00:00:31.450> really<00:00:31.779> right<00:00:31.989> you<00:00:32.230> don't<00:00:32.380> even<00:00:32.439> notice

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
done really right you don't even notice

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
it like playing a French horn that sort

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.880 
it like playing a French horn that sort
you<00:00:36.370> look<00:00:36.490> at<00:00:36.580> that<00:00:36.670> you<00:00:36.820> go<00:00:36.940> on<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:38.500> I<00:00:38.560> looking

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
you look at that you go on but I looking

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.080 
you look at that you go on but I looking
at<00:00:39.010> somebody<00:00:39.310> in<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.460> eyes<00:00:39.580> and<00:00:39.880> saying

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
at somebody in the eyes and saying

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.910 
at somebody in the eyes and saying
something<00:00:40.840> like<00:00:40.870> you<00:00:41.050> mean<00:00:41.200> it<00:00:41.230> that's<00:00:41.590> kind

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
something like you mean it that's kind

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.830 
something like you mean it that's kind
of<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.130> know<00:00:42.160> there's<00:00:43.150> 7<00:00:43.420> billion<00:00:43.570> people<00:00:43.660> in

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
of you know there's 7 billion people in

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.020 
of you know there's 7 billion people in
planet<00:00:44.260> all<00:00:44.470> 7<00:00:44.830> billion<00:00:45.010> ought<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.310> do<00:00:45.400> that<00:00:45.580> so

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
planet all 7 billion ought to do that so

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.250 
planet all 7 billion ought to do that so
the<00:00:46.120> entire<00:00:46.300> planets<00:00:46.690> covered<00:00:46.930> with<00:00:47.020> 7

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
the entire planets covered with 7

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.770 
the entire planets covered with 7
billion<00:00:47.410> actors<00:00:47.890> so<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.820> craft<00:00:49.120> of<00:00:49.300> acting<00:00:49.480> is

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
billion actors so the craft of acting is

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.960 
billion actors so the craft of acting is
incredibly<00:00:50.170> simplistic<00:00:50.790> look<00:00:51.790> at<00:00:51.880> it<00:00:51.940> this

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
incredibly simplistic look at it this

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.200 
incredibly simplistic look at it this
way<00:00:52.380> I'm<00:00:53.380> anybody<00:00:53.860> kosta<00:00:54.610> musicians<00:00:54.970> in<00:00:55.180> the

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
way I'm anybody kosta musicians in the

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.500 
way I'm anybody kosta musicians in the
rumor<00:00:55.570> yeah<00:00:55.780> yeah<00:00:56.230> I'm<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.380> classical<00:00:56.770> pianist

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
rumor yeah yeah I'm a classical pianist

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.750 
rumor yeah yeah I'm a classical pianist
that's<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.660> hard<00:00:59.020> instrument<00:00:59.860> to<00:00:59.920> play<00:00:59.950> the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
that's a hard instrument to play the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.090 
that's a hard instrument to play the
crap<00:01:01.149> is<00:01:01.420> really<00:01:01.660> difficult<00:01:01.840> you<00:01:02.710> sometimes

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
crap is really difficult you sometimes

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.009 
crap is really difficult you sometimes
have<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.340> do<00:01:03.489> with<00:01:03.640> tech<00:01:03.910> with<00:01:04.119> two<00:01:04.329> hands<00:01:04.750> come

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
have to do with tech with two hands come

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.080 
have to do with tech with two hands come
up<00:01:05.110> with<00:01:05.290> five<00:01:05.500> different<00:01:05.740> voices<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.909> need

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
up with five different voices you need

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.440 
up with five different voices you need
to<00:01:07.270> figure<00:01:07.690> out<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.960> fingering<00:01:08.470> there's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
to figure out the fingering there's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.360 
to figure out the fingering there's
compositional<00:01:10.450> analysis<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.380> dynamics<00:01:12.130> and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
compositional analysis and dynamics and

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.680 
compositional analysis and dynamics and
there's<00:01:12.610> also<00:01:12.760> these<00:01:12.940> pedals<00:01:13.330> underneath

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
there's also these pedals underneath

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.180 
there's also these pedals underneath
that<00:01:13.840> somehow<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:14.170> play<00:01:14.500> with<00:01:14.620> syncopated

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
that somehow you play with syncopated

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.360 
that somehow you play with syncopated
time<00:01:15.370> and<00:01:15.640> it's<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:16.000> very<00:01:16.210> difficult<00:01:16.479> craft<00:01:17.370> the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
time and it's a very difficult craft the

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.640 
time and it's a very difficult craft the
instrument<00:01:19.000> however<00:01:19.510> is<00:01:20.049> a<00:01:20.110> piece<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.440> wood

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
instrument however is a piece of wood

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.260 
instrument however is a piece of wood
with<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:20.860> bunch<00:01:21.010> of<00:01:21.070> strings<00:01:21.370> in<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:21.700> it's<00:01:22.180> a

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
with a bunch of strings in it it's a

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.990 
with a bunch of strings in it it's a
ridiculously<00:01:22.870> simplistic<00:01:23.409> enjoyment<00:01:24.000> yeah

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
ridiculously simplistic enjoyment yeah

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.719 
ridiculously simplistic enjoyment yeah
acting<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.110> exact<00:01:26.380> opposite<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.460> craft

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
acting is the exact opposite the craft

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.090 
acting is the exact opposite the craft
is<00:01:27.909> a<00:01:28.090> joke<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.750> stand<00:01:29.620> there<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.950> say

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
is a joke you stand there you say

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.380 
is a joke you stand there you say
something<00:01:30.370> like<00:01:30.400> you<00:01:30.490> mean<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.760> everyone<00:01:31.240> does

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
something like you mean it everyone does

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.560 
something like you mean it everyone does
it<00:01:31.510> all<00:01:31.659> day<00:01:31.810> long<00:01:31.840> we're<00:01:32.470> all<00:01:32.560> good<00:01:32.770> at<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
it all day long we're all good at it the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.440 
it all day long we're all good at it the
instrument<00:01:35.320> though<00:01:35.619> is<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.330> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
instrument though is you and the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.570 
instrument though is you and the
instrument<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.110> intensely<00:01:38.890> intensely

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
instrument is intensely intensely

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.280 
instrument is intensely intensely
complex<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.450> most<00:01:40.570> complex<00:01:40.930> thing<00:01:41.049> on<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
complex the most complex thing on the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.550 
complex the most complex thing on the
planet<00:01:41.440> with<00:01:41.680> your<00:01:41.920> cranium<00:01:42.490> your

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
planet with your cranium your

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.420 
planet with your cranium your
consciousness<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.799> something<00:01:45.250> there's<00:01:45.400> no

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
consciousness is something there's no

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.219 
consciousness is something there's no
one<00:01:45.580> yet<00:01:46.060> says<00:01:46.270> figured<00:01:46.510> out<00:01:46.630> how<00:01:46.810> or<00:01:47.020> do<00:01:47.080> you

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
one yet says figured out how or do you

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.440 
one yet says figured out how or do you
mean<00:01:47.470> it's<00:01:47.680> let<00:01:47.799> alone<00:01:48.010> how<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.549> works<00:01:48.790> we<00:01:49.330> are

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
mean it's let alone how it works we are

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.500 
mean it's let alone how it works we are
intensely<00:01:49.930> complex<00:01:50.439> so<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.670> craft<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.330> acting

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
intensely complex so the craft of acting

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.960 
intensely complex so the craft of acting
is<00:01:52.930> actually<00:01:53.320> really<00:01:53.439> quite<00:01:53.680> simple<00:01:53.950> but<00:01:54.340> the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970
