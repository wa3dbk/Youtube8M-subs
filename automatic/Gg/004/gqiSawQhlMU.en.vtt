hey<00:00:00.709> we<00:00:01.709> are<00:00:01.829> all<00:00:01.979> familiar<00:00:02.190> with<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.820> idea

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hey we are all familiar with the idea

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.269 
hey we are all familiar with the idea
that<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.629> throw<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> ball<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.620> air<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.069> it

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
that you throw a ball in the air and it

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.150 
that you throw a ball in the air and it
falls<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.879> ground<00:00:06.049> so<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.319> gravity

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
falls to the ground so this is gravity

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.110 
falls to the ground so this is gravity
but<00:00:08.849> not<00:00:09.059> quite<00:00:09.360> it's<00:00:09.929> better<00:00:11.000> gravity<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
but not quite it's better gravity is a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.539 
but not quite it's better gravity is a
massively<00:00:12.750> long<00:00:13.110> range<00:00:13.440> force<00:00:13.860> between<00:00:14.130> all

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
massively long range force between all

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.689 
massively long range force between all
objects<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.299> mass<00:00:15.830> it<00:00:16.830> keeps<00:00:17.190> us<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.970 
light-years away millions of people
watched<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.910> Apple<00:00:39.270> fall<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.050> only<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:40.710> man

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
watched the Apple fall but only one man

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.299 
watched the Apple fall but only one man
asked<00:00:41.280> why<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.820> was<00:00:42.540> Isaac<00:00:42.930> Newton<00:00:43.309> he

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
asked why and that was Isaac Newton he

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.069 
asked why and that was Isaac Newton he
discovered<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> strength<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
discovered that the strength of a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.650 
discovered that the strength of a
gravitational<00:00:46.860> field<00:00:46.890> decreases<00:00:47.730> by<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
gravitational field decreases by the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.290 
gravitational field decreases by the
square<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> distance<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.120> you're

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
square of the distance so if you're

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
square of the distance so if you're
twice<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.660> far<00:00:52.079> away<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.219> gravity<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
twice as far away then the gravity is

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.930 
twice as far away then the gravity is
only<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.180> fourth<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.820> he<00:00:56.820> also

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
only a fourth of what it was he also

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.000 
only a fourth of what it was he also
discovered<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.870> proportional<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
discovered that is proportional to the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.939 
discovered that is proportional to the
mass<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> two<00:00:59.789> objects<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:01.199> more<00:01:01.440> mass<00:01:01.739> an

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
mass of the two objects the more mass an

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.429 
mass of the two objects the more mass an
object<00:01:02.039> has<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.940> bigger<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.449> Paul<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
object has the bigger it's Paul which is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
object has the bigger it's Paul which is
why<00:01:04.650> we're<00:01:05.010> stuck<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> earth<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.150> not

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
why we're stuck on the earth and not

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.320 
why we're stuck on the earth and not
affected<00:01:07.229> by<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.439> moon<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> oceans<00:01:09.090> are

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
affected by the moon but the oceans are

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
affected by the moon but the oceans are
this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.770> larger<00:01:11.250> mass

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this is because they have a larger mass

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.960 
this is because they have a larger mass
and<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.420> affected<00:01:13.820> remember<00:01:14.820> how<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and so can be affected remember how I

is<00:01:49.950> how<00:01:50.100> light<00:01:50.400> behaves<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.560> because

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
is how light behaves this is because

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.390 
is how light behaves this is because
gravity<00:01:53.700> warp<00:01:54.120> space-time<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.040> nice

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
gravity warp space-time and so a nice

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.030 
gravity warp space-time and so a nice

here<00:01:59.280> this<00:02:00.000> causes<00:02:00.330> photons<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.380> curve<00:02:01.680> round

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
here this causes photons to curve round
