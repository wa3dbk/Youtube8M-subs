all right I'm gonna grind these down

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.300 
all right I'm gonna grind these down
take<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.810> good<00:00:03.959> look<00:00:04.140> at<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.529> it's<00:00:04.980> just<00:00:05.190> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
take a good look at this it's just a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.390 
take a good look at this it's just a
flat<00:00:05.640> blank<00:00:06.210> it's<00:00:07.140> not<00:00:07.319> sharp<00:00:07.649> at<00:00:07.799> all<00:00:07.919> still

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
flat blank it's not sharp at all still

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.280 
flat blank it's not sharp at all still
pretty<00:00:08.580> rough<00:00:08.940> but<00:00:09.929> there's<00:00:10.170> no<00:00:10.349> edge<00:00:10.650> at<00:00:10.830> all

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
pretty rough but there's no edge at all

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.900 
pretty rough but there's no edge at all
what<00:00:13.290> i'm<00:00:13.380> doing<00:00:13.620> here<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.009> i'm<00:00:14.490> putting<00:00:14.849> an

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
what i'm doing here is i'm putting an

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.320 
what i'm doing here is i'm putting an
edge<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.710> up<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> pointed<00:00:17.369> tip<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:18.150> both

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
edge on up to a pointed tip on both

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.349 
edge on up to a pointed tip on both
sides<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.320> can<00:00:19.380> see<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.240> it's<00:00:21.240> not

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
sides and all you can see that it's not

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.109 
sides and all you can see that it's not
a<00:00:21.420> perfectly<00:00:21.930> straight<00:00:22.199> edge<00:00:22.699> but<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.029> only

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
a perfectly straight edge but the only

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.640 
a perfectly straight edge but the only
thing<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.420> matters<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.189> tip<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.650> try

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
thing really matters is the tip and try

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.990 
thing really matters is the tip and try
to<00:00:28.710> throw<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> piece<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> wood<00:00:29.670> already

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
to throw this in a piece of wood already

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.749 
to throw this in a piece of wood already
and<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.960> tip<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.439> bent<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> way<00:00:32.489> back

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and the tip just bent all the way back

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.340 
and the tip just bent all the way back
and<00:00:33.000> disintegrated<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.780> they're<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and disintegrated so they're going to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.100 
and disintegrated so they're going to
have<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.829> heated<00:00:35.130> up<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.469> treated<00:00:39.110> so

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
have to be heated up and treated so

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.600 
have to be heated up and treated so
there<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.739> i'm<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> show<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
there we go i'm going to show you how to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:01:25.030 
there we go i'm going to show you how to
put<00:00:41.700> an<00:00:41.820> edge<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.120> these<00:00:42.300> knives

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:02:17.260 

there's<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.730> beginning<00:01:26.120> stage<00:01:26.570> there

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.480 

see<00:02:17.990> it's<00:02:18.170> getting<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.410> lot<00:02:18.560> closer<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.160> I'm

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
see it's getting a lot closer and I'm

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.080 
see it's getting a lot closer and I'm
going<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.670> see<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.060> at<00:02:20.150> all

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
going to see that at all

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.130 
going to see that at all
not<00:02:22.660> there<00:02:22.930> yet<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:23.470> pretty<00:02:23.650> thick<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
not there yet it's so pretty thick that

00:02:26.140 --> 00:03:18.280 
not there yet it's so pretty thick that
side<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> lot<00:02:28.239> closer

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:53.950 

you

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.440 

that's<00:03:54.560> one<00:03:54.770> side<00:03:55.070> there<00:03:57.760> it's<00:03:58.760> not<00:03:58.970> perfect

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
that's one side there it's not perfect

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.900 
that's one side there it's not perfect
by<00:03:59.570> any<00:03:59.600> means<00:04:02.770> real<00:04:03.770> close<00:04:04.040> I'll<00:04:04.430> go<00:04:04.640> through

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
by any means real close I'll go through

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.650 
by any means real close I'll go through
a<00:04:04.970> strike<00:04:05.680> peace<00:04:06.680> mang<00:04:06.980> while<00:04:07.250> both<00:04:07.490> ends<00:04:07.940> I'll

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
a strike peace mang while both ends I'll

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:25.720 
a strike peace mang while both ends I'll
let<00:04:08.840> them<00:04:09.050> run

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.720 

try<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.450> run<00:04:26.600> all<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.380> way<00:04:27.440> true<00:04:27.890> from<00:04:28.460> front

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
try to run all the way true from front

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.880 
try to run all the way true from front
to<00:04:28.790> back<00:04:28.880> if<00:04:29.270> not<00:04:29.510> you'll<00:04:29.780> have<00:04:30.020> different

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
to back if not you'll have different

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.950 
to back if not you'll have different
angles<00:04:31.250> all<00:04:31.400> over<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.700> place<00:04:31.910> right<00:04:32.210> now<00:04:32.930> I

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
angles all over the place right now I

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.170 
angles all over the place right now I
have<00:04:33.170> a<00:04:33.200> top<00:04:33.470> level<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.280> bottom<00:04:34.640> one<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:34.970> got

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
have a top level and a bottom one I got

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.870 
have a top level and a bottom one I got
to<00:04:35.270> blend<00:04:35.450> all<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.840> in<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:36.370> go<00:04:37.370> through<00:04:37.640> again

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
to blend all that in so go through again

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.560 
to blend all that in so go through again
it<00:04:38.390> looks<00:04:38.630> good<00:04:39.160> there's<00:04:40.160> two<00:04:40.430> levels<00:04:41.090> two

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
it looks good there's two levels two

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.960 
it looks good there's two levels two
angles<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.230> got<00:04:42.890> to<00:04:42.980> burn<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.280> down<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.730> one

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
angles I got to burn that down to one

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.290 
angles I got to burn that down to one
and<00:04:44.420> I'll<00:04:44.720> do<00:04:44.930> that<00:04:45.080> for<00:04:45.380> both<00:04:45.530> sides<00:04:46.210> will<00:04:47.210> be

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
and I'll do that for both sides will be

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.750 
and I'll do that for both sides will be
done<00:04:47.480> that's<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.130> thanks

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.790 

Oh
