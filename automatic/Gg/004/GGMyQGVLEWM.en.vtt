00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.600
 the torrijas is a typical dessert 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.770
 Easter 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.350
 now we explain how to make them 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.140
 to make the bread torrijas we use 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.480
 bread from the previous day better than hard than 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.700
 it's gummy we put it in a bag of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.440
 plastic and the next day we cut it 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.440
 in slices of 12 centimeters 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.050
 we make a mixture with beaten egg 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.890
 cream and milk 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.890
 i 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.770
 and we use this mixture to soak 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.770
 the bread slices 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.610
 We let them rest in the fridge 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.289
 about an hour also what 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.199
 we can do the day before and leave them 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.780
 all night they will get better 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.469
 to fry the torrijas we put a little 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.469
 of oil in a pan 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.710
 we went through beaten egg 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.640
 We fry them in medium strong oil 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.320
 we take out of the oil a dish with a 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.130
 Absorbent paper to remove the excess 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.130
 of oil 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.299
 and still hot we went through a 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.299
 mixture of sugar and cinnamon 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.170
 can be served hot or cold 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.990
 we also intend to make some 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.030
 Torrijas de BrÃ­os that are not fried but 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.770
 grilled so the mixture 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.630
 to make the soaking will be a cream 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.969
 cooked we will make an English cream 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.189
 we started in fusing the milk to 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.439
 that we put 400 milliliters in a 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.569
 casserole with orange peel skin 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.840
 lemon and a little bit of vanilla we can use 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.209
 natural vanilla or sugar vanilla dow 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.340
 the milk should not boil simply that 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.910
 be infused and impregnated of all 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.730
 flavors 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.730
 On the other hand we beat 4 egg yolks 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.440
 we add about 100 grams of sugar 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.440
 taste if you want more or less sweet 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.260
 we beat well and add 100 milliliters 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.900
 of milk approximately half a glass 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.200
 then what we do is add the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.930
 hot milk over the yolk mixture 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.579
 or sugar and cold milk very little by little 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.040
 so that it does not set very fast 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.590
 buds and then we reintroduce 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.599
 all the mixture again in the casserole and 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.239
 we remove very gently also without 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.879
 come to boil we cook 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.709
 approximately between 3 and 5 minutes 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.290
 we cut the brightness we can use bread 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.769
 of milk to little slices and we spread it in 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.769
 a plate 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.940
 re wet the sprigs of energy with the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.940
 English cream 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.140
 We put in a refrigerator to cool 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.300
 if we also want to make it more 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.400
 easy to manipulate we can put more in 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.020
 the freezer and then make them 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.360
 frozen 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.730
 to finish we prepare a pan a 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.400
 iron spread with oil and we do the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.910
 turn round torrijas until they are 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.910
 toasts 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.350
 we propose these two recipes 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.780
 torrijas and we invite you to try 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.400
 other options such as adding a little 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.740
 of honey or a trickle of anise 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.090
 I hope you cook this Easter 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.090
 bon appetit torrijas
