show original signal you'll see that it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.240 
show original signal you'll see that it
becomes<00:01:51.299> much<00:01:51.570> flatter<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> have

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
becomes much flatter and that you have

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.170 
becomes much flatter and that you have
all<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.390> detail<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> shadows<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.180> more

detail on the highlights then without
that<00:01:59.250> transform<00:01:59.790> applied<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.899> what<00:02:01.079> I'm<00:02:01.170> going

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that transform applied so what I'm going

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.910 
that transform applied so what I'm going
to<00:02:01.380> go<00:02:01.469> ahead<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.310> turn<00:02:02.820> off<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
to go ahead and do now is turn off that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
to go ahead and do now is turn off that
show<00:02:04.920> original<00:02:05.369> signal<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> what

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
show original signal and this is what

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.160 
show original signal and this is what
the<00:02:07.140> default<00:02:07.350> Alexa<00:02:08.250> tone<00:02:08.429> map<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.140> what<00:02:10.140> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the default Alexa tone map and what I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.149 
the default Alexa tone map and what I
can<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.739> here<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.390> edit<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
can do in here is edit the

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.030 
can do in here is edit the
that's<00:02:13.819> one<00:02:14.030> way<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.209> affecting<00:02:14.689> the<00:02:14.810> signal

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
that's one way of affecting the signal

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.199 
that's one way of affecting the signal
what<00:02:16.040> I'm<00:02:16.129> gonna<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.519> go<00:02:16.700> ahead<00:02:16.909> and<00:02:17.000> lift

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
what I'm gonna do is go ahead and lift

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.089 
what I'm gonna do is go ahead and lift
the<00:02:17.450> shadows<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> little<00:02:18.049> bit<00:02:18.379> so<00:02:18.650> there's<00:02:19.040> a

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
the shadows a little bit so there's a

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.610 
the shadows a little bit so there's a
little<00:02:19.400> more<00:02:19.549> shadow<00:02:19.790> detail<00:02:20.329> but<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.260> still

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
little more shadow detail but you still

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.699 
little more shadow detail but you still
have<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.980> nice<00:02:22.159> shoulder<00:02:22.730> handling<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.709> this

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
have the nice shoulder handling of this

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.569 
have the nice shoulder handling of this
particular<00:02:25.340> tone<00:02:25.579> map<00:02:25.819> so<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.409> know<00:02:27.530> I'm<00:02:28.370> not

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
particular tone map so you know I'm not

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.789 
particular tone map so you know I'm not
blowing<00:02:28.879> out<00:02:29.120> where<00:02:29.359> there's<00:02:29.590> super<00:02:30.590> hot

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
blowing out where there's super hot

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.470 
blowing out where there's super hot
light<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.250> mean<00:02:31.459> it's<00:02:31.579> a<00:02:31.670> little<00:02:31.849> brighter<00:02:32.060> but

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
light I mean it's a little brighter but

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.179 
light I mean it's a little brighter but
you<00:02:33.049> know<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.349> affect<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.769> too<00:02:33.980> you'll

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
you know I can affect that too you'll

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.699 
you know I can affect that too you'll
see<00:02:34.400> if<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:34.670> hold<00:02:34.819> my<00:02:34.939> hand<00:02:35.180> here<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:36.260> effect<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
see if I hold my hand here in effect the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.940 
see if I hold my hand here in effect the
shoulder<00:02:37.099> it<00:02:37.549> just<00:02:37.939> takes<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.950> shoulder

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
shoulder it just takes that shoulder

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.220 
shoulder it just takes that shoulder
area<00:02:40.280> down<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.489> little<00:02:40.730> bit<00:02:40.939> so<00:02:41.720> that's<00:02:41.840> using

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
area down a little bit so that's using

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.059 
area down a little bit so that's using
the<00:02:42.349> curve<00:02:42.590> tool<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.280> live<00:02:43.670> grade<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.920> can

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
the curve tool in live grade and we can

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.420 
the curve tool in live grade and we can
also<00:02:46.220> affect<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.480> color<00:02:48.220> with<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.280> color

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
also affect the color with the color

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.940 
also affect the color with the color
balls<00:02:49.760> over<00:02:50.120> here<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.379> can<00:02:51.530> adjust<00:02:51.859> your

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
balls over here so you can adjust your

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.819 
balls over here so you can adjust your
shadows<00:02:52.579> mid-tones<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.420> highlights<00:02:53.829> using

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
shadows mid-tones and highlights using

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.460 
shadows mid-tones and highlights using
the<00:02:54.950> color<00:02:55.159> wheel<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.690> can<00:02:56.840> also<00:02:56.989> affect

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
the color wheel and you can also affect

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.349 
the color wheel and you can also affect
the<00:02:57.620> saturation<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.579> just<00:02:58.970> for<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.180> heck<00:02:59.329> of

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
the saturation so just for the heck of

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.690 
the saturation so just for the heck of
it<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:03:00.109> gonna<00:03:00.290> turn<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.680> saturation<00:03:00.859> way<00:03:01.489> up

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
it I'm gonna turn the saturation way up

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.629 
it I'm gonna turn the saturation way up
and<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:03.019> can<00:03:03.170> see<00:03:03.409> the<00:03:03.859> picture<00:03:04.159> getting<00:03:04.340> more

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
and you can see the picture getting more

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.699 
and you can see the picture getting more
saturated<00:03:05.269> over<00:03:05.629> here<00:03:07.840> much<00:03:08.840> much<00:03:09.439> more

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
saturated over here much much more

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.190 
saturated over here much much more
saturated<00:03:10.159> too<00:03:10.489> saturated<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.629> I'll<00:03:11.989> take<00:03:12.139> it

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
saturated too saturated so I'll take it

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.440 
saturated too saturated so I'll take it
down<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.670> we'll<00:03:13.970> sort<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.209> split<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
down and we'll sort of split the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.330 
down and we'll sort of split the
difference<00:03:14.720> with<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.439> little<00:03:15.739> more<00:03:15.889> punchy

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
difference with a little more punchy

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.240 
difference with a little more punchy
image<00:03:16.669> and<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.379> notice<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.829> on<00:03:19.040> this

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
image and you can notice that on this

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.339 
image and you can notice that on this
monitor<00:03:19.609> my<00:03:20.389> skin<00:03:20.690> tones<00:03:20.900> are<00:03:21.049> looking<00:03:21.290> a

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
monitor my skin tones are looking a

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.259 
monitor my skin tones are looking a
little<00:03:21.440> warm<00:03:21.799> in<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:22.220> mids<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.910> shoulder

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
little warm in the mids to the shoulder

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.479 
little warm in the mids to the shoulder
so<00:03:23.989> I'll<00:03:24.260> cool<00:03:24.530> those<00:03:24.769> down<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.069> little<00:03:25.310> bit

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
so I'll cool those down a little bit

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.809 
so I'll cool those down a little bit
just<00:03:25.699> for<00:03:25.879> the<00:03:25.940> heck<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:28.340> can<00:03:28.519> see<00:03:28.699> it's

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
just for the heck of it you can see it's

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.740 
just for the heck of it you can see it's
getting<00:03:28.940> cooler<00:03:30.879> while<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:31.970> shadows<00:03:32.389> where

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
getting cooler while the shadows where

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.629 
getting cooler while the shadows where
the<00:03:32.840> wood<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.049> are<00:03:33.349> still<00:03:33.470> warm<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.069> my<00:03:34.430> hats

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
the wood is are still warm and my hats

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.699 
the wood is are still warm and my hats
still<00:03:34.819> kind<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.209> warm<00:03:35.419> and<00:03:35.659> also<00:03:36.409> cool<00:03:36.680> to

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
still kind of warm and also cool to

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.699 
still kind of warm and also cool to
highlights<00:03:37.129> off<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.370> little<00:03:37.579> bit<00:03:38.109> so<00:03:39.109> that's<00:03:39.349> a

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
highlights off a little bit so that's a

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.869 
highlights off a little bit so that's a
little<00:03:40.459> popular<00:03:41.060> more<00:03:41.389> saturated<00:03:41.930> look<00:03:42.879> with

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
little popular more saturated look with

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.520 
little popular more saturated look with
a<00:03:44.150> little<00:03:44.389> bit<00:03:44.510> cooler<00:03:44.780> mids<00:03:45.109> and<00:03:45.290> cooler

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
a little bit cooler mids and cooler

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.189 
a little bit cooler mids and cooler
highlights<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:47.120> what's<00:03:47.569> cool<00:03:47.750> about<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:48.139> is

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
highlights and what's cool about this is

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.770 
highlights and what's cool about this is
that<00:03:48.470> it's<00:03:48.620> non-destructive<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:50.120> what<00:03:50.629> you're

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
that it's non-destructive so what you're

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.610 
that it's non-destructive so what you're
