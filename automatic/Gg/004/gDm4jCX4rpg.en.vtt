00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
pieces here but I didn't need to do that

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.590 
pieces here but I didn't need to do that
because<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.870> did<00:03:13.350> this<00:03:13.590> piece<00:03:13.890> first<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.730> then

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
because I did this piece first and then

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600 
because I did this piece first and then
I<00:03:15.630> think<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.260> then<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.500> tie<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.800> twine<00:03:17.280> around

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
I think and then I tie the twine around

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.820 
I think and then I tie the twine around
it<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.420> wrapped<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.930> around<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.560> back

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
it and then I wrapped it around the back

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.440 
it and then I wrapped it around the back
of<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.190> envelope<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.760> said<00:03:20.940> why<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.060> didn't

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
of the envelope I said why I didn't

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.780 
of the envelope I said why I didn't
doing<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.990> that<00:03:22.170> way<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:23.100> just<00:03:23.130> wrap<00:03:23.760> it

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
doing it that way I can just wrap it

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.640 
doing it that way I can just wrap it
around<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.720> bring<00:03:24.990> it<00:03:25.110> from<00:03:25.290> around<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
around like bring it from around the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.130 
around like bring it from around the
back<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:25.920> still<00:03:26.430> close<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:27.750> that's<00:03:27.930> what<00:03:28.110> I

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
back and still close it so that's what I

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.050 
back and still close it so that's what I
decided<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.770> do<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.190> eliminate<00:03:29.850> one<00:03:30.030> of

that's it's notepads and I started

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.530 
that's it's notepads and I started
readjusting<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:16.950> measurements<00:04:17.520> to<00:04:17.670> fit<00:04:18.390> the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
readjusting the measurements to fit the

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.650 
readjusting the measurements to fit the
5<00:04:18.720> by<00:04:18.930> 8<00:04:19.200> 5<00:04:19.710> by<00:04:19.919> 7<00:04:19.979> that<00:04:20.460> I<00:04:20.489> had<00:04:20.760> but<00:04:21.419> then<00:04:21.630> I

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
5 by 8 5 by 7 that I had but then I

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.080 
5 by 8 5 by 7 that I had but then I
realized<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.470> have<00:04:22.650> 4<00:04:22.830> by<00:04:22.950> 6<00:04:23.310> new<00:04:23.580> car

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
realized I have 4 by 6 new car

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.790 
realized I have 4 by 6 new car
it's<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.330> orientation<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.500> would<00:04:25.650> be

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
it's the orientation of it would be

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.680 
it's the orientation of it would be
different<00:04:26.280> but<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.669> concept<00:04:27.180> is<00:04:27.300> still<00:04:27.419> the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
different but the concept is still the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.400 
different but the concept is still the
same<00:04:27.990> so<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.070> inspiration<00:04:29.370> piece<00:04:30.050> goes<00:04:31.050> this

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
same so the inspiration piece goes this

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.760 
same so the inspiration piece goes this
way<00:04:32.270> but<00:04:33.270> as<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:33.600> see<00:04:33.810> I<00:04:33.840> had<00:04:34.080> because<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.560> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
way but as you see I had because of the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.189 
way but as you see I had because of the
new<00:04:34.919> cars<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.660> do<00:04:36.840> my<00:04:37.729> landscape<00:04:39.199> and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
then here was another envelope here and

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.390 
then here was another envelope here and
then<00:04:43.080> I'll<00:04:43.199> just<00:04:43.380> flip<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.650> real<00:04:43.919> quickly<00:04:44.160> show

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
I'm tired it's like a first time I tried

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.909 
I'm tired it's like a first time I tried
to<00:06:11.910> do<00:06:12.030> this<00:06:12.150> video<00:06:12.539> but<00:06:13.289> that's<00:06:13.560> what<00:06:13.800> I<00:06:13.830> did

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
to do this video but that's what I did

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.629 
to do this video but that's what I did
so<00:06:14.070> that's<00:06:14.400> how<00:06:14.669> I<00:06:14.700> was<00:06:15.030> able<00:06:15.150> to<00:06:15.479> stick<00:06:15.810> all<00:06:16.110> my

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
so that's how I was able to stick all my

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.110 
so that's how I was able to stick all my
new<00:06:17.639> cards<00:06:18.120> together<00:06:18.360> and<00:06:19.010> in<00:06:20.010> hindsight<00:06:20.430> if<00:06:20.970> I

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
new cards together and in hindsight if I

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.029 
new cards together and in hindsight if I
was<00:06:21.270> thinking<00:06:21.810> I<00:06:21.930> wouldn't<00:06:22.200> even<00:06:22.470> cut<00:06:22.860> these

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
was thinking I wouldn't even cut these

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.310 
was thinking I wouldn't even cut these
down<00:06:23.460> so<00:06:23.490> that<00:06:23.910> they<00:06:24.060> could<00:06:24.270> fit<00:06:24.630> inside<00:06:25.020> this

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
down so that they could fit inside this

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.770 
down so that they could fit inside this
pocket<00:06:25.680> in<00:06:26.039> case<00:06:26.250> you<00:06:26.400> know<00:06:26.520> I<00:06:26.550> wanted<00:06:26.880> to<00:06:27.060> you

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
pocket in case you know I wanted to you

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.330 
pocket in case you know I wanted to you
know<00:06:27.810> put<00:06:28.110> something<00:06:28.320> in<00:06:28.620> there<00:06:28.800> I<00:06:28.919> guess<00:06:29.190> I

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340
