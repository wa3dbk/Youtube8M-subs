00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
compared to the packaging it's not very

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.799 
compared to the packaging it's not very
great<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.010> then<00:00:45.489> this<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.030> consistency

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
great and then this is the consistency

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.080

of<00:00:46.840> it<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.320> did<00:00:47.890> get<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.130> lighter<00:00:48.399> one<00:00:48.610> because

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
of it I did get a lighter one because

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.120 
of it I did get a lighter one because
for<00:00:49.719> some<00:00:49.899> reason<00:00:50.230> I<00:00:50.410> always<00:00:50.440> think<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:50.950> I'm

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
for some reason I always think that I'm

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.030 
for some reason I always think that I'm
very<00:00:51.160> very<00:00:51.370> dark<00:00:51.820> but<00:00:52.270> I'm<00:00:52.450> not<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:53.290> fat<00:00:53.649> dark

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
very very dark but I'm not that fat dark

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.150 
very very dark but I'm not that fat dark
that<00:00:54.340> I<00:00:54.370> am<00:00:54.730> quite<00:00:55.180> tan<00:00:55.510> year-round<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.739> so<00:00:57.100> I

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
that I am quite tan year-round but so I

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.069 
that I am quite tan year-round but so I
got<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.670> medium<00:00:58.120> light<00:00:58.450> which<00:00:58.690> I'm<00:00:58.930> really

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
got the medium light which I'm really

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.779 
got the medium light which I'm really
really<00:00:59.320> happy<00:00:59.710> I<00:00:59.739> did<00:00:59.980> because<00:01:00.010> this<00:01:00.309> does

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
really happy I did because this does

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.350 
really happy I did because this does
tend<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.539> oxidize<00:01:02.079> so<00:01:03.039> once<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.399> oxidizes<00:01:04.149> it

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
tend to oxidize so once it oxidizes it

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.090 
tend to oxidize so once it oxidizes it
actually<00:01:04.809> gets<00:01:04.989> darker<00:01:05.410> so<00:01:05.649> if<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:05.920> don't

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
actually gets darker so if you don't

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.580 
actually gets darker so if you don't
blend<00:01:06.369> it<00:01:06.520> very<00:01:06.550> well<00:01:06.880> on<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.420> sides<00:01:07.720> you<00:01:08.470> can

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
blend it very well on the sides you can

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.080 
blend it very well on the sides you can
actually<00:01:08.800> see<00:01:09.160> that<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.430> gets<00:01:09.520> darker<00:01:09.940> than

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
actually see that it gets darker than

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.840 
actually see that it gets darker than
when<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.330> first<00:01:10.570> pour<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.110> out<00:01:11.369> my<00:01:12.369> second

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
when you first pour it out my second

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.809 
when you first pour it out my second

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
using it I didn't have very big

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.070 
using it I didn't have very big
expectations<00:01:33.099> of<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.399> and<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:34.479> be<00:01:34.509> honest<00:01:34.990> the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
expectations of it and to be honest the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.230 
expectations of it and to be honest the
consistency<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:36.009> also<00:01:36.220> totally<00:01:36.729> throws

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
consistency of it also totally throws

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.300 
consistency of it also totally throws
you<00:01:37.420> off<00:01:37.599> so<00:01:37.869> when<00:01:38.349> you<00:01:38.440> put<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.770> on<00:01:38.920> it's<00:01:39.190> very

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
you off so when you put it on it's very

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.419 
you off so when you put it on it's very
very<00:01:39.849> very<00:01:40.060> oily<00:01:40.599> so<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.349> think<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:42.069> it's

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
very very oily so you think that it's

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.730 
very very oily so you think that it's
not<00:01:42.819> gonna<00:01:43.090> absorb<00:01:43.479> any<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:43.869> your<00:01:44.020> oiliness<00:01:44.410> on

not gonna absorb any of your oiliness on

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.190 
not gonna absorb any of your oiliness on
your<00:01:44.920> eyelids<00:01:45.369> but<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.119> really<00:01:46.539> really<00:01:46.780> does

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
us would use it as a shadow because it's

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.010

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
very very subtle contour well I might

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.260 
very very subtle contour well I might
wear<00:05:10.190> this<00:05:10.340> when<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.610> get<00:05:10.699> a<00:05:10.820> little<00:05:11.000> bit<00:05:11.180> more
