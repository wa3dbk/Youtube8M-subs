for him spends a bar and still loses the
round<00:02:10.370> meter<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.730> important<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.360> game

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
round meter is so important in this game

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.270 
round meter is so important in this game
but<00:02:12.780> he's<00:02:13.380> starting<00:02:13.710> off<00:02:13.800> at<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> pretty<00:02:14.160> big

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280

deficit

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.790 

and<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.690> lets<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.900> play<00:02:19.020> offense<00:02:19.410> better<00:02:19.620> if

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
and it lets you play offense better if

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.520 
and it lets you play offense better if
you<00:02:19.860> wait<00:02:20.040> defense<00:02:20.400> better<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.810> everything

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
you wait defense better is everything

like<00:04:09.410> Elena<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:10.250> very<00:04:10.520> annoying<00:04:10.850> for<00:04:10.940> gin

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
like Elena is is very annoying for gin

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.330 
like Elena is is very annoying for gin
primarily<00:04:11.720> because<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.080> just<00:04:12.500> how<00:04:12.620> far<00:04:13.010> and

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
primarily because of just how far and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.400 
primarily because of just how far and
how<00:04:13.370> safe<00:04:13.670> her<00:04:13.910> slide<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.810> also<00:04:15.020> because<00:04:15.380> a

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
how safe her slide is and also because a

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.130 
how safe her slide is and also because a
lot<00:04:15.680> of<00:04:15.709> her<00:04:15.890> normals<00:04:16.359> just<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.660> hitboxes

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
lot of her normals just the hitboxes

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.539 
lot of her normals just the hitboxes
attack<00:04:18.440> from<00:04:18.590> angles<00:04:18.920> that<00:04:19.040> Jenna<00:04:19.250> has<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.400> lot

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
attack from angles that Jenna has a lot

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.430 
attack from angles that Jenna has a lot
of<00:04:19.580> trouble<00:04:19.910> counter<00:04:20.150> hitting<00:04:20.390> yeah<00:04:21.080> I<00:04:21.109> think

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
of trouble counter hitting yeah I think

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.600 
of trouble counter hitting yeah I think
she<00:04:21.590> has<00:04:21.709> pretty<00:04:21.890> good<00:04:21.950> footsie<00:04:22.250> game<00:04:22.370> she<00:04:22.580> has

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
she has pretty good footsie game she has

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.030 
she has pretty good footsie game she has
some<00:04:22.820> some<00:04:23.180> mix<00:04:23.360> ups<00:04:23.540> up<00:04:23.660> close<00:04:23.870> but<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.890> might

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
some some mix ups up close but you might

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.920 
some some mix ups up close but you might
also<00:04:25.220> be<00:04:25.460> betting<00:04:25.670> that<00:04:25.970> Momo<00:04:26.540> she<00:04:26.600> does<00:04:26.810> not

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
also be betting that Momo she does not

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.870 
also be betting that Momo she does not
have<00:04:27.140> Elena<00:04:27.590> experience<00:04:28.220> he<00:04:28.490> might<00:04:28.640> be<00:04:28.730> right

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
have Elena experience he might be right

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.550 
have Elena experience he might be right
about<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:29.180> not<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.600> very<00:04:29.780> good<00:04:29.900> common

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
about that not a very good common

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.040 
about that not a very good common
character<00:04:30.890> at<00:04:30.980> all<00:04:31.240> my<00:04:32.240> only<00:04:32.540> experience<00:04:32.840> with

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.260 

skee<00:04:41.770> plates<00:04:42.010> are<00:04:42.160> very<00:04:42.340> vague<00:04:42.610> alike<00:04:43.030> so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
skee plates are very vague alike so

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.310 
skee plates are very vague alike so
we'll<00:04:43.420> see<00:04:43.570> if<00:04:43.660> that's<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.900> justin<00:04:44.200> is<00:04:44.290> doing

we'll see if that's a justin is doing

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.020 
we'll see if that's a justin is doing
here<00:04:44.620> yeah<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:47.010> see<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.040> lot<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.250> common<00:04:48.640> tactics

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
here yeah I see a lot of common tactics

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.820 
here yeah I see a lot of common tactics
already<00:04:49.330> though<00:04:49.540> see<00:04:49.960> good<00:04:50.290> usage<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.710> the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
already though see good usage of the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.590 
already though see good usage of the
slide<00:04:51.100> although<00:04:51.580> she<00:04:51.880> was<00:04:52.090> prepared

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
slide although she was prepared

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.690 
slide although she was prepared
perfect<00:04:53.470> timing<00:04:53.590> on<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.800> fireball<00:04:54.160> that's

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
perfect timing on the fireball that's

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.120 
perfect timing on the fireball that's
flat<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:55.480> far<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:56.050> goes<00:04:56.200> really<00:04:56.500> far<00:04:56.770> it's<00:04:56.950> very

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
flat so far it goes really far it's very

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.650 
flat so far it goes really far it's very
safe<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.730> you<00:04:57.850> hit<00:04:58.030> all<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.480> lead

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
safe to if you hit all in the lead

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:06.140 
safe to if you hit all in the lead
frames<00:04:58.960> yeah<00:04:59.350> and<00:04:59.470> really<00:04:59.650> hard<00:04:59.800> to<00:04:59.890> react<00:05:00.100> to

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.430 

great<00:05:07.150> usage<00:05:07.420> of<00:05:07.570> those<00:05:07.690> normals<00:05:08.080> from<00:05:08.140> alehna

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
great usage of those normals from alehna

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.830 
great usage of those normals from alehna
but<00:05:08.800> mostly<00:05:09.550> with<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.790> patient<00:05:10.210> stuff<00:05:10.450> gets<00:05:10.720> a

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
but mostly with the patient stuff gets a

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.970 
but mostly with the patient stuff gets a
combo<00:05:12.930> not<00:05:13.930> enough<00:05:14.140> here<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.350> switch<00:05:14.620> counsel

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
combo not enough here to switch counsel

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.530
