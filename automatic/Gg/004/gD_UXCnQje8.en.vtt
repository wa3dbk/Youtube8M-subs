00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 yes and welcome to another 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.109
 video today I show you from one 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.750
 normal minecraft service.de at 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.120
 multi channel sets everything that way 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.860
 her on the shopping center also 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.330
 ticket server or a fourth bi 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.300
 server could manage for the first time 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.609
 of course you have to be on your game 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.359
 log in server 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.510
 there I would first with the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.470
 account also provides mail account 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:36.450
 lure us with the extra test 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.550
 account for me one so here is the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.210
 momentary microserver we can easily 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.640
 times as a test show that a whole 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.399
 normal backup server is going here 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.989
 the live console is already here 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.030
 creates a normal stink normal 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.000
 minecraft pocket server on the version 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.390
 1.5 point 2 as selected here 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.859
 was around the now ticket or 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.300
 fourth is compatible 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.300
 Of course, first of all, but stop 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:14.189
 that takes a little moment and then 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.150
 if you go on expanding you go now 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:22.259
 here on the server chooses as clear the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.330
 own tat of custom cloud so off and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.090
 in this case, the file is called custom 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.930
 points as she gets up press here and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.049
 save on 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.110
 and there it is already stored 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.840
 then we go to fdp access copy 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.509
 us here our horst ip and support 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.979
 our fdp username and our multi 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.899
 Power passwords is the password with 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 we just logged in up here 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.329
 With these data we lure each other 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.780
 For example, in wind scp, that one 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.299
 fdp administration program there we choose 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.920
 fdp as a transmission protocol from the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.890
 Encryption does not really matter 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.850
 as the computer name we enter the ip 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.619
 the one above is also 37 points 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.890
 11 4.58 point 75 as the username here 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.690
 how she stands up test account point 43 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.800
 or just your username putt 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:22.270
 all of us, of course, different and different 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.620
 our password so then we are too 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.500
 already connected and here we have like 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.840
 said the normal budget server 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.960
 Then we give it to the ticket 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.340
 awarded at google informatik it 1 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.710
 Finding Immediately has long since become technology 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:45.280
 pack and then we go ahead in advance 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:51.580
 pÃ©cs or are we looking for the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.560
 fact from a classic tablecloth 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.690
 The whole days ticket is a sorrow 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.640
 slimmed down version of a child 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.560
 the whole mile ticket it can of course 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.360
 be made with any text version 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.030
 just have to louder later in the text 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.010
 Select because the ticket you now 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.280
 want to have and which stretch that too 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.020
 but have installed on the server 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.880
 that serve principle is at all ticket 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.060
 versions also at david the beast 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.959
 version equal so we are looking for here 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.730
 the download below is server as 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.709
 download title 1.0 point six server 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.560
 you press it and then the whole 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.660
 down in time pause narrow so 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.270
 the file was downloaded the 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:37.360
 archive now we open with winrar and 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:39.000
 Here it is already possible 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.410
 we also close the page here again 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:50.590
 our windmill will open crooked too 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:53.200
 again wind scp and then because the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.420
 whole folder up here except the lounge 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.000
 point and lounge point sh need the 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:03.459
 neither of us that it's a game server 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.410
 is and you do not have any consoles 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.070
 can over the console then just no 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.260
 bac or no sht start at 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.160
 a party needs windows anyway 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.780
 will and the servers will run on linux 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.760
 we take the whole one here and download 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.470
 pause the whole thing high in time 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.220
 again 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.210
 yes, these are here again and as you can see 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.010
 uploaded everything 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.340
 then we have to take the last step 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.960
 Now we call the ticket.de 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.030
 Indenture took to have chosen 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.530
 in the case so custom points so then 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.080
 we can also go back to the control panel 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:50.310
 go and then we'll click 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.310
 start gameserver clean again 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.850
 Therefore starts here the cpu 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.460
 performance goes where cpu utilization goes 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.300
 high and then maybe that should 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.300
 actually be ready 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.090
 see here is also all 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.090
 activated and installed 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:36.500
 so do not pause again just like that 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.140
 Although panel does not indicate that the 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.340
 server online is but as you can see 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.260
 you can see here and the cpu utilization 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.040
 which I move normally and the 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.780
 random access memory 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.720
 then I just tried but 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.300
 can access the server and it 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.040
 so it seems that has only a bug 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.190
 in the web interface that was not it 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.750
 minecraft server itself is not 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.430
 appears that yourself online 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.650
 then there is just this whole thing 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.210
 this restart sign what do you do 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.890
 actually nothing that runs itself 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.270
 can walk around and yes take just 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.380
 learns a little less because of me 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.790
 everything should have been high 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.080
 of course be different with you if you 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:20.060
 have a better computer and at 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.630
 Of course Fiete could do that as well 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.860
 just like byd corner there must be everything 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.060
 will be uploaded to be planned 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.130
 therefore be designed 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.160
 and there could be over the launcher of the 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.930
 each month on the server 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.400
 access and that's even with 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.880
 my video then we'll see you in the 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.880
 next year
