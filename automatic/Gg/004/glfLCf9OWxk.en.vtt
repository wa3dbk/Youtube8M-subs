00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:09.769
 I wonder if today's fire media will not come 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:13.990
 Because the work of junior high school student association is busy in the basement already 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.830
 I'm going to go to Tokyo, so it seems like there 's also a house . 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.279
 There is not anxious to make somehow lunch 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.190
 But you should eat lunch properly 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.810
 Come on 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:30.769
 Sorry for this time 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.769
 Oh say A anyway about this before I was bad 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.150
 I do not think 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.730
 Coming 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.940
 I wonder was not something going to cry to you 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.710
 However 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.990
 hey 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.890
 Aoi-kun is not bad 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.820
 N there is I no longer know somehow even his own 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.170
 Hatch tears have overflowed 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.940
 . From time I 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:00.520
 That's why it's not because each one's luxury crown is bad 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.070
 I don't care at all either, so don't worry about the effects 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.800
 At all car 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.190
 It is 2 no anything 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:14.020
 That 's the same class as a good niece or a thousand song sounds. 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.050
 Oh it was n't a place that changed into a thousand song sounds 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.270
 Himenayah 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.540
 It may be because of my mind 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.520
 Good so different from the post-US-chan anywhere at any time 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.520
 Maybe there was something about someone 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.290
 I think there is something because the closest Chris side says 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.970
 A little bit to me 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.190
 That's right 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.120
 Should I ask the fire media directly ? 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.950
 That's right 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.310
 Maybe I do not want to talk to me for some reason 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.780
 When standing 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.940
 I can not ask you 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.830
 Give know without surely hear anything you were Utoa's I think that there is no such a thing 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.110

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.319
 I will forget it 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.040
