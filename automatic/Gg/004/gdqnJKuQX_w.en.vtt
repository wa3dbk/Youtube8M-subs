00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.180
 well I want to say that when I entered here 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.629
 I went in with a lot of fear and that the 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.510
 intervention has been excellent that the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.699
 surgeon has been the best and that has not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.449
 hurt nothing so I have another earring 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 what am I going to do as soon as 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.949
 it can 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.640
 the intervention was extraordinary and I 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.780
 it went very well and I was two or three days 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.820
 with my mouth inflamed because it was a 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.250
 implant with breast lift but 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.680
 very good very well without any problem 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.280
 the four months that have elapsed 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.710
 since the intervention I did not feel any 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.960
 annoyance and I am perfectly 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.469
 in experience in the center of 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.620
 implantology and it has been very gratifying 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.170
 in the intervention period as the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.210
 postoperative in both humane treatment 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.300
 as the technical capacity of their 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.580
 professionals I think a 10 and what 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.310
 I recommend all people expressly 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.830
 an athlete arrives for an implant and I 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.810
 said salgado 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.970
 not too big because they take all the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.480
 teeth totaled 18 to 20 views of 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.260
 knock 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.750
 so I thought he had enough 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.660
 about how he was going to feel and the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.540
 same past of pain and in the end it was 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.110
 very good because the recovery 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.890
 they removed the week and a half stitches and 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.979
 perfect and my annoyance ni 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.659
 I am very happy to have met 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.140
 the institution is training and 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.960
 pathology within the team has been very 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.920
 Attentive and very professional I have not had 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.360
 inconvenience 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.860
 and the truth is that everything went very well 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.650
 that I would repeat I do not know a million times and 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.690
 I would gather many thanks 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.690
 it's been great, thanks
