00:01:20.053 --> 00:01:23.353
 THE EXPERIMENT 

00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:47.023
 - Stinks. - Stinks. 

00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:49.988
 Yes, I stink so much that I'm a scoundrel 

00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:53.188
 What do you mean, here are your pills. 

00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:55.480
 You suppose you're nice to me. 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.725
 I'm nice to you, but it's not my fault that you did not win the game. 

00:02:58.725 --> 00:03:00.741
 You suck Travis. 

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:04.482
 I know. 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.955
 Hello Travis 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.161
 See you later. 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.965
 Travis ... 

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.032
 have you been talking about 

00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:19.723
 see the world, during all the time you've been here 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.212
 thanks to this you have an opportunity to ... 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.501
 that you finally do it 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.492
 You are casting me 

00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:28.731
 I'm not casting you, 

00:03:28.994 --> 00:03:30.149
 it's just a farewell. 

00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.908
 And I do not lie to you, the state is 

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:33.634
 who is lying to you, 

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:35.111
 with all the budget cuts. 

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.584
 They make cuts of the part that we requested, 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.727
 This has nothing to do with you. 

00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:42.418
 My advice Travis ... go see the world, 

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.787
 get that from the system, as you've always wanted ... 

00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:47.840
 ... maybe you'll come back ... I'll use you again 

00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:53.741
 - Bring them home! - Bring them home! 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.619
 I can not believe I got fired yesterday. 

00:03:58.654 --> 00:04:00.086
 Come on man, there are some nurses around here 

00:04:00.088 --> 00:04:03.388
 - in retirement. - That's what I say, the nurses. 

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:04.896
 It's better for the world to change that. 

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:06.850
 We try a hope here. 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.857
 Very well. 

00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:12.692
 Listen, I do not want you to get angry but I think something like this must have happened to you, 

00:04:12.692 --> 00:04:14.312
 to force you out of your comfortable life, 

00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:15.620
 Maybe so you can mix a little bit. 

00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:17.676
 I do not need to mix, I need money, 

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:19.998
 then cheer up, man, and do not tell me you do not know how to do it 

00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:22.606
 go back to school that, where they gave you those substantial shit tests, 

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:24.884
 you sold your sperm ... 

00:04:25.393 --> 00:04:26.898
 I never sold my sperm. 

00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:30.238
 Nobody knows what they got with those jewels 

00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:33.711
 You know what? 

00:04:33.711 --> 00:04:36.261
 Whoever said, the demonstrations of peace is where the action is, 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.168
 I did not know shit ... this is a fucking dietary celebration 

00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:41.065
 Absolutely. 

00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:45.398
 - See you later. - See you later. 

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.229
 Hey hey 

00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:58.431
 - I'm going to teach you. - Hears. 

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:00.832
 - Motherfucker. - What happens? 

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.135
 Enough, enough enough. 

00:05:06.236 --> 00:05:07.036
 Hears! 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.054
 - Keep away. - I'll show you, what I want to tell you 

00:05:12.054 --> 00:05:14.247
 Let's go. 

00:05:15.247 --> 00:05:18.692
 Hypocrites, you fucking hypocrites. Who do they believe? 

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.499
 Open your eyes 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.966
 Thank you. 

00:05:38.414 --> 00:05:40.066
 You're good? 

00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:41.848
 Yes, and you? 

00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:44.523
 I'm fine. 

00:05:45.852 --> 00:05:49.329
 My dad sat me down and made me love the red dawn, 

00:05:50.022 --> 00:05:52.436
 just so he would understand how bad things would get if he arrived, 

00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:53.693
 if communism arrived. 

00:05:55.238 --> 00:05:56.763
 I was from that movement. 

00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:02.405
 When I was young, I walked with young people who were somehow 

00:06:02.407 --> 00:06:06.174
 under those looks that made us go to war 

00:06:06.174 --> 00:06:08.080
 But you continue in demonstrations. 

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:11.029
 You know me wrong. 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.261
 Health 

00:06:17.368 --> 00:06:19.072
 This is a great moment ... Travis 

00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:22.957
 you can be a witness .. 

00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:27.555
 that even the last pacifist in the world will hear from me. 

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:29.728
 Do you know what I noticed? 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.054
 The real war is here. 

00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:34.660
 Are you sure you understand? 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.392
 No, I knew for a while but finally, I'll do something about it. 

00:06:40.392 --> 00:06:41.651
 Like what? 

00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:46.155
 I will go to India 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.172
 I imagine that ... to do yoga someday in Ashram .. 

00:06:52.156 --> 00:06:53.809
 have sex with my Guru. 

00:06:56.896 --> 00:06:58.101
 Good... 

00:06:58.102 --> 00:07:00.837
 we'll both agree later that it was a mistake ... of course. 

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:01.799
 Of course. 

00:07:06.076 --> 00:07:07.789
 Maybe you should go. 

00:07:09.174 --> 00:07:12.879
 - You can do it. - Well, a trip like that is 

00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.108
 Extremely expensive, and I do not have enough. 

00:07:16.108 --> 00:07:17.396
 Should you steal a liquor store? 

00:07:19.278 --> 00:07:22.129
 I think I could do something better? 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.676
 Like what? 

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.427
 You would not like to know. 

00:07:28.432 --> 00:07:29.751
 I think I can handle it. 

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:33.605
 I mean ... it would be an experience for both 

00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.255
 Can I see you again? 

00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:54.636
 Subject is searched for behavioral experiment. 

00:07:54.637 --> 00:07:57.137
 2 weeks, no experience, sure. 1000 dollars a day (515)555-0172 

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:17.748
 Michael Barris. 

00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:19.769
 Travis. 

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.664
 Smart man. 

00:08:23.664 --> 00:08:25.688
 What? 

00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:28.743
 You wear a suit, good movement. 

00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:30.935
 Yes, there are few vacancies 

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:34.227
 &lt;i&gt; - My signature or my name? - Only the signature is enough. &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:35.189
 Thank you. 

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:36.339
 I love your jacket. 

00:08:38.123 --> 00:08:40.045
 We are strangers, 

00:08:40.045 --> 00:08:41.713
 in a strange life. 

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:44.393
 &lt;i&gt; First &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:08:44.393 --> 00:08:49.234
 What we will do here in this behavioral experiment, in case some do not know 

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:53.910
 we will simulate the conditions of life, in a prison of the State. 

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:57.256
 The only requirement is that none of you desert at any time 

00:08:57.576 --> 00:08:59.840
 and if they do, we would like to thank you for your interest 

00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:01.526
 but your specific data will not be handled 

00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:04.902
 Now, in a few minutes we will do some quick tests 

00:09:04.902 --> 00:09:07.971
 but before I begin, I would like to inform you 

00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:13.353
 the key experiences will be done in a safe environment 

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:16.234
 and the volunteers will be safe at all times. 

00:09:16.235 --> 00:09:19.860
 We will deprive some of them of their civil rights, 

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.544
 - It's the flying man - "during" 

00:09:21.734 --> 00:09:23.134
 - "two weeks" - What is your name? 

00:09:24.546 --> 00:09:25.729
 "Man from Maine" 

00:09:25.753 --> 00:09:28.078
 &lt;i&gt; "Now, we will begin the tests" &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:28.880
 &lt;i&gt; can we? &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:09:29.475 --> 00:09:31.701
 - History of hallucinations? - Do not. 

00:09:32.685 --> 00:09:34.109
 Violence? 

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.969
 Do not 

00:09:34.969 --> 00:09:36.349
 Never? 

00:09:37.003 --> 00:09:37.945
 Do not 

00:09:40.887 --> 00:09:42.249
 Any religion? 

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.580
 Do not 

00:09:45.082 --> 00:09:46.362
 Do not? 

00:09:46.362 --> 00:09:49.390
 Religion is not a question that can answer with a yes or no Mr. Hunt 

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.025
 People tend to say what they believe in, and what do you believe in? 

00:09:53.574 --> 00:09:55.588
 Well, there's nothing good here. 

00:09:55.987 --> 00:09:59.152
 So, how is your behavior and decision making? 

00:10:01.927 --> 00:10:02.890
 From here. 

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:07.459
 Scouting team and baseball team in high school. 

00:10:10.172 --> 00:10:11.284
 And activities in the Church. 

00:10:11.284 --> 00:10:12.564
 What development there? 

00:10:12.564 --> 00:10:13.761
 Joy. 

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:18.366
 What do you think of good and absolute evil in the world? 

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.302
 I suppose... 

00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.170
 that ratifies the existence of God. 

00:10:28.865 --> 00:10:31.738
 He ratifies it, right? 

00:10:31.738 --> 00:10:33.778
 Yes, I know there are three rules 

00:10:35.127 --> 00:10:36.135
 Eat a lot. 

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.473
 Smoking marijuana. 

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.106
 And smile a lot. 

00:10:45.552 --> 00:10:49.269
 It's a short video that we want you to see, absolutely sure, naturally. 

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.400
 Are you ok to continue Mr. Hunt? 

00:12:02.762 --> 00:12:04.143
 Yes Yes. 

00:12:29.758 --> 00:12:30.890
 You would not have hit him 

00:12:32.676 --> 00:12:33.618
 Who? 

00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:36.301
 the guy who pushed me in the demonstration 

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:41.477
 You could not have hit him 

00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:46.285
 is that ... it's not your way of being 

00:12:49.777 --> 00:12:51.535
 - Call me fearful. - Yes 

00:12:55.338 --> 00:12:56.996
 It's a compliment. 

00:12:58.054 --> 00:12:58.802
 Go. 

00:13:02.283 --> 00:13:04.220
 I'll just go for a while, you know? 

00:13:06.014 --> 00:13:07.442
 I know. 

00:13:19.736 --> 00:13:21.345
 TRIP TO INDIA what emotion 

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.320
 It's sexy 

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.118
 exciting 

00:13:26.909 --> 00:13:28.547
 When will you go to see me? 

00:13:30.187 --> 00:13:30.987
 The twelve?, 

00:13:31.388 --> 00:13:32.288
 the thirteen? 

00:13:33.789 --> 00:13:34.989
 The thirteen! 

00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:39.004
 I will arrive on the 13th 

00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:41.116
 at 6:00 pm. 

00:13:47.382 --> 00:13:48.387
 Hey, we got it. 

00:13:48.387 --> 00:13:49.651
 I'm glad to see you. 

00:13:49.652 --> 00:13:51.695
 - Yes - I finally have someone to talk to 

00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:57.391
 I keep thinking that this would be a good thing for us 

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.629
 Actually I think about the money 

00:14:04.187 --> 00:14:06.511
 - Sorry. - Hello how are you? 

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.066
 This is the beginning. 

00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:24.027
 Starts the game. 

00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:28.718
 We will begin by asking for the word woman that means that word for you !!! 

00:14:28.719 --> 00:14:29.930
 Women, why? 

00:14:41.503 --> 00:14:48.569
 A divine creation, God created them and they are around the world ... I do not know. 

00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:24.277
 Boy, we have to pray. 

00:15:25.754 --> 00:15:27.830
 Did not you hear me dirty chicken? 

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.466
 We have to pray, turn off the TV. 

00:16:17.111 --> 00:16:18.411
 We have finally arrived. 

00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:26.962
 This is the place. 

00:16:27.898 --> 00:16:30.781
 Gentlemen, they are waiting for you inside. 

00:16:31.394 --> 00:16:35.231
 Would you mind if I take my bag? It has some things that I need. 

00:16:35.232 --> 00:16:38.509
 Everything you need is inside. 

00:16:45.843 --> 00:16:48.717
 "First day" 

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.579
 Good afternoon gentlemen. 

00:16:54.151 --> 00:16:57.961
 The next two weeks will be like a new experience for you. 

00:16:58.707 --> 00:17:02.114
 As I said before, some will not have civil rights, 

00:17:02.698 --> 00:17:04.966
 do not underestimate that, 

00:17:05.786 --> 00:17:08.928
 If anyone wants to leave, now is his last chance. 

00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:10.786
 Do not? 

00:17:14.678 --> 00:17:15.826
 All right. 

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:19.922
 Again, your safety is our first priority. 

00:17:19.923 --> 00:17:26.382
 If there is violence in any way the experiment will end immediately. 

00:17:26.955 --> 00:17:27.883
 It is clear? 

00:17:28.417 --> 00:17:31.041
 When they hear your name, please stand up. 

00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:32.157
 Daniel, 

00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:33.788
 Bosch, 

00:17:34.708 --> 00:17:35.664
 Helweg, 

00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:38.806
 Sandberg, 

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:40.642
 Chase, 

00:17:42.137 --> 00:17:43.083
 and Barris. 

00:17:45.948 --> 00:17:47.154
 All right. 

00:17:47.154 --> 00:17:50.599
 The rest of you stand up and follow the yellow line. 

00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:55.600
 - Until later, brother. - Good luck, gentlemen. 

00:17:55.601 --> 00:17:56.627
 And thanks. 

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.037
 What do you think will be the prisoners or guards? 

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:09.421
 I think we have the answer here. 

00:18:12.434 --> 00:18:15.883
 Nothing enters or leaves those cells, 

00:18:15.883 --> 00:18:18.144
 nothing of the outside world. 

00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:20.873
 If you look in your box office you will find a printed 

00:18:20.873 --> 00:18:24.773
 the five rules that prisoners must follow at all times. 

00:18:24.773 --> 00:18:26.780
 Please, read them out loud with me. 

00:18:26.781 --> 00:18:28.244
 The first rule 

00:18:28.244 --> 00:18:32.943
 The prisoners must make three meals a day and they must eat everything. 

00:18:32.943 --> 00:18:36.103
 The second rule They will have 30 daily minutes in the yard. 

00:18:36.103 --> 00:18:40.967
 The third rule will only remain in your area. 

00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:45.262
 The fourth rule They will not speak if they are not asked. 

00:18:45.262 --> 00:18:46.288
 The fifth rule 

00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:51.289
 They will not touch the guards under any circumstances. 

00:18:51.848 --> 00:18:55.850
 who breaks the rules will be severely punished. 

00:18:56.622 --> 00:18:58.422
 What does that mean? 

00:18:58.423 --> 00:19:01.916
 This experiment is not individual. 

00:19:01.916 --> 00:19:04.847
 If someone abandons the experiment, it's over, 

00:19:04.847 --> 00:19:06.430
 and if a prisoner breaks some rule 

00:19:06.431 --> 00:19:10.431
 they have 30 minutes to take a disciplinary action, 

00:19:10.431 --> 00:19:13.369
 and if they do not, that red light will come on, 

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.470
 indicating that the experiment is over and we will not pay them anything. 

00:19:18.253 --> 00:19:19.454
 What did you say? 

00:19:19.489 --> 00:19:22.319
 They enforce the rules or do not get paid. 

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.690
 I'll see you in two weeks. 

00:19:46.237 --> 00:19:47.033
 I'm sorry man. 

00:19:47.628 --> 00:19:50.672
 - Why. - For all this. 

00:19:50.672 --> 00:19:51.884
 Do not worry. 

00:19:54.155 --> 00:19:56.286
 Well, turn around, you must be clean. 

00:19:56.286 --> 00:19:57.603
 What? 

00:19:57.603 --> 00:19:58.901
 Why should I turn around? 

00:19:58.901 --> 00:20:00.770
 What is your problem? 

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.086
 Are you afraid that we will see that you do not have a cock? 

00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:04.734
 Fuck off. 

00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:06.242
 Leave the insults. 

00:20:08.321 --> 00:20:09.984
 Be careful not to drop the soap. 

00:20:11.282 --> 00:20:12.672
 Hey, girls 

00:20:13.342 --> 00:20:14.800
 All behind the line. 

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.350
 Which one of them? 

00:20:16.888 --> 00:20:18.217
 I do not know. 

00:20:19.532 --> 00:20:20.661
 That. 

00:20:20.661 --> 00:20:21.810
 That line. 

00:20:23.979 --> 00:20:25.662
 - Hello. - I must be honest, 

00:20:26.232 --> 00:20:29.518
 You guys are the worst guards I've seen in my life. 

00:20:33.704 --> 00:20:36.971
 ha ha ha and you can suck me and the whole state of Kentucky 

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.630
 Kentucky? 

00:20:39.631 --> 00:20:43.656
 Look, they should stop fucking because we'll finish before we started. 

00:20:45.135 --> 00:20:47.803
 And we will leave without pay. 

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.127
 From now on they will only be called by numbers. 

00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:55.755
 That is fantastic 

00:20:59.749 --> 00:21:02.455
 And another thing that my girls should know, 

00:21:02.455 --> 00:21:09.247
 Prisoners will find their assignments in each of the cells 

00:21:10.128 --> 00:21:11.916
 And are we supposed to do them? 

00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.381
 Yes, dear thinker. 

00:21:13.381 --> 00:21:14.648
 - Now? - Yes 

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.949
 unfold, unfold, find your place. 

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.650
 Well, guys keep moving. 

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:31.980
 Hi, I'm Travis 

00:21:38.581 --> 00:21:42.481
 - 17. - 77. 

00:21:48.288 --> 00:21:51.564
 I feel dangerous, with this suit of criminal 

00:21:53.031 --> 00:21:55.269
 - You look dangerous. - Yes Yes. 

00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:57.526
 I would not try to have trouble with me, right? 

00:21:57.526 --> 00:21:58.993
 - No no? 

00:21:59.672 --> 00:22:02.576
 - I'm Benjy, nice to meet you. - How are you? Travis. 

00:22:02.577 --> 00:22:03.965
 I'm a novelist. 

00:22:07.689 --> 00:22:11.593
 - Novelist? - In fact, graphic novels. 

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.506
 Comics? 

00:22:15.155 --> 00:22:17.434
 Graphic novels. 

00:22:17.954 --> 00:22:23.206
 My God, I have so much material here. This is great. 

00:22:24.154 --> 00:22:25.863
 Yes. 

00:22:27.323 --> 00:22:28.794
 Great. 

00:22:29.297 --> 00:22:30.821
 So, 

00:22:30.821 --> 00:22:32.677
 Why do you participate in the experiment? 

00:22:34.064 --> 00:22:36.040
 Cash. 

00:22:36.362 --> 00:22:37.604
 For my mother. 

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.416
 Was it your idea? 

00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:44.749
 He broke his pelvis. 

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.466
 And I need to pay the debts. 

00:22:47.944 --> 00:22:49.523
 Do you live with your mother? 

00:22:50.103 --> 00:22:51.061
 Yes. 

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.887
 - How old are you? - 42 

00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:59.435
 What is your reason for the Mr. Chase experiment? 

00:22:59.436 --> 00:23:00.454
 "Girls" 

00:23:00.454 --> 00:23:02.260
 "Girls" are my reason for the experiment. 

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.662
 This is an experiment just for men Mr. Chase 

00:23:05.662 --> 00:23:08.994
 You know how many "girls" I will have for $ 14,000 when you leave. 

00:23:08.994 --> 00:23:11.027
 How many sexual relationships have you had? 

00:23:14.071 --> 00:23:16.266
 I lost the account, maybe 17. 

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.445
 With men or women? 

00:23:20.123 --> 00:23:21.159
 Women. 

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.171
 Why do you need to do this experiment, Mr. Knicks? 

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.039
 I try to get the reward, sir. 

00:23:28.643 --> 00:23:29.710
 To escape. 

00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:32.882
 &lt;i&gt; Come on guys! &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:41.275
 Do you want to play? 

00:23:42.311 --> 00:23:44.324
 I ask this boy. 

00:23:44.325 --> 00:23:45.981
 No, no, I can not play. 

00:23:47.276 --> 00:23:49.562
 How about you law boy? Catch her 

00:23:51.963 --> 00:23:53.089
 Shit! 

00:23:53.089 --> 00:23:54.255
 - Get it out of here. - Shit. 

00:23:56.439 --> 00:23:57.944
 Sorry. I do not... 

00:24:01.749 --> 00:24:02.896
 You're good? 

00:24:02.896 --> 00:24:04.943
 Come on, let's get him out of here. 

00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:08.324
 Let's go. 

00:24:11.275 --> 00:24:12.968
 It was not on purpose, it was an accident 

00:24:12.968 --> 00:24:14.228
 It was not on purpose. 

00:24:19.613 --> 00:24:21.390
 What the fuck was that guy thinking? 

00:24:21.938 --> 00:24:24.450
 I'm fine, I'm fine. 

00:24:24.451 --> 00:24:25.768
 He did not want to do it. 

00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:27.003
 Are you sure you're okay? 

00:24:27.003 --> 00:24:29.973
 It's just a bit of nosebleed, let's get back to work, 

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.001
 please. 

00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:34.687
 I do not know. 

00:24:35.573 --> 00:24:37.148
 I think we should do something. 

00:24:37.967 --> 00:24:39.173
 What are you talking about? 

00:24:39.173 --> 00:24:41.036
 From rule number 5. 

00:24:43.718 --> 00:24:45.402
 The prisoners should not touch us. 

00:24:47.325 --> 00:24:50.393
 Technically, he did not touch me the ball he did. 

00:24:50.393 --> 00:24:52.167
 Look at your face, man. 

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.747
 We all hear what he said, 

00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:57.500
 we must maintain order, 

00:24:57.988 --> 00:24:59.950
 with disciplinary measures 

00:25:01.864 --> 00:25:05.972
 On that side, they know it was an accident. 

00:25:05.972 --> 00:25:07.247
 I agree. 

00:25:08.024 --> 00:25:09.323
 I mean, are you sure about that? 

00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:12.907
 Well, I do not want that light to turn on in 30 minutes 

00:25:12.908 --> 00:25:15.008
 because we did not do what we were supposed to do. 

00:25:15.008 --> 00:25:18.047
 - I need the $ 14,000ºº - Yes, we all need them. 

00:25:18.047 --> 00:25:19.362
 Let's go, 

00:25:20.309 --> 00:25:23.146
 we are not talking about crucifying anyone here 

00:25:24.793 --> 00:25:28.313
 The word "punish" 

00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:30.344
 I mean, 

00:25:30.804 --> 00:25:32.336
 it does not matter what he did, 

00:25:32.337 --> 00:25:34.963
 it was unimportant, 

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:37.672
 we will respond generously, 

00:25:38.508 --> 00:25:39.276
 gently, 

00:25:39.843 --> 00:25:41.163
 gently, 

00:25:41.805 --> 00:25:43.957
 We do, 

00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:46.878
 or wait for the red light? 

00:25:54.041 --> 00:25:58.229
 Push-ups, 10 

00:25:58.474 --> 00:25:59.778
 Do it now. 

00:26:01.042 --> 00:26:04.700
 There was a bad understanding, it was everything. 

00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:07.706
 It was an accident. 

00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:17.075
 This is not a fucking negotiation. 

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:18.569
 Do the push-ups. 

00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:23.951
 Only a small misunderstanding, brother, only small. 

00:26:26.193 --> 00:26:27.857
 Very well. 

00:26:27.857 --> 00:26:30.897
 All 10 push-ups. 

00:26:37.951 --> 00:26:39.937
 You already heard it, come on. 

00:26:40.696 --> 00:26:42.071
 Do them. 

00:26:43.376 --> 00:26:44.235
 Come on, do them. 

00:26:45.012 --> 00:26:46.439
 Yes, your little brother's fault. 

00:26:48.762 --> 00:26:50.118
 Here we go. 

00:26:51.056 --> 00:26:51.922
 Count high. 

00:26:52.010 --> 00:27:01.810
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 

00:27:02.511 --> 00:27:06.586
 I did not tell you, it was easy. 

00:27:07.386 --> 00:27:09.869
 and you, you looked like a policeman, really. 

00:27:09.869 --> 00:27:11.834
 He seemed more like a Sergeant. 

00:27:11.834 --> 00:27:13.013
 Yes. 

00:27:13.014 --> 00:27:16.760
 That man was trying to cheat you know, 

00:27:17.561 --> 00:27:20.902
 It was great to be honest. 

00:27:20.902 --> 00:27:23.421
 You know, if we are responsible here. 

00:27:26.073 --> 00:27:27.481
 Has the 30 minutes passed? 

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.003
 Yes. 

00:27:37.132 --> 00:27:39.128
 I think we survived. 

00:27:41.965 --> 00:27:44.091
 I do not feel bad, you know 

00:27:44.092 --> 00:27:45.719
 and so 

00:27:46.516 --> 00:27:50.969
 if we continue with the push-ups all together 

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:52.799
 everything is bizarre ... and they will pay us 

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:55.635
 and we will get in shape 

00:27:56.912 --> 00:27:58.930
 Do you have a girlfriend, 17? 

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.013
 Do not 

00:28:00.952 --> 00:28:01.782
 What about you? 

00:28:04.523 --> 00:28:06.562
 - I had just started a relationship. - Yes? 

00:28:06.563 --> 00:28:09.247
 Me too, you feel good, right? 

00:28:09.247 --> 00:28:10.256
 Good and bad. 

00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:12.025
 at least you have someone to think about 

00:28:13.013 --> 00:28:15.676
 and someone who thinks of you, right? 

00:28:15.677 --> 00:28:17.534
 Exactly what do you write? anyway 

00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:21.340
 - Comics. - Yes, graphic novels. 

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.538
 I was writing the story of the flying man. 

00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:25.286
 - Flying man. - Yes 

00:28:25.926 --> 00:28:28.041
 The man who flies. 

00:28:29.782 --> 00:28:31.376
 I have decided to fly. 

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:33.881
 You see it? What you just said ? 

00:28:33.883 --> 00:28:35.929
 When did you decide to fly? 

00:28:35.929 --> 00:28:37.684
 that happens when people want to become 

00:28:37.685 --> 00:28:39.560
 and that's what we're talking about 

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.470
 if the human being could fly 

00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:51.829
 nothing could stop us just fly, as you and I in this cell could fly 

00:28:51.829 --> 00:28:57.797
 tell me who would not want to read something like that ... they would kill themselves for a story of these 

00:28:58.362 --> 00:29:00.677
 - Would it be something great? - Yes a little bit. 

00:29:00.678 --> 00:29:02.787
 What do you think 77? 

00:29:02.787 --> 00:29:05.438
 Do you think we can fly out of here? 

00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:08.714
 Yes, we will do it. 

00:29:09.992 --> 00:29:11.475
 To sleep ladies. 

00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:12.975
 Turning off the lights. 

00:29:13.577 --> 00:29:14.977
 See you tomorrow. 

00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:47.515
 "Second day" 

00:29:53.172 --> 00:29:54.467
 Really? Let's go 

00:29:54.468 --> 00:29:55.463
 What? 

00:29:56.089 --> 00:29:57.503
 What is it? 

00:29:58.062 --> 00:30:00.391
 Milk for you to pass? 

00:30:02.933 --> 00:30:05.732
 Come on guys, move. 

00:30:46.966 --> 00:30:48.940
 Hey, hey, you have not eaten everything. 

00:30:50.464 --> 00:30:52.230
 Come on, that will not happen. 

00:30:53.445 --> 00:30:55.926
 Who are you? Any type of unionist? 

00:30:55.926 --> 00:31:00.709
 I do not want to cause problems, I ate everything else, but I can not handle this. 

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.628
 I mean, look at it well 

00:31:02.628 --> 00:31:04.591
 It looks like dog shit. 

00:31:11.753 --> 00:31:14.004
 They are caraotas, come on. 

00:31:14.004 --> 00:31:15.130
 Eat them. 

00:31:16.562 --> 00:31:19.688
 Come on guys, I'm not the unreasonable here, 

00:31:19.688 --> 00:31:21.899
 I mean, we have rules, well 

00:31:22.385 --> 00:31:23.792
 Rule number one 

00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:26.205
 They have to leave the plate clean. 

00:31:26.205 --> 00:31:28.849
 The number 6, should eat dog shit 

00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:31.150
 It's not dog shit. 

00:31:32.474 --> 00:31:33.899
 It's dog shit. 

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.198
 Then it is a pity 

00:31:37.737 --> 00:31:39.858
 because they will eat them anyway 

00:31:39.858 --> 00:31:42.968
 I will .. My God, my God, my dog ​​shit. 

00:31:44.018 --> 00:31:44.935
 Damn shit. 

00:31:44.935 --> 00:31:48.461
 Well, well, I would not have eaten it anyway. 

00:31:48.552 --> 00:31:50.508
 Hey MOULIN ROUGE 

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:51.882
 They must eat them. 

00:31:51.882 --> 00:31:54.958
 No one will leave until the trays are clean. 

00:31:56.222 --> 00:31:57.725
 They already heard it. 

00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:02.131
 Totally clean 

00:32:06.551 --> 00:32:09.240
 Clean? that is the word. 

00:32:13.046 --> 00:32:14.362
 Now it is clean. 

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.000
 They just won other push-ups. 

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.334
 Push-ups 

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:26.012
 You already heard it, push-ups! 

00:32:26.012 --> 00:32:28.402
 So more push-ups? Well, take this. 

00:32:34.335 --> 00:32:38.518
 you're fucked ..... lick ass 

00:32:40.782 --> 00:32:41.877
 Behind! 

00:32:48.636 --> 00:32:50.342
 Stop doing that girls !!! 

00:32:51.014 --> 00:32:53.086
 come out of here 

00:32:53.823 --> 00:32:56.747
 Run, damn nenaza. 

00:32:58.016 --> 00:32:58.616
 Douchebag 

00:32:58.617 --> 00:33:01.217
 Leave the flying man alone. 

00:33:02.018 --> 00:33:04.200
 Flying man? 

00:33:09.244 --> 00:33:10.419
 Yes. 

00:33:10.419 --> 00:33:14.920
 This is our bitches place, it's our house. 

00:33:16.126 --> 00:33:19.422
 The only reason ... the only fucking reason why they did it 

00:33:19.423 --> 00:33:22.423
 It's because they know we can not hurt them. 

00:33:23.578 --> 00:33:25.561
 Some speak with fear. 

00:33:25.561 --> 00:33:27.810
 I would like to hit them in the mouth. 

00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:32.093
 Suddenly they have become brave. 

00:33:33.483 --> 00:33:36.395
 Maybe it's true, but rules are rules, 

00:33:36.853 --> 00:33:38.160
 we will not use violence. 

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:48.004
 We must do something ... we are being tested just like them 

00:33:48.423 --> 00:33:51.492
 They look like damned cowards to me for what they did. 

00:33:54.063 --> 00:33:55.159
 I have an idea 

00:33:57.145 --> 00:34:01.081
 Once I was in a clinic 

00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:03.447
 for more than a week, friends 

00:34:04.414 --> 00:34:06.069
 if they do not treat us well 

00:34:06.069 --> 00:34:10.058
 because we must be tolerant with them ... 

00:34:10.335 --> 00:34:13.066
 I mean, the rules here are for everyone, 

00:34:14.617 --> 00:34:17.211
 nobody should be hurt, 

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.492
 but this has been much worse, 

00:34:21.706 --> 00:34:23.169
 They humiliated us! 

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:28.551
 this is what we will do to him, 

00:34:32.316 --> 00:34:35.854
 We will humiliate them! 

00:35:09.618 --> 00:35:11.839
 What is it, man? 

00:35:13.513 --> 00:35:16.075
 - This is what they did. - What? 

00:35:16.076 --> 00:35:17.114
 - What are you talking about? - Shut. 

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:21.322
 You should shut up ... you, well 

00:35:30.759 --> 00:35:34.607
 There will be no more incidents, 

00:35:35.344 --> 00:35:36.848
 like the one that happened today. 

00:35:38.774 --> 00:35:39.960
 Are you clear? 

00:35:42.645 --> 00:35:43.792
 Said, 

00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:45.425
 Do you understand? 

00:35:45.928 --> 00:35:47.056
 Yes. 

00:35:47.516 --> 00:35:48.871
 If that? 

00:35:49.307 --> 00:35:50.907
 because I do not hear them. 

00:35:50.942 --> 00:35:52.946
 Yes sir 

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:03.186
 Who is the whore, now? 

00:36:03.645 --> 00:36:05.414
 Whores. 

00:36:08.233 --> 00:36:09.418
 Good job guys. 

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:11.017
 Good job. 

00:36:20.409 --> 00:36:21.751
 I'll see you later. 

00:37:36.738 --> 00:37:37.638
 Excuse me 

00:37:40.139 --> 00:37:44.703
 I am having intermittent vision and my blood sugar is low. 

00:37:47.903 --> 00:37:50.845
 Shut up a fucking time, fine. 

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.083
 What are you talking about? 

00:37:58.321 --> 00:37:59.297
 Of my blood sugar. 

00:38:00.368 --> 00:38:04.005
 I told you to shut up a fucking time. 

00:38:16.028 --> 00:38:17.086
 You're good? 

00:38:26.428 --> 00:38:29.331
 "Third day" 

00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:32.745
 Very well, 

00:38:33.174 --> 00:38:34.919
 since everyone is attending, 

00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:41.875
 I suggest ... then, 

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:44.874
 act like gentlemen, 

00:38:45.414 --> 00:38:46.432
 the rest of the week, 

00:38:46.432 --> 00:38:48.016
 and follow the rules, 

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.687
 these last eleven days 

00:38:53.733 --> 00:38:56.774
 and we can all go home happy 

00:38:58.766 --> 00:38:59.861
 What do you think? 

00:39:11.344 --> 00:39:12.599
 Where is 51? 

00:39:16.026 --> 00:39:17.719
 Where is 51? 

00:39:23.292 --> 00:39:24.109
 Let's go. 

00:39:30.233 --> 00:39:31.815
 I need sugar. 

00:39:34.233 --> 00:39:36.580
 He is diabetic. 

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.756
 - But his report says he's healthy. - Where does he say it? 

00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:40.528
 No no. 

00:39:40.528 --> 00:39:43.454
 - Take a specific diet. - Insurance. 

00:39:44.019 --> 00:39:46.459
 No need to worry 

00:39:46.847 --> 00:39:48.310
 we will solve it 

00:39:52.032 --> 00:39:53.286
 This is not a big problem. 

00:39:53.286 --> 00:39:54.262
 It is not. 

00:39:54.709 --> 00:39:56.908
 I mean, my grandmother suffered the same disease 

00:39:56.909 --> 00:39:58.782
 and ate sweets between meals. 

00:39:58.782 --> 00:40:01.993
 Trust me, it's not that important. 

00:40:03.942 --> 00:40:05.616
 No. 51, I need you to get up 

00:40:06.035 --> 00:40:07.132
 Come on, incorporate. 

00:40:07.578 --> 00:40:12.961
 I would like to do it, but I need my chocolates. 

00:40:12.961 --> 00:40:14.061
 They are in my bag. 

00:40:14.462 --> 00:40:15.945
 - You can find it. - Enough. 

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:16.746
 Although you are one ?? 

00:40:20.355 --> 00:40:21.779
 Get up, come on. 

00:40:22.258 --> 00:40:24.338
 - Go Go. - Can not. 

00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:25.539
 You'll be fine. 

00:40:27.499 --> 00:40:29.988
 - Let's go. - Why do not you let him rest? 

00:40:29.988 --> 00:40:31.412
 No, No. 77 

00:40:32.625 --> 00:40:34.924
 All prisoners must participate. 

00:40:34.924 --> 00:40:37.152
 And you must not address me, 

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.250
 unless I talk to you first. 

00:40:40.116 --> 00:40:42.265
 Man, look at it. 

00:40:42.703 --> 00:40:44.028
 He can not do it. 

00:40:51.571 --> 00:40:56.329
 You understand that this is an experiment in a prison, right? 

00:40:56.761 --> 00:40:57.683
 Yes. 

00:40:58.097 --> 00:40:59.415
 And you understand 

00:40:59.774 --> 00:41:04.043
 - that there are rules to fulfill. - Obviously. 

00:41:04.421 --> 00:41:06.631
 You are a prisoner. 

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:12.581
 You do not give the orders, we do give the orders. 

00:41:14.332 --> 00:41:16.542
 Have you been clear? 

00:41:19.709 --> 00:41:24.236
 Let the man lie down. 

00:41:30.816 --> 00:41:34.350
 It will be that I have to teach you manners ... right now 

00:41:35.783 --> 00:41:37.068
 Do you want me to do that? 

00:41:38.947 --> 00:41:40.739
 What is that supposed to mean? 

00:41:41.614 --> 00:41:45.031
 It means, if you do not shut up. 

00:41:46.872 --> 00:41:51.648
 I will try to understand and imagine what I will do. 

00:41:54.685 --> 00:41:57.094
 Why do not you try to be rational? 

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:00.217
 I have not been rational enough ?? 

00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:02.078
 - Leave it alone. - Do it. 

00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:03.125
 Do not I look rational? 

00:42:03.455 --> 00:42:07.327
 If you hit me, the experiment is over. 

00:42:08.558 --> 00:42:09.538
 You know, 

00:42:09.967 --> 00:42:11.042
 and I know. 

00:42:12.528 --> 00:42:13.946
 To the cell now, let's go. 

00:42:15.064 --> 00:42:17.040
 It's okay, quiet. 

00:42:17.041 --> 00:42:18.065
 Listen to all, 

00:42:18.065 --> 00:42:19.410
 enter their cells. 

00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:22.142
 Come on guards, put them in their cells. 

00:42:22.142 --> 00:42:23.196
 Let's go. 

00:42:23.297 --> 00:42:25.697
 - Enter. - To your corner. 

00:43:07.397 --> 00:43:08.997
 What do you think of us now? 

00:43:10.834 --> 00:43:14.171
 Why did you come to this experiment? 

00:43:17.575 --> 00:43:19.904
 We are animals behind bars, you know. 

00:43:20.273 --> 00:43:24.088
 They will try to find which of us is the lion, 

00:43:24.478 --> 00:43:26.967
 and what is the rabbit. 

00:43:27.375 --> 00:43:33.479
 I think we are the apex in the evolution of monkeys. 

00:43:33.479 --> 00:43:36.812
 They do not care, how evolved do you think we are, 

00:43:36.812 --> 00:43:42.041
 is an opinion that is not enough, the strong always eats the weak 

00:43:42.041 --> 00:43:43.719
 That is what we are. 

00:43:48.368 --> 00:43:50.341
 Have you been in prison, 17? 

00:43:53.405 --> 00:43:57.388
 - You probably confuse me with another one - No. 

00:43:57.852 --> 00:44:03.846
 You have a tattoo that is done in prisons, so I imagine you were in a 

00:44:09.988 --> 00:44:12.378
 Now you're an expert on boy prisons ?? 

00:44:12.807 --> 00:44:15.425
 It does not cost much to discover it 

00:44:15.863 --> 00:44:20.076
 Do not interfere in my ability to earn my money 

00:44:23.385 --> 00:44:24.820
 Do you understand? 

00:44:26.913 --> 00:44:30.209
 I'm quiet. I swear. 

00:44:37.037 --> 00:44:37.843
 So, 

00:44:37.843 --> 00:44:39.556
 Why did you go? 

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.401
 Do you really want to know that? 

00:44:46.401 --> 00:44:48.610
 Yes, that's why I ask you. 

00:44:50.643 --> 00:44:52.427
 You have balls, boy. 

00:44:52.787 --> 00:44:53.964
 Yes? 

00:44:54.382 --> 00:44:55.499
 Because what you say? 

00:44:55.499 --> 00:45:00.167
 If you mess with the guards you will be in serious trouble 

00:45:03.418 --> 00:45:05.847
 - They are not guards! - But they are now 

00:45:06.467 --> 00:45:07.922
 And those who are watching us in the camera 

00:45:07.922 --> 00:45:09.796
 they know exactly what they want 

00:45:13.992 --> 00:45:16.723
 I suggest you stop protecting your friend. 

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.326
 it is necessary to protect it 

00:45:19.326 --> 00:45:23.097
 here you can not decide what is right 

00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:27.898
 stop messing with them 

00:45:28.437 --> 00:45:32.672
 just stay still in one place stay alone and stay alone man 

00:45:33.687 --> 00:45:35.851
 and that the things that happen do not affect you 

00:45:36.857 --> 00:45:38.184
 Just let it go. 

00:45:40.008 --> 00:45:40.935
 Trust me. 

00:45:43.239 --> 00:45:44.209
 Let go. 

00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:48.329
 Just help me, 

00:45:50.237 --> 00:45:52.253
 to give a lesson. 

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:54.366
 It is his show. 

00:45:54.366 --> 00:45:56.130
 For you, what? 

00:45:56.450 --> 00:46:00.598
 - If you want, I'm ready to go. - We can not do anything. 

00:46:01.696 --> 00:46:02.794
 How do you know that? 

00:46:03.233 --> 00:46:07.214
 The asshole is number one, if they want revenge they could 

00:46:07.214 --> 00:46:10.214
 but we put it in the middle of nowhere, to him alone. 

00:46:10.628 --> 00:46:12.829
 Those in the experiment will not let anything happen. 

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.130
 And how will they find out? 

00:46:19.152 --> 00:46:20.152
 77 

00:46:21.354 --> 00:46:22.895
 he is the leader 

00:46:23.343 --> 00:46:25.089
 anyway 

00:46:25.089 --> 00:46:26.890
 how it continues to behave like this 

00:46:27.247 --> 00:46:29.173
 someone is going to have to stop it 

00:46:29.173 --> 00:46:31.526
 Guys, guys, no one should be hurt 

00:46:32.144 --> 00:46:33.311
 otherwise the experiment is over. 

00:46:33.311 --> 00:46:34.701
 and they will not pay us. 

00:46:34.702 --> 00:46:37.696
 Only if you allow them to record you. 

00:46:38.094 --> 00:46:39.150
 What you think? 

00:46:42.214 --> 00:46:44.229
 Do you know how we can control them? 

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:50.547
 Scare them. 

00:47:57.232 --> 00:47:59.408
 The prisoner 

00:47:59.767 --> 00:48:00.997
 is listening to you 

00:48:04.596 --> 00:48:07.608
 For some reason they see you as their leader. 

00:48:11.132 --> 00:48:12.139
 I have news for you 

00:48:12.679 --> 00:48:17.778
 Here, you're the leader of the shit. 

00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:22.788
 This place belongs to us 

00:48:23.217 --> 00:48:24.784
 and nobody else. 

00:48:27.651 --> 00:48:29.709
 All kinds of things, 

00:48:29.709 --> 00:48:30.877
 what can we do to you, 

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.259
 so that you obey, 

00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:36.261
 in the act. 

00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:48.769
 So, 

00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:52.105
 Will you keep causing us problems? 

00:48:53.022 --> 00:48:55.998
 Or will you respect authority? now. 

00:48:58.039 --> 00:49:00.524
 Fuck you bastard. 

00:49:34.453 --> 00:49:36.590
 Those things make me angry. 

00:49:42.158 --> 00:49:43.474
 Take a look. 

00:49:43.934 --> 00:49:45.625
 We will send the message, 

00:49:45.625 --> 00:49:47.322
 sending the message 

00:49:47.761 --> 00:49:49.509
 Unanse. 

00:49:51.721 --> 00:49:52.909
 Unanse. 

00:50:38.098 --> 00:50:39.611
 You're good? 

00:51:29.729 --> 00:51:32.435
 Amazing philosophy. 

00:51:32.435 --> 00:51:33.931
 Fuck him. 

00:51:33.931 --> 00:51:36.820
 I mean, you're really bad, you knew. 

00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:39.995
 and it was a good thing, Barris 

00:51:43.088 --> 00:51:44.754
 The light did not go on 

00:51:44.754 --> 00:51:45.937
 and they saw it. 

00:51:46.356 --> 00:51:48.520
 And we're not going home. 

00:51:50.586 --> 00:51:51.933
 Doing what we did, 

00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:54.057
 we send the message 

00:51:54.436 --> 00:51:57.369
 - and we never lost our place. - I have something to say. 

00:51:58.673 --> 00:52:01.804
 Yes something like this happens again 

00:52:02.236 --> 00:52:03.582
 anything 

00:52:05.308 --> 00:52:06.655
 I'm out of here. 

00:52:08.074 --> 00:52:12.550
 You mean, you've considered a decision like that 

00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:16.696
 for all this 

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:18.267
 it's something great 

00:52:21.198 --> 00:52:22.854
 I do not care, sir. 

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:41.825
 Let go. 

00:52:58.823 --> 00:53:02.258
 If they hurt someone you want 

00:53:02.258 --> 00:53:04.031
 they rape or kill him 

00:53:04.031 --> 00:53:06.337
 and they do not process him 

00:53:06.337 --> 00:53:10.419
 this person is free and there is nothing you can do 

00:53:10.419 --> 00:53:12.321
 Would you consider doing justice? 

00:53:12.748 --> 00:53:14.461
 I have never thought about those situations 

00:53:14.461 --> 00:53:18.438
 Justice is what keeps us safe in this society. The order. 

00:53:19.018 --> 00:53:22.231
 Justice starts wars. 

00:53:22.231 --> 00:53:24.597
 eye for eye for eye 

00:53:25.948 --> 00:53:29.720
 I think that species evolve. 

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.320
 Then you are one of those who want to know the way forward 

00:53:32.321 --> 00:53:34.548
 for the evolution of the human race. 

00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:38.444
 the fact that the human race evolves does not make people better 

00:53:39.444 --> 00:53:40.444
 All the time. 

00:53:42.295 --> 00:53:45.303
 "Fourth day" 

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.227
 Look what I found. Eat it. 

00:54:23.877 --> 00:54:25.608
 It will increase your sugar a little. 

00:54:26.174 --> 00:54:30.165
 - I can not accept it. - It's nothing, like a piece of candy 

00:54:30.165 --> 00:54:32.223
 It's cheap bread. 

00:54:33.926 --> 00:54:35.638
 It will increase your sugar, trust me. 

00:54:36.066 --> 00:54:37.975
 I do not have insulin anyway. 

00:54:40.433 --> 00:54:42.593
 I thought you would not need it. 

00:54:42.594 --> 00:54:44.255
 I am diabetic. 

00:54:46.344 --> 00:54:48.552
 When they brought me here, 

00:54:49.099 --> 00:54:53.269
 I thought I would keep it, but they kept it. 

00:54:53.746 --> 00:54:55.457
 Jesus Christ 

00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:57.946
 Benjy 

00:54:57.947 --> 00:54:58.947
 Test No. 1 

00:54:59.256 --> 00:55:03.197
 Listen, you can not play with that, tell them immediately 

00:55:03.197 --> 00:55:04.565
 They must know, so they can get you out of here. 

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:05.167
 Do not. 

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:08.197
 Do not you understand, can you die? 

00:55:08.685 --> 00:55:11.989
 No, if they give me insulin. 

00:55:15.739 --> 00:55:16.942
 Why are you doing this? 

00:55:19.002 --> 00:55:21.408
 I am the man 

00:55:24.318 --> 00:55:25.551
 "Fraud man" 

00:55:26.137 --> 00:55:27.798
 Do not say that. 

00:55:27.799 --> 00:55:30.116
 Yes, it's stupid, it's stupid. 

00:55:30.116 --> 00:55:32.931
 Life sucks, 

00:55:32.932 --> 00:55:36.678
 - Just like me. - No, you're not the "Flying Man." 

00:55:42.628 --> 00:55:48.026
 I need this, I need to be no more a fraud. 

00:55:48.574 --> 00:55:50.594
 I need one time, 

00:55:51.052 --> 00:55:53.288
 prove it to myself. 

00:55:55.971 --> 00:55:57.384
 Please 77 

00:55:59.942 --> 00:56:01.234
 Oh my God. 

00:56:36.825 --> 00:56:38.591
 What the fuck are you doing? 

00:56:40.452 --> 00:56:41.755
 Nothing. 

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:45.457
 Do not turn your back on me, you have no shame 

00:56:45.457 --> 00:56:46.631
 Fuck you 

00:57:24.199 --> 00:57:26.921
 I will give you $ 1000º of my money. 

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:30.572
 Just let it run. 

00:57:32.114 --> 00:57:33.734
 Listen to this, 

00:57:34.172 --> 00:57:36.369
 He has the insulin in his bag. 

00:57:36.826 --> 00:57:37.881
 Can you bring it to her? 

00:57:41.952 --> 00:57:43.474
 You know it's forbidden. 

00:57:45.346 --> 00:57:47.305
 I will give you $ 2000ºº. 

00:57:53.268 --> 00:57:55.471
 $ 2000ºº needs it. 

00:58:05.683 --> 00:58:07.516
 I do not need the money. 

00:58:43.311 --> 00:58:44.381
 Get up. 

00:58:45.175 --> 00:58:46.717
 The captain wants to see you. 

00:59:12.625 --> 00:59:14.178
 How we stay locked nobody will hear us. 

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.444
 What? 

00:59:17.989 --> 00:59:19.251
 Very well. 

00:59:19.251 --> 00:59:22.325
 You are going to do this to me and you will not tell anyone. 

00:59:24.139 --> 00:59:25.164
 What the hell are you talking about? 

00:59:26.845 --> 00:59:28.744
 Chupamela 

00:59:31.027 --> 00:59:32.250
 No no no no. 

00:59:33.744 --> 00:59:35.017
 Let's go. 

00:59:35.017 --> 00:59:37.564
 - Just get on your knees. - No, I'll go back to my cell. 

00:59:39.097 --> 00:59:40.392
 Get on your knees, fine. 

00:59:40.392 --> 00:59:41.495
 All right? 

00:59:41.496 --> 00:59:42.727
 I'm going to my cell. 

00:59:42.727 --> 00:59:45.605
 listen, first you are going to suck my cock 

00:59:45.606 --> 00:59:46.665
 Suck it yourself. 

00:59:46.665 --> 00:59:48.387
 What do you get on your knees? 

00:59:48.726 --> 00:59:50.675
 Damn it, you're on your knees. 

00:59:54.584 --> 00:59:55.481
 What's going on? 

00:59:55.481 --> 00:59:56.526
 Nothing. 

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:58.717
 What does that prisoner do outside his cell? 

00:59:58.717 --> 01:00:00.075
 The... 

01:00:00.075 --> 01:00:02.693
 ... he had to tell me something about prisoner 77, 

01:00:03.239 --> 01:00:04.552
 but he has not finished telling me everything. 

01:00:05.718 --> 01:00:07.192
 - 77? - Yes 

01:00:07.192 --> 01:00:08.229
 That's true? 

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.543
 - No. - Yes, it's true. 

01:00:09.543 --> 01:00:10.608
 I'm asking him. 

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:11.752
 That's true? 

01:00:11.752 --> 01:00:12.946
 If true. 

01:00:13.433 --> 01:00:16.854
 Barris, I finally find you, you must come fast. 

01:00:25.485 --> 01:00:27.086
 You see? 

01:00:33.806 --> 01:00:34.598
 Why? 

01:00:46.302 --> 01:00:47.436
 What were you doing in there? 

01:00:49.845 --> 01:00:50.732
 Nothing. 

01:00:51.626 --> 01:00:53.863
 I need you to empty your pockets. 

01:00:56.258 --> 01:01:00.343
 Empty your pockets, Bosch, get there right there. 

01:01:17.292 --> 01:01:23.719
 You know, that nothing of the outside world should enter here. 

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.087
 You know, right? 

01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:28.268
 - I just ... - Silence. Shut. 

01:01:32.979 --> 01:01:36.381
 They try to win me, I know you would not allow it. 

01:01:38.235 --> 01:01:39.720
 or would you allow it? 

01:01:41.221 --> 01:01:42.867
 Tell me and we will forget this. 

01:01:45.604 --> 01:01:46.632
 Who told you? 

01:02:23.116 --> 01:02:25.271
 Then we will talk about this. 

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.146
 All right. 

01:02:54.774 --> 01:02:57.159
 As you can see 

01:02:58.915 --> 01:03:00.688
 I am a rational man 

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:03.576
 I'm not a monster, if that's the case, 

01:03:03.577 --> 01:03:05.172
 I would open your head. 

01:03:11.107 --> 01:03:16.494
 I have a position, which I did not ask 

01:03:18.532 --> 01:03:21.287
 and in some way, it would be easier, 

01:03:22.726 --> 01:03:24.601
 without prisoners like you. 

01:03:25.271 --> 01:03:26.966
 I doubt it very much. 

01:03:27.564 --> 01:03:29.571
 You break the rules again 77. 

01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:31.383
 You could die if you do not get the insulin. 

01:03:31.383 --> 01:03:34.234
 I died if I did not receive the insulin. He could die if he did not receive his insulin. 

01:03:34.234 --> 01:03:36.684
 Did you hear that? He could die if he did not receive his insulin. 

01:03:38.938 --> 01:03:39.886
 Really? 

01:03:39.886 --> 01:03:41.744
 When you speak, 

01:03:42.471 --> 01:03:43.789
 Can you hear yourself? 

01:03:48.261 --> 01:03:51.785
 What do you think is on the other side of those cameras? 

01:03:54.359 --> 01:03:56.505
 They are watching us 

01:03:57.692 --> 01:04:00.682
 The 24 hours of the day. 

01:04:00.682 --> 01:04:02.078
 They know what we do, 

01:04:02.747 --> 01:04:07.838
 you think that if there was the slightest chance, 

01:04:07.839 --> 01:04:11.139
 that someone died, would this continue? 

01:04:12.434 --> 01:04:13.723
 He is completely safe, 

01:04:14.056 --> 01:04:15.213
 your friend. 

01:04:16.326 --> 01:04:21.783
 They keep us completely safe. 

01:04:23.796 --> 01:04:25.054
 When this is over, 

01:04:26.211 --> 01:04:27.660
 You know, what do you have to do? 

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:28.677
 Do not. 

01:04:29.844 --> 01:04:31.201
 Take the money, 

01:04:32.729 --> 01:04:35.486
 and take a vacation, where you want 

01:04:37.503 --> 01:04:41.766
 and then you should go to a rehabilitation clinic 

01:04:41.766 --> 01:04:45.973
 where doctors can diagnose your problem 

01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:47.481
 Maybe you can suggest me, 

01:04:47.482 --> 01:04:52.082
 a clinic because obviously you have serious problems inside your head. 

01:04:53.355 --> 01:04:54.927
 Do you allow this to be your boss? 

01:04:54.927 --> 01:04:56.791
 - I follow the rules. - Need help. 

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:57.992
 I only enforce the rules. 

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:00.526
 I'm not trying anything. 

01:05:00.526 --> 01:05:04.977
 You need to get out of here, okay? You need a damn help. 

01:05:07.007 --> 01:05:07.922
 Do you know what I need? 

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:14.051
 I need you to clean the Toilet. 

01:05:15.676 --> 01:05:16.772
 That is what I need. 

01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:20.446
 Enough, enough of that nonsense, man. 

01:05:20.446 --> 01:05:24.604
 WC. It is not cleaned. 

01:05:24.604 --> 01:05:26.890
 Stop this, guys. Stop this. 

01:05:27.348 --> 01:05:29.853
 Are you in charge, that makes you happy? 

01:05:29.853 --> 01:05:31.303
 Toilet 

01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:34.083
 I need you to clean my Toilet. 

01:05:34.084 --> 01:05:34.961
 Fuck you 

01:05:35.489 --> 01:05:36.484
 Fuck me 

01:05:36.864 --> 01:05:39.569
 Fuck you 

01:05:40.058 --> 01:05:42.304
 I do not normally use those swear words but, 

01:05:43.611 --> 01:05:44.938
 Fuck you 

01:05:45.539 --> 01:05:46.139
 Fuck. 

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:47.540
 Fuck. 

01:05:56.442 --> 01:05:59.598
 You are a prisoner, 77 

01:06:00.895 --> 01:06:02.664
 Your pride let it go. 

01:06:07.732 --> 01:06:09.330
 I need you too 

01:06:10.259 --> 01:06:11.346
 Say it for me. 

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:14.775
 Say it "I am a prisoner" 

01:06:15.155 --> 01:06:16.363
 Fuck you 

01:06:23.221 --> 01:06:24.691
 Say it. 

01:06:25.675 --> 01:06:26.467
 Fuck ... 

01:06:38.192 --> 01:06:40.977
 Say it. 

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.288
 Go to hell. 

01:07:09.454 --> 01:07:11.773
 Stop, stop. 

01:07:15.024 --> 01:07:15.624
 Say it. 

01:07:16.525 --> 01:07:17.548
 Say it for me. 

01:07:21.763 --> 01:07:23.877
 I 

01:07:25.103 --> 01:07:26.880
 I 

01:07:27.198 --> 01:07:28.098
 I am 

01:07:28.198 --> 01:07:29.347
 Prisoner. 

01:07:31.154 --> 01:07:32.511
 Prisoner. 

01:07:32.994 --> 01:07:34.222
 prisoner. 

01:07:35.911 --> 01:07:37.827
 I am a prisoner. 

01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:39.583
 Yes. 

01:07:40.025 --> 01:07:41.102
 Yes. 

01:07:41.538 --> 01:07:42.817
 Yes, 77 

01:07:43.804 --> 01:07:45.382
 That's, 

01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:47.009
 exactly, 

01:07:47.424 --> 01:07:48.622
 what you are. 

01:09:34.778 --> 01:09:35.756
 Hears, 

01:09:37.828 --> 01:09:39.462
 You got a minute? 

01:09:45.865 --> 01:09:47.360
 Let's go. 

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:56.896
 Let's go. 

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:11.467
 Why can not we talk in the room? 

01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:13.801
 The boys want to tell you something. 

01:10:18.952 --> 01:10:22.247
 Guys, whatever you plan to do, please, do not do it. 

01:10:31.889 --> 01:10:35.042
 "Fifth day" 

01:10:53.107 --> 01:10:54.984
 I think it's very clear, 

01:10:55.743 --> 01:10:57.822
 that there will be zero tolerance, 

01:10:57.822 --> 01:10:59.556
 if they break the rules. 

01:11:08.412 --> 01:11:13.657
 Bosch, will now join the prisoners 

01:11:14.197 --> 01:11:18.253
 Now he will be prisoner No. 76 

01:11:19.671 --> 01:11:21.279
 Problem with that? 

01:11:21.279 --> 01:11:23.356
 Prisoner 77? 

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.419
 All right. 

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:33.477
 I am the "man of the echo". 

01:11:33.678 --> 01:11:36.878
 of the echo, the echo, the echo ... 

01:11:36.979 --> 01:11:37.979
 &lt;i&gt; "I want you guys" &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:11:38.674 --> 01:11:41.328
 &lt;i&gt; "Everyone can talk to me" &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:11:41.329 --> 01:11:42.329
 &lt;i&gt; "can you talk to me" &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:46.830
 &lt;i&gt; "they put the words, the words can help us," &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:11:46.931 --> 01:11:52.331
 &lt;i&gt; "the guy, the fifth on the left" &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:11:52.332 --> 01:12:00.032
 &lt;i&gt; "As if they did not exist, as if they did not exist, I swear it." &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:12:00.055 --> 01:12:02.011
 Not everyone is happy with their life. 

01:12:04.108 --> 01:12:08.091
 I have my place, they have their place and all of you, 

01:12:08.749 --> 01:12:10.745
 all of you, have your places, 

01:12:11.433 --> 01:12:13.581
 and I have my place, 

01:12:13.581 --> 01:12:19.003
 without the existence of rules, it would be chaos. 

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:25.214
 Replace it to put. 

01:12:35.719 --> 01:12:39.261
 I said, you put it back on 77 

01:12:45.393 --> 01:12:46.971
 Did you hear 77? 

01:12:50.057 --> 01:12:51.296
 Put it on 

01:12:51.296 --> 01:12:53.331
 Put it on 

01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:56.467
 Go back to the line, do not continue. 

01:12:57.254 --> 01:12:59.512
 Hey, what are you doing? Stop. 

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:01.617
 Open the door. 

01:13:02.121 --> 01:13:04.971
 - You, him from there inside. - Down 77 

01:13:04.971 --> 01:13:07.022
 - Listen to me, we want to leave. - Get down from there. 

01:13:07.022 --> 01:13:08.993
 - I will not repeat it to you. - Behind. 

01:13:14.503 --> 01:13:15.631
 Talking with them? 

01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:16.669
 Do you hear me? 

01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:19.154
 Nobody, nobody talks to them. 

01:13:19.798 --> 01:13:21.605
 You must speak only when they address you. 

01:13:21.605 --> 01:13:23.042
 That is rule number one, now. 

01:13:23.645 --> 01:13:26.088
 Nobody talks to them. 

01:13:47.804 --> 01:13:49.814
 - To the fucking hole. - Pieces of shit. 

01:13:49.895 --> 01:13:51.195
 Better shut up 

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:53.724
 You have searched for yourself. 

01:13:54.914 --> 01:13:56.320
 Fuck. 

01:13:57.338 --> 01:14:00.438
 Go to the prisoners, isolate them, so they do not talk to each other. 

01:14:01.162 --> 01:14:03.996
 Forget the numbers, change them because this place is ours. 

01:14:57.575 --> 01:14:58.801
 What is all this shit? 

01:14:59.835 --> 01:15:02.835
 I can not even think. 

01:15:03.412 --> 01:15:04.689
 All I know is that I get out of here. 

01:15:05.526 --> 01:15:09.909
 You know that decisions must be made collectively. 

01:15:09.909 --> 01:15:13.094
 This experiment is over, we use violence, it's over. 

01:15:13.094 --> 01:15:14.040
 Insurance? 

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.282
 More than 30 minutes have passed and the light has not been turned on. 

01:15:17.283 --> 01:15:18.588
 Anyway? 

01:15:18.588 --> 01:15:20.306
 If you think about it reasonably, 

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:23.737
 the prisoner was the one who used the violence we just answered. 

01:15:23.737 --> 01:15:25.003
 Disproportionately, we screwed up. 

01:15:25.003 --> 01:15:28.644
 Unchecked we screwed this, and crossed the damn red line. 

01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:30.524
 How can you say that? 

01:15:31.721 --> 01:15:33.635
 The red light is the only thing we have. 

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:35.671
 They do not realize? 

01:15:38.836 --> 01:15:41.007
 It is the only way, 

01:15:41.007 --> 01:15:42.272
 to be able to know. 

01:15:46.095 --> 01:15:47.478
 Where is my music? 

01:16:00.527 --> 01:16:02.306
 You can feel what's happening, right? 

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:04.686
 You're a fucking crazy. 

01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.005
 Did you know? 

01:16:07.984 --> 01:16:09.484
 Feel it. 

01:16:47.722 --> 01:16:48.522
 There is a.. 

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:51.323
 ...camera? 

01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:57.869
 Why? 

01:16:57.869 --> 01:17:01.543
 Why do not you stop this? 

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.232
 Why? 

01:17:04.257 --> 01:17:07.066
 "Sixth day" 

01:17:28.792 --> 01:17:30.085
 I'll kill you. 

01:17:31.769 --> 01:17:34.555
 Fuck you I'll kill you. 

01:17:55.823 --> 01:17:57.595
 I will remove the tape, 

01:17:58.914 --> 01:18:00.395
 but you will give me what I want. 

01:18:01.317 --> 01:18:02.148
 In agreement? 

01:18:04.711 --> 01:18:05.642
 Fuck you 

01:18:08.077 --> 01:18:10.110
 You're a fucking fagot. 

01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.963
 You know? 

01:18:15.695 --> 01:18:17.615
 I'm not afraid. 

01:18:18.101 --> 01:18:18.971
 Yes. 

01:18:19.911 --> 01:18:21.122
 Yes. 

01:18:22.612 --> 01:18:23.739
 I know you. 

01:18:40.396 --> 01:18:42.834
 You can not imagine what I can see. 

01:18:43.867 --> 01:18:46.288
 you will be amazed 

01:18:49.459 --> 01:18:51.079
 For. 

01:18:52.898 --> 01:18:54.599
 Do not hit me again. 

01:18:54.599 --> 01:18:56.391
 Now you will treat me kindly. 

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.158
 I'll kill you. 

01:19:11.937 --> 01:19:13.309
 Please. 

01:19:18.609 --> 01:19:19.209
 Get up. 

01:19:24.198 --> 01:19:25.019
 You know? 

01:19:25.832 --> 01:19:28.047
 If your mouth is not kind, 

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.723
 I'll do it for another place. 

01:19:45.959 --> 01:19:47.259
 No, no, please. 

01:19:47.861 --> 01:19:48.972
 No, no, wait. 

01:19:48.972 --> 01:19:49.794
 Shut. 

01:19:49.794 --> 01:19:51.668
 Please, I'll deal with my mouth. 

01:20:39.797 --> 01:20:41.831
 Fuck you, you bastard son of a bitch. Fuck you 

01:20:41.832 --> 01:20:44.728
 Do you think that's funny? How funny is it now? 

01:20:54.352 --> 01:20:55.328
 Thank you. 

01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:01.657
 Let's go. 

01:21:13.058 --> 01:21:15.092
 Do you still prefer to continue like this? 

01:21:15.092 --> 01:21:16.525
 Fuck, no. 

01:21:23.019 --> 01:21:25.155
 These young people need someone like us. 

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.317
 Hey, mate. 

01:21:44.318 --> 01:21:45.680
 Let's go. 

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:28.062
 Barris, we have problems. 

01:22:33.263 --> 01:22:34.363
 Let's go for you. 

01:23:02.914 --> 01:23:04.689
 By God, what will we do? 

01:23:05.592 --> 01:23:07.037
 Be prepared. 

01:23:08.834 --> 01:23:11.058
 You've lost your mind, man. 

01:23:12.011 --> 01:23:14.431
 They are more than us. 

01:23:21.115 --> 01:23:22.219
 Maybe, 

01:23:22.919 --> 01:23:24.134
 but they are still prisoners. 

01:23:24.746 --> 01:23:26.290
 They can not with us. 

01:23:27.907 --> 01:23:29.944
 What are you doing here? 

01:23:33.321 --> 01:23:35.195
 Now if we get screwed? 

01:23:38.644 --> 01:23:40.363
 What is your authority fuck? 

01:23:41.536 --> 01:23:44.899
 There's not much time. 

01:24:29.759 --> 01:24:31.280
 What do they do? What do they do? 

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.699
 We must stay inside, 

01:24:32.699 --> 01:24:34.388
 separated from the outside world. 

01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:36.369
 We can not let anyone leave. 

01:24:36.369 --> 01:24:38.437
 Stop, why do you try to do this? 

01:25:00.523 --> 01:25:01.993
 It is your fault. 

01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:08.870
 Michael Barris June 14, 2010 $ 14,000ºº 

01:29:42.671 --> 01:29:46.528
 Are you still thinking that we are the peak of evolution, about monkeys? 

01:29:55.092 --> 01:29:55.692
 Yes. 

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:01.265
 But there is still a lot to do about it. 

01:30:05.782 --> 01:30:08.382
 This is where the experiment led took place 

01:30:08.382 --> 01:30:11.029
 performed by a non-government company. 

01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:13.926
 We talked to someone from the corporation and they confirmed us 

01:30:13.926 --> 01:30:16.526
 that the company was in charge of the psychological experiment. 

01:30:16.527 --> 01:30:17.955
 "Yes, we will testify" 

01:30:17.955 --> 01:30:19.656
 "Where it is necessary" 

01:30:19.656 --> 01:30:22.805
 A man died there called Benjy 

01:30:22.869 --> 01:30:24.069
 Everything indicates that an investigation will be opened against the 

01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:26.460
 "Dr. Juno Joanna accused of ..."
