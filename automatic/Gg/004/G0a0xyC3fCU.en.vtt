00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
always seem to somehow gather I also

always seem to somehow gather I also
sometimes<00:00:37.100> stick<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.340> tactical<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.059> think

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
sometimes stick it on tactical I think

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.630 
sometimes stick it on tactical I think
cat<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> best<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.980> honest<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
cat was the best be honest if you a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.090 
cat was the best be honest if you a
stick<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.120> tactical<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.620> best<00:00:43.770> option

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
stick on tactical it is the best option

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.540 
stick on tactical it is the best option
which<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.539> useful<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.399> also<00:00:47.399> I'm

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
which is very very useful and also I'm

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.869 
which is very very useful and also I'm
so<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:48.289> little<00:00:49.289> blips<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
so about little blips in this I think it

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.600
