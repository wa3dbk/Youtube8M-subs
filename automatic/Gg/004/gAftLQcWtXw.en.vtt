00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
this is a sample unit and so when we get

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.029 
this is a sample unit and so when we get
samples<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.230> don't<00:00:22.380> always<00:00:22.560> know<00:00:22.859> if

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039

noticed<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.310> HIAS<00:03:03.000> cards<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.010> AMD<00:03:05.010> cards

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
noticed that HIAS cards and AMD cards

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.430 
noticed that HIAS cards and AMD cards
usually<00:03:05.459> use<00:03:05.910> stream<00:03:06.300> processing<00:03:06.870> unit<00:03:07.290> is

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
usually use stream processing unit is

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.760 
usually use stream processing unit is
there<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:08.510> verbage<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.900> either<00:03:10.320> way<00:03:10.590> it's

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
there a verbage so either way it's

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.710 
there a verbage so either way it's
correct<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.250> shader<00:03:11.520> units<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.090> that's<00:03:12.570> what

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
correct so shader units if that's what
