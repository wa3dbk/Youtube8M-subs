00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
impressed and then I think here I asked

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.669 
impressed and then I think here I asked
him<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.460> canter<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.119> this<00:01:20.109> was<00:01:20.289> always<00:01:20.469> his

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
him to canter and this was always his

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.160 
him to canter and this was always his
bad<00:01:20.829> way<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:21.039> I<00:01:21.640> didn't<00:01:22.630> think<00:01:22.840> he<00:01:22.960> was<00:01:23.020> gonna

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
bad way so I didn't think he was gonna

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.779 
bad way so I didn't think he was gonna
pick<00:01:23.380> up<00:01:23.499> the<00:01:23.590> right<00:01:23.740> lead<00:01:23.920> but<00:01:24.429> I<00:01:24.460> think<00:01:24.700> he

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
pick up the right lead but I think he

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.999 
pick up the right lead but I think he
did<00:01:25.060> know<00:01:25.719> I<00:01:25.869> was<00:01:26.020> just<00:01:26.229> asking<00:01:26.560> him<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.829> move

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:49.980 
with under saddle as well so he's doing
really<00:01:48.999> good<00:01:49.209> and<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.479> reins<00:01:49.689> are<00:01:49.840> flying

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
really good and the reins are flying

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.169 
really good and the reins are flying
around<00:01:50.170> but<00:01:50.439> never<00:01:50.649> once<00:01:50.979> did<00:01:51.100> they<00:01:51.340> go<00:01:51.520> near

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
around but never once did they go near

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.399 
around but never once did they go near
his<00:01:52.299> feet<00:01:52.509> where<00:01:52.719> he<00:01:52.749> could<00:01:53.020> have<00:01:53.109> tripped

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
his feet where he could have tripped

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.190 
his feet where he could have tripped
near<00:01:54.219> them<00:01:54.459> so<00:01:55.030> he<00:01:55.420> kind<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.719> gave<00:01:55.899> me<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.049> little

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
near them so he kind of gave me a little

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.949 
near them so he kind of gave me a little
sass<00:01:56.499> on<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:56.950> one<00:01:57.209> but<00:01:58.209> that's<00:01:58.389> okay

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
sass on that one but that's okay

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.859 
sass on that one but that's okay
and<00:01:59.459> as<00:02:00.459> you<00:02:00.609> can<00:02:00.729> see<00:02:00.999> he<00:02:01.179> kind<00:02:01.299> of<00:02:01.420> get<00:02:01.539> stuck

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
and as you can see he kind of get stuck

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.980 
and as you can see he kind of get stuck
in<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.109> corners<00:02:02.499> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.850> round<00:02:04.060> pen<00:02:04.270> but<00:02:04.630> he

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
in the corners of the round pen but he

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.739 
in the corners of the round pen but he
was<00:02:05.200> doing<00:02:05.469> very<00:02:05.499> good<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.189> I<00:02:06.279> was<00:02:06.490> very<00:02:06.749> just
