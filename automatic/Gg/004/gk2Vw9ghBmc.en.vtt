00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.660
 more 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.400
 android next and on the mwc has 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.940
 from pet 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.619
 a 7 inch tablet 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.449
 telephony function like you are 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.439
 Samsung is also very modern 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.410
 the eight inch devices with 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.090
 Telefoniefunktionen out so regardless 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.710
 curiosities to a giant knocker 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.240
 to run amrum you can do that too 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.279
 with a handsfree or something 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.380
 use so there is this homepage 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.760
 from asus 7 inch with telephony function 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.410
 and the special about watson inter 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.700
 process trainer and not now the 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.040
 clings helplessly to the wait 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.780
 but the smaller and we have now 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.010
 here an original packaged device and 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.149
 because I thought I use the times 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.050
 do this together with you 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.340
 unpack 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.070
 maybe one or the other would like 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.629
 sure to put up a front and the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.309
 head count effect still of what are so 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.780
 in the packaging in it is why 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.280
 Let's take a quick look at the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.319
 nothing special back actually 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.510
 on it here so the numbers you have that 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.609
 also and you four times as the cover off 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.129
 and then we already see that from here 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.140
 bed if that in a nice cover 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.120
 is packed off at a time 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.229
 and yes then already the first 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.820
 special device has one here 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.250
 italia is already on liquid so 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.990
 A clue back with up here 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.790
 Of course a plastic band for better 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.040
 we received construction work 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.600
 volume rocker we know everything 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.430
 so far so nothing really 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.170
 that's the way to get it 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.390
 therefore what is in the packaging and in 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.080
 Here we have a nice short 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.870
 that is not even one 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.900
 Quick Guide which is the guarantee card 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.060
 a user manual that explains what the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.050
 individual connections and buttons here so 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.030
 and then of course that 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.980
 obligatory micro usb cable in 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.340
 standard asus design we know that 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.290
 so far and next to the power supply 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.570
 to the car or a really huge one 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.100
 power supply so I have in the last 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.980
 time already a little bit smaller 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.450
 seen that here rather like this 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.010
 knocker from the i am school now 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.490
 not so easy off but 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.470
 not ugly for beautiful now 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.670
 the mutated may be relatively large 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.260
 well do not want us with the power adapter 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.240
 stop we look if we already have one 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.910
 a little bit of power is on it and then drive 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.860
 this frontman for the first time we high it 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.560
 vibrates exactly seen visions intel 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.450
 inside we are still looking forward to it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.030
 more curiosity is still rare 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.890
 that we have devices with android the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.350
 just run on an intel chip 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.920
 In the case of the Aasee stream is driving 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.150
 that and yes the well-known good animation 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.520
 and also groups how long that is now 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.350
 is constantly very high is so 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.030
 of course, as I said not the clavister 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.380
 in there and now always there and now 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.080
 can you all here to set up the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.370
 Of course I save myself now but we 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.940
 have it just went well times 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.930
 looked at that so that asus endangers 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.280
 I think it costs or you can do it 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.320
 preorder in germany already for 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.730
 somehow 230 euro or something I know 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.740
 not how they finally settle it 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.390
 But one goes from a price to 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.430
 the 200 euro from but just get it 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.050
 a 7 inch device with the her too 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.480
 need phone calls that was me 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.130
 from android next here with the unboxing 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.130
 the awo sent from bed until then 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.540
 a 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.300
 March 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.310
