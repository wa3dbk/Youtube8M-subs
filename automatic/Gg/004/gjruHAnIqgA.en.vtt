00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
almost hole in my ear yeah it isn't her

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.460 
almost hole in my ear yeah it isn't her
I<00:01:04.330> know<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.690> looks<00:01:04.839> crazy<00:01:05.019> but<00:01:05.199> it<00:01:05.379> really

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
I know it looks crazy but it really

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.890 
I know it looks crazy but it really
doesn't<00:01:05.710> bother<00:01:05.890> me<00:01:06.159> at<00:01:06.280> all<00:01:06.310> so<00:01:07.180> I<00:01:07.210> found

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
doesn't bother me at all so I found

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.990 
doesn't bother me at all so I found
these<00:01:08.080> things<00:01:08.290> that<00:01:08.500> surgery<00:01:08.920> actually<00:01:09.729> I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
these things that surgery actually I

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.300 
these things that surgery actually I
think<00:01:10.090> it's<00:01:10.240> about<00:01:10.360> $500<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.259> have<00:01:11.410> them<00:01:11.650> re--

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
think it's about $500 to have them re--

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.100 
think it's about $500 to have them re--
stitch<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.759> and<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:13.119> probably<00:01:13.360> will<00:01:13.750> do<00:01:13.930> that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
stitch it and I probably will do that

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.499 
stitch it and I probably will do that
eventually<00:01:14.440> but<00:01:14.920> right<00:01:15.160> now<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.640> don't<00:01:16.210> have<00:01:16.420> an

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
eventually but right now I don't have an

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.320 
eventually but right now I don't have an
extra<00:01:16.690> 500<00:01:17.170> bucks<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:18.550> found<00:01:18.910> these<00:01:19.060> little

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
extra 500 bucks so I found these little

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.430 
extra 500 bucks so I found these little
um<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.850> kind<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.330> think<00:01:22.509> it's<00:01:22.630> called<00:01:22.869> like<00:01:23.290> an

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
um it's kind I think it's called like an

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.060 
um it's kind I think it's called like an
ear<00:01:24.750> ear<00:01:25.750> saver<00:01:26.140> or<00:01:26.470> something<00:01:26.770> like<00:01:26.890> that<00:01:27.039> I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
ear ear saver or something like that I

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.070 
ear ear saver or something like that I
think<00:01:27.160> you<00:01:27.340> can<00:01:27.520> get<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:27.880> at<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.820> Claire's<00:01:31.240> or
