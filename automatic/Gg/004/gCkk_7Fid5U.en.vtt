00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
that I love these things so much and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.439 
that I love these things so much and
there's<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.279> much<00:00:26.460> controversy<00:00:26.910> about

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
there's so much controversy about

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.420 
there's so much controversy about
wearing<00:00:27.810> them<00:00:27.930> I've<00:00:28.439> never<00:00:28.740> had<00:00:28.920> any<00:00:29.070> problems

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
wearing them I've never had any problems

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.859 
wearing them I've never had any problems
with<00:00:29.460> wearing<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.880> before<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.810> just

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
with wearing on before I think it's just

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.420 
with wearing on before I think it's just
about<00:00:30.990> using<00:00:31.230> common<00:00:31.650> sense<00:00:31.680> you<00:00:32.070> don't<00:00:32.250> want

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
about using common sense you don't want

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.049 
about using common sense you don't want
to<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.260> 16<00:00:34.260> 15<00:00:34.890> inch<00:00:35.160> waist<00:00:35.760> that's

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
to have like a 16 15 inch waist that's

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.119 
to have like a 16 15 inch waist that's
just<00:00:36.269> absolutely<00:00:36.629> ridiculous<00:00:37.080> I<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.980> want

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
just absolutely ridiculous I just want

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.829 
just absolutely ridiculous I just want
to<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.580> help<00:00:38.820> minimize<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.510> waist

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
to do it to help minimize my waist

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.840 
to do it to help minimize my waist
because<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.230> don't<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.589> that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
because I don't like that

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.389 
because I don't like that
flat<00:00:42.480> straight<00:00:43.469> side<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> don't<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.340> I

thought to have my natural curve
enhanced<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.559> little<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.579> anyways<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.149> um

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
enhanced a little bit so anyways but um

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
it's really a good idea I don't see how

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.930 
it's really a good idea I don't see how
you<00:03:17.900> can<00:03:18.080> get<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.500> proper<00:03:18.950> breathing<00:03:19.310> or

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
you can get the proper breathing or

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.480 
you can get the proper breathing or
stretching<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.080> need<00:03:21.350> not<00:03:21.980> only<00:03:22.040> that

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
stretching that you need not only that

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.890 
stretching that you need not only that
but<00:03:22.700> like<00:03:22.760> when<00:03:23.060> you're<00:03:23.180> working<00:03:23.570> out<00:03:23.690> and

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
but like when you're working out and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.060 
but like when you're working out and
you're<00:03:23.960> wearing<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.650> can't<00:03:24.890> really

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
you're wearing this you can't really

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.710 
you're wearing this you can't really
work<00:03:25.460> your<00:03:25.700> stomach<00:03:26.030> muscles<00:03:26.210> that<00:03:26.450> much

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
work your stomach muscles that much

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.120 
work your stomach muscles that much
because<00:03:27.050> you're<00:03:27.260> relying<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.830> this<00:03:27.980> to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
because you're relying on this to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.160 
because you're relying on this to
support<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.480> honestly<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.990> don't

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
recommend working out with this because

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.460 
recommend working out with this because
like<00:03:32.060> just<00:03:32.480> for<00:03:32.690> health<00:03:32.900> reasons<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.380> don't

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
like just for health reasons I don't

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.810 
like just for health reasons I don't
think<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:33.800> good<00:03:33.920> idea<00:03:34.250> if<00:03:34.460> you<00:03:34.580> get<00:03:34.700> your

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
think it's a good idea if you get your

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.150 
think it's a good idea if you get your
