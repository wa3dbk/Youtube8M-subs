should be able to have the best
performance<00:00:16.040> in<00:00:16.669> in<00:00:17.509> braking<00:00:18.080> cornering<00:00:18.410> top

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
performance in in braking cornering top

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.800 
performance in in braking cornering top
speed<00:00:19.460> and<00:00:19.970> you<00:00:20.119> should<00:00:20.270> be<00:00:20.390> able<00:00:20.450> to<00:00:20.630> combine

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810

combine that with exclusivity luxury and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.910 
combine that with exclusivity luxury and
usability<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:25.519> it's<00:00:25.670> many<00:00:25.939> contradicting

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
usability so it's many contradicting

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.279 
usability so it's many contradicting
terms<00:00:27.920> that<00:00:28.189> has<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.490> come<00:00:28.670> together<00:00:29.289> it's

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
terms that has to come together it's

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.259 
terms that has to come together it's
about<00:00:30.439> proving<00:00:30.859> all<00:00:31.220> of<00:00:31.339> those<00:00:31.490> continuously

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
about proving all of those continuously

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.600 
about proving all of those continuously
and<00:00:32.480> showing<00:00:32.930> that<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.620> bar<00:00:33.830> is<00:00:33.860> raced<00:00:34.339> in

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
and showing that the bar is raced in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.090 
and showing that the bar is raced in
every<00:00:34.940> area<00:00:37.629> outside<00:00:38.629> our<00:00:38.870> Factory<00:00:39.650> in<00:00:39.739> Sweden

every area outside our Factory in Sweden
we<00:00:40.220> have<00:00:40.339> a<00:00:40.370> test<00:00:40.640> track<00:00:40.729> which<00:00:40.940> used<00:00:41.150> to<00:00:41.269> be<00:00:41.360> a

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
we have a test track which used to be a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.570 
we have a test track which used to be a
military<00:00:41.629> runway<00:00:42.379> where<00:00:43.040> we<00:00:43.159> do<00:00:43.280> shakedown

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
military runway where we do shakedown

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.149 
military runway where we do shakedown
rounds<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.330> our<00:00:44.449> prototypes<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.320> production

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
rounds and our prototypes and production

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.640 
rounds and our prototypes and production
cars<00:00:46.369> and<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:46.760> on<00:00:46.790> and<00:00:47.269> we<00:00:47.989> just<00:00:48.140> noticed<00:00:48.530> with

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
cars and so on and we just noticed with

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.920 
cars and so on and we just noticed with
the<00:00:48.739> power<00:00:48.920> level<00:00:49.339> we<00:00:49.489> have<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:49.940> India<00:00:50.540> gear

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
the power level we have in India gear

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.020 
the power level we have in India gear
are<00:00:51.229> we<00:00:51.650> can<00:00:51.830> actually<00:00:51.979> go<00:00:52.250> all<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.610> way<00:00:52.640> up<00:00:52.820> to

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
are we can actually go all the way up to

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.289 
are we can actually go all the way up to
200<00:00:53.239> miles<00:00:53.690> per<00:00:53.809> hour<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.260> great<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:55.159> only<00:00:55.400> 1.5

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
200 miles per hour and great in only 1.5

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.750 
200 miles per hour and great in only 1.5
kilometers<00:00:56.570> which<00:00:57.170> is<00:00:57.320> amazing<00:00:57.860> so<00:00:57.890> we<00:00:58.610> said

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
kilometers which is amazing so we said

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.119 
kilometers which is amazing so we said
why<00:00:58.909> don't<00:00:58.970> we<00:00:59.229> cloak<00:01:00.229> this<00:01:00.470> officially<00:01:00.949> see

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
why don't we cloak this officially see

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.340 
why don't we cloak this officially see
what<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:01.400> does<00:01:01.549> and<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:01.939> turned<00:01:02.150> out<00:01:02.269> to<00:01:02.510> be<00:01:02.540> way

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
what it does and it turned out to be way

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.740 
what it does and it turned out to be way
way<00:01:03.589> faster<00:01:03.860> than<00:01:04.189> any<00:01:04.610> other<00:01:04.879> car<00:01:05.269> on<00:01:05.299> a

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
way faster than any other car on a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.719 
way faster than any other car on a
production<00:01:06.290> car<00:01:06.439> on<00:01:06.560> earth<00:01:06.680> it's<00:01:07.430> actually

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
production car on earth it's actually

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.660 
production car on earth it's actually
five<00:01:07.970> six<00:01:08.360> second<00:01:08.810> faster<00:01:09.289> zero<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.159> three

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
five six second faster zero to three

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.550 
five six second faster zero to three
hundred<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:11.119> zero<00:01:11.390> then<00:01:11.719> then<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.170> closest

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
hundred to zero then then the closest

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.490 
hundred to zero then then the closest
competitor<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:13.759> it's<00:01:13.880> just<00:01:14.000> massive<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.630> it

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
competitor so it's just massive and it

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.380 
competitor so it's just massive and it
was<00:01:15.679> almost<00:01:16.039> like<00:01:16.340> we<00:01:16.490> didn't<00:01:16.729> even<00:01:16.789> try<00:01:17.060> we

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
was almost like we didn't even try we

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.270 
was almost like we didn't even try we
didn't<00:01:17.659> push<00:01:18.200> very<00:01:18.350> hard<00:01:18.469> to<00:01:18.710> do<00:01:18.829> this<00:01:19.039> or

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
didn't push very hard to do this or

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.190 
didn't push very hard to do this or
create<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.240> perfect<00:01:20.420> launch<00:01:20.899> or<00:01:21.020> anything

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
create the perfect launch or anything

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.410 
create the perfect launch or anything
it's<00:01:21.409> just<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.859> national<00:01:22.579> thing<00:01:22.820> for<00:01:23.030> our<00:01:23.119> car

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
it's just a national thing for our car

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:40.120 
it's just a national thing for our car
to<00:01:23.600> do

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.700 

there<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.249> a<00:01:41.280> nice<00:01:41.609> way<00:01:41.969> to<00:01:42.299> show<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.319> lot<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
there was a nice way to show a lot of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.739 
there was a nice way to show a lot of
different<00:01:44.069> aspects<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.999> very<00:01:45.210> short<00:01:45.509> period

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
different aspects in a very short period

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.740 
different aspects in a very short period
of<00:01:45.929> time<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.890> actually<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.549> 0<00:01:47.819> to<00:01:48.119> 300<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
of time because actually the 0 to 300 is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.740 
of time because actually the 0 to 300 is
director<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.890> 300<00:01:50.520> zero<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> director<00:01:51.539> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
director this 300 zero is director and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.440 
director this 300 zero is director and
together<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.469> irregular<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:54.240> time

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
together it's irregular so in a time

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.109 
together it's irregular so in a time
span<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.959> under<00:01:55.200> 22<00:01:55.619> seconds<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.640> actually

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
span of under 22 seconds it's actually

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
span of under 22 seconds it's actually
well<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.380> records<00:01:59.689> in<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.929> go<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.560> shows

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
well to records in one go and it shows

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.889 
well to records in one go and it shows
how<00:02:02.490> stable<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.240> car<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:03.569> you<00:02:03.750> can

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
how stable the car is that you can

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.859 
how stable the car is that you can
actually<00:02:04.520> first<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.670> all<00:02:05.819> force<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.420> with

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
actually first of all force it up with

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.020 
actually first of all force it up with
extreme<00:02:07.259> energy<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.799> 300<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.580> directly

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
extreme energy to 300 and then directly

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.900 
extreme energy to 300 and then directly
bring<00:02:09.299> it<00:02:09.420> down<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:10.259> zero<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:11.039> not<00:02:11.280> extreme

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
bring it down to zero is not extreme

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.670 
bring it down to zero is not extreme
when<00:02:12.150> you're<00:02:12.299> doing<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.349> handle

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
when you're doing it is you can handle

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949 
when you're doing it is you can handle
the<00:02:13.799> car<00:02:14.010> very<00:02:14.220> well<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.819> it's<00:02:15.329> made<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.840> do

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959

there<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.290> no<00:02:24.470> way<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.950> achieving<00:02:25.190> these

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
there is no way of achieving these

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.120 
there is no way of achieving these
results<00:02:26.300> because<00:02:27.020> first<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.740> all<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.920> have<00:02:28.010> to

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
results because first of all you have to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.070 
results because first of all you have to
put<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> power<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.910> ground<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.780> only

contact from the car to the ground is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.280 
contact from the car to the ground is
via<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.140> tire<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.070> has<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.400> do<00:02:34.520> its<00:02:34.700> job<00:02:34.940> and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.470 
result either in in cornering
acceleration<00:02:43.070> or<00:02:43.970> braking<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.950> tire<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
acceleration or braking so the tire is a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.600 
acceleration or braking so the tire is a
vital<00:02:47.480> part<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.930> these<00:02:48.110> records<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:49.160> crucial

with<00:02:51.830> Michelin<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.940> course<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.420> goes

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
with Michelin so of course it goes

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.900

very interested in our directors like

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.940 
very interested in our directors like
top<00:03:08.220> speed<00:03:08.459> records<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.000> lap<00:03:09.150> records<00:03:09.659> -<00:03:10.379> and

top speed records and lap records - and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.410 
top speed records and lap records - and
maybe<00:03:11.159> some<00:03:11.280> endurance<00:03:11.730> records<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.390> show

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
maybe some endurance records to show

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.509 
maybe some endurance records to show
that<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.019> total<00:03:13.200> aspect<00:03:13.829> of<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> performance

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
that the total aspect of the performance

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.339 
that the total aspect of the performance
of<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.640> car<00:03:14.909> we're<00:03:15.750> looking<00:03:15.989> at<00:03:16.140> the

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
of the car we're looking at the

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.920 
of the car we're looking at the
numerator<00:03:16.680> looking<00:03:17.430> at<00:03:17.549> top<00:03:17.730> speed<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
numerator looking at top speed and and

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.440 
numerator looking at top speed and and
things<00:03:19.650> like<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.519> we<00:03:20.700> believe<00:03:20.879> that<00:03:21.090> our

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
things like that and we believe that our

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.890 
things like that and we believe that our
car<00:03:21.750> has<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.349> specification<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.519> be<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.689> top

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
car has the specification to be the top

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.430 
car has the specification to be the top
in<00:03:24.930> all<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.530> these<00:03:25.709> areas<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.519> we're

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
in all of these areas so we're

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.440 
in all of these areas so we're
we're<00:03:28.100> very<00:03:28.250> hungry<00:03:28.580> to<00:03:28.850> go<00:03:28.970> out<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.270> prove

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
we're very hungry to go out and prove

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:37.720 
we're very hungry to go out and prove
that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.790
