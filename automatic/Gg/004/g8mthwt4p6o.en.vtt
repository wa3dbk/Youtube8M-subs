in the stack that'll explain but in a
different<00:00:47.039> video<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.610> guess<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> gets<00:00:48.329> 25

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719

likes<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.950> my<00:00:50.190> opinion<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.820> be

the<00:00:50.940> best<00:00:51.059> cycle<00:00:51.360> format<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.899> i<00:00:52.430> think<00:00:53.430> it's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the best cycle format and i think it's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310 
the best cycle format and i think it's
going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> win<00:00:53.820> Toronto<00:00:54.329> i'm<00:00:55.050> pretty<00:00:55.199> sure

first you can magician shark and end
with<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.860> shock<00:01:35.189> Master<00:01:36.259> Zen<00:01:37.259> mighty<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
with a shock Master Zen mighty and a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.499 
with a shock Master Zen mighty and a
photon<00:01:38.790> path<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.420> another<00:01:39.540> shark<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.320> think<00:01:40.560> or

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
photon path and another shark I think or

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.420 
photon path and another shark I think or
you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.020> discard<00:01:43.470> two<00:01:43.649> cards<00:01:43.680> end<00:01:44.310> with

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
you can like discard two cards end with

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.210 
you can like discard two cards end with
a<00:01:44.490> proton<00:01:45.060> PAP<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.810> um<00:01:45.990> seine<00:01:46.950> mighty

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
a proton PAP and they um seine mighty

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.120 
a proton PAP and they um seine mighty
and<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.149> hunter<00:01:48.509> i<00:01:48.540> sold<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> hunter<00:01:49.200> um<00:01:49.619> i

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and then hunter i sold a hunter um i

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.630 
and then hunter i sold a hunter um i
think<00:01:50.960> this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.439> deciding<00:01:53.159> factor

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
think this is a really deciding factor

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
think this is a really deciding factor
on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.000> good<00:01:54.270> builds<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.810> wine<00:01:54.990> deaths<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
on the good builds of wine deaths this

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.840 
on the good builds of wine deaths this
format<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.670> bad<00:01:56.850> ones<00:01:57.090> cuz<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.079> card<00:01:58.350> um

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
format and the bad ones cuz this card um

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.270 
format and the bad ones cuz this card um
really<00:01:59.850> adds<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.509> another<00:02:01.380> dimension<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
really adds up another dimension to the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.760 
really adds up another dimension to the
deck<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.759> gum<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:04.020> don't<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.500> hand

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
deck like gum you don't really do hand

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.959 
deck like gum you don't really do hand

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
thudding is a really big problem for the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.160 
thudding is a really big problem for the
stack<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.270> that's<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> only<00:02:39.930> reason<00:02:39.990> I

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
stack this that's the only reason I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.220 
stack this that's the only reason I
could<00:02:40.290> see<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.340> not<00:02:41.610> when<00:02:41.790> Toronto<00:02:42.300> but

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
could see it's like not when Toronto but

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.200 
could see it's like not when Toronto but
if<00:02:43.950> they<00:02:44.190> made<00:02:44.340> three<00:02:44.580> snowmen<00:02:44.820> eat<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
if they made three snowmen eat it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.030 
if they made three snowmen eat it
shouldn't<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.810> much<00:02:46.110> problem<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.680> also

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
shouldn't be that much problem I also

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
shouldn't be that much problem I also
rabbit<00:02:47.490> will<00:02:47.610> be<00:02:47.670> really<00:02:47.880> big<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.390> will
