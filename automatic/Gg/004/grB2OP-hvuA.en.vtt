lightened his mind to a blank sheet of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.850 
lightened his mind to a blank sheet of

to<00:01:08.100> work<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:09.470> wander<00:01:10.470> around<00:01:10.520> waiting<00:01:11.520> for

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
to work I wander around waiting for

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.100 
to work I wander around waiting for
something<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> make<00:01:12.420> an<00:01:12.540> impression<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.049> me

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and as I said earlier the camera can get

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
and as I said earlier the camera can get
in<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> way<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> know<00:01:17.790> your
