 series in which I put a goal of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.130

 in a few days and also if you want 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.030
 your question appears in the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.500
 next questions and answers well what 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.089
 have to do is leave me there our 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.379
 question down in the comments is worth and 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.820
 the most interesting question then 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.170
 obviously they will be what you put in the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.519
 next question and answers like this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.780
 Well, having said that, we are going to 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.789
 start with the questions of this 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.359
 week and the first one we asked the question of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.850
 lynce 615 tells us questions you would ask 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.559
 own tlc that you would be good to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.879
 three things would you consider good if 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.280
 I had to put three things to a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.929
 slip and today I would put a the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.260
 jetpack brazen or be the jetpack the 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:03.269
 first second a flying motorcycle that is 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.739
 I would love a power bike and 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.970
 you with the boot and normally as if 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.390
 outside a normal motorcycle through the city of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.460
 the Saints 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.320
 they are winning here by hernando over there and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.750
 all of a sudden and give them the button the e3 or 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.100
 give the circle to any button that 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.020
 will be activated in a room that would be 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 wings and unfolding and that will start the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.659
 motorcycle to fly not and that could 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.580
 find it as if it were a plane and its 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 mother nor need a puntazo be 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.670
 saying what would not be beautiful like that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.690
 that would be a good thing I already mentioned 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.340
 in another video and a lot of time 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.630
 no prisoners will be people who agreed to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.830
 also be something else that would add a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.530
 flying motorbike when you want 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.750
 click on a button will now be displayed if 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.270
 so I could start flying not after 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.060
 well the last thing I would add would be 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.050
 an airplane which had speed 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.930
 supersonic 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.399
 that is to say the exterior they give and it is that in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.920
 is mother wanted me what you say things 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.270
 meaningless to see those things from my 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.259
 point of view I could put what 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.090
 I want to put the cures 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.649
 obviously so good I 'm going to have 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.210
 as I say an airplane which could be 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.920
 walk the map of the saints in about 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.660
 how many seconds is it worth that I strap 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.369
 I know like 34 times more than hunting for 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.330
 example would be we will be gorgeous for 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.009
 do acrobatics and there is the wake 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.360
 would love a plane that strap 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.130
 very much that would be my third thing that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.229
 they throw me a tlc like that when you put on your 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.080
 he says he says 615 we see with the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.549
 next ask me stock xx gamer me 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.200
 says question two points go to man 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.270
 asked the point of time 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
 danny you think that when you believe or 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.800
 you want them to take out a military dlc in the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.540
 which aircraft carriers appear where 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.280
 Titans land and warships one 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.900
 salute opens this is already talked about a 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.269
 lots of time about that maybe 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.459
 they were going to put a military lcd they go to what 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.780
 better and that were rumors and such but at 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.730
 final was in rumor not in the end not 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.260
 he threw me none of that nor rockstar confirmed 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.630
 nothing and nothing I sincerely 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.060
 I would love to be given a military dlc 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.280
 but I would like for them to throw me a 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.260
 portal I do not know to a port and a 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.599
 insidy 5 gorgeous hysteria in plan 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.190
 gigantic in which they could 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.599
 land and take off planes but 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.980
 obviously that his pearl was moving 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.120
 then it would be the only drawback what 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.400
 that would have to go super slow since 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.200
 super big then I would love it 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.090
 this mission but it was very big 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.530
 to be able to land an airplane without 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.209
 concerns so to speak between 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.549
 quotes albeit quite difficult 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.840
 that you can cairo your friends and I know that 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.250
 everyone will start to land in the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.400
 aircraft carrier with the titans with the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.610
 fighters 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.610
 so yes 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.630
 a dlc of the of military the celestial part 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.190
 could not miss an aircraft carrier 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.510
 I love the mind so it does not seem 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.870
 for your product we go with the following 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.300
 asks me the trank pkk pe tells me 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.370
 ask two points men because the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.770
 tricks we choose the face and revel instead 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.050
 the car free summer or what 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.060
 dictate on one side because with here it puts 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.680
 here with almost the odd one or those of the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.850
 collector's edition well this I what 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.990
 question many people comment danny 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.340
 because you spend your money on the street 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.630
 Isabella who is $ 3,000 instead of 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.540
 catch a free car from the efes 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.890
 summer good basically basically 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.650
 it's because with the cars the summer of 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.600
 tlc good the summer 13 cars 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 free does not come the tricks do not work 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.630
 do not ask why it does not make sense 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.220
 but with free cars from the east 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.840
 summer like I say tricks do not work 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.190
 so that's basically why that's the way 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.750
 that we take the lack see because it is the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.860
 vehicle that costs less are three thousand 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.420
 dollars that's almost nothing 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.030
 well when thanks for your question he 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.460
 cranko pkk p then the next 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.990
 asks one and towers tells me that it is that 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.810
 they gave me a megalodon or different 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.500
 monsters in gta 5 1 and an illusion that 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.280
 I have ingenia 5 is that emit a dlc of 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.540
 supernatural monsters so to speak 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.500
 we are going to put in this new dlc a 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.650
 sea monster other 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.570
 of ground and another flyer for example by 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.570
 example the flying one you had not 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.700
 you have to find different pieces 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.010
 something like that to activate this monster not 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.840
 so then for example I do not know in 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.430
 contrast the flying monster and in the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.690
 monte chilia when this and everything with the 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.520
 lightning and in contrast the flying 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.260
 but it showed really great not that 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.690
 they hit a lot and then another there 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.950
 in him for example in the poplar yes that is 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.330
 the lake that is right next to the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.620
 clover airport then there 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.500
 find you the sea monster has 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.390
 come out of the water as if it were something and 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.470
 after the terrestrial by controlling and 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.330
 through the city of the saint destroying 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.700
 destroying buildings not but that 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.040
 outside more and more will be a mission not 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.630
 that it was not something we could 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.040
 see it when we did monkey that was 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.570
 a mission which we could activate 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.340
 making free finding different 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.230
 paper found different riddles or 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.610
 something like that does not make good and I love that 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.960
 give me a gift with what that is 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.120
 something that I would love and you have to 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.830
 kill him with your friends and make him super 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.960
 big in this gorgeous like that the 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.390
 next question one and madrid to another 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.030
 an iron look that the name of a line is 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.140
 it's strange I 've never seen it since it has 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.500
 gone question with the name of one and 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.500
 my mother 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:41.070
 danny 2.2 how many videos when the 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.530
 new dlc 1.13 the highlight of the 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.740
 update 1.13 you are the best then 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.470
 thank you very much to see how many videos 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.030
 new tlc so to see the first thing to teach 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.390
 everyone to teach cars and their 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.890
 signals teach the new bike and clothing 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.420
 the weapons is to teach is all that 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.980
 I bring 9c all the information that brings 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.900
 and such and after that then surely 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.370
 continue with the series of tuning or two 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.630
 new cars tunnels all new 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.400
 cars the new motorbike also to tunear and 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.690
 I will also do that if the odd test 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.510
 of speed I really want to do 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.880
 speed entities between the bird 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.530
 against the car that runs the most from the new 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.420
 dlc its with the car if red that came out and 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.160
 that he was super handsome in the image of 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.810
 promotion of the new dlc or what to do 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.950
 speed test between the ader and that 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.180
 car because I think that car is going to 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.000
 aim very strong in terms of speed 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.980
 in gta 5 and also because I'm going to do 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.930
 some test with the motorcycle when the new 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.040
 motorcycle that they are going to put in front of 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.660
 the most running bikes to date in 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.070
 people to 5 online and also because between 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.360
 the two cars the new dlc I do not know if it is 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.110
 basically the videos that I would do and 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.540
 some other series more than now 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.840
 and also good let's go back to the last 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.060
 ask me questions angel lopez the 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.080
 question is do you think that gta 6 will come out for 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.200
 playstation 3 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.450
 well I unfortunately think that there 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.210
 why then because of 7 to 5 already in 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.400
 playstation3 goes like a bit forced by 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.170
 so saying it by saying it slowly forced 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.880
 to go imported by when I think 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.380
 that is already in the generation that of 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.760
 some impressive graphics have 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.590
 super big maps a lot of 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.020
 textures a hoot of graphics like 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.730
 I say I think already for the playstation3 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.440
 it costs you not to reuse all 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.450
 those graphics to play it 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.640
 so I think that the next people 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.410
 to follow will be a fool will come out 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.820
 within three four or five or six 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.310
 years I guess not in a lot of years 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.730
 and with all those years then to rockstar him 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.170
 will give time to create a great game as with 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.030
 triple the graphics you have card 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.220
 5 triple large maps things 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.090
 awesome what they will do in gta 6 well 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.400
 I suppose that game will go 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.900
 focused on the new generation or pc is 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.060
 super powerful not because madrid 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.410
 gta 6 - just imagine it and it enters me 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.810
 fear for the body say my mother yes 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.520
 jeta 5 since a damn past people 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.200
 so is that two in and that awaits albedo 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.500
 of the game so I think for 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.470
 appetites 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.150
 a slightly old-fashioned version a bit what 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.889
 graphic a little softer with the map 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.270
 a little more reduced so to speak with 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.130
 a little more expansions and such and 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.290
 they put it in playstation 3 but I think 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.250
 that is kind of complicated some kind of 

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.690
 put but basically all this has 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.889
 been all this week's questions 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.990
 you can leave me the questions of frizz 

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:03.430
 those of the comments obviously and 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.389
 give it like so that it reaches 1500 that 

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.979
 the video and there is another question and 

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:07.210
 answer within a few days there is a lady 

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:08.530
 this video was screened I'll leave a 

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.669
 team by toshio to liked subscribed 

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.449
 they will take off if you are not and we will leave 

00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:12.449
 Approaching God
