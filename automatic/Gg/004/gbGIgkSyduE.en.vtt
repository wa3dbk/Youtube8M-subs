here<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.810> jack<00:03:46.049> cable<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.590> wish<00:03:47.069> they<00:03:47.250> would

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
here the jack cable I wish they would

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.920 
here the jack cable I wish they would
have<00:03:47.430> made<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.819> bit<00:03:48.030> longer<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:48.720> make

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
have made it a bit longer just to make

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.360 
have made it a bit longer just to make
it<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.109> bit<00:03:49.260> easier<00:03:49.439> because<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.889> can<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:50.250> if

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
it a bit easier because you can see if

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.110 
it a bit easier because you can see if
we<00:03:50.489> come<00:03:50.700> over<00:03:50.730> here<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:51.750> kind<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.019> have<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.409> a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
we come over here we kind of have to a

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.390 
we come over here we kind of have to a
pull<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.569> little<00:03:54.719> bit<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.109> get<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.409> in<00:03:55.560> but

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
pull on it a little bit to get it in but

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.909 
pull on it a little bit to get it in but
that's<00:03:56.549> not<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.819> big<00:03:57.060> deal<00:03:57.120> but<00:03:57.680> other<00:03:58.680> than

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
that's not a big deal but other than

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.849 
that's not a big deal but other than
that<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.459> definitely<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.269> great<00:04:00.900> speaker

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
that this is definitely a great speaker

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.250 
that this is definitely a great speaker
