00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.180
 Hi, I'm already here to talk about mine. 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.490
 skin care oily my skin 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.800
 have enough acne and I think we 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.930
 recent videos you noticed that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.640
 it was very intense business 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.040
 I actually do not have much acne. 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.960
 resistant sealing what worse still 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.610
 because they do not come for nothing in this 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.200
 world they do not go away 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.649
 So I'll talk a little bit about the routine. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.329
 of skin for you in my routine you 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.000
 They'll realize that I do not have a type. 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.340
 many products or very carefully I 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.769
 I have the ideal and basic care 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.780
 I do not pass anti-wrinkle cream any of this 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.940
 because I still do not think I need more 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.519
 maybe now it's coming to the right 25 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.010
 Who knows, the first thing that I 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.109
 I always do when I get home is 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.899
 take off the makeup very well so I 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.480
 shot the shampoo johnson or with and silences 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.129
 of the snow and has to take the makeup well 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.260
 before using soap so because 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.780
 can not leave any residue on the skin 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.630
 Why does this oil come back? 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.870
 back total impunity 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.850
 a skin soap that I really like 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.210
 My, it's over, people are horrible, no 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.920
 Look how beautiful I use the bar already 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.930
 I used the liquid but I prefer a thousand times. 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.970
 because it leaves the skin well 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.770
 receiving a crucible so 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.140
 oilseed oil 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.740
 I always look disgusting at the speed I 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.690
 disgusted 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.550
 but seriously it sucks who has oily skin 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.920
 will understand 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.930
 so come on , I'll blow the soap 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.090
 So I took the makeup first. 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.310
 I passed the soap remembering that they feel 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.320
 always wash with cold water 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.340
 always because the skin gets old. 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.430
 using hot water used soap at 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.830
 Sometimes I blow the soap with gauze 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.350
 take some gauze on the soap 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.200
 exfoliating the face with it because it is a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.370
 light exfoliation and very very effective 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.100
 so I used the soap there 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.000
 exfoliation with gauze is from the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.390
 foreign 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.910
 if I use this of what is the milk of 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.010
 I also like roses and I use them 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.700
 with cotton so normal for 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.030
 really get all dirt out 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.410
 your everything everything in the skin and it looks good 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.030
 clean 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.890
 I only stop when cotton type has 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.650
 white swear 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.019
 who has oily skin knows that he has to 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.239
 treat because otherwise moisturize creates 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.310
 more and good skin thinks you need 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.720
 produce more always gets more 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.410
 valuable people is not that the people 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.060
 would you like 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.340
 But I've never adapted myself to it either. 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.180
 cream no so no gel ever tried 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.720
 the crimes in gel is already tried solution of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.459
 cream even all kinds of crimes 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.500
 Can you imagine I've already tried it on myself 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.900
 worked and then I found a solution 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.540
 miraculous to moisturize the skin I step 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.130
 the liquid with cotton and this 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.319
 hydration that I do the skin looks good 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.000
 well moisturized and this is the best 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.849
 tip that I post for anyone who has skin 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.160
 oily rather true, it left 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.650
 is not going to be producing sebum and 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.690
 It's not a cream so it 'll be a thousand and a half. 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.940
 I think it's pretty silly so I've already cleaned it 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.310
 planned hydrated skin is time for 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.019
 sun protection and I said that already to 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.360
 all my friends so it's a tip 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.889
 What are you going to do? 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.430
 I tested all the producers you can 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.980
 Imagine having in the pharmacy is all 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.889
 all of them all of the same brands 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.100
 dermocosmetics have already done the same and 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:38.160
 best without doubt is that this Minesol 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.019
 mini sun I buy from factor 30 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.940
 but it has factor 70 also for who is 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.889
 more white is that I do not think I 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.290
 I have so much need so I buy a 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.639
 factor even and gave me some news 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.430
 What did you recommend? 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.170
 and it is this leaves the skin really dry I 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.510
 I love this sunscreen. 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.980
 it leaves the skin kind that withstands the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.250
 grease knows 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.230
 and then the makeup part or bed departed 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.930
 Of course, if I go to sleep, I'll stop there. 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.970
 of hydration and if I just woke up 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.000
 I do not take makeup to trade for 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.799
 soap and ends in sunscreen and 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.859
 these are my skin care 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.410
 oily I have to leave the maximum mate 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.019
 possible shine or makeup business 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.269
 nothing because the body dry skin dry dry 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.950
 It is a novelty that the film drama 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.349
 I 'm going to start taking rotan 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.930
 so if you want to know how it goes 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.740
 be an experience with rotan as was the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.360
 process of 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.970
 Okay, I've already done several treatments. 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.699
 is and so does not work 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.520
 because I have here tough and kind 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.410
 This really bothered me a lot. 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.000
 so I'll start taking rocco terror 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.650

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.240
 Can you find it? 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.580
 that keeping a shopkeeper a very 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.440
 strong and I can even make a video with
