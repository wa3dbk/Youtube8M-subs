00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.720
 If you start writing 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:53.370
 Only the part that I wrote with a pen has been responding to the problem here 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.420
 This does not mean that there is a device on the touch pen especially The last feature update function

 Even in Japanese, English may be used like this, and Japanese English 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.610
 I like to play block type but it is often written in a mixed form 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.689
