00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.180
 The evil can not be banal and radical 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.230
 be both 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:18.510
 the evil is never extreme 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.390
 radically deep and radical is always only 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.210
 the good as the new yorker me 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.180
 charged with the court proceedings 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.910
 against adolf eichmann was to report 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.010
 I think that at a process 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.410
 can only be of interest 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.090
 the demand for justice follows 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.220
 to hate the Israeli leadership 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.050
 secret services was illegal 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.190
 israel has the sacred right to a nazi 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.110
 make the crime against that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.519
 Jewish people so short it is very 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:52.979
 important completely different than me 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.729
 The evil has become common 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.739
 as something demonic one considers 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.170
 but you can not do it for the sake of it 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.250
 devilish demonic profundity 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.229
 always just unable to think 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.010
 I am not anti-Semitic what is that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.049
 for a humbug 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.729
 analogous to him on the Leimener please you 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.460
 can not write that not for 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.750
 the new yorker in no case 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.570
 Prosecutor replies to Hannah 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.960
 arendts bizarre defense of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.760
 Eichmann has and this killer as 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.500
 to call a clown no one 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.460
 had his own sake and yet he says 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.979
 it still is 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:38.350
 this phenomenon that I paid for as 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:41.259
 banality of the evil hurricane but you have 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.690
 no love to think of them because 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.610
 articles are great she is braver 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.770
 as the wish you the death 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.350
 some even very imaginative 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.350
 wise we will need bath salts 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.930
 you never accepted that 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.720
 Germans are the most shameful 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.429
 have betrayed they have expelled 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.990
 and they would have killed each other if they did 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.360
 could have done everything possible 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.310
 respect, we recommend yours 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 to give up teaching 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.729
 you will not have enough students 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.729
 who are ready to study 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.030
 there are things 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.030
 this stronger than a single person
