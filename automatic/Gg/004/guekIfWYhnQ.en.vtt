00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
a moment of inspiration as exasperation

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.389 
a moment of inspiration as exasperation
we<00:01:06.690> had<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> price<00:01:07.140> shock<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.680> food<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.310> that's

we had a price shock and food and that's

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.040 
we had a price shock and food and that's
when<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.640> price<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.940> peanut<00:01:09.540> butter<00:01:09.630> almost

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
when the price of peanut butter almost

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.300 
when the price of peanut butter almost
doubled<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.070> thought<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
doubled and I just thought this is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.219 
doubled and I just thought this is
ridiculous<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.450> by<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> machine<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
ridiculous and they go by a machine and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.230 
ridiculous and they go by a machine and
see<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.410> we<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.649> do<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.920> when<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> peanut

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
see if we can do this when the peanut

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
see if we can do this when the peanut
butter<00:01:15.270> idea<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:15.929> first<00:01:16.110> launched<00:01:16.759> nobody

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
butter idea was first launched nobody

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.430 
butter idea was first launched nobody
really<00:01:17.970> knew<00:01:18.179> what<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.720> links<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> what's

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
really knew what kind of links it what's

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.560 
really knew what kind of links it what's
going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.190> wasn't<00:01:20.729> sure<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
going to have I wasn't sure the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.180 
going to have I wasn't sure the
logistics<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.200> how<00:01:22.410> it<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.679> work<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.100> if

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
logistics of it how it would work and if

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.859 
logistics of it how it would work and if
it<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.429> going<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.729> possible<00:01:24.149> I<00:01:24.360> think

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it was going to be possible I think

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
it was going to be possible I think
there<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.020> certainly<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:25.470> skepticism<00:01:26.429> but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
there are certainly some skepticism but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
there are certainly some skepticism but
I<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.360> people<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:28.170> gonna<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.560> least

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I think people know I'm gonna at least

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830 
I think people know I'm gonna at least
try<00:01:28.890> things<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:29.820> happens<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.450> kind

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
try things and see what happens I kind

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.570 
try things and see what happens I kind
of<00:01:30.899> think<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.470> Dan<00:01:32.399> as<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:33.390> mad<00:01:34.289> scientist<00:01:34.979> he

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
of think of Dan as a mad scientist he

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.550 
of think of Dan as a mad scientist he
comes<00:01:36.179> up<00:01:36.300> with<00:01:36.360> all<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.690> these<00:01:36.929> crazy<00:01:37.229> ideas

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
that peanut butter is really not about

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.670 
that peanut butter is really not about
raising<00:04:48.180> money<00:04:48.389> as<00:04:48.660> much<00:04:48.840> as<00:04:48.990> its<00:04:49.229> raising

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
raising money as much as its raising

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.219 
raising money as much as its raising
awareness<00:04:49.800> it's<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.610> tangible<00:04:51.090> symbol<00:04:51.599> of<00:04:51.900> our

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229

awareness it's a tangible symbol of our
mission<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:53.009> this<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.430> certainly<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:54.120> most

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
mission and this is certainly the most

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.450 
mission and this is certainly the most
exciting<00:04:55.020> changes<00:04:55.470> we've<00:04:55.680> had<00:04:55.830> in<00:04:56.039> telling

the<00:04:56.550> story<00:04:56.820> in<00:04:57.090> recent<00:04:57.690> years<00:04:57.780> peanut<00:04:58.470> butter

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
the story in recent years peanut butter

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.140 
the story in recent years peanut butter
is<00:04:58.680> really<00:04:58.979> just<00:04:59.159> the<00:04:59.280> beginning<00:04:59.430> for<00:04:59.789> us<00:04:59.820> I

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
is really just the beginning for us I

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.640 
is really just the beginning for us I
think<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.539> sky<00:05:00.720> is<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.900> limit<00:05:00.990> what<00:05:01.500> we're

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
think the sky is the limit what we're

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.580 
think the sky is the limit what we're
looking<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:01.949> do<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.550> really<00:05:03.389> take<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.870> idea<00:05:04.259> of

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
looking to do is really take the idea of

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.070 
looking to do is really take the idea of
local<00:05:05.039> food<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.610> producing<00:05:06.479> our<00:05:06.630> own<00:05:06.659> food

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
local food and producing our own food

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:17.679 
local food and producing our own food
and<00:05:07.320> expanding<00:05:07.889> on<00:05:08.009> that
