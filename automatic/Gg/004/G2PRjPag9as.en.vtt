whoo<00:00:00.390> right<00:00:00.930> Jill<00:00:01.199> here<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.650> demo<00:00:01.860> very<00:00:02.429> Swift

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
whoo right Jill here to demo very Swift

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.650 
whoo right Jill here to demo very Swift
in<00:00:03.090> one<00:00:03.570> take<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:04.110> hope<00:00:05.060> you<00:00:06.060> need<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> squared

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
in one take I hope you need a squared

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.690 
in one take I hope you need a squared
material<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.200> start<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.890> rectangle<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.519> no

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
material to start with a rectangle is no

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.089 
material to start with a rectangle is no
good<00:00:08.910> it's<00:00:09.030> got<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> square<00:00:09.889> once<00:00:10.889> you've

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
good it's got to be a square once you've

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.280 
good it's got to be a square once you've
cut<00:00:11.280> your<00:00:11.429> square<00:00:11.790> mark<00:00:12.570> across<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.080> diagonal

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
cut your square mark across the diagonal

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.970 
cut your square mark across the diagonal
and<00:00:13.880> cut<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.740> pieces

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
and cut that so that you have two pieces

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.609 
and cut that so that you have two pieces
one<00:00:17.779> over<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> top<00:00:19.699> edge<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:21.090> edge<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.689> so

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
one over the top edge to edge and so

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.970 
one over the top edge to edge and so
caught<00:00:22.980> inch<00:00:23.220> seam<00:00:23.550> along<00:00:23.820> there<00:00:24.289> in<00:00:25.289> order<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
caught inch seam along there in order to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.099 
caught inch seam along there in order to
end<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.939> with<00:00:26.970> another<00:00:27.539> piece<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.960> material

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
end up with another piece of material

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.990 
end up with another piece of material
but<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.710> will<00:00:28.800> all<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> bias<00:00:29.580> then

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
but they will all be on the bias then

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.110 
but they will all be on the bias then
obviously<00:00:30.810> i'm<00:00:31.320> doing<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.820> strict

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
obviously i'm doing this the strict

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.940 
obviously i'm doing this the strict
version<00:00:33.329> which<00:00:33.899> means<00:00:34.170> i'm<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.649> pinning

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
version which means i'm not pinning

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.740 
version which means i'm not pinning
anything<00:00:37.910> when<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> shredder<00:00:39.239> scores

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
anything when the shredder scores

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
anything when the shredder scores
somewhere<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.559> there<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:42.950> okay<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> i'm

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
somewhere up there this okay so i'm

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.700 
somewhere up there this okay so i'm
trying<00:00:45.649> through<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
trying through this

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:59.300 
trying through this
it<00:00:49.670> won't<00:00:50.000> take<00:00:50.649> hope<00:00:51.649> it<00:00:51.800> comes<00:00:51.980> out<00:00:52.250> right

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.610 

and<00:01:00.140> ideally<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:02.130> should<00:01:03.170> reverse<00:01:04.170> across

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
and ideally you should reverse across

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.470 
and ideally you should reverse across
the<00:01:04.800> end<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.190> seams<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.670> solon<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.240> trap

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
the end of the seams in solon to trap

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.060 
the end of the seams in solon to trap
material<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> press

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
do it at this stage it it's a harder

right one quest open theme ok put your
gear<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.390> with<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.260> long<00:01:47.040> edge<00:01:47.250> vertical

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
gear down with the long edge vertical

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
gear down with the long edge vertical
like<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.350> ok<00:01:50.300> what's<00:01:51.470> important<00:01:52.470> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
like that to you ok what's important in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.700 
like that to you ok what's important in
that<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:54.000> feel<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.020> you've<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.380> sewn

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that you have feel that you've just sewn

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
that you have feel that you've just sewn
is<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.550> diagonal<00:01:56.820> down<00:01:57.300> towards<00:01:57.869> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
is going on a diagonal down towards you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.530 
is going on a diagonal down towards you
like<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.490> because<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.910> don't<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
like that because if you don't have it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
like that because if you don't have it
on<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.840> diagonal<00:02:01.369> you're<00:02:02.369> actually<00:02:02.850> not

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
on a diagonal you're actually not

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240 
on a diagonal you're actually not
cutting<00:02:03.630> across<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.110> bias<00:02:04.320> cuz<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.070> don't

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
cutting across the bias cuz you don't

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.450 
cutting across the bias cuz you don't
mean<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.580> then<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.810> mark<00:02:07.080> off<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:08.009> width<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
mean and then you mark off the width of

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.510 
mean and then you mark off the width of
the<00:02:08.880> binding<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.479> want<00:02:10.070> this<00:02:11.070> piece<00:02:11.310> of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the binding you want this piece of

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.630 
the binding you want this piece of
material<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:12.210> just<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.620> score<00:02:14.010> i<00:02:14.070> started

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
material I just have to score i started

material I just have to score i started
with<00:02:14.819> with<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.690> 30<00:02:17.210> centimeter<00:02:18.210> square

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
with with it was 30 centimeter square

off<00:02:24.930> 5<00:02:25.230> centimeter<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.040> can

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.399 

see<00:02:32.370> if<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.849> do<00:02:32.909> it<00:02:33.090> quite<00:02:33.390> big<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> should

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
see if I do it quite big then it should

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.449 
see if I do it quite big then it should
be<00:02:34.439> easy<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.159> to<00:02:35.310> sleep<00:02:35.599> so<00:02:37.310> obviously<00:02:38.310> if

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
be easy for you to sleep so obviously if

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.729 
be easy for you to sleep so obviously if
you<00:02:38.549> have<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> parallel<00:02:39.299> ruler<00:02:39.689> too<00:02:40.170> much<00:02:40.409> much

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
you have a parallel ruler too much much

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.089 
you have a parallel ruler too much much
easier<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:41.459> don't<00:02:42.079> so<00:02:44.989> if<00:02:45.989> i<00:02:46.170> get<00:02:46.409> this<00:02:46.620> vaguely

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
easier I don't so if i get this vaguely

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.640 
easier I don't so if i get this vaguely
straight<00:02:47.730> i<00:02:48.060> don't<00:02:48.930> think<00:02:49.140> i<00:02:49.230> have<00:02:49.470> already

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
straight i don't think i have already

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:58.710 
straight i don't think i have already
actually<00:02:53.180> try<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.209> pin<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.569> down

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.610 

it's<00:02:59.140> one

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.910 

just<00:03:04.220> crying<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.900> know<00:03:06.019> if<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.650> take<00:03:06.890> your

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
just crying you know if you take your

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.430 
just crying you know if you take your
time<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.580> do<00:03:07.819> it<00:03:07.849> right<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.659> it's<00:03:08.840> all<00:03:09.019> nice

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
time and do it right so it's all nice

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.220 
time and do it right so it's all nice
and<00:03:09.830> level<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.430> straight<00:03:10.849> this<00:03:11.840> will<00:03:12.080> work

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
and level and straight this will work

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.680 
and level and straight this will work
beautifully<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:13.069> suspect<00:03:13.760> when<00:03:14.000> i<00:03:14.120> turn<00:03:14.420> my

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
know it's going to be a bit offline just

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.610 
know it's going to be a bit offline just
because<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:19.700> doing<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.180> very<00:03:20.840> strictly<00:03:21.379> like

get<00:03:41.000> something<00:03:41.359> left<00:03:41.750> over<00:03:41.959> because<00:03:42.530> here's

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
get something left over because here's

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.190 
get something left over because here's
one<00:03:43.489> from<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:44.390> square<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:47.180> diagonal<00:03:48.019> of<00:03:48.140> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
square which means the slide as long is

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.880 
square which means the slide as long is
that<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.450> hypotenuse<00:03:51.109> something<00:03:51.560> like<00:03:51.709> that

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
that the hypotenuse something like that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.289 
that the hypotenuse something like that
okay<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.909> pack<00:03:53.150> head<00:03:53.420> rub<00:03:53.690> tummy<00:03:53.900> bit<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:55.299> that

okay the pack head rub tummy bit is that

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.899 
okay the pack head rub tummy bit is that
the<00:03:56.450> first<00:03:56.659> line<00:03:57.109> which<00:03:58.069> I<00:03:58.220> hope<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.579> can<00:03:58.730> see

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
the first line which I hope you can see

the first line which I hope you can see
the<00:03:59.030> marking<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.510> first<00:03:59.750> line<00:04:00.109> you've<00:04:00.319> marked

the marking the first line you've marked

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.940 
the marking the first line you've marked
is<00:04:01.129> going<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.489> come<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.540> seam<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.230> you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
is going to come to the seam that you

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.110 
is going to come to the seam that you
have<00:04:04.159> sown<00:04:04.430> there<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:06.019> next<00:04:06.409> line<00:04:06.880> will<00:04:07.880> join

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
have sown there the next line will join

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.289 
have sown there the next line will join
up<00:04:08.329> with<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.540> next<00:04:08.900> mark<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:10.549> next<00:04:10.910> one<00:04:11.120> and

up with the next mark the next one and

up with the next mark the next one and
so<00:04:11.389> on<00:04:11.660> but<00:04:11.900> when<00:04:12.079> you're<00:04:12.230> turning<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:12.739> over

what you're actually seeing is a cross
