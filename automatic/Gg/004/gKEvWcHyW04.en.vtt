in the air one of the games you chose

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.799 
in the air one of the games you chose
Chicago<00:00:31.400> at<00:00:31.970> Philly<00:00:32.300> a<00:00:32.449> little<00:00:32.509> bit

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
Chicago at Philly a little bit

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.150 
Chicago at Philly a little bit
interesting<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:33.199> chose<00:00:33.440> that<00:00:33.620> game<00:00:33.890> of

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
interesting you chose that game of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.189 
interesting you chose that game of
course<00:00:34.460> got<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.670> really<00:00:35.000> high<00:00:35.120> total<00:00:35.390> Chicago

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
course got a really high total Chicago

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.840 
course got a really high total Chicago
though<00:00:36.320> is<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.470> very<00:00:36.739> vulnerable<00:00:36.920> defense<00:00:37.640> so

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
though is a very vulnerable defense so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.670 
though is a very vulnerable defense so
uh<00:00:37.879> I<00:00:38.269> can<00:00:38.600> understand<00:00:38.960> why<00:00:39.080> that<00:00:39.110> would<00:00:39.530> be

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
uh I can understand why that would be

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.619 
uh I can understand why that would be
you<00:00:40.190> know<00:00:40.280> this<00:00:40.519> Philly<00:00:40.730> bounce<00:00:41.030> back<00:00:41.330> after

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
you know this Philly bounce back after

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.170 
you know this Philly bounce back after
their<00:00:41.960> loss<00:00:42.170> at<00:00:42.650> Minnesota<00:00:43.160> probably<00:00:43.910> I<00:00:44.059> think

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
their loss at Minnesota probably I think

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.670 
their loss at Minnesota probably I think
it's<00:00:44.660> probably<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.050> good<00:00:45.079> bet<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.500> they<00:00:45.620> do

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
it's probably a good bet that they do

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.889 
it's probably a good bet that they do
Jay<00:00:46.610> Cutler<00:00:46.969> is<00:00:47.180> gonna<00:00:47.360> be<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.510> quarterback<00:00:47.780> for

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
Jay Cutler is gonna be a quarterback for

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.750 
Jay Cutler is gonna be a quarterback for
Chicago<00:00:48.379> again<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:48.829> you<00:00:49.190> know<00:00:49.309> he's<00:00:49.520> always

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
Chicago again and you know he's always

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.270 
Chicago again and you know he's always
iffy<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:50.360> Philly<00:00:50.600> minus<00:00:51.110> three<00:00:51.379> at<00:00:51.590> home<00:00:52.100> I

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
iffy so Philly minus three at home I

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.380 
iffy so Philly minus three at home I
think<00:00:52.550> that's<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.850> way<00:00:52.940> I<00:00:52.969> would<00:00:53.090> lean<00:00:53.270> is

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
think that's the way I would lean is

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.020 
think that's the way I would lean is
that<00:00:53.510> what<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.660> like<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.640> yeah<00:00:55.640> that's<00:00:55.879> what

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
I like here you know Philly for me first

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.799 
I like here you know Philly for me first
of<00:00:58.370> all<00:00:58.460> they<00:00:58.579> qualified<00:00:59.000> in<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.329> great<00:00:59.570> late

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
of all they qualified in a great late

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.330 
of all they qualified in a great late
season<00:00:59.840> situation<00:01:00.770> for<00:01:01.010> me

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
season situation for me

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.020 
season situation for me
that's<00:01:01.699> 133<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.870> 70<00:01:03.379> going<00:01:04.160> back<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.460> 1983

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
that's 133 and 70 going back to 1983

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.270 
that's 133 and 70 going back to 1983
with<00:01:05.420> four<00:01:05.630> ties<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:06.110> there<00:01:06.289> so<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.070> great

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
with four ties in there so it's a great

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.669 
with four ties in there so it's a great
situation<00:01:07.490> both<00:01:08.450> teams<00:01:09.020> come<00:01:09.229> in<00:01:09.259> obviously

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
situation both teams come in obviously

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.770 
situation both teams come in obviously
with<00:01:09.890> above-average<00:01:10.490> rushing<00:01:11.060> offenses<00:01:11.539> and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
with above-average rushing offenses and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.900 
with above-average rushing offenses and
above-average<00:01:12.259> passing<00:01:12.830> deep<00:01:12.979> it's<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
above-average passing deep it's a the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.490 
above-average passing deep it's a the
difference<00:01:14.300> though<00:01:14.420> or<00:01:14.690> offenses<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.350> should

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
difference though or offenses I should

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.170 
difference though or offenses I should
say<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.100> difference<00:01:16.460> though<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:16.790> really<00:01:16.970> on

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
say the difference though is really on

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.399 
say the difference though is really on
the<00:01:17.270> defensive<00:01:17.689> side<00:01:17.869> like<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:18.229> said

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
the defensive side like you said

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.230 
the defensive side like you said
Philly's<00:01:19.040> deep<00:01:19.250> inside<00:01:19.549> probably<00:01:19.759> ranked<00:01:20.150> in

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
Philly's deep inside probably ranked in

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.999 
Philly's deep inside probably ranked in
with<00:01:20.360> an<00:01:20.479> average<00:01:20.659> defend<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.320> won<00:01:21.680> against

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
with an average defend I won against

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.600 
with an average defend I won against
them<00:01:22.130> last<00:01:22.280> week<00:01:22.580> I<00:01:22.700> think<00:01:22.759> on<00:01:23.170> these

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
them last week I think on these

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.700 
them last week I think on these
broadcast<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.200> but<00:01:27.200> they<00:01:27.290> were<00:01:27.380> just<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.650> a

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
broadcast and but they were just in a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.560 
broadcast and but they were just in a
bad<00:01:27.950> spot<00:01:28.250> last<00:01:28.549> weekend<00:01:28.909> coming<00:01:29.150> off<00:01:29.299> three

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
bad spot last weekend coming off three

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.719 
bad spot last weekend coming off three
straight<00:01:29.630> home<00:01:29.990> games<00:01:30.229> on<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.680> road<00:01:30.920> Vikings

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
straight home games on the road Vikings

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.090 
straight home games on the road Vikings
were<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.150> good<00:01:32.329> match<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.810> them<00:01:32.960> despite<00:01:33.829> being

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
were a good match to them despite being

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.469 
were a good match to them despite being
really<00:01:34.369> banged<00:01:34.610> up<00:01:34.790> which<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.119> kind<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.390> a

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
really banged up which is kind of a

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.050 
really banged up which is kind of a
surprising<00:01:35.810> game<00:01:36.259> but<00:01:36.619> but<00:01:37.460> their<00:01:37.610> defenses

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
surprising game but but their defenses

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.210 
surprising game but but their defenses
average<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.780> Bears<00:01:39.049> defense<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.650> brutally

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
average the Bears defense is brutally

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.999 
average the Bears defense is brutally
bad<00:01:40.430> get<00:01:40.759> in<00:01:40.909> really<00:01:41.119> bad<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.439> you<00:01:42.770> know<00:01:42.860> we

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
bad get in really bad and so you know we

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.530 
bad get in really bad and so you know we
could<00:01:43.159> stop<00:01:43.430> right<00:01:43.460> now<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.180> they<00:01:44.329> look

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
could stop right now just they look

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.969 
could stop right now just they look
silly<00:01:44.780> playing<00:01:45.110> three<00:01:45.439> points<00:01:45.740> at<00:01:45.860> home

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
silly playing three points at home

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.950 
silly playing three points at home
stealing<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.460> very<00:01:46.700> short<00:01:47.000> number<00:01:47.270> at<00:01:47.360> home<00:01:47.390> you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
stealing a very short number at home you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.660 
stealing a very short number at home you
got<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.140> good<00:01:48.350> team<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.040> they're<00:01:49.369> doing<00:01:49.520> that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
got a good team and they're doing that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.210 
got a good team and they're doing that
against<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.060> very<00:01:50.270> bad<00:01:50.540> defense<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:52.100> know<00:01:52.189> I

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
against a very bad defense I you know I

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.350 
against a very bad defense I you know I
don't<00:01:52.460> know<00:01:52.520> what<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.759> stats<00:01:52.970> are<00:01:53.149> on<00:01:53.210> that

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
don't know what the stats are on that

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.480 
don't know what the stats are on that
but<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:53.570> bet<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:53.899> could<00:01:54.079> win<00:01:54.110> 55<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.920> 60<00:01:55.219> percent

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
but I bet you could win 55 to 60 percent

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.520 
but I bet you could win 55 to 60 percent
of<00:01:55.520> those<00:01:55.610> games<00:01:55.909> just<00:01:56.659> alone<00:01:56.930> just<00:01:57.290> betting

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
of those games just alone just betting

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.410 
of those games just alone just betting
that<00:01:57.560> blindly<00:01:58.100> but<00:01:58.909> you're<00:01:59.000> taking<00:01:59.090> another

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
that blindly but you're taking another

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.969 
that blindly but you're taking another
step<00:01:59.689> further<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.259> know<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.799> Bears

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
step further you know that the Bears

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.440 
step further you know that the Bears
have<00:02:01.070> allowed<00:02:01.369> at<00:02:01.520> least<00:02:01.579> 20<00:02:01.969> points<00:02:02.119> in<00:02:02.299> every

game this year on the road against good

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.819 
game this year on the road against good
offenses<00:02:05.479> they've<00:02:06.020> only<00:02:06.140> played<00:02:06.259> one<00:02:06.619> good

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
offenses they've only played one good

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.380 
offenses they've only played one good
office<00:02:07.130> on<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> road<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.610> year<00:02:07.850> they<00:02:08.209> gave

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
office on the road this year they gave

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
up 40 points in that game and then you

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.180 
up 40 points in that game and then you
got<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.390> Philly<00:02:11.660> defense<00:02:12.049> you<00:02:12.530> know<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:13.040> might

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
got a Philly defense you know it might

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.039 
got a Philly defense you know it might
just<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.430> average<00:02:13.820> but<00:02:14.030> prior<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.660> last<00:02:14.810> week

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
just be average but prior to last week

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.050 
just be average but prior to last week
they'd<00:02:15.470> allowed<00:02:15.739> 21<00:02:16.220> or<00:02:16.370> less<00:02:16.519> in<00:02:16.790> nine

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
they'd allowed 21 or less in nine

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.819 
they'd allowed 21 or less in nine
straight<00:02:17.390> weeks<00:02:17.600> now<00:02:18.079> they<00:02:18.260> haven't<00:02:18.380> really

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
straight weeks now they haven't really

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.349 
straight weeks now they haven't really
played<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.070> ton<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.370> good<00:02:19.549> offenses<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.180> year

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
played a ton of good offenses this year

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.840 
played a ton of good offenses this year
so<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:21.109> would<00:02:21.230> not<00:02:21.380> surprise<00:02:21.590> me<00:02:21.889> if<00:02:22.280> they<00:02:22.459> do

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
so it would not surprise me if they do

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.909 
so it would not surprise me if they do
actually<00:02:23.060> give<00:02:23.750> up<00:02:23.870> more<00:02:24.019> than<00:02:24.079> 21<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.709> week

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:24.919 
actually give up more than 21 this week

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:25.540 
actually give up more than 21 this week
but

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
but

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.790 
but
you<00:02:26.090> know<00:02:26.210> they're<00:02:26.510> just<00:02:26.690> they're<00:02:27.350> they're<00:02:27.650> as

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
you know they're just they're they're as

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.500 
you know they're just they're they're as
good<00:02:28.070> if<00:02:28.190> not<00:02:28.220> better<00:02:28.400> offensively<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.240> think

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
good if not better offensively I think

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.300 
good if not better offensively I think
than<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.660> Bears<00:02:29.960> and<00:02:30.740> they're<00:02:30.920> just<00:02:31.100> much

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
than the Bears and they're just much

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.640 
than the Bears and they're just much
much<00:02:31.550> better<00:02:31.760> defensively<00:02:32.450> in<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:33.290> good<00:02:33.470> spot

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
much better defensively in a good spot

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.960 
much better defensively in a good spot
with<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.980> situation

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
with that situation

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.210 
with that situation
lena<00:02:35.510> short<00:02:35.900> number<00:02:36.140> at<00:02:36.230> home<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.740> even<00:02:36.980> last

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
lena short number at home and even last

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.250 
lena short number at home and even last
week<00:02:37.490> they<00:02:37.640> all<00:02:37.760> gained<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> biking<00:02:38.510> 7.3

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
week they all gained the biking 7.3

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.470 
week they all gained the biking 7.3
yards<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.560> play<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.830> 6.2<00:02:40.370> yards<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.730> play<00:02:40.910> now

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
yards to play the 6.2 yards to play now

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.570 
yards to play the 6.2 yards to play now
there's<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.800> difference<00:02:42.800> in<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> rushing

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
there's a difference in the rushing

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.040 
there's a difference in the rushing
passing<00:02:44.000> ballot<00:02:44.270> there<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.570> kind<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.780> skewed

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
passing ballot there that kind of skewed

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.420 
passing ballot there that kind of skewed
those<00:02:45.140> numbers<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.500> little<00:02:45.620> bit<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.370> they

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
those numbers a little bit but they

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.280 
those numbers a little bit but they
moved<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.820> ball<00:02:46.940> last<00:02:47.210> week<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.630> just<00:02:48.110> think

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
moved the ball last week I just think

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.780 
moved the ball last week I just think
lanes<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.590> short<00:02:48.830> number<00:02:49.010> gets<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.430> really<00:02:49.580> bad

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
lanes a short number gets a really bad

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.240 
lanes a short number gets a really bad
defense<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.630> quite<00:02:51.230> frankly<00:02:51.440> I'd<00:02:51.950> probably

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
defense and quite frankly I'd probably

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.650 
defense and quite frankly I'd probably
be<00:02:52.460> more<00:02:52.640> worried<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.120> game<00:02:53.300> if<00:02:53.510> the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
be more worried in this game if the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.870 
be more worried in this game if the
colonists<00:02:54.110> playing<00:02:54.320> versus<00:02:54.650> Cutler<00:02:55.220> don't

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
colonists playing versus Cutler don't

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.430 
colonists playing versus Cutler don't
trust<00:02:56.120> Cutler<00:02:56.480> when<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.750> need<00:02:56.870> them<00:02:56.960> the<00:02:57.080> most

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
trust Cutler when you need them the most

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.140 
trust Cutler when you need them the most
I'll<00:02:57.920> lay<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.250> points<00:02:58.520> too<00:02:58.670> short<00:02:58.880> Deborah

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
I'll lay the points too short Deborah

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.000 
I'll lay the points too short Deborah
against<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.450> bad<00:02:59.600> defense<00:02:59.990> now<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.500> agree<00:03:00.920> that

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
against the bad defense now I agree that

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.800 
against the bad defense now I agree that
the<00:03:01.250> Cutler<00:03:01.520> starting<00:03:01.940> makes<00:03:02.120> me<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.720> know

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the Cutler starting makes me you know

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.930 
the Cutler starting makes me you know
