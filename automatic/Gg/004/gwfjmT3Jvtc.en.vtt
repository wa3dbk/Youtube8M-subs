00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
at University where I was really doing

conceptual art but got slightly

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.200 
conceptual art but got slightly
frustrated<00:00:24.980> by<00:00:25.130> that<00:00:25.160> moved<00:00:25.669> into<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.029> film

frustrated by that moved into the film

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.509 
frustrated by that moved into the film
industry<00:00:26.329> straight<00:00:26.900> after<00:00:27.320> college<00:00:27.829> had

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
industry straight after college had

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.460 
industry straight after college had
about<00:00:28.789> four<00:00:28.999> years<00:00:29.240> working<00:00:29.509> on<00:00:29.749> big<00:00:30.079> feature

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
about four years working on big feature

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.280 
about four years working on big feature
films<00:00:30.919> which<00:00:31.159> was<00:00:31.339> great<00:00:31.579> really<00:00:32.180> fun

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
films which was great really fun

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.970 
films which was great really fun
exciting<00:00:33.610> stimulating<00:00:34.610> but<00:00:34.910> wasn't<00:00:35.270> actually

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
exciting stimulating but wasn't actually

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.260 
exciting stimulating but wasn't actually
that<00:00:36.980> creatively<00:00:37.670> rewarding<00:00:38.800> personally

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
that creatively rewarding personally

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.139 
that creatively rewarding personally
because<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:41.390> know<00:00:41.480> you<00:00:41.539> were<00:00:41.719> a<00:00:41.750> small<00:00:42.469> ant<00:00:43.149> in

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
because you know you were a small ant in

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.799 
because you know you were a small ant in
a<00:00:44.239> big<00:00:44.420> machine<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.260> know<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:46.329> you<00:00:47.329> sort<00:00:47.570> of

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.110 

yeah<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:50.989> suppose<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.500> wasn't<00:00:52.039> I'm<00:00:52.250> finding

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
yeah I suppose I wasn't I'm finding

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.229 
yeah I suppose I wasn't I'm finding
myself<00:00:53.239> able<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.960> really<00:00:55.090> be<00:00:56.090> creative

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
myself able to really be creative

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.069 
myself able to really be creative
day-to-day<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.559> that's<00:00:58.429> when<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:58.789> was<00:00:59.629> starting

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
day-to-day so that's when I was starting

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.229 
day-to-day so that's when I was starting
to<00:01:00.109> think<00:01:00.589> more<00:01:00.769> about<00:01:00.829> doing<00:01:01.760> photography

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
to think more about doing photography

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.439 
to think more about doing photography
and<00:01:02.510> then<00:01:03.250> documentary<00:01:04.250> photography<00:01:04.730> really

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
and then documentary photography really

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.190 
and then documentary photography really
became<00:01:05.930> quite<00:01:06.500> a<00:01:06.530> clear<00:01:07.400> path<00:01:08.000> or<00:01:08.390> something

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
became quite a clear path or something

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.719 
became quite a clear path or something
made<00:01:09.410> a<00:01:09.440> lot<00:01:09.620> of<00:01:09.680> sense<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.010> me<00:01:10.189> because<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.610> was

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
made a lot of sense to me because it was

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.810 
made a lot of sense to me because it was
a<00:01:10.759> way<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.530> being<00:01:12.530> out<00:01:12.770> in<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:12.950> world<00:01:13.159> learning

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
a way of being out in the world learning

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.420 
a way of being out in the world learning
from<00:01:14.060> people<00:01:14.350> always<00:01:15.350> doing<00:01:16.159> different

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
from people always doing different

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.630 
from people always doing different
things<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:18.070> also<00:01:19.070> expressing<00:01:19.520> myself

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
things and also expressing myself

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.840 
things and also expressing myself
creatively<00:01:20.150> as<00:01:20.329> well

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.460 

I<00:01:25.909> suppose<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.900> natural<00:01:28.540> instinct<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.750> so

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
I suppose it's a natural instinct and so

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.380 
I suppose it's a natural instinct and so
I<00:01:30.799> look<00:01:31.009> for<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.400> stories<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:31.880> speak<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.240> me

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
I look for the stories that speak to me

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.140 
I look for the stories that speak to me
and<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:32.960> feel<00:01:33.380> interesting<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.100> me<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.460> it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
and that feel interesting to me and it

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.609 
and that feel interesting to me and it
just<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:35.420> happens<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:36.110> always<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
just so happens that that always is the

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.440 
just so happens that that always is the
smaller<00:01:36.860> ones<00:01:37.100> because<00:01:37.490> they're<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.270> ones

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
smaller ones because they're the ones

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.139 
smaller ones because they're the ones
that<00:01:38.899> you<00:01:39.049> can<00:01:39.200> actually<00:01:39.580> feel<00:01:40.580> like<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:40.939> have

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
that you can actually feel like you have

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.530 
that you can actually feel like you have
some<00:01:42.369> response<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.520> if<00:01:43.580> something's<00:01:43.940> huge<00:01:44.299> and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
some response to if something's huge and

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.090 
some response to if something's huge and
you're<00:01:44.600> told<00:01:44.869> about<00:01:45.020> some<00:01:45.320> big<00:01:45.500> issue<00:01:45.680> it's

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
you're told about some big issue it's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.999 
you're told about some big issue it's
just<00:01:46.700> like<00:01:47.270> either<00:01:47.899> another<00:01:48.140> news<00:01:48.500> item<00:01:48.680> or

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
just like either another news item or

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.130 
just like either another news item or
it's<00:01:49.549> just<00:01:49.759> sort<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:49.970> it's<00:01:50.330> too<00:01:50.509> large<00:01:50.690> to

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
it's just sort of it's too large to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.649 
it's just sort of it's too large to
fathom<00:01:51.619> or<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.039> process<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.330> said

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
fathom or to process and so said

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.950 
fathom or to process and so said
definitely<00:01:54.289> my<00:01:54.649> way<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:55.270> getting<00:01:56.270> involved<00:01:56.840> or

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
definitely my way of getting involved or

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.840 
definitely my way of getting involved or
trying<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.229> think<00:01:57.500> about<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:58.069> larger<00:01:58.550> issue<00:01:58.670> is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
trying to think about a larger issue is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.639 
trying to think about a larger issue is
through<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.240> smaller<00:01:59.539> story<00:01:59.869> or<00:02:00.050> a<00:02:00.140> smaller<00:02:00.409> set

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
through a smaller story or a smaller set

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.820 
through a smaller story or a smaller set
of<00:02:00.679> people<00:02:01.130> because<00:02:01.909> that's<00:02:02.090> when<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.479> really

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
of people because that's when it really

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.949 
of people because that's when it really
seems<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.890> activate<00:02:04.310> something<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.700> my<00:02:04.819> mind

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.830 

I've<00:02:10.560> always<00:02:10.860> seen<00:02:11.280> taking<00:02:12.239> photographs<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I've always seen taking photographs and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.960 
I've always seen taking photographs and
documentary<00:02:13.379> about<00:02:13.439> as<00:02:14.280> being<00:02:14.549> sort<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:14.909> an

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
documentary about as being sort of an

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.119 
documentary about as being sort of an
extension<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.540> who<00:02:16.409> I<00:02:16.530> am<00:02:16.709> or<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.010> do

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
extension of who I am or what I do

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.089 
extension of who I am or what I do
anyway<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.170> for<00:02:19.170> me<00:02:19.260> finding<00:02:19.530> stories<00:02:19.799> has

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
anyway so for me finding stories has

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.280 
anyway so for me finding stories has
always<00:02:20.250> been<00:02:20.579> through<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.329> my<00:02:21.750> life<00:02:21.930> rather

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
always been through just my life rather

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.740 
always been through just my life rather
than<00:02:22.439> I<00:02:22.829> don't<00:02:23.129> go<00:02:23.459> through<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.120> newspapers

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
than I don't go through the newspapers

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.899 
than I don't go through the newspapers
and<00:02:24.989> look<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.500> interesting<00:02:26.040> stories<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.790> I

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
and look for interesting stories like I

thought oh god this this would actually

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.960 
thought oh god this this would actually
make<00:04:01.590> something<00:04:01.859> really<00:04:01.979> interesting<00:04:02.549> and

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
make something really interesting and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.699 
make something really interesting and
then<00:04:03.090> as<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.599> result<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.139> I've<00:04:04.260> gone<00:04:04.530> back

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
as far as I can see that that's the main

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
issue with it and then going further I

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.430 
issue with it and then going further I
mean<00:05:31.889> there's<00:05:32.099> so<00:05:32.250> many<00:05:32.400> women<00:05:33.169> who<00:05:34.169> are<00:05:34.199> not

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520

photographers but who are in the
photographic<00:05:36.150> industry<00:05:36.510> so<00:05:37.349> there's<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.620> lot

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
photographic industry so there's a lot

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.909 
photographic industry so there's a lot
of<00:05:38.039> power<00:05:38.340> female<00:05:39.330> power<00:05:39.599> within<00:05:40.320> the

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
of power female power within the

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.450
