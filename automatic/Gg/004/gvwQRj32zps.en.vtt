farm<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.560> I've<00:00:16.619> got<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> quick<00:00:17.070> video<00:00:17.279> here<00:00:17.670> for

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
farm and I've got a quick video here for

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.910 
farm and I've got a quick video here for
you<00:00:18.000> today<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:19.080> some<00:00:19.260> reason<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.650> bunch<00:00:19.830> of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
you today for some reason a bunch of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.500 
you today for some reason a bunch of
people<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.279> been<00:00:20.340> asking<00:00:20.609> me<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> make<00:00:21.090> an

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
people have been asking me to make an

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.279 
people have been asking me to make an
anvil<00:00:21.949> dispenser<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:25.019> couple

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
anvil dispenser so I have a couple

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.070 
anvil dispenser so I have a couple
really<00:00:25.710> simple<00:00:26.310> designs<00:00:26.670> for<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.830> ideally

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
really simple designs for you ideally

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.139 
really simple designs for you ideally
the<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:32.040> way<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> would<00:00:32.399> want<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.730> build<00:00:32.910> this

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the the way I would want to build this

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.740 
the the way I would want to build this
is<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.200> an<00:00:34.620> anvil<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.760> bud<00:00:36.360> switch<00:00:36.510> in

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is to have an anvil on a bud switch in

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.790 
is to have an anvil on a bud switch in
the<00:00:36.840> ground<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.500> would<00:00:37.710> basically<00:00:38.100> count<00:00:39.800> or

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the ground that would basically count or

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.760 
the ground that would basically count or
it<00:00:41.670> would<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:42.600> activate<00:00:43.170> every<00:00:43.379> time

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it would it would activate every time

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.069 
it would it would activate every time
the<00:00:44.100> anvil<00:00:44.489> changed<00:00:44.879> state<00:00:45.090> from<00:00:45.480> New<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the anvil changed state from New to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
the anvil changed state from New to
slightly<00:00:46.350> damaged<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.280> damaged<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
slightly damaged to very damaged to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.330 
slightly damaged to very damaged to
broken<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.379> could<00:00:49.590> attach<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
broken and then you could attach that to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.760 
broken and then you could attach that to
a<00:00:50.489> counter<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.090> some<00:00:51.329> sort<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:52.199> an<00:00:52.320> RS<00:00:52.590> nor

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
a counter of some sort like an RS nor

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.670 
a counter of some sort like an RS nor
latch<00:00:52.829> array<00:00:53.340> where<00:00:53.789> by<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> time<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
latch array where by the time it got to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.369 
latch array where by the time it got to
the<00:00:55.770> broken<00:00:56.129> state<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.239> activate<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the broken state that would activate the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.130 
the broken state that would activate the
dispenser<00:00:59.190> again<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.760> drop<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> new<00:01:00.510> anvil<00:01:00.930> for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
dispenser again and drop a new anvil for

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.959 
dispenser again and drop a new anvil for
you'd<00:01:01.320> never<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> push<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> button<00:01:02.340> now

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you'd never have to push a button now

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.310 
you'd never have to push a button now
the<00:01:03.030> problem<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.600> there<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> couple

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the problem with that there are a couple

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.010 
the problem with that there are a couple
things<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.450> may<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.689> noticed

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
things actually one you may have noticed

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.760 
things actually one you may have noticed
that<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.320> anvil<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.220> fell<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:10.140> took

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that this anvil just fell and it took

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.880 
that this anvil just fell and it took
damage<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> fell<00:01:12.119> which<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:13.140> change<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
damage as it fell which would change the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
damage as it fell which would change the
state<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.430> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> throw<00:01:15.330> off<00:01:15.509> your<00:01:15.540> counter

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
state and kind of throw off your counter

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.340 
state and kind of throw off your counter
if<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.500> were<00:01:16.619> doing<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.950> automated<00:01:17.430> so

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
if you were doing this automated so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.920 
if you were doing this automated so
let's<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:19.650> another<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:22.250> see<00:01:23.930> so

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
let's put another one in here and see so

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
let's put another one in here and see so
that<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.259> didn't<00:01:25.530> take<00:01:25.680> damage<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.790> don't

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that one didn't take damage so I I don't

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
that one didn't take damage so I I don't
know<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> percentage<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.950> seems<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
know what the percentage is it seems to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
know what the percentage is it seems to
be<00:01:29.369> about<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.210> four<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:31.229> don't<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.890> if

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
be about one in four I don't know if

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.440 
be about one in four I don't know if
that's<00:01:32.159> intentional<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.030> either<00:01:33.270> but

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that's intentional or not either but

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.740 
that's intentional or not either but
that's<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.320> how<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> moment<00:01:35.750> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
that's just how it is at the moment and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.539 
that's just how it is at the moment and
you<00:01:36.810> compile<00:01:37.619> these<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.159> high<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.460> want

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you compile these up as high as you want

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.420 
you compile these up as high as you want
obviously<00:01:39.180> want<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> hide<00:01:39.780> them<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:41.159> hill<00:01:41.400> or

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
obviously want to hide them in a hill or

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.980 
obviously want to hide them in a hill or
something<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> don't<00:01:42.780> see

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
something like that so you don't see

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
something like that so you don't see
this<00:01:43.170> big<00:01:43.380> chimney<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> couple

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
this big chimney but there are a couple

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
this big chimney but there are a couple
designs<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.860> them<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.040> very<00:01:47.790> simple<00:01:49.070> but

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
designs one of them is very simple but

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.490 
designs one of them is very simple but
it<00:01:50.250> requires<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.909> place<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.540> button<00:01:51.899> up

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it requires you to place the button up

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.850 
it requires you to place the button up
next<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.340> where<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.329> piston<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.649> both<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
next to where the piston is like both of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
next to where the piston is like both of
these<00:01:56.100> designs<00:01:56.549> these<00:01:57.090> are<00:01:57.240> basically<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
these designs these are basically the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.539 
these designs these are basically the
same<00:01:57.810> design<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> put<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.159> wall<00:01:59.369> behind

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
same design just one I put a wall behind

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.260 
same design just one I put a wall behind
it<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:01.049> other<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.700> allows<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> place<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it the other one allows you to place the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.789 
it the other one allows you to place the
button<00:02:03.479> wherever<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.869> want<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.469> takes<00:02:04.649> a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
button wherever you want but it takes a

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.280 
button wherever you want but it takes a
lot<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:04.979> redstone<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.509> will<00:02:06.930> show<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.170> how

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
lot more redstone so I will show you how

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.779 
lot more redstone so I will show you how
to<00:02:07.409> build<00:02:07.619> both<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.069> them

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to build both of them

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.130 
to build both of them
and<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.090> hope<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.719> enjoy<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:11.360> all<00:02:12.360> right<00:02:13.019> I'm

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and I hope you enjoy it all right I'm

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.780 
and I hope you enjoy it all right I'm
going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.319> show<00:02:13.469> you<00:02:13.530> how<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.739> do<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.159> simple

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
going to show you how to do the simple

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.380 
going to show you how to do the simple
design<00:02:15.090> first<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:16.290> want<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> pile<00:02:17.250> up<00:02:17.549> like

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
design first you want to pile up like

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.589 
design first you want to pile up like
three<00:02:18.780> blocks<00:02:18.930> or<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.790> believe<00:02:20.790> an<00:02:21.209> anvil

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
three blocks or so I believe an anvil

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.009 
three blocks or so I believe an anvil
will<00:02:21.959> take<00:02:22.459> damage<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.060> drop<00:02:24.359> it<00:02:24.540> from<00:02:24.689> too

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
will take damage if you drop it from too

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.940 
will take damage if you drop it from too
high<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.680> place<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:27.450> know<00:02:27.950> recommend

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
high of a place so I you know recommend

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.569 
high of a place so I you know recommend
being<00:02:29.519> careful<00:02:29.970> with<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.920> on<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.370> block

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
being careful with that on the block

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.849 
being careful with that on the block
underneath<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.359> piston<00:02:33.720> behind<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.680> want

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
underneath the piston behind it you want

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.160 
underneath the piston behind it you want
to<00:02:34.920> put<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.099> redstone<00:02:35.400> torch<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.689> then<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> block

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
to put a redstone torch and then a block

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.759 
to put a redstone torch and then a block
above<00:02:37.439> it<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:39.139> you<00:02:40.139> want<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.379> put<00:02:40.469> a<00:02:40.500> button

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
above it and you want to put a button

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.509 
above it and you want to put a button
here<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.689> what<00:02:42.689> that<00:02:42.870> will<00:02:42.989> do<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.409> cause<00:02:44.099> this

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
here and what that will do is cause this

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.970 
here and what that will do is cause this
to<00:02:44.790> pulse<00:02:45.120> really<00:02:45.569> quickly<00:02:45.989> now<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.739> reason

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
to pulse really quickly now the reason

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.890 
to pulse really quickly now the reason
this<00:02:47.220> works<00:02:47.609> is<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:50.129> button<00:02:50.430> is

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
this works is that the button is

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.440 
this works is that the button is
retracting<00:02:52.519> it's<00:02:53.519> turning<00:02:53.849> off<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.000> torch

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
retracting it's turning off the torch

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.069 
retracting it's turning off the torch
and<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:55.139> not<00:02:55.319> activating<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.010> piston<00:02:56.430> until

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
and it's not activating the piston until

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.619 
and it's not activating the piston until
both<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.439> button<00:02:58.769> pop<00:02:59.310> back<00:02:59.519> open<00:02:59.939> and<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
both the button pop back open and the

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.369 
both the button pop back open and the
light<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.560> redstone<00:03:01.919> torch<00:03:02.250> turns<00:03:02.819> back<00:03:03.090> on

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
light the redstone torch turns back on

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.720 
light the redstone torch turns back on
so<00:03:04.379> that's<00:03:04.859> the<00:03:05.010> reason<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.430> difference

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
so that's the reason the difference

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.580 
so that's the reason the difference
between<00:03:05.879> those<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.329> like<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.989> tick<00:03:07.290> or<00:03:07.319> two

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
between those is like a tick or two

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.330 
between those is like a tick or two
right<00:03:07.859> so<00:03:08.129> it<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.519> causes<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:09.000> pulse<00:03:10.010> if<00:03:11.010> I

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
right so it just causes a pulse if I

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.300 
right so it just causes a pulse if I
were<00:03:11.669> to<00:03:12.470> let's<00:03:13.470> say<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.680> wanted<00:03:13.919> to<00:03:14.040> put<00:03:14.220> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
were to let's say I wanted to put the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.309 
were to let's say I wanted to put the
button<00:03:14.489> somewhere<00:03:15.120> else<00:03:17.389> like<00:03:18.389> right<00:03:18.720> here<00:03:21.319> it

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
button somewhere else like right here it

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.990 
button somewhere else like right here it
wouldn't<00:03:22.650> work<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.010> same<00:03:23.190> way<00:03:23.250> see<00:03:23.790> how<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
wouldn't work the same way see how the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.110 
wouldn't work the same way see how the
piston<00:03:24.810> stayed<00:03:25.049> open<00:03:25.229> for<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:26.489> know<00:03:26.609> a<00:03:26.790> normal

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
piston stayed open for you know a normal

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.899 
piston stayed open for you know a normal
piston<00:03:27.720> length<00:03:28.159> so<00:03:29.159> you<00:03:29.250> want<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.579> do<00:03:29.669> it<00:03:29.790> like

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
piston length so you want to do it like

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.960 
piston length so you want to do it like
this<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.139> time<00:03:31.560> between<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.669> button

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
this so that the time between the button

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.129 
this so that the time between the button
pulling<00:03:33.269> out<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.599> light<00:03:33.750> turning<00:03:33.959> back

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
pulling out and the light turning back

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.860 
pulling out and the light turning back
on<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.530> quick<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.090> piston<00:03:36.540> will<00:03:36.690> do<00:03:36.840> a

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
on is quick so that the piston will do a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.170 
on is quick so that the piston will do a
quick<00:03:36.989> pulse<00:03:37.440> now<00:03:38.400> if<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.639> really<00:03:39.000> want<00:03:39.150> to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
quick pulse now if you really want to

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.080 
quick pulse now if you really want to
have<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.449> button<00:03:40.370> somewhere<00:03:41.370> else<00:03:41.699> I<00:03:41.940> will

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
have the button somewhere else I will

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.539 
have the button somewhere else I will
show<00:03:42.269> you<00:03:42.329> how<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.659> do<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.019> by<00:03:43.739> integrating<00:03:44.459> a

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
show you how to do that by integrating a

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.189 
show you how to do that by integrating a
normal<00:03:44.940> quick<00:03:45.449> pulse<00:03:46.250> into<00:03:47.690> into<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.810> design

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
normal quick pulse into into the design

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.879 
normal quick pulse into into the design
so<00:03:50.069> what<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.639> want<00:03:50.819> to<00:03:50.940> do<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.590> put<00:03:52.590> an<00:03:52.680> anvil

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
so what you want to do is put an anvil

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.800 
so what you want to do is put an anvil
on<00:03:53.159> top<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.669> and<00:03:53.699> you're<00:03:54.090> actually<00:03:54.329> ready

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
on top of it and you're actually ready

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.170 
on top of it and you're actually ready
so<00:03:55.229> you<00:03:55.290> want<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.590> clean<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.979> place<00:03:56.159> up<00:03:56.189> a<00:03:56.489> bit

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.729 

alright<00:04:00.180> well<00:04:00.359> put<00:04:00.389> some<00:04:00.810> stairs<00:04:01.109> under<00:04:01.439> here

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
alright well put some stairs under here

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.640 
alright well put some stairs under here
to<00:04:01.859> make<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.189> look<00:04:02.430> nice<00:04:02.699> and<00:04:04.430> let's<00:04:05.430> see

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
to make it look nice and let's see

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.240 
to make it look nice and let's see
something<00:04:07.650> like<00:04:08.269> this<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.739> course<00:04:10.769> we<00:04:11.099> can

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
something like this and of course we can

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.199 
something like this and of course we can
do<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.459> same<00:04:11.669> on<00:04:11.699> the<00:04:11.939> back<00:04:12.150> side<00:04:12.359> as<00:04:12.569> well<00:04:14.090> now

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
do the same on the back side as well now

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.539 
do the same on the back side as well now
you're<00:04:17.209> going<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.690> want<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.110> put<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.860> anvil

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
you're going to want to put the anvil

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.340 
you're going to want to put the anvil
right<00:04:20.060> on<00:04:20.209> top<00:04:20.420> of<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.660> block<00:04:20.870> that's

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
right on top of the block that's

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.250 
right on top of the block that's
connected<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.490> piston<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.020> then<00:04:24.020> you

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
connected to the piston and then you

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.320 
connected to the piston and then you
know<00:04:24.380> you'll<00:04:24.650> stack<00:04:25.010> them<00:04:25.190> up<00:04:25.310> as<00:04:25.970> high<00:04:26.150> as<00:04:26.180> you

know you'll stack them up as high as you

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.300 
know you'll stack them up as high as you
want<00:04:26.590> but<00:04:27.590> you're<00:04:27.770> probably<00:04:27.980> going<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.220> want

more<00:04:36.170> redstone<00:04:36.500> intensive<00:04:37.190> design<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:38.270> one

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
more redstone intensive design this one

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.610 
more redstone intensive design this one
allows<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.840> place<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.170> button<00:04:39.440> wherever

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
allows you to place the button wherever

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.500 
allows you to place the button wherever
you<00:04:39.830> want<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.840> can<00:04:41.840> also<00:04:42.700> have<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:44.030> anvil

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
you want and you can also have the anvil

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.780 
you want and you can also have the anvil
drop<00:04:44.810> against<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.380> wall<00:04:45.590> flush<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.490> or

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
drop against the wall flush like that or

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.180 
drop against the wall flush like that or
you<00:04:47.540> have<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.960> block<00:04:48.350> away<00:04:48.530> if<00:04:48.980> you<00:04:49.160> just

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
you have it a block away if you just

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.890 
you have it a block away if you just
break<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:50.480> block<00:04:50.720> in<00:04:51.020> front<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:52.900> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
break the block in front of the the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.050 
break the block in front of the the
block<00:04:54.170> in<00:04:54.350> front<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.650> piston<00:04:55.010> ok<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:55.820> I've

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
block in front of the piston ok so I've

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.610 
block in front of the piston ok so I've
cleared<00:04:56.390> everything<00:04:56.720> away<00:04:56.990> let's<00:04:57.410> show<00:04:57.560> you

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
cleared everything away let's show you

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.980 
cleared everything away let's show you
how<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.860> build<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.850> first<00:04:59.270> obviously<00:04:59.780> if

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
how to build it so first obviously if

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.540 
how to build it so first obviously if
you<00:05:00.110> want<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.380> room<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.680> look<00:05:00.800> like<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:01.220> you

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
you want the room to look like this you

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.850 
you want the room to look like this you
know<00:05:01.670> you<00:05:02.060> can<00:05:02.210> build<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.660> 3<00:05:02.870> by<00:05:02.990> 3<00:05:03.020> wall<00:05:03.530> and

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
know you can build a 3 by 3 wall and

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.930 
know you can build a 3 by 3 wall and
then<00:05:04.490> go<00:05:05.090> you<00:05:05.930> know<00:05:06.020> zigzag<00:05:06.650> some<00:05:07.250> blocks<00:05:07.550> and

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
then go you know zigzag some blocks and

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.210 
then go you know zigzag some blocks and
you're<00:05:08.390> going<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.570> put<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.170> piston<00:05:09.740> or<00:05:10.070> the

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
you're going to put the piston or the

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.730 
you're going to put the piston or the
button<00:05:10.550> right<00:05:11.210> about<00:05:11.360> here<00:05:11.750> if<00:05:11.930> you're<00:05:12.470> doing

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
button right about here if you're doing

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.400 
button right about here if you're doing
the<00:05:13.400> flush<00:05:13.940> design<00:05:14.330> it'll<00:05:14.630> land<00:05:14.810> here<00:05:15.170> if<00:05:15.290> you

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
the flush design it'll land here if you

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.230 
the flush design it'll land here if you
do<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.710> other<00:05:15.860> design<00:05:16.250> it'll<00:05:16.580> land<00:05:16.760> here

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
do the other design it'll land here

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.970 
do the other design it'll land here
let's<00:05:17.540> do<00:05:17.750> this<00:05:17.930> one<00:05:18.140> just<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.530> show<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.740> how

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
let's do this one just to show you how

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.390 
let's do this one just to show you how
so<00:05:19.910> underneath<00:05:20.750> this<00:05:21.110> button<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:21.980> want<00:05:22.190> to

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
so underneath this button you want to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.540 
so underneath this button you want to
have<00:05:22.550> an<00:05:22.700> open<00:05:22.820> block<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:24.800> need<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.310> place

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
have an open block and you need to place

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.860 
have an open block and you need to place
a<00:05:25.580> redstone<00:05:25.850> on<00:05:26.419> top<00:05:27.080> of<00:05:27.260> that<00:05:27.470> underneath<00:05:28.870> by

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
a redstone on top of that underneath by

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.760 
a redstone on top of that underneath by
the<00:05:29.930> way<00:05:30.140> this<00:05:30.560> is<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:32.770> design<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.800> used<00:05:34.370> for<00:05:34.640> my

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
the way this is the design I used for my

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.110 
the way this is the design I used for my
massive<00:05:36.770> cocoa<00:05:37.130> bean<00:05:37.280> farm<00:05:37.580> for<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:37.940> quick

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
massive cocoa bean farm for the quick

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.630 
massive cocoa bean farm for the quick
pulse<00:05:38.390> so<00:05:38.810> I'm<00:05:39.620> sure<00:05:39.830> there<00:05:39.980> are<00:05:40.010> much<00:05:40.430> more

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
pulse so I'm sure there are much more

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.510 
pulse so I'm sure there are much more
efficient<00:05:41.120> ways<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:41.840> do<00:05:42.350> this<00:05:42.380> but<00:05:42.770> this<00:05:43.340> is

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
efficient ways to do this but this is

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.830 
efficient ways to do this but this is
just<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.940> one<00:05:44.060> I<00:05:44.090> happen<00:05:44.450> to<00:05:44.480> know<00:05:44.570> off<00:05:44.810> the

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
just the one I happen to know off the

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.350 
just the one I happen to know off the
top<00:05:44.960> of<00:05:45.140> my<00:05:45.260> head<00:05:45.350> so<00:05:46.340> you<00:05:46.400> want<00:05:46.580> a<00:05:46.790> repeater<00:05:47.180> in

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
top of my head so you want a repeater in

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.909 
top of my head so you want a repeater in
front<00:05:47.570> of<00:05:47.630> that<00:05:47.750> block<00:05:47.990> then<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.500> block<00:05:48.770> in

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
front of that block then a block in

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.470 
front of that block then a block in
front<00:05:49.130> of<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.340> then<00:05:49.580> another<00:05:49.820> repeater<00:05:50.240> and

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
front of it then another repeater and

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.970 
front of it then another repeater and
you<00:05:50.720> need<00:05:50.840> to<00:05:50.930> put<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:51.230> on<00:05:51.290> the<00:05:51.530> third<00:05:51.800> or

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
you need to put that on the third or

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.480 
you need to put that on the third or
fourth<00:05:52.280> tick<00:05:52.550> otherwise<00:05:53.150> it<00:05:53.330> won't<00:05:53.480> work<00:05:54.490> and

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
fourth tick otherwise it won't work and

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.240 
fourth tick otherwise it won't work and
another<00:05:56.180> block<00:05:56.450> in<00:05:56.600> front<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.070> you<00:05:58.070> want

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
another block in front of that you want

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.400 
another block in front of that you want
a<00:05:58.340> redstone<00:05:58.669> torch<00:05:58.910> right<00:05:59.360> here<00:05:59.810> and<00:05:59.960> you<00:05:59.990> need

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
a redstone torch right here and you need

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.530 
a redstone torch right here and you need
to<00:06:00.560> loop<00:06:00.800> it<00:06:00.950> back<00:06:01.270> to<00:06:02.710> reactivate<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:03.980> signal

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
to loop it back to reactivate the signal

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.500 
to loop it back to reactivate the signal
we're<00:06:05.540> going<00:06:05.660> to<00:06:05.720> carry<00:06:06.020> this<00:06:06.169> up<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:07.510> the

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
we're going to carry this up to the

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.409 
we're going to carry this up to the
piston<00:06:08.960> directly<00:06:09.410> that<00:06:10.340> needs<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.700> be<00:06:10.820> a<00:06:11.030> block

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
piston directly that needs to be a block

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.159 
piston directly that needs to be a block
back<00:06:11.690> from<00:06:12.260> the<00:06:12.500> wall<00:06:13.390> so<00:06:14.390> that<00:06:14.419> when<00:06:14.930> you<00:06:15.020> put

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
back from the wall so that when you put

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:16.450 
back from the wall so that when you put
a<00:06:15.200> block<00:06:15.410> in<00:06:15.560> front<00:06:15.590> of<00:06:15.830> it<00:06:15.950> will<00:06:16.070> be<00:06:16.160> flush

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
a block in front of it will be flush

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.100 
a block in front of it will be flush
with<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.730> wall<00:06:16.850> and<00:06:19.030> you<00:06:20.030> need<00:06:20.210> to<00:06:20.390> put<00:06:20.930> some

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
with the wall and you need to put some

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.780
