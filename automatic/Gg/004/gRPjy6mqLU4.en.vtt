00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 good 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.349
 or guys trying my youtube 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.329
 name is rachel expressed and good guys 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.919
 Well, we have a new video in this case 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.509
 it's going to be a very, very fast way and 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.340
 very simple that many reach 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.169
 be annoyed for a while but 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.789
 I want to attract him as well because they have 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.169
 followed many tutorials of this one but 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.059
 I always repeat that I want to have my 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.409
 own modes already uploaded to the channel in 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.030
 this case is true of the tree capi mode 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.729
 hector that if you do not know him I do not know if what 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.110
 you know they will know that it is very usual good 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.920
 let's do this by day so that 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.469
 let's see better 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.359
 and this and that we're good with an ax 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.250
 obviously with any type of ax 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.870
 we are going to have a tree but instead of 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.940
 so big here and from here from here 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.559
 let's try to work they can see that 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.079
 I have a diamond ax and it takes a lot 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.059
 because because when I simply threw the 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.579
 block below you will see that all the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.690
 other that's what is going to be and 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.210
 many will say what advantages or disadvantages 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.799
 it has good what because they use 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.299
 much much the series since 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.920
 generally to be felling has 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.899
 to be one by one apart to be 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.369
 going up and that's how you can say a 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.200
 little bit more real I 'm going to show it in my 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.369
 case because if we have a tree from 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.470
 down then obviously everything is going to fall 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.850
 and apart from that it is much easier and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.009
 it's being the same or it does not have 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.530
 nothing cheated because it takes away the same or 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.060
 be at a glance skin you will think 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.360
 that you simply have one of these 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.569
 blocks an example let's look for a 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.369
 wooden ax but it is on the contrary 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.289
 when you want a block you spend what 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.030
 they normally spend all the blocks me 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.399
 I mean what is pulling a tree with ten 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.619
 blocks the h will be spent as if 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.780
 stretched ten blocks not as if only 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.399
 speed below you can also see that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.380
 the time it takes is the same as if 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.970
 will remove one by one so there's no 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.370
 simply lose that you avoid this 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.840
 doing the extra work in this case 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.400
 we are going to have to remove it and as 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.200
 can see is one made of common wood 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.940
 and current and you can see how it is that 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.470
 low the quality of the ax without 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.380
 Diamond change, obviously as 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.150
 the diamond is not removed in the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.620
 installation as always you're going to 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.149
 download the files that I leave here 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.830
 I do not leave them in the good folder 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.870
 I leave the page where is the mode that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.640
 there are simply downloads the files and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.230
 happens to your minecraft folder to the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.270
 folder fort we're so be 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.790
 comfort if you do not know how the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.380
 version of force for your minecraft you 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.090
 I leave here in the video description 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.310
 but of course if you've got here it 's 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.660
 because you know how to install mods like this 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.100
