set on a bed of sand there's no moisture
barrier<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.140> decided<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.769> best<00:00:31.920> approach

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
barrier so we decided the best approach

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
barrier so we decided the best approach
would<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.790> overlay<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> floor<00:00:33.870> before

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
would be to overlay the floor before

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.850 
would be to overlay the floor before
applying<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.130> polyuria<00:00:36.230> after<00:00:37.230> installing<00:00:37.739> a

applying the polyuria after installing a
few<00:00:38.040> tests<00:00:38.370> screws<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:39.000> realized<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
few tests screws we realized that the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.660 
few tests screws we realized that the
pavers<00:00:40.140> did<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.770> very<00:00:40.980> good<00:00:41.100> holding

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pavers did not have very good holding

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.290 
pavers did not have very good holding
power<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.540> tended<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> strip<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:44.120> at<00:00:45.120> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
power they tended to strip out at that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
power they tended to strip out at that
time<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.600> decided<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:46.260> needed<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.710> pressure

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
time we decided we needed to pressure

wash<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> floor<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.600> promote<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.170> adhesion

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
wash the floor to promote the adhesion

set mortar was trialed onto the floor

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.760 
set mortar was trialed onto the floor
and<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.579> attached<00:00:56.969> quarter<00:00:57.570> inch<00:00:57.719> Duroc<00:00:58.350> on

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and we attached quarter inch Duroc on

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.429 
and we attached quarter inch Duroc on
